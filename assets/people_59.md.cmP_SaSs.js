I normally don't like fantasy-based movies but this one just blew me away. I enjoyed every minute of the 3 1/2 hours. I was hooked from beginning to end. It's rare that a movie of that length would keep anyone interested for that long. BUT IT DID! It was awesome. Visually it was excellent but the characters and the storyline is what will keep you hooked. The Characters are awesome. The acting was amazing. It was dramatic, emotional, and action-packed. The basic plot is about a hobbit (played oh so well by Elijah Wood) that acquires a ring of dark power and he has to destroy it. A lot unfolds along the way. THE LORD OF THE RINGS: FELLOWSHIP OF THE RING is pure magic and the ending leaves you craving parts 2 and 3."},{"rating":"2","title":"the best movie","review":"I saw it in the theaters yesterday and it was the best movie I have ever seen in my life.

This is a very, very good movie and I can't wait until The Two Towers and Retun of the King come out."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect for the obsessive Lord of the Rings person","review":"This is a Lord of the Rings groupie's dream. Plus you get a free ticket to the second movie, so it's really a good deal. Beautifully packaged, and full of fascinating stuff.On the half hour of new scenes, I see why they were cut, but it was fun to watch them anyway."},{"rating":"2","title":"ok","review":"Yeah, all criticisms of the changes made to the book in this movie aside, it was pretty good. Most of the actors were well chosen (except maybe Elrond) and I would have liked to have seen Glorfindel, but all in all I was satisfied (my brother, who has read the books about a million times, hated it but watched it several times anyway) In particular i liked Liv Tyler as Arwen, and the CG and costumes are all very well done. Some of the scenes could have been done better (in particular the council of Elrond) but like I said I did enjoy this and its about as good as you could do with condensing the book into 3 hours. But Gimli didnt kick enough ... in Moria and Legolas didnt fire arrows nearly fast enough"},{"rating":"2","title":"the fellowship","review":"?I saw it in theaters. In theaters It was PG-13 now on vhs it's \\"R\\". Why? Yes the movie is violent in some ways but not enough to have an \\"R\\" rating. in the Mines it is very intense. Very scarry for little kids. the Real life Look of all the actors and the action is also scarry . But it is clear that Good is aginst Evil and that is a good thing. So is the movie changing ??? The rating system is not something I can count on. this was a good movie for a kid my age to see with my parents. If it was \\"R\\" I never would have got to see it. It is Intense. I have seen it 6 times now. it is one of my favorite movies. Now my Dad is concerned about what changes have been made. These are great books and great movies. Good Vs Bad. The Movie is like what it looks like in my imigination when my dad reads to me Just not as gory.... I would have never imagined the Green Ork blood.. GROSS."},{"rating":"2","title":"Magical","review":"Having read the trilogy, It's absolutely the best production, from a book to the big screen I have ever seen.

Those boring parts are made up with action thrilled fight scenes which I personally thought were the greatest things ever."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth every penny...almost","review":"The extended version of the film is fantastic for fans of the theatrical release. It fleshes out the characters and scenes and is every bit as enjoyable as the first. However, people should be warned against buying the gift set as opposed to the plain DVD. After being duped into buying the theatrical release with practically no bonus material a few months ago, I was determined not to make that mistake again. However, what I didn't realize that the only difference between the gift set and the regular DVD is the Argonath statuettes and the National Geographic DVD \\"Beyond the Movie\\", which may be a fabulous disc, but hardly worth more than twice the price. Buy the special edition, it is a must-own, but don't waste your money on the \\"gift set\\", it is only a gift to the studio, just like the first DVD release."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring (Four-Disc Special Extended Edition)","review":"The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring (Four-Disc Special Extended Edition) is Peter Jackson's vision of The Fellowship of the Ring. Why I start with this sentence is to make sure to make it clear that it differs a lot from the book. That being said as a fantasy movie it is quite remarkable. The special effects are amazing and so is the music. Elijah Wood is perfect in the role as Frodo, as is Mckellen in his role as Gandalf the Grey. Then we come to roles that could been reconsidered, i.e., that of Arwen. This is a very good fantasy film that will entertain both young and old alike. Recommended indeed. 4/5."},{"rating":"2","title":"A mind-boggling, stunning cinematic achievement","review":"Unless you're a Tom Bombadil-obsessed Tolkien purist/freak, it's impossible to NOT be enchanted, enthralled, and amazed by this movie that is inarguably a cinematic masterpiece on par with the likes of Godfather and Citizen Cane. I have never recommended a movie more highly."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful","review":"This movie is the most beautiful film in the world. I have seen it 3 times and cannot wait until it is available on DVD. Everything about it is awesome: the filming, the acting, the costumes, the special effects, the soundtrack, and everything else. If you haven't already seen this masterpiece, see at is soon as it comes out -- you will love it, guaranteed."},{"rating":"2","title":"LOR is the best fantasy ever made","review":"I'm probably prejudiced because I have always loved Tolkein's novels, and I'm even going to the college that he graduated from next year. Anyway, this was the best movie that I have seen in a very long time. Nothing compares to the action and adventure of this great epic. If only the producers hadn't left out some parts of the story..... Might I also suggest that you read the books, including The Hobbit, before you see the movie because it's a proven fact that books are always better than the movies based upon them, although the director of LOR did stick to most of the book and did not leave out enough to ruin the story."},{"rating":"2","title":"Finally, a Masterwork DVD","review":"This is what the power of the DVD medium is all about. Peter Jackson and co. have utilized this format better than any other filmakers in the short history of DVD. This is a set for true fans of moviemaking. By the time you finish the endless hours of extras, you will be not only a fan of the film, but a fan of the filmakers as well, who pored so much heart and soul into the production of this instant classic. Highest possible recommendation."},{"rating":"2","title":"Two Disks Movie","review":"The reason that the the movie was spilt onto two different disks was to enhance the Quality of the movie, 208 minutes can really take up space on a disk, It's the same idea with the \\"Superbit\\" dvd collection they totally remove everything but the feature to ensure the best picture/sound quality, I've never seen the DVD is question, however i do know that that is the plan, (Audio commentaries have nothing to do with it, i'm really excited to listen to them when i do purhase this DVD release)"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Wonderful Movie Experience","review":"I enjoyed this movie thoroughly. It is very well paced and extremely well casted. Peter Jackson did a wonderful job directing this movie and the actors did a wonderful job at bringing the characters to life.Although it is a long movie, it did not seem so at all. As I said above, it was very well paced. I was not prepared for the movie to end as I was ready to continue my adventure with the Fellowship.I found the movie to be extremely enjoyable and it was quite an adventure. I am so looking forward to The Two Towers in December."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lord of the Rings","review":"When I went to see Lord of the Rings I was expecting to see something much like Harry Potter- I was some what decieved! Lord of the Rings was a terrific movie! It had every genre imaginable- action, comidy, romance, fantisy, mystery, and more. It made me very interested in J. R. R. Tolkien's writing and when I got home, having not read the books at the time, I picked up the second book."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best movie I've seen in a long time!","review":"When I first went to see this movie I was doubtful. I had not read any of the books, and first thought that the film seemed far too long. After seeing the film though, I was absolutely overjoyed. Everything about it was great. I have now read all the books, and see what an amazing job the film did of recreating Middle-Earth and everything in it. Director Peter Jackson did a wonderful job, and all of the cast was very well chosen. All the actors seemed as if this was the part that they were meant to play. I reccommend this film to everyone, if you have read the books or not. I can't wait for the DVD to come out, and be able to watch this film again and again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lord of the Rings","review":"Lord of the Rings is a thrilling as well as exciting adventure that keeps you on your toes. Before there was Harry Potter, There was Frodo Baggins and his 8 companions going on an adventure of a lifetime. This exciting book has just been made into a most facinating movie and will keep your eyes peeled and you can't wait for more. When your done watching the movie for the first time, you ask yourself, \\"How soon untill I come back?\\" You will find that when J.R.R. Tolkien closes a door, he always opens a window in this fantacy. He makes you feel as if there was accually a time when there were such things as hobbits, elves, dwarves and trolls along with orcs and goblins... and well, Middle-Earth. Tolkien put a backround to this tale, which makes this classic's scenarios tencer, or sometimes even more relaxed. I rate this wonderful, thrilling, breath-taking adventure 5 stars, and when you read his books, you'll know why."},{"rating":"2","title":"Highly recommended","review":"I loved this movie so much! I've never read the books (I'm more into American literature than British), but contrary to some opinions, I was able to appreciate the film anyway. Good vs. evil. Mythical creatures. Swordfights. What's not to love?I also enjoyed the documentaries on the DVD. They can be a little repetitive if one watches them sequentially, but they are very informative and the shots of New Zealand are breathtaking."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lord of the Movies!","review":"Perfect, absolutely perfect. This is the best movie I've ever seen! Who cares if it's 3 hours long? I like it and that's all that matters.Let me start from the beginning. I thought that this movie would be a normal movie, boy was I wrong! I came out of the theater with a thirst to see it again. Now that thirst has gone to parched. I've been thinking about the movie ever since.The sound effects are EXCELLENT! The script is EXCELLENT! And the acting is EXCELLENT! Those who give it 4.5 stars are wrong. This is THE movie to see. Even my brother who didn't like Lord of the Rings enjoyed it.All together, this movie is great. I can't wait for it to come on DVD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lord of the Rings","review":"I felt this was a wonerful fantasy movie for adults. I have seen the movie 3x and would recommend it. The cast is perfect for each role,and gave excellent performances. For me the time flew by much too quickly. The location and scenery was breath taking and the effects were wonderful. Let us not forget the sound track which added so much to this film, (which I have also purchased and listen to regularly.)I hope that others can look at this film as the entertaining piece that it is and feel the enjoyment that I have found in watching it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A home version of the best fantasy movie ever","review":"If Star Wars has showed the world what the best Science Fiction movie is, The Lord of the Rings did the same in Fantasy.If you like Fantasy, you already know that it's a must-have, and you will definitly want to have it in your home collection. If you don't like Fantasy, you'd still buy it to your home collection as the best representative of the fantasy movies."},{"rating":"2","title":"Extended only - Can't watch the theatrical release","review":"I agree with all other reviewers about the quality of production for the extended edition of The Fellowship of the Ring.However, be aware that the extended and new scenes are integrated into the movie. There is no way to watch the original theatrical release. You may ask, \\"why would I want to do that? I want to see the extended scenes.\\" True, and this is why I waited to purchase this version. However, I assumed that DVD technology would allow me to view EITHER version - with or without the new scenes. This enables showing the movie to first-timers who would better tolerate a 3 hour movie over 3.5 hour one."},{"rating":"1","title":"this review actually refers to the VHS...","review":"ok. i bought Lord of the Rings on VHS because the movie was magnificent and i did not at the time have a DVD player. Big mistake. The film to tape transfer is terrible and the special effects that in the film were vivid and realistic now look cheap and poorly done. The Riders in the scene with the water horses look like paper cut outs and even the opening sign that says \\"Lord of the Rings\\" looks like dull plastic. If you enjoyed to film for the special effects, do not buy this VHS tape. Maybe if you never saw it in the theater or on DVD you wouldn't notice, but overall it is not worth it. It's like they made the VHS crappy on purpose so people would buy the DVD. Now I have a DVD player, and Lord of the Rings on DVD, and am very pleased. But the VHS is a dulled down version that shames the intricacies of the creative process behind the film."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply the most impressive DVD I have seen to date","review":"The dedication of Peter Jackson to make this franchise a timeless collection continues with the fantastic 4 disk set. I have only watched the extended version of the movie so far, and I'm already impressed. The inclusion of such vital scenes as the gift giving scene make this impressive movie even more so. I would highly recommend this set for anyone who is a true fan of the original work of J.R.R. Tolkien and the movie. And the included Movie Cash for a free ticket to Two Towers makes this set a great value as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"I'd sell my collection!","review":"I have about 40 DVDS but I would sell the great majority of them to have this movie on DVD.It is without a doubt a great film and I can't wait to see the extended version.My birthday is this month and for 3 months I've been telling my wife that this is the ONLY gift I want! The TWO TOWERS---This December!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best movie ever!!!","review":"I loved this movie before I got the extended DVD and I love it even more now. The new and extended scenes are awesome. Especially since there is more Legolas. We also get to see Legolas speak more elvish. The cast commentary is great. The actors who play the Hobbits are extremely funny. All the behind the scenes features are great. One of the best things on this DVD set is hidden on the first disc is the LotR skit MTV did on their Movie awards with Sarah Michelle Gellar and Jack Black. This is a great movie and a great extended DVD set."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lord of the Rings, Fellowship of the Ring Review","review":"This film is really great! It has many different worlds that you can watch and fell that you are there. For example Orcs, Wizards, Elfs, and much more!!! This is only the first film out of three. Lord of the Rings, The Fellowship of the Ring has a very talented main character that this film is greatfull to have Elijah Wood!!! Elijah Wood also will be in all three of the Lord of the Rings films. Elijah Wood also stared in The Adventures of Huck Finn, Flipper, Oliver Twist, and so many more!!! I think that even though this film has so wicked and scarry parts in it, it is still a very good film over all. People who have kids that get scarred easily should not see this film but many people love this film and if you like Harry Potter you will love this film!!!! I suggest you see it today!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great DVD for Collections!","review":"Very Excited! It is very long though. Prepare a day to watch it.Highly Recommended!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Extended IS better!","review":"I've seen the film twice in the theatre, have almost finished the book, but when I watched this version of the film it smoothed out the rough spots that I felt during my intial viewing. With the added scenes and the additions to the sound track, it was so much more fulfilling. Peter Jackson has surely demonstrated his love of the \\"Rings\\" story. What will be even nicer is when the entire three parts are released and there is a super jumbo, seamless film on DVD for all of the ardent followers. This version is recommended above the intial DVD release."},{"rating":"1","title":"A massacre of a classic!!","review":"I first viewed this movie excited to see Tolkien's timeless classic put into live action on screen. Not only were the characters completely off, they removed all the poems and songs that were intrinsic to the nature of the fable. Special effects are very entertaining, but you must realize that nothing quite compares to midget like people singing and dancing gayily to memorized poetry. A shame that this movie was ruined by the short sightedness of the director. And what about Tom Bombadil? Might as well rename this This Lord Really Stinks! THumbs way down to a movie that could have quite possibly become a modern masterpiece. FOR SHAME!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Discs split?","review":"The point of blu ray is to not split films in 2 discs, and, Special features in DVD?

Then I got to The Lord of the Rings:The Fellowship of the Ring, and it totally bored me. Tolkein makes no sense at all in that book! So why is the movie so popular??? It's nothing more than a PG-13 version of Harry Potter! This has to be THE most overrated movie I have ever, ever seen in my life. I'm so tired of people saying, \\"The Lord of the Rings is so awesome\\" and \\"I can't wait for the sequel!\\" and other things like that. Please, people, realize that this movie [is bad]."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shameless","review":"It saddens me that such a classic could be butchered so badly. That's not to say that the special effects weren't impressive, but three hours of scenery just doesn't cut it. Even then, the effects fall short because the hobbits change height several times, first coming up to people's waists, then their shoulders. Regarding the storyline, the movie portrays Gandalf as a parnoid old man, Aragorn as a shamed derelict, Boromir as an evil sissy, Sauron as a mythical monster...etc. They changed key scenes, but not the quotes they use from the book, which is contradicting. I guess what I'm getting at is, if you have read and truly enjoyed the books, don't waste your time or money on the movie for it will only make you mad."},{"rating":"1","title":"the worst movie i have ever seen in a theater","review":"absolutely awful, the comedy is directed towards 5 year olds, the plot line is bad to the point of being funny, and the battle scenes arent even that goodi almost left in the 1st 30 minutes,i found myself laughing at the parts that were supposed to make me sad and hoping that the characters would die so the movie would be over quicker"},{"rating":"1","title":"stupid, dumb, and waaay tooo long","review":"3 hours? are the producers on crack er something? who wants to sit through a three hour movie?? i had to go to a birthday party and see this awful movie. we sat there. for 3 hours. the thing i hate about this movie is that the screen will fade just like it ending, and then pop right back up again and have a whole nother hour. i just think it was really stupid. if they want to make it better, then cut it. I think the movie was dispicable. people are so dumb to actually get into this dumb movie. its fiction and unrealistic. none of what happened in the movie could ever happen in real life. so why do people like it? its stupid, dumb, and way too long! It makes me sick just thinking that someone could waste three whole hours of their life on this crap"},{"rating":"1","title":"ONE STAR FOR NEW LINE..!!","review":"I'm rating one star for NEW LINE marketing strategy, not for the content of this movie, that is marvellous.The fact is that I live in Latin America, and NEW LINE will not release this special edition around here, due to fear tha sales will not make worth the costs....

However, I don't like three hour boring movies. I never read the books, which I'd probably enjoy, but this movie was bad. I saw it a long time ago, during it's cinemtic release, not on DVD, so I have forgotten, thankfully, what the lord of the ring is about. I think if you where it you're invisible for three boring hours and than everybody sees you, gets angry that they looked for three hours when they had not a chance of finding you in the first place and than you escape your impending death by putting credits up so you get a a one year head start on a bunch of guys with swords and shields."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring and highly overrated","review":"I thought that The Lord of the Rings - The Fellowship of the Ring was incredibly boring and highly overrated. It seemed to drag on, and finally at the end, when the excitement comes, you learn that in order to find out what happens...you have to watch 6 more hours of the movie. The least Peter Jackson could've done would've been to give it a little more of an ending. Otherwise, it's like an open-ended waste of time. I recommend not wasting your time on this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bland!","review":"This movie really lacked spice.A lot of pompous talking, interrupted by action scenes looking as if they were lifted from a computer game.An extremely lame and simple action scenes it were. F.ex. the scene where the elven girl races towards the river with Frodo. How does she succeed ? She just whispers a few spells to the horse and it outruns the pursuers. This may work in a novel, but in a movie you need a lot more twist and turns. Compare this horse race with the speeder chase in Return Of The Jedi. See what I mean ?What a shame, that such a classic work should suffer this fate.(2 stars for scenery though)"},{"rating":"1","title":"3 hours and at the end of it all you're left with NOTHING!","review":"The \\"Lord of the Rings\\" book trilogy is one of the best I have ever read. It's too bad the first movie is one of the slowest, uneventful, and boring I've ever watched. There was so much potential for this movie to be one of the greatest of all time, but Peter Jackson had to ruin it all. The acting is atrocious. I've never seen so much wooden acting in my life! I don't know whether it's the actor's or the director's fault, but whoever is responsible should get out of the business for good. Not even the fx are good in this movie.This movie is good if you want a good night's sleep though."},{"rating":"1","title":"*cough*","review":"I had great expectations for this movie, but then I saw it and found out it was not that great of a movie. The only scene I liked in this movie was the begining fight. The rest of the movie went too slow and boring. Frodo (Elijah Woods) had a constipated look through the whole film and was just bothering me. The dark riders had an annoying screech and the fight sequence between Gandalf and the evil wizard was cheap and disappointing. I hope/wish the next two will be better than this very disappointing start to the world of the lord of the rings."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ponderous, just ponderous","review":"This is without a doubt the worst film epic ever made.

It left me cold with it's Hollywood special effects and lack of acting from actors who depend on special effects. But i guess for the dumbing down of america generation who lacks imagination this will look like a masterpiece. It is a piece alright. Maybe someday americans will go to the movies to see great acting. It's sad that so many people need special effects and computer generted stuff to say that it's a good movie. I feel sorry for you brain-dead generation. But i guess the old saying is true. If a million people jump off a bridge would you? I guess the answer is really \\"yes\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Truly Amazing.","review":"As I entered the theater, I was wondering what kind of film it would be. Would it be a Braveheart or Gladiator-style epic? A love story? A SFX show? Or a brutalization of the book?Thankfully, I was wrong.The movie IS the Lord of the Rings. The plot follows the book amazingly well, and the deviations are well thought out. The setting is seamlessly placed, and fits all that I had thought. You feel like you are visiting the Shire, Moria, etc. Everyone fits their role well. As another review mentioned, \\"they ARE their characters. The dialog is true to the spirit, and quite often the words, of the book. The three hours go by quickly due to the excellent pacing of the scenes. I have only one minor complaint, which will probably be rectified by the DVD's deleted scenes section.I don't care what your taste in movies is, see this one. Soon. You will not be disappointted."},{"rating":"2","title":"Take a bow Mr. Jackson and thank you New Line!","review":"If you only see one movie this year, make it The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring! This film is absolutely incredible. I have to admit I was a little dissapointed at finding out that the part of Crickhollow and meeting Farmer Maggot was cut from the film, but then again, I, like all you other obsessed fans, have to realise that there had to be alterations to this film in order to please all audiences (and also not to make it over 6 hours long, haha). So, keeping that in mind, this movie is as close to justifying the novel as humanly possible. This movie sucks you into the story more than any movie I've ever watched. When I watched it for the first time, people in the audience (I included) were sobbing aloud at times and at one point we actually applauded and cheered!

All the basic elements are there; Characters, quest, Evil force trying to take over the relm...ect. Yeah, I know that LORD OF THE RINGS is much bigger than that, But if you check the history on J.R.R. Tolkien's work and anything you know on D&D You'll see that LOTR came before every RGP created since D&D. So now we all know where EVERY RGP (Inculding Japanese RGPs like the FINAL FANTASY series) got there insperation from!

My complaint is with the DVD. The 2nd disc - which promises features - is just an advertisement for the Special Edition DVD, to be released in November.

This is by far the worst example of bad sound vs. video I've ever seen."},{"rating":"1","title":"This won academy awards?","review":"I watched the movie, with avid Tolken fans as my guide. I was just as disappointed as they were.The hype of the movie really failed to bring it to light. It spends a lot of time mired in long scenes where nothing expansive of plot driving really takes place.While the actors were well picked, the much talked about special effects left a lot to be desired. Some of the digital backgrounds felt detached, and if there was human style movement, the figures were robotic.A lot of the plot and dialogue is easy to determine just due to the events that need to take place before they could be allowed to die. The dialogue sometimes just goes on and on when a few sentences are needed.A few of us even laughed with the whole opening flashback involving Sauron.Overall. Not really worth the three hours spent. We hope the Two Towers will be more compelling."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best Movie I've ever seen!","review":"This version of Peter Jackson's great film should have been the one that appeared in theaters. Having the film more than 3 hours long would have probably earned this movie the Oscar for Best Picture. Otherwise, this film is still great, even on the home screen. It incorporates about 30 minutes more into the film, making Tolkien's world of Middle-earth come alive even more brilliantly. The audio commentaries are great, especially the one including Peter Jackson because he reveals cool details about the 3rd film. The special features on the 2nd and 3rd discs are also amazing! I've had this DVD for 3 months and I still haven't finished all of the bonus features. This version of the film is great because although it still ends with a cliff-hanger, you've seen so much that you don't even think about film 2 or 3 and you sit there just totally baffled at what you have just seen (Like I did). In conclusion this film is the best DVD of 2002 and the best movie I've ever seen!"},{"rating":"1","title":"great movie","review":"Too bad the streaming was AWFUL! We were very disappointed.

I kind of understood why they were separate when it came to the DVD versions, as neither the data capacity or features of Blu-ray were available at the time, making seamless branching impossible. That's NOT the case here. They could simply release both versions and have the extended bits added seamlessly depending on which version you pick (or if that's not feasible, just release it on a second disk). Instead, you'll end up paying for both yet again. Don't fall prey to it (your DVD version will suffice until a proper BD is released), unless of course you're the kind of person who thinks George Lucas is a generous guy for allowing you to buy 8 different versions of the same trilogy..."},{"rating":"2","title":"excellent","review":"The fellowship of the ring is a fantastic cinematic event that outdoes that other fantasy filled movie running alongside it by far. Jacksons direction is perfect, the make-up and CG effects are stunning and above all, fantastic characters are lifted by some fabulous performances. I think that mainly Elijah wood and Ian Mckellen stand out a lot, but the breakthrough role will undoubtedly be Orlando Bloom as the Elvin archer Legolas.I give this film a five because it is undoubtedly one of the most epic and sweeping movies ever made, matched only by Braveheart for stunning battle sequences and all that we have come to expect from these sorts of movies.Well done Peter Jackson, i can feel George Lucas trembling from here."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Lord of the Rings","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed Peter Jackson's \\"The Lord of the Rings\\". My aunt found it creepy, though. She nearly cut the circulation off in my arm. So, this movie is not for people prone to nightmares or who can't stand creepy things.I have been a fan of Tolkien a short time, so this movie was a wonderful supplement to what I already knew. This movie is unlike many of Hollywood's movies these days: it was not permeated with language or sexual exploitation.In short, I really, REALLY loved this movie and I will most definitely own it on DVD when it is released."},{"rating":"2","title":"What a Great Day to Live In, Fantasy and Technology !","review":"If you are a visual person this time in Middle Earth is the best. The Lord of the Rings met all my expectations and more. It is an amazingly beautifully executed masterpiece. The cinematography was composed of dreamy pastorial scenes shot from many angles and perspectives always enticing the viewer. The movie formated its many sized heros and villians in one space convincingly. Tolkein's story was transformed into the beautiful movie without diluting the story's content or details. Afterall who can add to or take from Tolkein?The actors were perfect representations of the book's characters. The uniqueness of the settings and characters was worth enjoying even without knowing the story. What a delight, worth every penny and then some. This is destined to be the movie both young and old will want to see again and again; especially if you left a bit of your heart in Middle Earth."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible!!!!!!","review":"I havent read the books, and this movie was totally confusing. I guess its only good for people who have read the books... IN my opinion, it stunk!! You could not get into the movie, like you could in Harry Potter.

It is NOT worth the money! It is not worth the money to watch any movie with the Aspect Ratio(s) of Widescreen anamorphic - 2.35:1. Especially, this movie. To release it in this format only for this price is a a crime.If Stuart Little 2 can at offer both versions on one CD for only $13.95 why can't LoTR extended version do the same for $29.00. Sure you get the full view of the movie horizontally as intended by the film maker. But if you like the vertical picture to fill only HALF the size of your TV screen when watching go ahead and buy it. I tried watching it on my 50inch big screen and it made every charactor look like a hobbit from 4 feet away! Hey, thats an idea. Let just put on the box 'ok' for children under 4. They like to sit 2 feet from the screen when watching TV. And they would just love everything looking like little hobbits. - My take, im outta here. \`jd"},{"rating":"1","title":"Buy the \\"Extended Version\\"","review":"I bought this DVD when it first came out in 2002 and then towards the holiday season of 2002 an \\"Extended Version\\" was released with around 30 minutes more added to the movie. Sure, the \\"Extended Version\\" costs more, but if you want to see more of the story then there's only one choice here, unfortunately. It would have been nice of the packaging commitee to include both the original theatrical version and the \\"Extended Version\\" in a single set (like E.T.) but then they would have lost making 2 sales to every fan. But now that the \\"Extended Version\\" and the \\"Shortened Version\\" are out, well, who wants the \\"Shortened Version\\"? Buyer beware: there are 2 versions of this film available, this one is the short straw."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not very original.","review":"Since there is so much interest in Tolkien and his Rings books, I thought this would have some important content. Wrong. The story seems to be largely derivative, taking themes and ideas from a variety of classic literature: Homer's Odessy, the Arthurian legends, the Biblical book of Ezekiel, etc. There wasn't even a clear reason for ending the first movie of the series where it did. Perhaps if the movie does not closely follow Tolkien the books might be better.As a movie, the action scenes are repetitive and dull, despite the excessively graphic carnage. The female characters are few and shallowly characterized, and the significance of the different groups of beings and their characteristics unclear, despite some explicit statements.Was it worth the price of admission? Yes, but it wasn't the exciting cinema I was expecting."},{"rating":"1","title":"Extended edition In Spanish Not available in DVD","review":"This is a shame, again!!! I only buy DVDs and they dont have the decency to release this wonderful extended version for the three main languages in the USA and Canada : English, Spanish and French.

It's an open discrimination to 25% of non-english speakers in both countries!"},{"rating":"1","title":"What is the big deal?","review":"I think that the \\"Lord of the Rings\\" was highly overratted. It was a good story line but they took the plot and stretched it out for far too long. The movie wouldn't have been bad if the film wasn't three hours long and if all the special effects didn't look computer animated. You could very much tell that Frodo (Elijah Wood) wasn't small. You could tell that they weren't in the snowcapped mountains.I have not read the books, and mabe after I do my mind will change. But for right now I would just like to say that if the next 2 movies are anything like this one I am not going to waste another $14, nor am I going to waste another 6 hours of my life.

This is truly a reference DVD if I ever saw one!As far as the movie is concerned, I'll simply say that the movie is gorgeous in its cinematography. The care that was taken to create Tolkien's \\"Middle Earth\\" universe are to my eyes extremely successful. The mostly excellent performances are occassionally marred by a stupid line, or un-necessary comic relief from one of the Hobbits. But don't let that distract you. If you're looking for THE movie to show off your new home theater system, use \\"The Fellowship of the Ring\\" and tell your neighbors to take cover!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wizard of Oz....Star Wars......Lord of the Rings!!!!","review":"One of the first fantasy films that changed was The Wizard of Oz. A few decades later came Star Wars. And now for the new generation it will be Lord of The Rings. There is not a dull moment in this movie. Its totally action packed. And just as in Star Wars and The Wizard of Oz, this film managed to become a huge success without using foul language! The PG rating is for some of the fighting scenes but you see more violence than that just fliping on the television. Im not one of these people who try to over analysis movies and find something wrong with them, Im just a regular guy who watches a movie to just to be entertained and relax. If you're anything like me, I give you my word, you are sure to love this movie! If your the other type person who is going to compare this film to the book and try to pick out every difference, you need to get a life!"},{"rating":"2","title":"i don't get it","review":"I see a few people saying this is a bad movie. Well if you didn't read the book or didn't understand the book, i could see that. I think Jackson is a genius. This movie is exactly how i pictured it while i read it. He leaves out some uneeded characters such as Bombadil, who in my opinion was a tad annoying. The Special effects were great, not like you can have relasitic lookin magic done by someone throwing glitter into the air. ACting was very good, not Al pacino in godfather good... but great nonetheless. It is now my favorite movie, passin Return of the Jedi, Last of the Mohicans, Ocean's 11 (the rat pack version), Laurance of Arabia etc. I am a huge fan of books to movies when the director follows the books and doens't change much. My father who is a avid Tolkien fan... said he thought the movie was unbielievably good. And what people need to remember is its a story a true trilogy , nothing like Star Wars that has ending each one. This is made like a book is."},{"rating":"1","title":"2001?","review":"99% of these reviews are not for this product, some are from 2001!

If you like this movie, the additional 28 minutes of inserted footage makes the movie just that much more unbelievably good. Every single minute inserted, with perhaps the exception of Midgewater Marsh, improved this movie.And all the documentaries are just icing on the cake. Very thorough, it just impresses you how much went into producing this movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Lord of the Rings-Fellowship a Triumph!","review":"I have never read the books in the trilogy.

We can't wait for the release of 'The Two Towers.'"},{"rating":"1","title":"I just didn't like it...","review":"Granted, I'm not a big Sci-fi/Fantasy fan and have never read any of the J.R.R. Tolkein novels, but I felt LOTR: FOTR was one big bore. The film moved slowly, perhaps setting it up for part II, but it was excruciating. I took a twenty minute bathroom break before allowing myself back into the theater, then I kept drifiting off to sleep. I realize I'm in the minority, but it I just did not like this film, AT ALL!!! One star for the cast and another for the visuals."},{"rating":"2","title":"The complete package","review":"Just wanted to add my praise to the mix, as this is the definitve version of an already rich movie. The new and extended scenes add more depth to the characters and plot, and to the overall feel of Tolkien and Jackson's world. The DVD package also nicely labels which scenes have been added, which is very convenient. The extras on the last 2 DVD's will take you a whole weekend to watch, but it can be enjoyable to learn more about filmmaking in general. You really get to see how much talent and effort was tapped in making this movie. My favortite extras were the artist's galleries with commenteries by Alan Lee, and \\"The Road Goes Ever On...\\" where you see video Elijah Wood filmed at the movie's premiere. One of the best DVD's ever - and don't forget the 2 easter eggs! (A long trailer for LOTR:TTT, and a cute MTV Movie Award spoof of the Council of Elrond with Jack Black and Sarah Michelle Gellar!)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best DVD I OWN","review":"I have may dvds including the origanal version of lord of the rings, and i was wondering what they could possible put in the movie that would make someone buy it, but i soon found out. Love the new moments in the origanal story and the brand new sceans also. The two extra discs are also cool and give much info to the new fans on LOTR. A must buy for all who dont and who have the origanal."},{"rating":"2","title":"Far better than I expected","review":"I just saw this movie in the theater and was happily surprised at how good it was. Considering how many ways a live action version of this story could go wrong, director Peter Jackson and his cast do an excellent job. It covers the first book of the trilogy quite well and the visuals/special effects are often stunning. Even at three hours, there are plenty of details and subplots that fall by the wayside (Cate Blanchett has very little to do and Tom Bombadil is missing in action). All in all the film is beautiful to watch and you get a very good idea of the main thrust of the Tolkien novel. I especially enjoyed Sir Ian McKellan as Gandalf and Elijah Wood as Frodo. They do a great job in a very tricky roles, and they add an emotional core to this film that is missing in far too many fantasy films. For once Hollywood did not screw it up."},{"rating":"2","title":"Before you buy, please read to make sure","review":"The Blu Ray release is nearly flawless. Beautiful picture and sound. Movie is split onto two Blu Ray Discs. Noticed no \\"green hue\\" that was an issue with the box set release. Be advised that the 3 special feature discs are on regular DVD, Not Blu Ray. Still hours of great features, just DVD quality. Now for those of you that have linked you Ultraviolet accounts to Vudu so you can watch through you PS3 system (you will understand this next part). The Ultraviolet digital copies of all 3 of the extended editions are in SD, not HDX. It really bothers me when I get a new blu ray with ultraviolet and after code redemption it shows up as SD and not the 1080p HDX version. Just food for thought before you buy. Still at $25 per movie still not a bad deal. Choice is yours but I picked up all 3."},{"rating":"1","title":"The not so special edition","review":"We all love lord of the rings. Yet New Lines idea of giving us a regular edition and a special edition about two months later is just a way to rake in cash. So hold on tight, wait until November and get the special edition. You know you will want it with it's 30minutes of extra footage, and more."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Lord of the Rings","review":"When I first saw this movie I was at school and I was totally memorized in this wonderful story of a mysical world called middle earth. 3 hours or so of a great plot, extended scences and added scences. It's a timeless tale of adventure. You'll be swept away into a world of complete mystery. You'll be wishing there was more and this story wont be forgotten easily. Your movie collection wont be complete without the Lord of the Rings.With a great cast thats so convincing, in my opinion, there is no way you can resist watching this movie over and over again, till your like me, knowing exactly what everyone is going to say before they say it. So don't wait and get this movie and become a Lord of the Rings Fanatic."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well worth the price","review":"With all the extra scenes as well as the extended ones, this DVD set is well worth the price! I was quite pleased with it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"An awesome movie, but...","review":"Critics everywhere have heralded Jackson's Lord of the Rings: the Fellowship of the Ring as a visual masterpiece. And truly, it is. The sets are wonderfully done, every detail is there. The movie stays very true to the book, except for a few understandable omissions (the Old Forest and Tom Bombadil) and Arwen's role is considerably more important. The actors fit perfectly in their characters. I cannot help but quote Orlando Bloom who said he always believed elves \\"moved like alert cats\\". So why is there a but? Let me just say that, aside from the movie, the extra material in this DVD fall short of my expectations. I wonder why the New Line company had to make three different DVD versions of this film, when two could have sufficed. All in all, I believe that the edited scenes are cruelly absent in this version, and that I regret not waiting for the special edition DVD. If you're still hesitating on which DVD to buy, be more patient than I was and wait til November."},{"rating":"2","title":"one disc to rule them all","review":"oh-my-gosh. There's not much to say...but I'll try. This is what DVD is all about, giving the public what it wants until it's satisfied and this 4 disc monster will fill anybody's stomach. I have no complaints, none, nada, zip. Flawless victory and then some. What I most enjoyed was the cast interviews and commentary especially from Christopher Lee who is a great Tolkien fan. To hear him speak about the project was so cool. I was also blown away by the Weta Workshop features and the sheer enormity of their tasks. From creating chain mail to designing the Balrog it was amazing to see how they made the things come to life. And of course the enhanced film is just astounding and brillant.

Aragorn and Leogolas and Gimli were perfect, but the hobbits took some getting used too.I am so excited that they did all three books/movies at once.

I wasn't a great Tolkien fan, but I've seen the movie 3 times and will see it probably 2 more times in theaters.

Peter Jackson brings the epic literary trilogy to breathtaking life with beautiful cinematograpy, the perfect cast, an intelligent script, and amazingly lifelike special effects all set against the lovely New Zeland countryside. The acting is so adept that you feel that you're watching Frodo (for example) instead of Elijah Wood as he tries to save all of Middle Earth from the domination of Sauron.

When I realized I needed one I snapped this puppy up at a short-lived $45. Who needs an indoor grill that splatters? I may as well use the grill plate that covers 2 burners (now relegated to an outdoor 2-burner gas stove and a 2-burner electric plate used on the patio). Cooking for one most of the time the smaller grilling space wasn't an issue. But keeping the food covered with a see-thru top is, tho this one isn't a tight fit and must be carefully placed. But buying a heat-keeping aluminum baking pan to cover the Sanyo would've been cost-prohibitive. Plus the flat edge is handy for non-meat foods. No smoke, little odor, easy enough to clean- so what's not to like? Yeah, well it takes up space & I can't park stuff on it when not in use like the Sanyo, but so what? The Sanyo I'll give away."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Grill.","review":"I love this grill. I use it all the time. It cooks fast and the food taste wonderful. It's easy to clean and doesn't smoke so you can cook indoors without any problems. Its so easy to use. The only suggestion for improvement would be the glass lid. It doesn't exactly lay ontop of the grill snug. You still can grill and steam vegetables with using the lid but the grill doesn't really have groves for the lid to sit in.. So you have to shift it around a little to make sure you lay it properly.... That's the only thing I would improve on this grill.......Overall, I am very very satisfied with it and feel that I got a very good deal."},{"rating":"2","title":"amazing","review":"This CD is simply amazing. I'm amazed at how well Chris can perform live! The CD is mixed really well. They keep the audience noise from drowning chris out, but bring up the audience in all the right places. In the song, the Places You Have Come To Fear the Most, the way they bring the crowd in is very emotional and effective. The only complaints I have are that the drummer's singing seemed out of tune at times, but the CD made it barely noticable. You'll only notice it on the DVD. Also, I don't know why, but this one girl in the audience was soooo anoying to me! She's the girl in the green sleeveless shirt right behind chris. I don't know, she just seems like such an airhead, and maybe I hate her so much because she represents the new Dashboard Confessional fans, the teeny bopper rich airhead girls. Yeah, just thought I'd mention it, was anyone else bugged by her?"},{"rating":"1","title":"How annoying can it be?","review":"When I purchased this disc I thought it would be in my collection until the day I died. I had no idea that after listening to only two songs, I would be selling it back to the store for only a fraction of what I paid. If you are thinking of buying it and have read the complaints in regards to teen backup singers, beware. It really is as bad as I am saying it is."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tune it in, Turn it up, Tune out my children","review":"Chris's music is amazing, breathtaking, and heartbreaking all at the same time.I would recommend this cd to anyone, as well as any of his other cd's and ep's So there is a sing-a-long nature to this album. Buy it, love it, play it over and over, and then buy it again when you wear that copy out."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good songs, poor recording","review":"I love Dashboard as much as the next person, but the unplugged album is the exception. Sure it has a great song list and it's great that it comes with a DVD. But Chris doesn't sing for nearly half of the show, he simply lets the audience sing for him. If I wanted to hear a bunch of kids singing Dashboard songs, I would get a group of my friends together for a sing along. This album is very heartfelt. You can almost feel his pain as he sings. But I would not waste the money unless you don't mind the tracks being clouded up with a bunch of kids in the background, sometimes singing half the song."},{"rating":"1","title":"readings from a junior high diary","review":"Dashboard Confessional is easily one of the most vomit enducing \\"artists\\" out now. This is music for 12 year olds who have never heard of Elliott Smith with relationship problems. Buy this if you want to hear the audience sing all of the parts he can't sing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy this unless you enjoy audience background vocals","review":"This album might be good if it weren't for the ten teenagers singing in the background very loudly almost the entire time. I don't know a whole lot about Dashboard Confessional, but I liked a couple of their songs and wanted to check them out. The store was sold out of their studio album, so I bought this instead. Sometimes an unplugged album is a gem, but definitley not this one. I would only recommend this to a die hard fan who is willing to suffer the pain of the background vocals in order to hear the short patches of the actual band without teenage vocal support."},{"rating":"2","title":"What's that about screaming??","review":"To all of you who are saying how Chris' screaming is awful...If you listen to tracks on his CDs, he actually screams in those too. They could easily do some of their special studio effects things and make him sound 'perfect', but the reason he is screaming is because he is so unbelievably upset. If you've been to any of their live shows, you'll know he dedicates them! Like, \\"This one's about a girl.... I don't like her anymore\\". They actually MEAN something to him! SO listen to the original recordings, you supposed dashboard fans, and then say if he screams just because he can't reach his notes.And to expand on the whole studio thing... you've heard what they do with voices of bands like S Club7 (actually, I don't know. Do you know S Club in the US??)! They could make Chris sound however they wanted. This is his trademark!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"DVD and CD in one, Excellent!","review":"Ok, I like Dashboard a lot. I first saw them opening for Weezer and I was immediately impressed. I bought this CD the first day it came out and was pleasantly surprised with the DVD. The DVD is the best part of this package. I missed the Unplugged performance and I thought that on DVD it was crazy awesome. The CD is cool too cause you don't feel stupid singing along becuase everyone on the CD is singing to. Go out and buy this CD, and enjoy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"DASHBOARD IS AWSOME!!!","review":"Well, the cd is amazing and it has the added touch that only true fans can understand,the sing-a-long. A great performance with Chris's little changes in his songs here and there that make it different then the regular albums, but keeps that same Dashboard vibe. The DVD is dope too. Just the entire MTV Unplugged show with no interuptions. If you're a fan or not, this is definately and inspirational album to get."},{"rating":"2","title":"hands down","review":"i cant even find the right words to describe Dashboard Confessional. moving, touching, painful, hopeful, etc. to me, Dashboard is an emotional rollercoaster. this CD/DVD combo gives new fans, as well as old ones a taste of the music and the live music. definately the best band in my opinion, for those of us with broken hearts."},{"rating":"1","title":"Background singing is horrible","review":"I cannot believe they ruined this CD/DVD by not taking out the audience singing along. The music is great, but the audience singing along is really annoying. It makes it impossible to listen to this album. Very annoying. I thought maybe the bonus DVD was actually a Bonus until I watched it. Instead I was now able to match the faces to the horrible voices that ruined the CD. Not exactly a bonus. I would recommend staying away from this album, unless you enjoy listening to people singing off-key and ruining what should have been a great cd."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brings what a Dashboard concert should be to a CD","review":"First off, in many ways this is my favorite Dashboard CD. But, it should not be the first Dashboard disk you buy. The progression on this disk from solo to backing band is pretty great and kind of mirrors the actual progression of Dashboard. Also, hearing the crowd sing with/instead of Chris is pretty great to me - but is some people's greatest complaint. So be warned. It's like being at a good Dashboard concert where the crowd really becomes one with the band in a lot of ways (which is different than a lame Dashboard show where the crowd just isn't into it). I think it really amplifies the emotions of some of the songs to hear an entire crowd yelling \\"so we can get some.\\" It also packs a lot of great songs onto one disk. I highly recommend it for any Dashboard fan."},{"rating":"2","title":"Insanely good as expected","review":"First off- Dashboard Confessional is one of my favorite bands along with some harder rock bands. This CD/DVD is probobly my second favorite concert DVD. The reason why it is in second? Because i certainly did not enjoy the people background singing. That is the reason i gave it 4 stars instead of 5, the Singing is loud at times and in my opinion partially wrecks the song. Not totally wrecked or anything, but it would be a lot better with the lead singer/guitarist only singing and not the audience.overall very good"},{"rating":"1","title":"Psuedo Emo Teen Singalong","review":"If I wanted to hear a bunch of heartbroken teens singing Dashboard Confessional I would go to an \\"emo\\" Karaoke night.I could not even get through the whole CD, and this purchase will be sold at my local second hand store without even removing the DVD extra.I like Dashboard Confessional, and I think this Unpugged would be great, if I could actually hear Chris Carrabba sing. I don't want to hear the extras from TRL whine along like they are in high school glee club.If you want TRL meets \\"EMO\\" buy this unplugged. If not purchase another Dashboard Confessional CD."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste","review":"Why did I pay money to hear kids yelling to the accoustic playing of Dashboard Confessional? If you're an old fan, you'll like it. But me being a new fan . . . this is a waste of money. I paid to hear Dashboard sing accoustic versions of their songs. Not kids. I felt like I was sitting at a campfire at Vacation Bible School. Stupid!"},{"rating":"1","title":"haha it's a cult!!","review":"Yeah so we already know the music is quite terrible, but how about the actual live performance. People just stare at this guy like he is god and none of them are over 15 and it's really quite funny and frightening at the same time. He has his own teenage army. I mean I don't think any of them blinked throughout the show. Basically it was a bunch of zombies watching and singing along to every word. I guess it deserves 2 stars simply for the fact that it has the live show which is really entertaining to watch as long as you turn the sound down real low. Give it enough sound so you can still hear the kids chanting along in the background. It makes it all worth it."},{"rating":"1","title":"13 Year-Old Campfire Sing-along","review":"If you enjoy the prepubescent sounds of a junior high school girl sing-along, like at a YWCA summer camp or Brownie convention, this is the album for you. These preteens sing all the words to their favorite Dashboard Confessional songs, complete with the raw passion and frustration that pimples, algebra exams, and unrequited love for Justin Timberlake bring. Somewhere in attendance is Chris Carrabba, singer for Dashboard; you can hear him at times in the background when the girls choke back a tear or take a sip from their juicepacks."},{"rating":"1","title":"I don't understand...","review":"I wanted to hear Dashboard and instead I get a bunch of idiots singing instead? It doesn't seem much, but I wasted [...] on this cd. I should have bought new strings for my guitar. At least then I wouldn't have to listen to these idiots screaming the songs. I hate this and the DVD is even worse because then you have to see all these rich idiot kids playing extra sad for the cameras??? WTF Dashboard? MTV Sucks!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Live compilation of Dashboard Material","review":"Dashboard Confessional has an awesome type of emo music. Chris Carabba drones on about women that have hurt him in the past, or maybe he just made the songs up.This live unplugged cd is great. Some of the live songs are better than when in the studio, some are vice versa. The only real detrament is that often the audience sings and Chris doesn't. That ruins the best part of \\"Screaming Infedilities\\" and opening song \\"The Swiss Army Romance\\"Alot of the songs feature just Chris and the other guitarist, but I think the better ones are played along with the drummer and bassist.The DVD is great, featuring the whole concert and great sound. It has a couple special features, that add more to it.Overall, this is a great buy. I love Dashboard's music, and can't wait for more material from them."},{"rating":"1","title":"LET THE MAN SING","review":"LET THE MAN SING!

Chris and Dashboard are probably one the best choice bands for an Unplugged acoustic show, although when I first heard the CD, I felt like I was in some kids sing-a-long. Chris's performance was incredible with him playing by himself, and with the full band, not too impressed about the audience participation. I bought the CD wanting to hear Dashboard, what I got was 50 kids kereoking to his songs."},{"rating":"1","title":"MTV did a job here","review":"I mean how lame can MTV make Dashboard look? Well they did a good job here. Which was better, the meat-head football player in the background actually sobbing during \\"The Best Deceptions\\" or his best friend belting out \\"YOUR HAIR IS EVERYWHERE\\" with his right fist in the air? The only redeeming quality...Mike Marsh on drums is a genius."},{"rating":"1","title":"DON'T BUY IF YOU DON'T LIKE PEOPLE SINGING ALONG!!!","review":"I am a big DC fan, but when I listened to this cd I could only listen to about a couple of songs. The cd is good but the whole time people are singing as loud as they can and it is very irritating. I will say that it is a good price for a cd and dvd, and the dvd is pretty good. I saw DC live not to long ago and it was amazing. People did sing at the show I was at, but this cd seems like the audiences singing covers Chris'. I meet Chris and the band, and Rhett Miller at the hotel they were staying at and they were the coolest guys.

The crowd singing along is so emotional... it makes me yearn to be a part of them. If you wanted a solid recording without background vocals get a studio recording. This cd is BRILLIANT. Chris sings with such absolute passion, and the crowd gets into it and I get chills. I especially love The Best Deceptions. Anyway, that's my opinion. I recommend this CD to anyone who enjoys Dashboard Confessional for the raw emotion and musical passion, because this cd is chock full of it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Audience Unplugged","review":"I love Dashboard Confessional, but I hated this album.

The script tries to be Hitchcockian in its many twists, but Hitch knew how to make those twists convincing, whereas the writers of RAW HEAT merely hoped for any similarities. Williams as a shrink does a real no-no in revealing something a client told her in confidence; she also vacillates back and forth in trying to assess Brosnan's duplicity, and the end is so uh-oh, what have I done, it makes no sense. And who really killed Brosnan's wife?Brosnan is an automaton, capitalizing on his suave looks, and Madsen shows some of the talent that would eventually lead to her Oscar nominated performance in SIDEWAYS. But RAW HEAT is DEAD COLD in my book."},{"rating":"1","title":"victim of plagiarism","review":"This wanna-be Hitchcockian thriller shamelessly rips off scenes from Vertigo, Psycho, and North by Northwest, with the music of Richard Stone imitation Bernard Herrmann via Pino Donaggio. Psychologist Jobeth Williams is dating Pierce Brosnan, the same man who it turns out is also dating her patient, Virginia Madsen. Or is he? The time it takes Jobeth to realise such a faux pas makes her seem rather dim, though she appears to be preoccupied in showing how she thinks she can do sexy. It is unfortunate that her (many!) love scenes with Pierce play so awkwardly, though having Pierce recite Edgar Allan Poe badly doesn't help. Madsen probably comes off best. She manages to invest emotion and truth in what is a cliche role of the woman scorned. Jobeth has some tiny moments, particularly with her friend played by the baritone-voiced Georgia Brown. Director Jerry London gives us a juggling clown to represent Jobeth's confusion, and rain to accompany Billie Holiday singing Stormy Weather."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not Exactly What I was Looking For, But Good","review":"We are homeschooling the old-fashioned, classic way. I was looking for a penmanship book for my son and saw this. This is OK, but is very brief (on practice- 24 pages). I think being able to see the inner pages would have been a little more helpful; it's not exactly what I imagined. But, it is still useful and my son will be starting it soon and from what I can see, it should what it is supposed to do. So I think it was still a good buy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Writing System","review":"This is a great writing system.

In *Disputed Questions* Hick expounds on the same ideas in much greater detail: problems surrounding the traditional interpretations of the trinity, the atonement, and Christian exclusivism. The scope of this book is much broader, however, in that it also explores the nature of religious experience in general, suggests the applicability of Buddhist doctrines to the problem of pluralism, and theorizes about various life-after-death scenarios. I am not a person with a theological background--just a spiritual seeker--but I find Hick's writing to be highly accessible and his arguments to be exceedingly reasonable. This book was helpful to me in resolving some important issues in my personal Christian faith, and I would recommend it to anyone who finds traditional Christian doctrine untenable yet desires to remain within the Christian tradition."},{"rating":"2","title":"I just got one!!!","review":"First off i want to start off by saying that i have owned a creative vision m mp3 player as well as numerous other ones, but none have compared to the zune that i just picked up.

Also downloading and transfering music and videos with the software are easier than any other program out there. Also you can subscribe to download as much music as you want without having to pay a dollar a song like itunes, thats a big plus for me.

Its harder to find accessories for the Zune products , but the Belkin clear acrylic case is really protective, the Altec Lansing IM 414 is a nice radio unit, but if you can find a M604 Altec Lansing speaker system, buy it.

In fact I'm a network administrator so I know a thing or two about computers.I bought the Zune because a good friend seemed so happy with is Zune. That has since changed; He bought the Zune because he liked the wifi feature. After several failed attempts to share a song he became frustrated with the Zune.

After weeks of not being able to log in, it was recommended that I do a clean reinstallation of windows. That worked, but at what cost of time? Then I noticed that if the zune was plugged in while restarting, the computer would not restart. Supports response? \\"Well, then don't plug it in while restarting,\\" indifferent to the 6 hours of troubleshooting that had gotten me to that point. Anyway, except for the radio feature, there is nothing here to recommend this product over the iPod (don't be fooled by the communication feature - you'll never find anyone with whom to share). The iPod, albeit not perfect, is more stable, better tested, and offers more competant support."},{"rating":"1","title":"Most disapointing devise purchased","review":"I wanted to get FM tuner, large screen for videos and MP3.

The kids received the iPod the same time I received the Zune, they were were up and in service within 1 hour the Zune took several days and one delay after another. Battery life is a significant weakness, a full charge will not run 1.5 hours over 3 days for use during my workouts. The web site is a challenge to navigate and manage the media. The picture was clear and controls reasonalble to navigate. TiVo to go software would not interface with the system so none of my recorded movie could be used.

So why all the advertisement about the bigger screen? Is it becuase they couldn't build something sleek and sexy?The click wheel isn't a wheel at all - it is four buttons: up, down, left, right. You want to scroll down? Push and hold the down butten. Looks like an iPod thumb twirler but actually just buttons.Parents. Don't surpise your kids with one of these, they will only be embarrassed.Disclaimer: I own a new iPod Shuffe 2G.

The earbuds are the most comfortable I've ever worn...I dont know if anyone else cares, but I sure do. I'm not sure how it compares in weight to the pod, but its NOT THAT heavy. The software worked flawlessly for me, in that it automatically imported all of my music, vid's and pic's during the initial setup.

Clearly, when the reality of this \\"trade\\" hit Microsoft, they back-tracked. Second, a percentage of all sales goes to Universal based on the presumption that Zune owners are going to steal music. This is a horrible precedent, to charge customers based on the theory that they use MP3 players to steal. Now will other companies have a hidden \\"steal\\" charge?

Installing Zune software isn't too hard but Zune Marketplace can't compete with e.g. Itunes or Rhapsody. Also I find it strange that Rhapsody has far more tracks available than Zune MP.Now after four months my battery has failed.

The iPod is so much more elegant.In addition, I had major problems installing the software. None of my iTunes songs would transfer to the player after all the problems installing.I'm returning my Zune and getting another iPod.

The product was delivered within four days. Liked the packaging, very nicely done. I previously had a 30GB ipod, which I bought for 270 bucks. Zune is not an ipod when it comes to weight and looks, but it offers a good value for money. The sound quality is good, and the screen size is fantastic (more than ipod). I listen to songs frequently, so the battery drains pretty fast. One tip I would suggest to conserve battery, put the Zune in Shutdown mode when not is use (press and hold the Back button and simultaneously press down on the control pad for around 4-5 secs). The videos play well, and the pictures look great. Overall, an excellent value for money. If you could get the product for less than $150, then I would highly suggest that you buy this product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent hardware, clunky software","review":"I absolutely adore the hardware, the player itself is great.

However, the software is beyond difficult to install. I've spent hours on the phone with customer support because of conflicts with my Windows Media Center.

It makes duplicate copies of songs on the player, sync's stuff you tell it not to, and adds incorrect album art, artist and album info to roughly 30% of the songs on player.The software alone is reason to look elsewhere.These are remedial issues that Microsoft should've fixed before bringing the product to market."},{"rating":"2","title":"the brown Zune... works as the white, red and others do.","review":"I saw the brown Microsoft Zune listed for about 89 bucks...

This was the only logical choice seeing as Apple no longer makes the 30gig iPod. The Zen players I never really liked aesthetically. Great player, does everything you need from a HDD music player. Only thing different from the iPod is the poorly designed Zune software. The software makes editing ID3 tags a pain, but thankfully I still have Itunes for this reason. Only thing I could have asked for was a clock. No installation problems, as of now wireless syncing does not work, haven't found anyone with a Zune to share music with either. These fixes I assume will be fixed in later versions of the firmware updates, I am not worried, I am waiting for the possibilities of the wireless function to open up. Not an iPod killer, good alternative though, and holds up better to scratches and wear and tear."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great....","review":"When I read the reviews abt the sofware problems of Zune I was bit worried at first. But I didnt face any problem with the setup. Zune is working great.......The only disadvantage is that, the charging has to be done by connecting Zune to the system. We need to buy the charger seperately, if u need to charge it directly without connecting it to the system.Other than this difficulty, i find Zune as one of the best items i own."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it.","review":"I got the 30gb Brown Zune for Christmas and I Love it.

So... the sofware crashed a few times on installation. It did sync my files, but many albums/folders won't play correctly, edit correctly, and it's not because of copyright protections. I suspect I have to re-organize and dummy things down for the Zune to get to play folders properly. Otherwise it's OK, but if you use a computer based mp3 player like WinAmp, working with Zune is like playing ping pong with the village idiot. The interface does not run smoothly on your desktop, it repeatedly hangs-ups and I'm talking about running it on XP, SR2. I have to say it's very disappointing to see a company like MSFT put out a product that seems 3-4 years behind the curve software-wise. Yikes!"},{"rating":"1","title":"zune - the brown squirter","review":"Basically this is a ho-hum effort.MSFT waits to see who has success with a product or service then tries to horn in.They should work on re-writing from scratch, that awful bug-ridden insecure, unstable Windows system rather than trying to copy eveyone else's ideas.Now with the Apple iPhone announcement, Zune is dead in the brown murky water.... peace."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buyer be ware!!!","review":"The Zune is a very nice unit. Only had it about a month but left it overnite to charge. By morning it developed an internal cracked screen. Apparently from a overheated internal battery. I found this out by checking forums on the net since I thought it could have been dropped. Zune support will not tell you it overheated, only that its not covered for repair. Microsoft/Zune will not replace or repair the unit. Next time you watch TV, try imaging watching it with cracks running thru it, its not pleasant.Carmen Baldwinsville"},{"rating":"1","title":"Zune = Toshiba. Software = Microsoft","review":"It's so funny to read all the reviews here saying how awesome the Zune is. Microsoft is the best! Oh but the software needs a lot of work. I have a little factoid for all of you Microsoft fans, the Zune is made by Toshiba not Microsoft. That's why the hardware is nice. It's a Gigabeat. ONLY the software is brought to you by Microsoft. So it's no wonder that the only part of the whole experience to credit MS for is the substandard software. But hey, don't let the facts get in the way. And don't blame all the snickering iPhone users this summer for that fact that you fell for the Zune hype and bought 5-year late brick.Now go buy Vista! It's got candy colored buttons!"},{"rating":"2","title":"delievered as promised","review":"I have read a lot of reviews for the zune that have slammed the zune software and the device itself.

I have handed the zune to several people and no everyone has figured the interface out very quickly with minimal instruction, it's that easy to use.I won't comment on the zune marketplace because I have no need to use it, i rip my music from actual CD's.

My wife does have a shuffle but I havent realy used it that much. I bought the Zune because of the storage size (30 GB) and I got it a really good price bfore Thanksgiving (less than $100). I have a huge Cd collection but wanted to put alot of my songs in one place. It is great and does what I want it to. The music transfers fast from my computer to the Zune and I did not have any problems downloading the required software. The sound is great and it is very easy to find your music once it is on the zune with the drop down menu. Also has a FM radio which works really well and sounds great. The video quality was great for me it looked a lot better than what I expected. So If you can find this at a reasonable price I think it is a great player.

The wheel is not as easy as iPod's, the battery life is not as good as they state, you have to buy from their store (which is DEFINITELY no iTunes Store!) Overall, I was not impressed with this effort, and would not recommend it to anyone. If you bought it, take it back, quick! Let's just face it, this is yet another so-called \\"iPod Killer\\" that falls on it's face. Mr. Gates, give it up. Ande besides, who listens to the radio anymore? This product stinks, and is nothing more than smoke and mirrors."},{"rating":"2","title":"This thing is too cool","review":"I picked up a refurbished 30GB Zune for just over 100 bucks. Wow, what a deal. I plugged it into my PC running Windows Vista and the Zune software v2.3 and it instantly recognized it and started the setup process. The Zune software is easy to use (why it doesn't work with Windows media player is beyond me -- BUT, the Zune software is very good!). The Zune itself is very nice. I found the user interface very intuitive, the screen bright and beautiful, the sound quality is excellent. My co-workers are envious of my Zune :) I like the Radio Data Service with the integrated FM radio. Putting music/videos/photos on it is a snap.Cons: proprietary USB connection (no biggie - just don't lose the cable).I am VERY happy with this beauty."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sexy But Very Disappointing.","review":"No power cord, No Record functionality, No User Manual, No Custom EQ (only presets), No ability to directly copy music to Zune. No useful caring case, No useful earphones, even the ON/OFF is poorly designed.From the moment you open the box you can begin to see that the Zune is a real mess! Everything is aimed at making it look \\"sexy\\", with complete disregard for functionality. Installation is bloated with copyright infringement protection, and not much else. On restarting your computer Zune automatically takes control of your computer, grabbing every possible file without allowing you to decide which pictures or music you want on the Zune. Playback has very little customization available. No custom folders, etc. The only things that I found impressive was the radio and the large screen. Very disappointing for anyone wanting media YOUR way."},{"rating":"1","title":"not so good","review":"Most mac users probably won't be buying a Zune, but I thought the price was good and I wanted to try something new. Of course I knew it didn't play well with mac os, but I had Vista installed on my mac, so I figured it would work fine with that. It did work, but it took me a long time to get it working and get my music on it. Once I had my music transfered, it did a fine job of playing music, but the interface was not the best I have seen. I would prefer the sansa one over the zune interface. The wireless transfer thing turned out to be a flop for me since I only know one person with a zune, and we couldn't get it to work anyways. Pretty much, I felt like I was stuck with a huge 30gb mp3 player. Yea, music worked fine, but I was expecting more. I'm trying to return it, and now I'm gonna get a sansa. If that thing flops I will go back to an iPod."},{"rating":"1","title":"Please don't Buy a Zune","review":"I bought the Zune around Christmas time of 2006.

After spending three (3) hours on the phone with four (4) technicians, Microsoft accepted my return for repair and sent me a box to ship it to their repair facility. Two (2) weeks later, I received the Zune back with a note that the Zune was not repaired because the problem it had was not within the warranty limitations. They did not tell me what the problem was - only that they did not fix it. I was more then dismayed. I had spent almost $300.00 with tax and shipping to buy this product.

It may be bigger then an ipod but its lighter, which may disappoint some(Yes I have both). The screen is nice and big.

However as for the program with my music library i cannot say the same. It is so difficult to use. Much less convenient and harder to sift through all my music. And as far as putting new music in, it is much more difficult. The titles of songs and artists get all scrambled. I love my itunes library, i just put a cd in and the names come in fine and if i want to change it i just edit it, the Zune program does not work this easily. It's quite a hassle to where i haven't even bothered putting new music on it. So basically i wish i could have the Zune player with the itunes library setup/software. I do love the Zune itself, the color, thickness, sturdiness. So if you are a person that either has all their music organized, no burned cd's with unknown or misc. artists or someone who doesn't mind disorganized music, then this might not be a bad choice for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Microsoft strikes again","review":"It took me 2 hours to get the Zune to sync with my computer, and an additional hour to load songs onto it. I'm still dumbfounded that someone who's been making software for so long could produce something this bad. After getting past software issues, the Zune player itself isn't all that great either. It's user interface: Junk. It's immitation click wheel (which is actually just a 4 way directional pad): Junk. It's design: to bulky, to heavy. It feels like I'm carrying a brick in my pocket.Overall: Microsofts first attempt at breaking into the MP3 player market and taking back some of the market share which is primary owned by Apple, is a complete failure. The only hint of innovation that the Zune shows, it's Wi-Fi connection to other Zune's, isn't enough to detire someone from buying the iPod instead.

The design is dynamic in its simplicity and easy to navigate. If there is a downside, it is scarcely to be found in the player itself. The Zune software, sadly, is decidedly sub-par. While frequent updates have improved the user-friendliness over the past year, it is still cumbersome and awkward. I, like many, am forced to do any editing or grouping on an alternate program and then load it into Zune. As far as the device is concerned, my only complaint is that playlists cannot be created on the go, only at the computer. The 'currently playing' list is a poor option because it is far too easy to push one button incorrectly, say pressing 'play song' instead of 'add to now playing', and the list you just compiled for your car ride home is erased."},{"rating":"1","title":"no returns","review":"i purhased this zune and the on off button broke. they would not let me return it. i'm not buying from them again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Zune better than Ipod","review":"I purchased the new 30mb Zune for my wife at christmas. I did a lot of research before buying and compared the Microsoft Zune, Creative Zen Video:M, and Ipod Video. In my opinion, both the Zen and Zune had much more to offer than the Ipod. The Zune has a brilliant screen and an scratch resistent finish. I didn't want to be forced to use Apple's music and video file types, which was the main reason for choosing the Zune. It accepts standard MP3 and AVI formats and uses Windows Media Player 11 to organize the files. It has limited wireless capability which is basically worthless unless you have someone else with a Zune to talk to. Micorsoft should have had the wifi communicate with wireless networks with an internet browser like the Sony PSP. It does have FM radio as well. I just wish it had an integral FM transmitter so you could play it through your car stereo without dropping another 80 bucks on a car kit."},{"rating":"1","title":"doesnt work and not user friendly","review":"this product is user unfriendly as there is no detailed manual available with it.

In fact I'm a network administrator so I know a thing or two about computers.I bought the Zune because a good friend seemed so happy with is Zune. That has since changed; He bought the Zune because he liked the wifi feature. After several failed attempts to share a song he became frustrated with the Zune.

Save your self the frustration buy something else."},{"rating":"2","title":"A steal at $99","review":"I got the Zune for $99. I use it on my 40 minute bus ride to work. I watch dvd's that I have ripped. I bought the Zune pass for music- that is VERY nice- tons of music for $15 a month, and I can stream that music through my XBOX360, which is hooked up to my home theater.Unfortunately, I am unable to view any video podcasts on it without conversion- which is a hassle. I think the new Zunes are able to view video podcasts without any hassle.I got the Altec Lansing M604 speakers to go with it for my garage- and that set up works quite nicely.The Zune 30 is a good value, holds plenty of high quality audio and video. It may be a little bulky- you aren't gonna be able to jog with it, but it is a hard drive based player that rarely leaves my backpack, so I couldn't care less if it were a couple ounces lighter, or fractions of an inch smaller."},{"rating":"2","title":"What a product","review":"I purchased my Zune about a month ago, had no problems installing the software on my PC. I am 60 years old and really enjoy using my Zune with the Shuffle All option, 'cause then I am not listening to one artist all the time. Also, I really like the FM tuner. I have the option to listen to the radio for even more music. I bought the 30GB but I really think I could have gotten by with an 8GB. The Zune 30GB is a bit big and a little heavier but I do like the big screen."},{"rating":"1","title":"Zune Software Ver. 2.0 Problem","review":"I bought(2)of this unit within one month.

It does not even look close to the actual product which is so much thicker than the actual product.Ligitation lawyers should make noteof this. It could be potentially a false advertising law suit.Why is Microsoft spending time and millions of dollar to produce Zune, a ME-TOO product which is generations behind other MP-3 products not to mention any names?"},{"rating":"1","title":"wanted to like this but was disappointed","review":"I received this zune the other day. I think it is the same with all zunes. Right out of the box i was disappointed. I hooked it up as instructed. I installed the software as instructed. When it came time to actually get the music from my pc to the zune it was very awkward. I tried the usual copy from pc to mp3 player as in the past. The zune would not allow me to copy music to it the windows explorer way. It made me copy through the zune interface way. I found it very awkward to copy from pc to zune. I have had much cheaper mp3 players that were more intuitive in copying music. I am also a geek. I know my computer stuff. I don't recommend that you purchase zune in any flavor or capicity."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Satisfied Zune user.","review":"I have had my Zune player for roughly 5 months and am very happy with the unit. I have been travelling a lot this summer, which means the typical bumbs and thumps of airport security and bags being knocked around. The Zune has worked flawlessly and never shown a sign of trouble. The sound is crisp and the screen is bright and very sharp. Battery life is acceptable. The interface is very simple and the controls are also very easy to learn, to the point that I can do almost anything without having to look at the Zune. All in all I am very happy with it.The only reason I give it Four Stars instead of Five is due to the Zune Marketplace. I have never been able to download music from the marketplace; three different hour-long sessions with tech support never resolved the issue. Not a Zune issue, but some lame Microsoft glitch."},{"rating":"1","title":"TERRIBLE ITEM","review":"Please save your self a terrible and horrendous headache and if you are even interested in buying this item then DONT and buy an iPod instead. Microsoft has always been strict in their compatibility issues, but the system requirements for this thing are insane. Half of the time it wont even be detected by the computer and if it does work then a few seconds after being detected it crashes the computer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheap and expensive","review":"My recommendation is to wait for the next generation or even two for the Zune. I experienced the Zune and iPod for the first time during the last couple of weeks. The Zune felt cheap and clunky compared to the iPod. I thought the iPod had better screen resolution and seemed like better quality. The Zune is still working out bugs finally working with Vista but the wireless seems quarky. No one has the Zune yet so no one to share with. The FM doesn't seem to work very well on the Zune having a lot of static with the stations it connects with. It would seem Microsoft would put better quality FM with the Zune since it is one of the features iPod doesn't have.The iPod seemed better polished and the interfaces worked better. I would wait if I were you for a year or so before getting a Zune. Don't throw your money away at a first generation product that still has to many bugs to work out."},{"rating":"2","title":"Zune family","review":"Zune 30 GB Digital Media Player (Brown)I bought a 30G Zune a year ago and loved the way I could have my music, pictures and videos with me always. I am a mother of 4 and a grandma of eight so I have LOTS of pics and flicks. I have about 1900 songs,40 videos, and 212 pictures on my Zune right now with 14G to go.Two other family members bought Zunes through the year and it made it so nice to wirelessly share pictures with each other that I bought three more this Christmas as gifts for my husband, son, and sister.We are now a 6 Zune family and growing. We all love them and plan on buying more as the grandkids get older."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very pleased","review":"My 16 y/o son got this for Christmas this year and absolutely loves it. It did take a while to get the software to load, but we were forewarned that may be the case, so no worries there. He loves the big screen that goes horizontal when the zune is turned. I love the fact that I was able to get him 30, count them 30 Gig for 130.00 instead of a measly 4 gig had we gone with the nano. There's no question, and NOT just for the money, the zune rocks!"},{"rating":"2","title":"For what it's worth from a Novice","review":"I am a grandmother who is not all that knowledgeable about all the new electronic gizmos on the market. However, I purchased this digital music player to use while at the gym--specifically because it had access to an FM tuner while some of the other players do not have this feature. I am very pleased with the quality, performance and ease of operation. Even I can \\"rip\\" CDs and download music choices from the internet (my son would be shocked). It is a bit heavy and I have not tried it at the gym yet as I have not found an appropriate arm band or other means to carry it. The availability of accessories at local stores is sorely lacking.Everything considered, I really like the Zune and enjoy listening to it while at work. I would recommend the Zune. I'm glad I took one more forray into the electronic age with this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"HORRIBLE PRODUCT!!!","review":"I am a big fan of Microsoft and what it stands for but I dont know what were they thinking with this idea!!!!!!!

The Zune just looks and feels cheap. The fake-out click wheel interface adds to the aura of chintziness. The Zune software is an unneccessary second step--why not use WMP?--and the Microsoft Points are silly. The lack of podcast support is unforgivable, the inability to use it as an external hard drive is insulting, and the wi-fi is useless.The screen is marginally larger, and even though it is the exact same resolution with the same number of pixels, it does look slightly more attractive than Apple's iPod does. However, that is more than undone by the sheer unsexiness of the Zune casing, and the inelegance of the clunky interface.Now, it's not a terrible product. It's a slightly ahead of the Creative Zen, for example. But it's still well behind the SanDisk Sansa, and even farther still behind Apple's iPod and iPod Nano.All in all, I would stay away from the Zune."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buyers Beware!","review":"The only good thing about the Zune is the amount of gigs for the price. The software will prompt you to update which will mess up your music library. You can find the fix on the forum, but it is a lot of work to fix. Many of the Zune owners including myself have had trouble with the players resetting during listening. There is no fix yet for this. There are many types of issues with the Zune and its all models not just this one. I honestly wish I had bought an IPOD. If there is no resetting fix by next year I am buying an IPOD. Sorry Zune, I wanted to like you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Can't beat it for the price.","review":"Pros:Huge, vivid screen.Truly excellent sound, even at low volumes.Robust design.Excellent updated software/firmware.Wireless connectivity.Best packaging ever.Cons:Huge, bulky chassis.

Looking into the Zen Vision W instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Decent Player, Horrid Store","review":"The player is nice, if a little large. The store is terrible. You have to buy a package of points. If you don't spend all your points Microsoft still gets the money and keeps it until you do. Say you want two songs. You have to buy $5 worth of points from Microsoft. Each song costs $0.99, so Microsoft keeps your $3.02 in it's back account until you spend it. Now say you buy 5 songs at once. At .99 a song that comes to $4.95. Microsoft keeps your nickel.So in reality the price of the songs are more than iTunes, but they don't tell you that. If you buy just one song, it's $5. If you buy 2, it's $2.50 a song. If you buy 5, it's a dollar each. Microsoft does not tell you about the hidden pricing. It's this kind of if not downright deceptive then misleading practice that makes me shy away from the player."},{"rating":"1","title":"WHAT A JOKE!","review":"I also just had to try one out for myself. What a piece of junk! I'm no iPod lover, but this thing pales in comparison. I felt like I was carrying around a sony walkman. The fake click wheel took me by surprise as it's just simple buttons. The software and store r simply ridiculous. Almost impossible to use. CRASH- CRASH CRASH. you can forget about syncing this thing. The battery life is terrible with WiFi on.

This works great!!","review":"I bought my zune 30gb used for $75 and I had no idea how to use it. It is my first multimedia player and I've never owned anything before this. I had problems at first getting the zune device to be reconized by the software, so I looked for some help on the internet and a website said that the front USB ports on a computer are generally weaker than the ports that are located in the back on the motherboard itself. So i connected the zune to one of the USB ports on the back of the computer. Since then, no problems. It's easy to sync songs, and it's easy to edit mp3 tags so you can organize the music the way you want to. The video and audio tracks sound great! My mp3's are all encoded at 192kbits-256kbits, so everything is high quality. I throw on my Bose Tri-port headphones and I'm set! Everything on it works great: 2,125 MP3's (no wma, or acc), 8 videos, 10 pictures, 2 games. and I've only used 13.11GB, leaving me with another 14.68GB to fill it up with!"},{"rating":"2","title":"zune","review":"I really liked this item. its great for when I run & has a radio & not to mention lots of space for all my music & photos"},{"rating":"2","title":"Zune Review","review":"This is a great little product.

It does everything the iPod does and it's cheaper! I like it better then the generic Mp3 player I had last too. I like that the Zune is popular enough to have support from 3-party sources but not so popular that there is an accessory for every facet of my life. That is that there is not an iToilet for the Zune (and yes there is an iToilet for the iPod) but there are accessories for the car and such."},{"rating":"1","title":"Zune needs to learn from Apple","review":"I was excited to try something new...the zune. For the first few months it was great - then it just sucked. Customer service with Zune is ridiculous - I was on hold forever and then I was speaking to someone in India for over an hour - in which I could barely understand what the c/s person was saying. It was pretty funny when he asked me which country I was calling from - seriously? When the problem was identified (after an hour) he had to transfer me to someone who could take my information. After 20 minutes of being on hold - I was actually transfered to someone in the U.S. - who asked me one question and fixed my problem in under a minute. Really??

It isn't that the device is bad, it's actually pretty good, but the software is the worst and keeps getting worse with every new release and update. To show you how bad this software is, Microsoft has an entire web site devoted to trouble shooting problems!!! Instead of developing the web site, maybe they should should've made a better effort on the software. If you don't mind headaches, wasted hours, and never getting the program to work correctly, then by all means buy this. Otherwise I suggest the iPod.

And the 30GB is OK.But we don't get anything new here and are still tied down in many ways to music subscriptions. It's baloney. AND the price is no deal.Do yourself a favor and buy the Creative Zen Vision:W or Creative Zen Vision:M. I've used both, and an iPod.

Sometimes when you are playing the raido it even tells you what song is playing and the artist which is great.The bad thing about this product is buying music online. It will not allow you to buy songs individually like itunes. You have to buy a $5 card and each song has different prices from 79 cents to 99 cents. So this means that after buying 4 songs you'll have a balance of 69 cents or so and won't have enought to buy a fifth song. Because the balance is so uneven, you'll always have something left on the card that you won't be able to use. Thats a rip-off. The other bad thing about the zune is that variety of music that you can buy online is not as extended as itunes. They have limited choices.I bought the zune for my husband but I am getting me an ipod. itunes allows me to buy as many songs I want for only 99 cents each with no additional fees."},{"rating":"2","title":"See Ya Ipod!!!","review":"I have owned two iPods before, but after using my new Zune for a few days I'm liking it so much, is it perfect? no, were my iPods perfect? no.Plus I really like the interface, much nicer than the iPod's white screen.Also the spanish music selection is way larger than the iTunes has and I have acces to all of them with my subscription."},{"rating":"2","title":"zune","review":"i have several mp3/4 players. the zune is the largest i own and i find that i use it every day. i belong to the ms zune service and what a deal.i still have problems trying to download movies and such.(reason for the 4 stars)wish it was as easy to download movies as music."},{"rating":"2","title":"AWESOME PRODUCT","review":"I reviewed several types of MP3 players from Ipod, Zune, RCA, Sandisk.

I purchased mine from Amazon. Zune software loaded easily on my computer, and it created my library with little fuss.The Zune is a little bigger than the 30 GB iPod, and a touch heavier. I own both. There isn't much difference. The screen on the Zune is much clearer, and the sound equals or exceeds the iPod.Microsoft needs to further explore the WiFi aspect of the Zune, and from what I've read they will be doing that. They also need to get podcasts and RSS into the Zune, and I suspect they are doing that, too. You can load a podcast into the Zune, but the Zune software doesn't do it for you (yet).Zune works well with Xbox 360. The Xbox sees it and you can play songs through it (and by extension your sterio and TV).All in all, a good start. It's not as polished as the iPod yet, but it is early."},{"rating":"2","title":"people bug me","review":"Nevermind reviews by those who haven't even held the device.

The screen is a good deal larger than the vidio-ipod's, making up for the slight increase in size. The finish is a scratch resistant feeling rubberized plastic, much better than the ipods.

The wifi feature is so bad its useless and only works with other zunes."},{"rating":"1","title":"I wonder how far I can throw this...","review":"I'm having a difficult time finding words for my disappointment. Let me start off by saying that the hardware is more than decent. The Zune sounds great and feels solid, with that said; the software is worse than I ever could have imagined. If you buy this, make sure your music is tagged to perfection and even then, the Zune's software misinterprets tags and randomly fills in blanks with information it pulls seemingly out of nowhere. I truly cannot believe that the people behind the software interface still have jobs."},{"rating":"1","title":"1st Generation Zune - Not even close","review":"I've owned a 1st generation 30gb Zune since the first of 2008. I've applied all available software/firmware updates. It has more working against it than for it. But I use it everyday because I don't want to risk losing my iPod Touch.The main complaints are the horrible software; the USB 1.1 transfer speed (takes literally hours to load movies); the lack of any ability to organize videos in any way and songs only into basic groups; the way it doesn't remember where you left off while listening to songs in a very long list; no way to delete files from collection but keep in player (deletes without asking when re-connecting); scrolling and more scrolling, clicking and more clicking (no shortcuts).It's not all bad: Good audio quality; video is passable but nowhere near the Touch; good size and comfort; good battery.Like I said, this is my everyday player but if I didn't have my iPod to fall back on, I'd be disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Zune Review","review":"I like the Zune. One because its not an Ipod, which I hate. Two because I can put more than just music on it. I can set my own wallpaper in the background and its easy to go from menu to menu. It is a little more user friendly than the Ipod because it's not touch sensitive. Also it has a nice sized screen. My only concern is that it doesn's have an off button or switch so you really don't know if its off. Nor does the battery last as long if you are listening at a high volume.

The reasons I don't like the Zune are: 1.) It doesn't have a customizable EQ. The sound that came out of this player was pretty bland. No high crisp bass even with the right earplugs. 2.) I hate the annoying program I have to use just to upload music or other files. It's a needless step in my opinion. I'd rather it be a drag and drop hard-drive player, cutting out the middleman program just to load your music. 3.) Battery life isn't at all long enough.The only reasons I gave it 2 stars is that the Zune really is easy to use. The buttons do what they're supposed to do and scrolling around looking for the song you want is super easy. Another reason is the fact that it really does have a pretty screen, I'll give it that. The photos and videos are vibrant in color."},{"rating":"2","title":"Zune 30 GB","review":"I ordered my ZUNE from Yahoo and couldn't be happier. It was shipped right away and works great.

Returned the first one because it would not connect.The second one died in the middle of updating the software and never connected again. I returned the second one, and got an iPod, and ate some crow.If it it had worked there are some features that I did not know about before I bought it that would have stopped me.1. You can't use it as an external hard drive. Why is that? One of the reasons I wanted such a device was to bring files home from work.2. While the second one was working, I tried sharing a file - it was slow and unreliable.3. The MS music store has a poor selection, and you can't use other stores with it.Also, I had hoped that Zune file would play else where - no dice."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is going back today","review":"I wanted to get a media player so that I could download pod casts. I did not have another media player prior to this so I could not compare it. I have spent 6 hours on this and at this point it is going back.First there are no instructions. I had to play around with it for about 4 hours to finally figure out how the thing worked. I though I could go to the Zune web site for help. No such luck, you have to go to the messages boards and sign on to access data.The Zune was adding data onto it from the web site that I did not want, such as music I would never listen to. From what I could figure out, music from my computer has to go to the Zune site, then downloaded to the Zune. I thought this would just be a drag and drop operation, but if it was, I never could figure it out. I could not just pick an album on my computer and drop it to the Zune. At this point I am so frustrated I am ready to throw my computer across the room. I hate this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"1 hour with my ZUNE caused 3 days on the phone with Tech Support!!!","review":"I recently purchased the ZUNE and was excited to come home and get it going. I put the disc in and started to install the software. When it asked me to plug in the ZUNE i did so and my computer froze completly. After restarting i finish installing the software (took FOREVER to complete) The media player was a nightmare. Slow choppy movement and constantly freezing for a few seconds. Not my computers fault (if thats what your thinking) it is just poor software. Well i realise that everytime i plug my zune into the computer, it locks the computer up. I tried getting online to check the zune HELP section and wait a minute...somehow ZUNE deleted my ethernet driver!?!?! It took 3 days and many hours on the phone and live tech chat to get my computer back to working properly. Needless to say i uninstalled ALL zune software and exchanged my zune for an ipod."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's like a bad girlfriend who's really good in bed...","review":"The Zune is...problematic. I'm a finicky person about audio, and it's lack of lossless support and a proper line-out bother me (especially the latter; in a unit this size, there's no reason to omit it). However, the superb sound quality, incredible build, and gorgeous interface make up for the bad points. That is until the battery runs out, which is ignorantly fast and often. Oh, and since Microsoft is too cheap to provide an AC adapter, be sure to calculate another $90 or so to pick up the travel pack, which you'll quickly find you need if you really use your mp3 player. Long story short, it's a piece of crap I'd murder someone over if they touched it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Zunes good for me","review":"I would have to say that the Zune is a a pretty great Mp3/Video player..I agree with all the other positive reviews of this item. One thing that I would complain about is the software that comes with it, it IS a little tedious to work with..say when you delete something from your library it automaticly deletes it from the Zune..but I have heard that Itunes also does this..Also when you import you audio files into the software you may need to mess around with the track names/album names because I sometimes get two of the same folders on my Zune. Either way I am pleased with the Zune."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fair to Middling at Best","review":"For the same price, you get better value from an iPod. Yes, the iPod has a slightly smaller screen. It also is thinner and has a longer lasting battery. When the screen is held up, the size isn't that big of a difference, and it's the same pixel resolution.Microsoft is attempting to mimic the iPod ecosystem, but you can't just go out and buy a song for 99 cents. You have to buy it in points, and one point does not equal one penny. At least with the Wii point system, you don't get confused on how much money you've spent.Sharing is so slow that there isn't much point. By the time you share a song with someone, you'd be better off just letting them borrow your Zune for three minutes.Yeah, yeah. People think the iPod is overpriced and overhyped. I have to say that it really isn't. When you pick up and use an iPod, it screams quality. The Zune just does not."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hated it!","review":"My Zune was delivered at 7 p.m. on Friday and I had returned it by 9 a.m. Saturday. I had purchased it as an \\"upgrade\\" to my Toshiba Gigabeat, but found it much less satisfactory. Most frustrating was that installation required that I update my Windows Media Player to version 11, but the Zune is completely imcompatible with WMP! Zune selected 26 of the several hundred albums on my computer (apparently random choices) and added them to the \\"collection\\" on the Zune software. It would not let me add others to the collection. After hours of frustrating efforts, I put it all back in the box and returned it (while cursing Bill Gates). I should have done better research on Zune's total incompatibility with WMP software. I made the mistake of assuming Microsoft products would be compatible. Several members of my family have Creative Zens and are very satisfied, so I will try that next. Meanwhile, the old Toshiba is more satisfactory than the new Zune."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great","review":"I am using it now and it seems to work very well.

The Zune is less than 35 days old. I would never recommend buying anything from Justin's Electronics. I'm thinking that I paid $200 for a refurbished product. You live and you learn.

On top of that the music quality I'm getting out of the this model isn't as good as on the newer Zune (I know that's hard to believe but certain instruments or vocals are really quiet on some songs...it's weird).

Long story short- NOBODY, I mean nobody has a zune that I could find. And what's up with the Zune Marketplace? Geez, iTunes is so freggin' easy to use, I got addicted to it and my parents got pissed off that I was D/Ling albums and videos.I'm putting my Zune on eBay and will be forced to buy another ipod (without the HD) - who needs 80 gigs of storage for crying out load?"},{"rating":"2","title":"What is with the price tag?

Support told me that Zune would not warranty a cracked LCD under any circumstances, they also would not give me any information on how to access factory repair. The C.S. repersenative was rude and not at all helpful. Online I checked some of the independant repair companies and found out that Zune has a problem with LCD's cracking if charged overnight. It seems that the battery heats up and expands causing the LCD to crack. Microsoft is aware of this problem but they are sticking to thier NO REPLACEMENT POLICY.

But, what is great about the Zune is that it is completely updatable. The computer software checks for updates and it's automatically (if you choose to) updated on your Zune...and Presto! problems solved. Don't listen to claims that the Zune \\"deletes your incompatible files.\\" That, ladies and gentlemen, is called USER ERROR.I admit, I have been critical of Microsoft in the past for the unstability of IE and other frustrating things about Microsoft, but the Zune... now the Zune is something to be proud of.

I went online only to see what experience others had. After reading several not-so-flattering blogs from others trying to find a way for this thing to work, I finally found a way to solve my problem. I went to the workshop and took out a hammer and applied it to the Zune. No more problem. It was in a funny way very therapeutic. I think we both felt better as both of us were out of our misery.

I installed the software on both a desktop PC as well as a laptop PC and the result was the same in that the Zune was never detected by the PC. Both of these PC's are running microsoft windows XP.Bottom line is that the Zune is not useable which is an extreme disappointment especially for a child who had hoped to receive this for christmas.Therefore, BEWARE when you purchase refurbished electronics as software is tricky and if not up to date can cause problems. I will never purchase refurbished again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Run, Don't Walk....To Return this one for a refund!","review":"Total Disaster...good luck getting the software onto your computer. even more challenging may be getting the actual player to charge or work. after spending hours downloading every possible microsoft update, the zune still believes it's not compatible with either my home or office equipement. without a doubt this is one of the worst products i've ever purchased."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than what you might think","review":"Ok so I have read mixed reviews of the Zune.After having it for a couple of months, I must say, I'm quite satisfied.I'm definitely not an iPod type of person so I definitely wanted to check out the Zune while Amazon was having a black Friday special of $89.99. I couldn't just let this deal pass me.I love all the features Zune has. A lot of people complain about Zune's software and I don't have any complaints.

I have always refused to buy the first year/generation of any product. First year/generation models are always buggy. I broke that rule and bought the Zune. I should have waited. The tonal quality does not approach that of a 5th generation iPod. The battery life on an iPod is far superior as well. The wheel does not work nearly as smoothly as an iPod either. The Zune was a good idea but it was not ready to go to market. I assume that if Christmas were not fast approaching they would have waited and improved the Zune a bit more before releasing it. They should have anyway. I gave mine to my sister yesterday and went back to my old iPod. When I can afford a new purchase I will get a 60 or 80 gig iPod video.

Every time I started downloading the software it hit an error message and told me to reboot and try again. Next try same thing, after about an hour or so I go to there official website, no help there. And now I have decided that this player would be a lot better if it supported easier plug and play compatibility's. Bill gates..... you sure dropped the ball on this one.

I think iPod is an overly expensive brand; and there is no reason this wouldn't be better than an iPod nano or shuffle; but the iPod touch is actually useful at places that offer wi fi, like McDonald's or Starbucks if you need information off of the internet.

It only recognized my media files intermittently (with no rhyme or reason as to why a.mpg was recognized but practically identical b.mpg was not,) took literally DAYS to sync with my computer (and then, after 72 hours, produced an error telling me that half the files still didn't sync but couldn't tell me why) compared to the iPod's ten minute sync time for twice as much data, and the software was nowhere near as user friendly as iTunes.The only positive things I can say are that I enjoyed the radio tuner feature, and it had a larger display than iPod (though, clearly, not the new iPod Touch) which was very pretty.If you're considering buying a Zune, save yourself the hassle and just get an iPod. Seriously."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible software makes a decent player unusable. :(","review":"The zune is a decent product, almost as good as the iPod, in fact, and cheaper usually. Unfortunately, I've owned one and have found out that the software is so buggy, so inefficient, so difficult to use and counterintuitive, I can't actually use this decent MP3 player. I've sold it, and am MUCH happier with my Creative Zen.The software randomly deletes and syncs files for no apparent reason, skips albums, won't sync podcasts, and ONLY allows zune specific WMV's. (Try finding a lot of video files, trailers, etc in Zune format. It's difficult, at best.) I literally knew I couldn't keep wasting my time with this horrible an interface, so I sold it.2-3/10"},{"rating":"1","title":"No Net Library? No Bookmarking? No Sale!","review":"This is not a machine for the 40+ crowd that shuns the attention fracturing music of today's youth. One of these days the mega Zunipod corporations will realize that much of the well-to-do middle aged and up demographic actually listen to BOOKS on their MP3 players.What the audiofile wants in an MP3 player is:1. 'Plays for Sure' compatibility so that we can copy our NET LIBRARY books using Windows Media Player to our audio devices.2. BOOKMARKING!!!!! A 17 hour WMA file is a sad thing when you lose your place in it and have to start over. Without bookmarking the player is essentially 'highjacked' by the book because if you move to another sound file you lose your place. (Note that this is not an issue for Zune. Although it won't bookmark, you can't get Net Library books on it in the first place!)The final word is: If you want to listen to audio books, get a Creative or a Rio with 'Bookmarking.' Avoid this device."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yikes!! Awful experience -- don't do it!","review":"Returned this unit after trying it for 4 days. I tried. I wanted to like it. The screen is nice.

This was a Christmas present replacement for the first Zune I bought my college-age daughter a couple of years ago -- also a refurbished one. No, the refurbished one didn't fail. My two year old grandaughter dropped it. And that wasn't the first time it had been dropped -- just the last time. My daghter really likes the Zune, which is why she wanted a replacement. It's a nice size, holds a lot of music, plus she has a speaker-radio combo that it plugs directly into so she can listen to her music by means other than head phones. Don't be afraid of the refurbished ones. At half the price of the \\"new\\" ones, it's a good deal."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Non Apple Mp3 player","review":"For the price its hard to beat. I considered purchasing an apple ipod classic and came across the zune price drops and figured it was too hard not to take a chance on the zune. As a father of two I purchased it out of practicality, including price and not media hype or coolness factor. I bought it mostly for music storage and pictures. My greatest concerns prior to purchasing were ease of use, functionality and battery life. My only disappointment is battery life. I average five hours which seems lousy to me. The zune requires its own software, similar to itunes with an upgrade that is pending. Right now the music or only availabe option on the zune marketplace is pretty good, but falls a bit short compared to itunes. However, its easy to use. The zune itself is easy to use and the screen is nice and pretty large. My only real disppointment is the current lack of videos for purchase on the zune marketplace and the short battery life."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lousy, clunky, useless","review":"Well, who needs simple mp3 playing anymore? At 5 years after iPod's introduction, what people truly wants is a MULTIMEDIA player and there Zunes fails short: it plays only M$'s own wm and a bastard type of mpeg4 of its own creation when most people now rips DVDs using the .avi format either in DivX or Xvid.What we need is a player that allows the user to load the latest codecs into it to play any kind of media format he prefers.Zune, instead, puts the user in a straightjacket imposing what Microsoft wants him to play.And what M$ allows you to play is movies with no compression which take over 2Gb space when any DivX takes only 700Mbs. On top of that--even in this day when most TVs support letterbox, Zune forces you to view them in the standard 4:3 ratio, distorting the images.I'm selling mine on eBay and getting something else."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sucks","review":"Don't work.

In spite of all the reviews of how bad this player and its software is, I am happy to say that they are both easy to use. All you need to understand this software is a basic understanding of how a computer works. The player itself is easy to see, use and enjoy. The hardest part of the software setup is installing it. Even this is relatively easy if you understand how to use your computer. IT takes awhile to install, but once it is, it works just like Windows Media player. For the reviewers that couldn't work it, maybe your computer can't handle the software, I feel that the ZUNE player is great.

Go away Zune!","review":"Got the Zune for Christmas. Wanted an iPod, but what the heck, should not be much difference, eh? Oh, how wrong I was! Software was NOT easy to use, despite what some reviewers have said. Zune Marketplace sucks big ones. You need to prepay to buy points. Must buy points in dollar increments, but songs don't cost exact dollar amounts, so you end up with a few cents here & there that you won't be able to use fully until you buy a bunch of songs. I won't be around that long!As for the Zune itself, it is clunky to use and looks like a toy. I've had enough of it. I bought myself an iPod and the Zune is on sale on Craigslist. Not one call on it. I guess others are smart enough to avoid it.Do yourself a favor - buy the iPod.

First of all you can't use it as a portable hard drive. Second of all, in order to download music and videos from the zune marketplace you have to subscribe 15 bucks a month for music I can't even burn on a cd and if I stop a subscription all the music puchased from the marketplace will delete itself. Also Apple has more content on iTunes, almost a million more songs than the zune marketplace including countless movies, tv shows, podcasts, and games. Also, the software to sync the zune is faulty and has connection ploblems with the zune. Furthermore, no way Microsoft will ever challenge Apple in this area. The ipod just has too big of a fanbase for the zune to take on, that and iTunes is pretty much the industry standard. The zune is too soon and I feel sorry for anyone who got this hunk of donkey poo for Christmas."},{"rating":"1","title":"JW","review":"This product is garbage!

This product was clearly not ready for release, but Microsoft was in such a hurry to get this thing out for the Holiday, they rushed it out without proper testing.There is nothing redeemable about this product. From software, to hardware, to their store. It's just not a good product. My prediction, this will be pulled from the market within a year.

When will someone come out with a media player that doesn't require poorly written, intrusive software to be installed on your computer?

It's really that simple, there is no need for anything more. Why is this such a difficult concept for Apple, Microshaft and others?

The Zune is larger than the iPod, the iPod felt right in my hand.The video screen on the Zune was a little larger but the clarity seem to pale next to the iPods.Now as far as software installation, I don't know. but when I walked out of the store, an iPod came home with me.The iPod software installed quickly, works smoothly with iTunes.

It's screen and video quality are amazing, much better than what i've seen on iPods. the sound is great, and the player is very simple to use. Plus, i like the music subscription plan of Marketplace. The raido is a big plus too.My complaints are the click wheel can be a hassle if you want to find music quickly (i was spoiled by the Dell DJ's scroll bar). The software is sometimes a pain, especially if your PC doesn't support it (i had to download Service Pack 2 to support the Zune Software).Yet, with any player there are going to be annoying problems, even the iPod.

The second copy is on my bookshelf and I still enjoy reading a chapter here and there. The author starts with the sinking of the Imperial Fleet in 1919 and does a good and concise accounting of Germany's naval planning afterwards, especially after Raeder takes over. The battles fought during the war are well known and can be found in more detail in books specializing in those individual topics; however, if you only had one book then this one would be ideal. Has also some good pictures. My only beefs are minor: his calling the Scharnhorst class battleships as battlecruisers, when in fact they were the opposite (heavy armour but weak guns for their size), and then the mislabelling of the pictures of the Scheer and Gneisenau.

I fail to see how anyone could identify with the main character, and therefore care what happens to him.

Even Mozart plays second fiddle to the author's angst."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unredeeming","review":"As a musician and mystery-lover, I expected to thoroughly enjoy this book. I pitched it less than a third of the way through. The protagonist is one of the most obnoxious narrators I've ever encountered - every woman's nightmare date, self-aggrandizing, self-pitying and self-absorbed. The plot seems to be a take-off on the DaVinci Code (another terrible book). There are too many good books to waste time reading bad books."},{"rating":"2","title":"Part travelogue, part history book, part musicology, all mystery.","review":"I found the book compelling and the research which gives it the fountation just a fascinating as the plot structure. I believe the book does reveal the cult of personality that still surrounds Mozart over 200 years after his death, but obviously not as dramatic as the book suggests. The only thing holding me back from giving the book five stars was the ending, not the actual ending but the way it was wrapped up in the somewhat cliche way where everyone was brought back in the end. Also at some stages there were a lot of characters to keep track off. Still, I love the descriptions of the cities and places visited, it made the book and set the right old world intrigue atmosphere. Very good read."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Cow Who Wouldn't Come Down","review":"I recommend that you read this book because how the author can tell you how they think and how you have to think what Miss Rosemary will do next.Plus itis funny to watch her mess up."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Cow Who Wouldn't Come Down","review":"I would not recommend this book.Because it was not my kind of book.I like chapter books and i also like different kinds of animals especially hamsters."},{"rating":"1","title":"Brutal - if they gave zero stars this would be one","review":"2 days after installation 4 buttons lie on the floor having been what can only be described as \\"shed\\" by the futon - maybe it will grow some new ones in the Spring.During installation the alan key provided lost it's grooves.

The call quality is poor with buzzing and feedback. The voice messsage, maintained on Vonage equipment is choppy and they can't fix it. They just tell you to unplug and the plug in the router---to no avail. Customer Service is wait on hold for 42 minutes, get disconnected, call back, speak to a guy in India that has no clue about helping you, get disconnected, call back wait 24 minutes, get \\"escalated\\" to no where and then get an e-mail saying to troubleshoot on their web site, when the website says call in.

The purchase included several rebates and opening of Vonage Service. CompUsa did not disclose termination fee of $39.99 that Vonage applies to terminations within first 12 months. Most VOIP providers do not require any termination fees for retail equipment/service purchases only for direct purchases.Quality of service was terrible, as a matter of fact the service is down now as I'm writing this. They try to keep you as long as possible to show high number of subscribers since they went public recently.But with this quality/cost ratio, the'll not survive. You can get Skype or other cheap VOIP services with better quality."},{"rating":"1","title":"Decent performance with one caveat, brutal technical support","review":"The setup was quite easy, and voice quality is decent. However, I can only place outgoing calls; calls to \\"my\\" number are routed to someone else. I won't fault Vonage for the technical problem itself. However, the response of their technical support is unacceptable; each of the four times that I have called, I have been told that they would look into it and get back to me by email. They have never done so. If you're considering Vonage, look online at the experiences of other users; I don't think that my experience is uncommon.UPDATE (Feb. 17, 2008): Shortly after my original review, and after another phone call, this problem was resolved by technical support by switching me to another number. Subsequently, I have not had to think about my phone line except when paying the bills, which is exactly what most customers want."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's As Bad As Using Two Tins Cups and a String","review":"I was really exciting about pulling the plug on Qwest. I immediately noticed a slight decline in quality with Vonage, but I thought I was being picky. Gradually, the quality of the line decreased to the extent that I simply could not communicate with people. There are echoes, static. Lots of time, I have to ask people to call me back on my cell phone. Vonage customer service is virtually non-existent. I'm not a techie, but I think if you have a home network and use Vonage, bandwidth is eaten up and Vonage does not have any proprietary part of the bandwidth. I really do not know, but I should not care because I never had to care with the phone company, and the savings is not that much that it is worth my while.BEWARE OF VONAGE. IT IS SIMPLY THE WORST."},{"rating":"1","title":"Absolutely no customer service","review":"The service works well . . . most of the time. However, if you have a problem, Vonage doesn't want to know about it. I've waited up to an hour on hold to get a tech rep and forget about e-mail support - they just don't answer. Now I want to cancel and they're going to charge me a cancellation fee! My advice is to wait until they work out a few more bugs and get over their growing pains."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Product, Terrible Support","review":"I recently installed Vonage and it worked great for a couple days. The sound quality is surprisingly good.Two days ago, the service stopped working altogether (I get a dial tone, but all calls end in a fast busy signal). I have made 3 calls to support and each time I was forwarded to a recorded message saying they are too busy to take my call. I have also sent three emails to support. I have not received a response to any of my inquiries.

I guess you need a T1 Line..","review":"I've had the vonage unlimited voice service and 12 virtual numbers for five months and we're on the verge of breaking up. On the outset, I thought VOIP would save me big bucks from $375-400 a month to $100...but I wasn't ever able to get the rock solid stability I need in a telephone line from the vonage line. My calls were always choppy and would echo even when forwarded to my cell phone...there seems to be a built in split second latency that is not present in regular land lines...I know that it's not all Vonage's fault, but my cable modem is faster and more reliable than anyone else's I've ever seen (and I've seen a lot) which made me confident at the outset that I had a chance of getting it to work. The service has a lot to offer if you can get it to work. Maybe if I had a T-1 line it would be perfect, but for now I have to stick with my phone company provided remote call forwarding lines."},{"rating":"1","title":"The ups and downs (mostly downs) of Vonage","review":"I bought Vonage service 7 months ago. When it works (not as often as I'd like), it's terrific. When it doesn't (too often), it's a nightmare. I have had most of the problems already mentioned in other reviews, but the worst one of all is that I forward my Vonage line to my cell phone whenever I'm not home. The call gets forwarded, but messages don't. I am told that I have a 6-second message, and there is never a voice. Customer service (or customer neglect would be a better term) has been working on it for weeks. They have actually made the situation worse. Moral of the story: you get what you pay for.

They don't have a contract but they charge you $40 to cancel service. Now that's a mental torture.Then they have a distinct entity to cancel services which remains only open for few hours on working days and they promise a credit which does never get reflected on your statement. Then when you call back they say they don't have notes it. Where's the value of the word they give.The customer service has sweet sound but they will waste your time by making things complicated, till the point you say why the hell did you get into this one.

So much so it almost made me like the regular phone company! They claim you can use your existing phone number and that you can try them \\"risk free\\" with a money back guarantee. Unfortunately, I found out (after bugging their customer service), that I had to either switch numbers or disconnect and then reconnect my DSL. I decided to cancel my service, but ended up paying over $100 in activiation, monthly and cancellation fees.I did eventually get part of my money refunded, after contacting their customer service several times, but considering I never got to make one phone call with them, it was pretty discouraging.

It has been a nightmare and not worth the money I wasted on it. The customer service is a useless. You can call and wait on the phone for 10 minutes and then you get a recording saying they cant take your call but you can leave a message or send an email!

I have seen others complain about the delay, but I don't think it really affects the quality of most phonec calls. Yes there is a delay. No, most people won't notice the delay in a normal conversation.A bigger issue, however, is Vonage support. I have had no Vonage dial tone for two days. Calls to their support # have ended in a \\"we are too busy to take your call, please leave a message.\\" These messages, as well as three emails, have gone unanswered. The result is that I have no phone service and no way to speak to anyone to fix the problem.

You will not be listed in Phone Book / 411.4. NO 911 service.5. You always need electricity and your internet connection should always be working.6. If you have only 128 kbps DSL connection, then while talking on Vonage phone, you are left with only 128-90 = 38 kbps connection for web surfing.. so you cannot do both at the same time.7.

I haven't even had a chance to evaluate their actual service yet because it hasn't started, but I've paid nearly $100 just for the privilege of waiting.

I guess because the guy works for CNN people assume he is trying to promote liberalism, but like I said this isn't the case for this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Made me proud to be an American!","review":"Anderson Cooper really hit paydirt with this book. From his travels from his cushy New York seat to the tragedies around the world and back to America with the greatest natural disaster Hurricane Katrina - that swamped the Gulf Coast. Hurricane Katrina was surreal, seeing our President congratulate the head of FEMA with pats on the back and saying how great of a job he was doing was beyond comprehension and then the other politicians of both parties started the same thing. The only one who did a good job was Mr. Koppell and then of course Mr. Cooper. Both of which brought the politicians on to ask them what they were doing that was so great? People were hungry, without water and food for days and children and old people dying. In America? I remember Cooper's words. Then I read his book and it gave me a glimpse into why he's so amazing to so many of us. He cares. Love this book, you must read it and it's well worth it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dispatches from the Edge","review":"I consider this one of my \\"hard to put down\\" books. I loaned it out to my two sisters who said the same. I bought it on tape for my visually impaired sister and she is listening to it now. Anderson is a remarkable person who could have had a life of leisure but put himself into danger again and again. A man of remarkable kindness, his compassion shows through in every paragraph. I loved the book and Anderson Cooper."},{"rating":"2","title":"awesome","review":"wonderful book! 3/4 the way through and it continues to blow my mind.Took a little while to receive in the mail but in great condition, esp for the price."},{"rating":"2","title":"Insightful","review":"I am a great admirer Anderson Cooper. Through his stories he reveals some of his 'real' self and his inner conflicts. My only negative comment is that I wish it were 10 times longer."},{"rating":"2","title":"What about 9/11????","review":"This book is a great read; very interesting and it goes fast, even when you don't have time to read (me). However, I only gave it 4 stars because (like others have said), you don't learn too much about him personally - which is not that important given the title of the book - but also because.... I kept waiting to hear about the turmoil and the reaction and how he helped the city where he grew up on 9/11/2001, on the day and in the days after it was terrorized, and there is none of it??? It is like there is a hole in the book. I thought well, maybe \\"the Edge\\" means other countries, but he covers Katrina. I am very surprised that of the 148 reviews I just looked at, nobody else has mentioned this or covered this. I do still recommend reading the book. Fascinating stuff. He complex and deep, that's for sure."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent","review":"I thought this was a very heartfelt book. Mr. Cooper has seen some horrific things in both his personal and professional life. I hope he continues to write about his experiences."},{"rating":"2","title":"A view from behind the camera","review":"Anderson Cooper first caught my attention during the tragedy of Hurricane Katrina. I saw him turn his head away from the camera, holding back the emotions that tvjournalists aren't supposed to show and I felt a bond with him. His first novel \\"Dispatches from the Edge\\" could've been better but I am impressed with the fact that he was able to put his feelings into words after years of avoiding them. I admit I cried as he related his time in Niger with the starving Nigerians and I felt the same outrage I'd felt during hurricane Katrina. Still, I wonder who is Anderson Cooper. As much as the book focused on the death of his father (and suicide of his brother) and how it affected his family, I feel like as a reader I dont know much about him. I hope that Mr. Cooper did that intentionally to maintain a sense of privacy or mystery. I also hope he writes another book, because despite the flaws I thought it was a great, informative book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Print journalists vs. Broadcast","review":"I'm from Vietnam and I'm a print journalism student. I was interested in Cooper's show - Anderson Cooper 360 - also partly because I know he studied in Vietnam once. However, as a future print journalist, I just feel that there are many print journalists who are devoting their lives to tell the stories won't get that much recognition as broadcast journalists. Their bylines are just blurring in readers' minds. But their words stay"},{"rating":"2","title":"very interesting","review":"I love his style of writing. It was very easy to read and most interesting on how he got his start and the stories he covered. Some of itwas difficult to read at times but well worth it. I would have liked to learn more about his background though."},{"rating":"2","title":"Surprisely good and interesting.","review":"One might view Anderson Cooper's life as great and desired, but after reading his story, I have come to admire his work. I was always interested in his CNN program but this insight into his personal life showed me that there was less glamour than what celebrities usually have. His father died at an early age, and his older brother commited suicide. Then he choses a life in journalism and the attendant life of visiting the world's hot spots where there is death and mutilation. He not only finds that in Africa and other third world spots, but also in New Orleans after Katrina. I enjoyed his book and felt outrage at this imperfect world where bodies are allowed to float around, and children die of starvation.This is a book about a caring journalist. He not only produces a good television program but he writes a good book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Surprisingly personal","review":"I had no idea who Anderson Cooper was until the hurricane season of last year. And then I was intrigued. More so when I discovered his parentage. This was a person who was showing what he felt but also being very factual in his reporting. I found his book to be intensely personal and surprisingly informative. His own life has certainly left him in a place where he could have been very hard and blase or as empathetic and instructive as he is. An excellent look behind the screen."},{"rating":"2","title":"Anderson Cooper surviving the past.","review":"Dispatches from the Edge was an interesting book that moved back in forth in time. Anderson Cooper is clearly an adrenaline junky that needs the action, the terror, and the horror to keep him interested. His reporting is clear and concise. As he says in the book, he tries not to politicize or be rude. The death of his two family members still haunts him and his experiences make him relive the past. Those sections of the book give you an insight into the man that makes the book worth reading."},{"rating":"2","title":"Phenomenal Book","review":"Anderson Cooper's book is a captivating account of his experiences as a reporter intertwined with his experiences and feelings about his father's death and brother's suicide. His dedication to telling other's stories grew out of his desire to escape the pain he experienced in his own life. This book is beautifully written. I strongly recommended it to anyone who wants a glimpse into the mind of Anderson Cooper or who wants to learn about what happens behind the scenes and when the news camera is turned off."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book","review":"I love how candid Anderson Cooper is in this book. He has always been a CNN favorite of mine but now I appreciate him even more."},{"rating":"2","title":"interesting","review":"i enjoy biographical books and was interested in the life of Anderson Cooper. Easy reading and gave me some insight to the man I see on the news on location where disaster is happening."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Deeper Look Inside the Man","review":"I downloaded this book to my Kindle and read it in 2 evenings. I admire Anderson and how he hasn't let fame and fortune go to his head. He talks about his deceased father and brother throughout the book and I'm not sure if he has ever made his peace with their deaths. I have lost 3 family members in an 8 month period and I don't think I've ever really made my peace either.Even though Anderson is a very private person, his compassion for people shines through not only in this book, but also in the stories he continues to cover for CNN.I would recommend this book to anyone who likes Anderson. I think you will come away with an even deeper appreciation of the man."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty Good","review":"AC's book is extremely readable, but too short; it's only about 200 pages; twice the length would have been good. The best parts by far are those about his own life. His descriptions of his brother's suicide and the effect it had on him are pretty devasating. Likewise the parts where he details his father's influence on him. But, as much as I want to give this 5 stars, I was slightly disappointed. Cooper provides an insight into his own life, but he keeps a great deal to himself. This may be fair enough, but at the start of the book it seems as if he's about to embark on a journey of self-revelation, but only ever gets halfway."},{"rating":"2","title":"Insight","review":"This is a well-written and engrossing book, by and about an enigmatic personality. Coopers juxtaposition of personal life, tragedy and memories with the epic human disasters he's been drawn to cover provide insight into his demons and to those at work in the world."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointed","review":"I found this uninteresting and boring. He dwells on the suicide of his brother throughout the whole book. enough already, Anderson! Let him go. The rest of the book is depressing enough. Now I know why I left CNN for Fox!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Horribly Written Drivel","review":"Probably the most bland book I have ever tried to read. Despite having lived though some vivid experiences, Anderson Cooper is unable to express even the slightest bit of candor or passion. I did not expect much before reading the book, and unfortunately, that's exactly what I got."},{"rating":"1","title":"get fed at CNN","review":"see the world through the lens of Anderson Cooper. never pursue the truth, because it hurts. the world hates us for a good reason I guess. on the other hand, (from a business stand point) good job Cooper. you managed to capitalize on Americans' fears and phobias, who are being fed their knowledge through the THE MOST TRUSTED NAME IN NEWS..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save Your Money","review":"Another guilt-infused liberal who bleeds all over the place while lining his pockets with money. He's probably working on the sequel right now. Let's hope for more natural disasters and wars to Andy can keep telling us how he feels so much more than us mortals."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dispatches from the edge","review":"A great read, Wasn't really a big fan of Anderson Cooper before this, but I read the whole book in one sitting, really interesting, easy to follow and not hard work at all.A great book, for an interesting insight into a very interesting man"},{"rating":"1","title":"Dispatches from the Edge","review":"I sympathized with him on the book. I felt that there was too much alternating from one country to the next to then a family rememberance. I did not think the book was written well. While reading the book, yes you want to go to the next chapter, but then towards the last 45 pages it is like well we pretty much know all about all of that, (those of us that follow the news) and it is not a surprise. I truly felt that he had to present this book to the public in order to tell his story and heal. There is nothing wrong with this, however, it was very emotional & intimate & confusion more than I ever expected."},{"rating":"1","title":"Although a fan of Cooper, can't recommend this book","review":"Save your money and read the excerpt in Vanity F. magazine. I really wanted to like this book as I am a fan of Mr. Cooper's style of reporting. In this book he reports on various wars he happened to be front and center. They seem to run in to each other and as hard as I tried to be engaged in the stories I found the writing style too clinical. Mr. Cooper does not discuss his personal life only the effects of his father's death and his brother's suicide. He tries, unsuccessfully to intergrate those deaths into the stories of death that war causes. If one is going to write a biography one should discuss one's life and address some of the questions circulating (i.e his homosexuality). Hopefully, Mr. Cooper will one day write a serious autobiography. This isn't it. The excerpt in Vanity F. sums up the book and is all you really need."},{"rating":"1","title":"The elephant in the room...","review":"Anderson Cooper manages to talk about everything else in this book EXCEPT the pink elephant in the room he refuses to acknowledge.The constant bleating of \\"Oh, I'm too busy to have a personal life\\" in this book starts getting tiresome and transparent. The personal IS political! No man is an island, Andy!Sorry, but I like to get my news from someone authentic. Rachel Maddow does it every day...so can you, Mr. Cooper!Also, does anyone else find the Cover Picture offensive? There is a starving/crippled (?) black person struggling in the background...and Anderson is turning his back on them...smouldering towards the camera giving us his best \\"Blue Steel\\" pout!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't quit your day job Mr. Cooper","review":"I made it to about page 60 before I couldn't go on anymore. This book is poorly written, has no continuity and really amounted to nothing more then the author rambling on in an incoherent fashion. I found it was all over the place. By reading up to page 60, the most I walk away form this book is knowing Mr. Cooper's father died on Jan 5 1978. I found he was all over the place - and the book is broken down into 1 page sections. One page he's talking about new year's eve, next page - the tsunami, next page - his father, next page - sri lanka, next page - his father, next page - his brother... I just found zero substance and little to gain from this book. I really think he tried too hard at playing his hand at this one. Mr. Cooper - don't quit your day job, authoring isn't for you. Please continue pushing your agenda in your \\"unbiased\\" media reporting."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dispatches dull and boring","review":"As much as I like Anderson Cooper as a correspondent, his book was quite difficult to plod through - dull and boring."},{"rating":"2","title":"An excellent, quick read","review":"I found Cooper's book captivating. Interspersed with each of his stories from places most of us will never see (many of us would truthfully have no desire to see), Cooper lays down his often painful, numbing experiences getting in touch with events that occurred while he was growing up. His father's death, his brother's suicide and its associated impact on his clearly dangerous adventures. This IS a must read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Should be required reading...","review":"I just finished reading Anderson Cooper's Dispatches from the Edge and was very impressed with both his ability and compassion. As Americans, we forget or ignore how the rest of the world lives. He takes us to places that expose us to the realities of life in remote places with names we can't pronounce and gives us an \\"in your face\\" look at war, starvation, destruction and both human misery and human valor!My hat is off to this man of conscience who as a child of privledge could have lived like a CEO, instead he chose to seek both truth and adventure and live a life of worth.The world needs more journalists of this nature and fewer who chase the rich and famous...Thank you, Anderson Cooper!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Not for the light-hearted.","review":"The writing is beautiful, words incredibly soulful. Every page has so much sadness set on them, and I found myself crying every now and then thinking back to my own father's questionable death."},{"rating":"2","title":"Anderson Cooper Dispatches","review":"If you really want to know Anderson Cooper he shares all in this book. He opens his heart and soul. The places you saw on CNN are made more human when he describes his inner feelings during his visits. The beginning of his life and career are amazing. A must read for anyone who watches his reports."},{"rating":"2","title":"Graphic, raw, and simply wonderful","review":"Anderson Cooper has a gift for getting to the heart of a story and treating his interview subjects with compassion and respect; this book gives the reader an idea of how he has become one of the finest journalists of our generation and why he continues doing what he does in some of the most dangerous spots in the world. In one of the best memoirs I've ever read, Anderson Cooper expertly intertwines his personal life experiences, including the premature death of his father and the suicide of his brother, with his work assignments in war-torn and disaster-stricken locations such as Somalia, Iraq, and New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina. The reader gets the feeling that Cooper is exploring some of these feelings for the first time or just beginning to touch the surface, which makes the book all the more compelling. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"yawwwn...","review":"man, i was really disappointed, there was hardly anything classic about this cd, besides some of the originals trying to release \\"new material\\"... the music was mediocre at best, the only thing cool was Mr. Armando Gallop's (RIP) voice overs, high-lighting through the history of the Chi-Town scene, but other than that...."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible nausea","review":"I had terrible nausea each time I took this product. Bad enough that I couldn't really function until it went away. I took it with food, tried even just one pill from the daily pack of 3 pills. No luck. I also burped a bad taste with it regularly. It just didn't feel good to me.I stopped after probably a week's worth and gave it to a relative, who also stopped taking them before the container was finished but I didn't ask why.I have no opinion on the quality as it's hard to tell with a pill...I just know the nausea made it not worth it for me.

Yes, it is unusually depressing but for heaven's sake, does that a book make??And, I don't understand the strange title. Because she has finally said nah-nah to her old boyfriend, she is now comfortable with herself and her place in the world? Sheesh. Settle this stuff within yourself, don't drag old boyfriends into the therapy.I found the writing as difficult as the title.

Maybe she should try to write non-fiction or perhaps take up another type of work. Her writing style if centered about herself totally, the book comes off as vindictive and vengeful. When does she plan to own up to her own predicaments?

Phony and pathetic and aimed at the wallets of women who are sad and lonely and phony and pathetic, too.I couldn't read the whole thing. After a couple of boring chapters I read here and there and when I got to the staged ending I went back to see what took our heroine there. I figured I wouldn't find that information in the book though. She made that trip to Salinger's not for her own sense of peace, but to have something to SELL in the book. Transparent. But that's Joyce Maynard.I did not like this book. Not worth the money, certainly not worth the time."},{"rating":"2","title":"UTTERLY EXHAUSTED","review":"I just finished this book and I am utterly exhausted. It seems to me it should be subtitled \\"Everything You Ever Wanted to Know About Joyce Maynard--Everything, and Then Some\\". She's a great observer of life, and a very good writer. Why she wasted so much of her life thinking about and longing for Salinger, an author known to be weird and self-centered and paranoid, is anybody's guess. She certainly didn't need his praise; she received that in spades from her parents.

JM can quote conversations verbatim that took place 25 years ago. She claims to be victimized by her parents, husband, and JDS. She can't let go of the affair with Salinger. She is furious that he dumped her. She never admits some of these problems are HER fault for the choices and actions SHE made. She confronts the 78 yr old JDS 25 years later and asks: \\"What was my purpose in your life?\\" What did she expect as an answer? JM needs some serious counselling to get over all this anger and move on. Her attempt to \\"expose\\" JDS backfires on her. It shows her as a hysterical, neurotic, complaining \\"poor victim\\". Not worth reading."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fascinating and well written","review":"All the Salinger fans who are howling at Joyce for violating his privacy need to get a life. This book is for anyone who succumbed to the charms of an older, sophisticated man who should have known better than to toy with the emotions of a young girl that, I am sure, he never had any interest in growing old with. I do not mean this as a slam on Joyce - she strikes me as a person that a man would be lucky to grow old with. The best part of the book is Salinger's curse on her \\"you love the world.\\" Reminded me so much of my brother in law, who hates the world. What a narrow and bitter life he and JD must lead!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Open Honest Look at Exploited Youth","review":"After listening to Ms. Maynard recount her life as a young impressionable and somewhat naive teen, her first encounter with J.D. Salinger, and later relationship with the demented and bizarre recluse, and the unfolding of her life after the great writer of Catcher in the Rye so coldly abandoned her without explanation or cause, I felt moved beyond words. I have seen and heard reviews mixed as to whether she should expose J.D. as she has done here (so clearly). Many say he deserves his privacy. I say, Joyce Maynard deserves her freedom to tell the story that affected every aspect of her life for nearly twenty-five years. This book which is read by Joyce Maynard, had me reflecting on my own life, first marriage and relationships. I say \\"Bravo\\" Joyce for finally facing the demons, and looking them straight in the eye! I want to hear from you again in twenty five years from now to hear how it all turns out for you!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Enjoyable read of trials and joys of a young writer.","review":"Joyce Maynard's AT HOME IN THE WORLD :A MEMOIR is an enjoyable and poignant story about a young writer who is both lonely and talented. It is also a fascinating story of a mother who is very enemshed in her daughter's life and what the daughter did to find herself. Joyce through her writing and waifish demeanor becomes a focal point of control and seduction for one of the most recluse writer's of our day, J.D. Salinger. Their relationship and subsequent breakup is the most riveting part of the book. The balance of the story seems to be falling action. I read it in one sitting and was caught up in her story. Perhaps you will be too. I could not help but feel sad at the lonely girl who was abandoned by responsibile adults as they were overtaken by celebrity. How she found her way to a fufilling life is incredible and worthy of your time. ."},{"rating":"2","title":"An excellent read by a great author","review":"This book was very intriguing. Learning about Joyce's life growing up was interesting enough. But to be drawn into her strange relationship with the famous J. D. Salinger was extremely captivating. Their quirky life over the course of a year or so was detailed beautifully by Miss Maynard. The book is witty at times, sad at others and overall triumphant. This would be a good read for women of all ages. I imagine many men enjoy her writing style as well. A \\"must read\\" for anyone that enjoys autobiographies or any of Joyce's other titles."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointing","review":"Perhaps my expectations of this book were too high, but with all the experiences in her life that she had to portray, Joyce Maynard comes up woefully short in holding the reader's interest. Her early passion for J.D. Salinger becomes a seething hatred, with the acclaimed author seeming no more than a curmudgeonly near-pedophile. And, for all the exorcising of her demons and the details of her private life she attempts to share in this book, she is surprisingly light on revelations. I wanted so much more, but found that she used pages to go out of her way not to tell more. It's frustrating, and an ultimately boring read. I was very disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"really?","review":"Seldom has the pretense of honesty been used so dishonestly.

So she rolled out the big guns and scrapped together recollections of an ages-old and very brief pedophilic relationship with J.D. Salinger.

It's such a remarkable page-turner that I wanted to yell, \\"Encore!\\" Maynard's brilliant writing style and tremendous gift for detail transfixed me as I discovered she was only 18 years old when she published her first article in a prestigious New York magazine. Raised by a kooky, critical mother and a drunken father, she soon became J.D. Salinger's oh-too-young pet and mistress. Not only did I gain insight into Salinger's clever and controlling mind, I reveled in Maynard's maturity and ability to eventually cope with, and be in, the world."},{"rating":"2","title":"entertaining, well written","review":"Joyce Maynard was one of few women gifted with both talent and opportunity. I ached inside as I watched her set aside her own dreams and aspirations for the needs of others. I wanted to blame J.D. Salinger. I wanted to blame Joyces first husband for being so cold and unavailable. I was hoping for an ending that would allow Joyce to discover her role as a participant, rather than a victim of her circumstances. The book seemed rather unfinished as the reader is left feeling she understands more about the writer than she understands about herself. Joyces memory for detail is phenomenal. I felt as though I was watching a video of her life rather than reading a book. I found this book to say much about myself and my generation of women in general, particularly in the way we often barter our dignity and self esteem for the security of a relationship.Helen Temple"},{"rating":"1","title":"One BAD Birthday Gift..................................","review":"A well-meaning (presumably) friend presented this book to me on my birthday. Why, I am not entirely certain, except that the author and I are of the same general age, and I do like autobiographies and nonfiction, as a rule.BUT....... This was one dreadful read. I confess to not having made it through the entire book, but I gave it my best try. I swear I did. In my opinion, Ms. Maynard's writing style is annoying as all get out: flat, uninteresting, one-dimensional. It is hard to believe she makes her living as a writer, although in all honesty, I haven't read anything else she has written.This seems to be a book written as a vendetta of some kind. Mainly against Salinger, but also against everyone else who has also \\"wronged\\" Ms. Maynard (and there are MANY!).

One, the acknowledgment of \\"family secrets\\" re: Ms. Maynard's alcoholic father and \\"incestous\\" mother. Also, Joyce's look into relationships - mainly the one with J.D. Salinger. Perhaps the public is at first interested in her memoir because she tells all re: her affair with the writer. But ultimately, he could have been any person in a position of power for us to witness the abuse of power in relationships. Maynard's book also shows her perseverence in the face of adversity. Her success, both in her career and according the the story her children's success (they seemed unscathed, though we would need to hear from them to know their reality) is a good example of how even with the darkness of life bearing forth, one can still prevail. I do believe her life is worth reading about. She may not be a major hero, but does it matter. She's a woman with her own story. And that's enough."},{"rating":"1","title":"skim it at the bookstore for a snarly laugh at the author","review":"I felt dirty and soiled by skimming it, but was comforted by the thought that I was in no way giving this loon any royalty money.

Note that it shows changes in steps of 0.5 psi.A handy item to keep in your car or garage, slightly easier to use and a bit more consistent than the mechanical \\"extending tube\\" type of gauge."},{"rating":"1","title":"Short Lived","review":"My Accutire model MS-4350B tire gauge lived a fairly short life. Purchased in March, 2010 - and used only twice - it was found in a comatose state in early 2012. Attempts at resuscitation proved fruitless and the corpse was laid to rest in a dumpster in my building's garage. Given the 5-year warranty, we considered returning the unit to it's place of birth in Parsippany, New Jersey but the cost of shipping in exchange for a sibling / replacement could not be justified. Even a 50-year or 500-year warranty would not have changed this heart-wrenching decision. MS4350B ... we hardly knew ye. RIP."},{"rating":"1","title":"Total Junk","review":"Like others have said, poor seal, needs O-ring.But that doesn't matter if the product never works.I bought 2 of these, the first stopped working in a few weeks, the second after about 9 months.Since there's no contact info on the website or in the instructions, the warranty is worthless.This is odd because the other Accutire gauge I had (the original aluminum-cased digital model) worked for 10+ years and I only chucked it because the sealing system was getting munched and I couldn't see any easy way of replacing it. I assumed the company would still be producing a reliable and well-built product but I guess not.At this point it's back to mechanical for me, I suspect things are so cheaply built in this digital era that my experience is going to be the norm."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not pleased at all","review":"This gauge does not withstand cold weather very well.

Seems to be consistently incorrect if that helps. I would avoid this product.Good luck...."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very short life.","review":"I bought it for emergency use and did not use much. But it was not working after 10 months once I pulled it out for use."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"Monkey-Grip\\" version","review":"I have one of these and it's nearly identical to the pictures except that it says \\"Monkey-Grip\\" on the the handle instead of \\"Accutire\\". As another reviewer noted it does not work when it is cold. If it's below freezing you need to warm it up first. With the variation that I have the problem isn't that the seal is too loose - it's that the opening for the valve stem is too tight. I have a new Subaru with the tire pressure monitoring system and there is one tire out of the 4 that I cannot take a reading on because I can't get the gauge to slip over the valve stem. On the others it works but just barely."},{"rating":"1","title":"Watch out: defective Accutire MS-4350B digital tire gauge","review":"Well, I should have read ALL the reviews before ordering this slug. Right out of the box--defective: the LED light wouldn't light up--just as noted by some other reviewers who gave it only 1 star. I was going to have Amazon send me another one in replacement. But i decided to first read ALL the reviews that gave it 1 star. I quickly changed my mind about ordering another one of these slugs--notice all the people that ended up sending it back because it doesn't properly fit the tire valve & lets lots of air out of the tire. In the future, when i'm considering a purchase, I'll first read all the low ratings! Sure glad I ordered it through Amazon: returns are fast and easy--they even quickly refund the cost of shipping it back!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Worked great until . . .","review":"Had the unit for about six months, worked great for a while. When it came time to replaced the old batteries, that was the end of the line for this unit. Now it reads between 14 to 24 pounds higher than what it should read. Think I'll stick to manual gauges for this purpose."},{"rating":"1","title":"Accurate, but does NOT seal properly to valve stem","review":"Like many of the other reviews I've read, this tire gauge does not seal properly to the tire's valve stem. And I've tried this gauge on 3-4 different cars. If you don't fit it exactly (and I MEAN EXACTLY) centered on the valve stem, you lose a few PSI just trying to insert the gauge. So if you miss the stem a couple of times, you lose 5 PSI right off the bat. And this happens to me 9 times out of 10 (keep in mind that I'm not a clumsy person).Back-lit LCD screen is nice when using at night. It also stores your car's factory-recommended tire pressure, but that's not difficult for me to remember. The gauge does seem accurate though, so there's no problem there. But it just has a flawed design. Go with theAccutire MS-4021B. Not perfect, but a lot easier to align with your tire's valve stem."},{"rating":"1","title":"I should have returned it","review":"This doesn't fit well in my valve stem. I think i've got this for like a year? and so far i've only got a reading from this like twice? Absolutely useless."},{"rating":"1","title":"Grossly Inaccurate","review":"Bought this item several months ago and have not had an opportunity to use it until a couple of days ago. The reading is grossly inaccurate - roughly 20 psi less than the true tire pressure. Never worked correctly defective out of the box. Would like to return it but hardly worth the effort since at this point I will get a partial refund and will have to pay shipping. I wish I had tried it as soon as I got it so I could have gotten a full refund. With all the other complaints why does Amazon continue to sell this product. I wish I had read the reviews before buying this product, but who would have thought something as simple as a tire air guage could be problemmatic?"},{"rating":"1","title":"I should have listened","review":"The progammable features are nice, but I should have listened to the other reviews. Those folks that said this gauge doesn't make a good seal with the tire were right on the money. The first time I tried it I let at least 5-6 psi out of the tire. After playing with it for about 20min, I still could only get a good seal after letting about 2-3 seconds of air out of the tire. This thing stinks and I would not recommend it to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"not very easy to use","review":"i tried out this digital tire gauge and did like it at all. the nozzle doesnt cover the tire stem very well and as a result a lot of air leaks out while you are trying to read the tire pressure."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not recommend","review":"the blue screen is cool, that's it the stem does not properly sit causing air to leak, I do not recommend at all."},{"rating":"2","title":"works great!","review":"I read a lot of reviews saying that it needs a gasket, but I received it today and it works without issue as-is, straight out of the box. It does exactly what it's supposed to do, and it works great. BUY IT. Don't even give it a second thought. You won't regret it one bit."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great gauge, good feel, easy to use","review":"I purchased this because I was tired of using those 'stick-style' pressure gauges, I never felt those gave an accurate reading since over time it seems that it became easier for those sticks to shoot out.In any case, this is a good gauge. It's got a good ergonomic feel which may or may not be important to you since you're generally not using it that long anyways. Clear digital display and a mini light. You can also program the gauge to set a target pressure for your front and rear tires which is a nice feature. The packaging claims that the battery is lifetime, I somehow doubt this, but it appears there is a screw on the backside that should give you access to the battery. I've never had to replace it yet anyways. Overall, a very good digital gauge for measuring your tire pressure."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice light weight gauge","review":"I just recieved this gauge a couple of days ago and it seems to be a very good product. It looks as if changes have been made by the manufacturer to make this gauge more productive. It has easy instructions on the settings and is very easy to handle when checking air pressures. I like it and highly recommend this small light weight gauge to anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun and Moody Little Gadget","review":"Got it just for giggles cause I love gadgets. Its... Moody to say the least, as in sometimes it can be way off (readings of 10 psi above or below what it really is), but most of the time its spot on.I still keep one of the pen style manual ones in my glovebox just as a backup, but this has proven to be useful enough when I need it.The O-Ring issue that you see other reviews complaining about must have been fixed by now, because mine has no issue sealing against the tire stem.The memory feature is nice for easily recalling the correct pressures for your tires (it remembers two numbers, front and rear)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Almost Perfect","review":"It is a great guage but it is missing the o ring which would have given it 5 stars. maybe they have another model that has it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good enough for the price","review":"I bought 2 of these, one for my father and one for me and both work good. I was concerned about old reviews of this tire gauge but it seems to me that Accutire solved the problem.

Again it worked as advertised. I'm absolutely positive I turned it off. Tried to use it yesterday. Batteries dead. I'm estimating it has been turned on a total of 45 minutes. I believe that turning it \\"off\\" does not entirely do so. The batteries are probably always maintaining internal settings and thus always draining. Not worth the money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Measured a Half-Dozen Times Then Stopped Working","review":"Used just a few times over a one-year period. Kept in glove box and never dropped or mistreated. Took out last week and the display would not come on. Never gets below 40 deg F here so not a cold issue.

As one reviewer said, I purchased the 5/16 X 3/16 X 1/16 o-ring, had to glue it in, and then tried my tires again. What a BIG difference! It was a piece of cake. Quick, easy, and accurate readings.

What's worse is that when it beeps (to tell you that you have a good reading) if you don't immediately remove it, I mean a flash fast muscle twitch reaction, it resets itself and erases the reading it just took.Since I was wrestling with making the connection, my hands, the gauge and the air stem were in constant motion. I had no way to remove the gauge right at the precise beep moment.Since it costs 75 cents for 3 mins of air at most gas stations around here, I spent $1.50 just to top off the the inflation levels...and I wanted a hammer to beat the gauge into the asphalt.I've thrown it away.P.S. Some have mentioned O rings and the \\"new\\" version but I bought mine in October '08. It was anything but new and improved.

He also conveys how the spiritual lessons evolve as we progress in our capacity to access insight."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for all the kids!","review":"I'm not a fan of this stuff but I haven't met a kid that doesn't love it and I'm a teacher!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent humidifier, impossible to reach customer service.","review":"This humidifier is more than enough for my humble 1300 sq. ft. townhouse rental--we keep it at the \\"two water drops\\" setting and the fan on low and I still get ice on my crappy windows. I've started turning the humidistat down on colder days, and that seems to have helped the ice buildup.Unfortunately, due to my own clumsiness, I broke the threaded rim of one of the water tanks. While it still holds water, it does leak slowly and despite my many attempts to contact Honeywell (at several different contact numbers and email addresses) to purchase a replacement, I still haven't received a response. Great humidifier, but don't count on any product support."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not so good","review":"The unit is noisy no matter where you place it. The output that it is rated for (9 gallon) does not even approach that.

I t is hard pressed to raise the humidity above 35% and stays aound 25 % mostly.The filter does not absorb water from the well and have to flip filter a couple times a day to keep any moisture in it.Overall Honeywel (who used to sell great products) sold me a bummerTwo stars tops but probably should be one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not much humidity","review":"1.)

This one so far has operated very well. Been using about the past month or so and love the large tanks. Is a little loud but guess it has to make some noise. I would have rated 5 but since relatively new still not sure about the overall durability. Plus it blows cool air... would have loved a warm air setting which I thought it had but my mistake I'm sure. Makes the room very cool so on a cold night pretty chilly.

Long enough for the return window to expire. They do NOT provide warranty support. They don't even seem to pick up the phones.

If you have a humidity monitor at home, you will find that the Crane Penguin unit is really deceiving and does nothing more than a good-looking toy.

We hoped that this would be the one. Unfortunately not. It does get the humidity up, but the only way to keep it there is to have it running on high. That is just too loud for us. It drowns out anything. We were trying to get around this by getting the humidity up and then turning the fan to low while we slept. The low fan setting is not bad, but wouldn't want it any louder.That worked OK, but not ideal. Then when I turned it on today it smelled like a wet sweatsock.

At least for the larger family room and the kitchen and this surely does the job. It's not very loud at all on the medium setting and that's all it takes to keep the house where we want it. It also greatly reduces the amount of static electricity so we are not always shocking each other. Great product!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"It kinda sucks","review":"What can I say.... Im not impressed. I own two of these things now in a space 1/4 of the size of what the box says it should humidify and its still bone dry. These are rated for 9 gallons a day yet they hold only two gallons at a time. That leads me to believe that on maximum I should have to fill up the humidifier at least 4 times a day. Instead on maximum I fill the humidifier once every two and a half days. So no they do not push 9 gallons of water into the air daily. They push 1 gallon. Did I get a faulty unit? Well since I have two of them and they both act the same way Im gonna have to say they just suck. Id return them in an instant but the boxes were mistakenly tossed out. Buyer be warned these are not high output humidifiers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bigger and Better Than Expected","review":"The first thing I realized when I received this humidifier is that is huge. I guess that's my fault for not noticing that it's on castors in the picture. So, rather than sitting on my dresser in the bedroom, it sits on the floor. That being said, it does an amazing job. It is about as noisy as a machine a third of the size. It also has an auto shut-off feature which means you won't be over saturating the air with water and can really fine tune the atmosphere to your liking. It has two water tanks, which means it can run while you fill one up. Even with the camel-like water capacity, I still need to fill it about once every two-to-three days."},{"rating":"1","title":"Broken!","review":"Our humidifier arrived with a broken water canister.

I mean you need water to humidify dont you?3) We start feeling the change hours after using it - you can feel the change in the atmosphere, I did not buy any gauge or something like that to notice the change in humidity level but we are quite confident that it brought change (there were some body reaction my gf was getting because of less humidity which started healing days after we started using it)It is little expensive but I thI personally think ink it is really worth if you have big apartment (it says it covers 2000 sq feet) ours is much lesser but we are planning to move to big apt soon so I thought i better get this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"good price","review":"good price for this product.

This wouldn't be necessary IF there was a pump that pumped water from the tank to the TOP of the filter.2. The CONSENSUS of reviewers was UNFAVORABLE in terms of CUSTOMER SERVICE & PARTS3.

Keeping humidity level at 45-48 on fan low setting and humidity control in center. I am using city water and I think I can get 2 months out of filter with proper care. This is going to depend on the quality of your water. Every time I refill i flip filter over and pour glass of water over it to keep it moist which prevents it from getting crusty. Filters are kind of expensive. Any advice on cheaper alternatives appreciated. I would buy this unit again. On anything except low fan setting can be loud.UPDATE AFTER OVER YEAR OF USE:After a year of use unit still works good. I go through 2 filters a season. Filters are expensive.

Good price, works like it should, I wihs it had a digital humidity gauge or they made one with it, that would be very helpful, the dial works fine but you do need to use a gauge it seems like its not as accurate since I can have it on the same setting to turn off and the humidity will be different depending on the day , time or weather outside/inside temps, but over all I can't complain, just wish it was a little more accure so I didn't have to pay attention so much"},{"rating":"2","title":"Does the job, but capacity is limited.","review":"Have to refill it about two times a day during the winter months.

The tanks are huge so if you don't have a large kitchen sink with a goose neck faucet it will be difficult to fill them and fill them you will - often.

I gave it 4 stars rather than 5 because of two, relatively minor, gripes:1. The run time on the highest settings is less than 24 hours. To my mind, one of the conveniences I look for in a humidifier is having water tanks that are sufficiently large to avoid daily filling. For a unit this big, the tanks don't hold enough to last a full day on the max settings.2. The following complaint is, I admit, so small I'm almost embarrassed to list it: The handle on the top of each water tank makes it impossible to walk away from the tank while it's in the sink filling with tap water. If you don't stand there and manually hold it upright, the tank will simply fall over. It's not a reason to avoid this product, but it would have been a nice feature."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lots of output but not as quiet as I expected","review":"We have a 2,400 sq ft home, this unit will do the job but you would not want it next to you in a living room or bedroom.

Even at the lowest setting it can interfere with TV watching. However it is very effective, and if you can put it another room, or like white noise while you sleep, it is a great product. Refilling is a bit of a challenge since the containers have rounded tops and won't sit in stable position, but having two keeps it from getting too heavy. I was refilling 3 times a day till humidy got to about 40 after a week.. then was down to 1.5 times to maintain it.. My condo is about 1500 square feet, so if you are bigger, might be refilling it even more."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hate it","review":"Why? It seems to work sporadically.

Evidently, my townhouse is too 'loose' for the furnace unit to keep up with MN winters. It h as been working great. I used another reviewer's idea about turning over the filter (I do it every 2-3 fills) and that is keeping the hardening and discoloration down, extending the filter life. the tanks take a perfect set in the bottom of my kitchen sink, so I don't have to hold on to them while they fill. In 0-10 degree weather, I fill one of the 2 tanks daily. This is with the unit set to maintain a 38-40% humidity, according to my (separate) hygrometer. This is all done running on the low fan speed setting, which is not noisy or intrusive.

Perhaps, if there had not been wheels on the base part of the humidifier,it would have been stabilized, but I was not about to start messing with that part. In the end we bought one from Sears and have been very happy with it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too fragile","review":"While it really does humidify the room, one of the water tanks cracked after I'd only had it three days, the plastic so fragile that it broke as I lifted it out of the bathtub where I'd filled it.

He apologized for the expense but said that there is no way around this. We had no idea that this was going to be an ongoing expense like this when we bought this model. I suggested that he put this information on the box so that a person buying this model will understand the ongoing expense associated with using it.

The bearings in the motor failed after 15 months, consistent with reviews posted on Amazon and throughout the internet.In doing my research, the HCM6009 had a 5 year warranty and was a Proudly Made in USA product. The owners manuals found online from a few years back confirm this.Not any more.The new HCM6009 -- just like my kaputz HCM300T -- has been quietly outsourced to China. Even worse, Kaz quietly reduced the warranty from 5 years to 3 years. And Kaz now charges US$10 or CAD$15.50 (in Canada) for warranty service, not to mention the shipping costs you incur for sending it back to their return center.Again, the Kaz/Honeywell products of recent times have gone downhill in the quality and warranty department.

I expected closer, since it was ending. Wrong-o. It ends as there is going to be another season. Not one question was answered, you have no idea what happens with the characters.

Both of those shows were cancelled. Although I did watch and enjoy Sons of Tucson, I watched FlashForward religiously. I would make time on Thursdays to watch the new episodes. The show was like a puzzle with all of the pieces coming together at the end of the series, and that was a really great way to keep people coming back.

How they interpreted their flash forwards and how that affected their decisions going forward. There's lots of surprises and action in this series, but it also makes you think. Really enjoyed this one and am pretty surprised that it didn't make it to season 2.

These are \\"Dinosaurus\\" in 1960, and \\"Over the Edge\\" in 1979. It is too bad because she is a superb actor.The timeline is a bit weird. The movie trailer states that, the dinosaurs were quick frozen 70 million years ago, while the chapters in the movie believe that these Jurassic animals were frozen 1 million years ago. This includes a Neanderthal warrior who was frozen along side the dinosaurs.Even with its time line inconsistencies, this is a fun movie for all.

If you want to buy it to replace using AA batteries, it's great, but don't buy it to charge MS Rechargeable battery packs.Also to confirm, Nyko customer service doesn't have a clue, I called and emailed multiple times, asked \\"will this charge a MS battery pack?

You plug-in the charge station and the lights blink green for a moment and then go out. Plug them into the controller and they don't work.Why don't they work?As one reviewer noted, the batteries have a clear-plastic sticky-strip over the terminal leads on the back of the battery. They were nearly impossible to see unless you know they're there. Remove the strip and they work perfectly.So why does the company need to get a clue?Nearly all of the product returns could have been avoided if they spent the extra $.001 and printed \\"REMOVE BEFORE USE\\" on the clear plastic strip."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stick with the genuine Microsoft charger...","review":"The Nyko batteries are larger than the standard Microsoft Xbox 360 Controller batteries. They need to be forced into the Xbox controllers or into the Microsoft Quick Charge Kit. Since the batteries are larger, they don't always make contact with the charging units/controllers. This is probably the problem that other people have experienced when they claim the Nyko batteries are defective.If you don't mind using some force to jam these batteries into your controller, then maybe this product is for you. Just keep in mind you get what you pay for. The Xbox 360 Quick Charge Kit is just a far superior product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buy the MS product instead.","review":"I know this product is about $8 cheaper, plus the cost of a 2nd battery, but I wouldn't recommend it. It started with the annoying packaging from the start, where you must remove the plastic sheath in order to charge the battery and went downhill quickly. I had 1 of the batteries in my controller and the controller stopped working properly about a day after I started using it... the controller would stop responding in the middle of a game or would respond in a haphazard manner (trying to move left would move forward instead, etc.) I returned the item to Toys R US and got the MS quick charger instead and have had no problems."},{"rating":"1","title":"Please do not buy!","review":"I have had the same problems with this product as the other reviewers.

Hope this helps."},{"rating":"1","title":"cheap for a reason","review":"This kit is pretty easy to sum up:-Cheaper than the Microsoft model-Not nearly as high quality-The battery life is about as long as the Microsoft brand ones (not nearly long enough, in other words)-The battery packs are microscopically larger than the originals, meaning they barely fit the controller-The charge dock doesn't charge the Microsoft brand packs (this one really irritates me)Now you know what I wish I knew before I bought it. Thankfully there are now about a hundred different charging options besides this one.Update: one of the battery packs now refuses to hold a charge, even though I have used them as much as the Microsoft ones. So, one star it is then; buy the Microsoft brand instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not bad, could be worse.","review":"I've had this for about 2 years now and it has worked well, the batteries will not fully charge any more, but they still last around 4-5 hours and I tend to only use them when my Microsoft ones are charging or being used by others. The good thing is though I contacted Nyko and told them about it not fully charging and even though they are two years old, they told me if I ship it to them they would replace them, so I would say if you just want something cheep until you get the Microsoft ones then go for it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beware!","review":"Bought this recently to use on my brand new Arcade bundle.

I probably won't be reading the rest of the books in this series any time soon."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yoder really does need to take a hike.","review":"I usually enjoy reading about quirky characters but Yoder is more of a quack instead. She pretends to be off beat when in reality she is actually off base. It would be nice indeed if Tamar Myers stops writing about Yoder and did somthing else altoghether.

I am not going to be in any hurry to read any of the others."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where's the \\"mystery\\"?","review":"This was my first encounter with this author, and sadly, will very likely be my last. I could not stay with the plot, nor could the author. It was hard to decide whether this was to be a comedy (although the humor often escaped me), historical (lots of \\"facts\\" regarding the Mennonite and Amish way of life) or a genuine mystery. I agree with previous posters...the \\"vailed\\" innuendos with regard to her pet kitten just don't come across the way I believe they have been intended.Fortunately, there are some very good mystery writers available to keep me reading for years to come. I really don't like to be so critical, but I was really turned off by this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hysterical stabs at humor.","review":"The plot was scarcely credible considering the main character, portrayed as unworldly and simple to the point of stupidity, actually solved a mystery. The hysterical stabs at humor, an aberration - decadence disguided as innocence - detracted from the whole and was offensive, especially from a writer purported to be of Amish roots, a claim evidently employed for \\"filthy lucre's sake\\" (Titus 1:11)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Time to retire Magdalena","review":"This series has been delightful, but the last few books have not measured up to the first ones. The author seems to have run out of fresh ideas for the main character, Magdalena.

She kept me in stitches with her philosophy of life and her little diatribes on the residents of Hernia. In THE CREPES OF WRATH we are treated to more insights into the Amish way of life -- this time concerning the young people -- and we learn about the new man in Magdalena's life. Myers consistently creates solid books with a satisfying mystery, splendid characters, and a lot of warm laughter."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of pulp","review":"I am an avid reader of mysteries and was thrilled to find Tamar Myers as she looks prolific. Thrilled that is until I actually read \\"Crepes of Wrath.\\" Awful! The heroine, Magdalena Yoder, is a sanctimonious bore at best with a juvenile humor at worst. Her puns are sophomoric and offensive; her 'wailing' every other page is downright irritating. ...."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"I read the Crepes of Wrath over the last weekend. I was extremely disappointed. As an avid reader of mysteries and a descendant of Pennsylvania Dutch, I looked forward to this book. I was hoping to find a new series that I would enjoy.

Out of the hundreds of movies I saw as a child this one has haunted my memory all of my life. It is one of a kind and totally unforgetable. This is a splendid film noir movie disquised as a cheap \\"B western that can be watched over and over again. The casting is the very best with Walter Brennen and Bill Elliot giving top performances.

The interpretation, choreography, sets, costumes (female is OK, male is hideous),amount of dancing, almost everything, is inferior. The Australian production DVD is not the best technical quality but given that, it shines and is a vastly better acquisition. Being a fan of POB in general I am disappointed in this purchase.

Even if the DVD were entitled, \\"Choreography by Bart, set to incidental music by Delibes\\" (as one reviewer seems to suggest, for the sake of truth in advertising), it would not be worth the money.

It has all the facets that make his genre exciting: (1) a great plot based upon actual events and people; (2) strong multi-dimensional characters; (3) just enough detail of the place and times of the events to keep it interesting for those who know nothing about the subject matter to those who know a lot; (4) the ups and downs of those seeking to increase their stations within the English court; and (5) just the right amount of court drama, deception, plots, planning and twists.Though a few parts were slightly long-winded, overall the book was very well written and I would most likely read other works by this author. I recommend it for those interested in historical fiction or in the time period a/o characters in particular."},{"rating":"2","title":"That's what I call history!","review":"As someone who slept through more history classes than I should have, I was thoroughly entertained and impressed by this author's ability to make historical complexities seem crystal clear.

This is excellent stuff!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Book","review":"I didn't know anything about the Churchill's before I read this book. They were both very ambitious people even bordering on manipulative. Sarah more so than John. John's love for Sarah was very tender and I loved seeing that! I enjoyed reading about Anne (the princess and future Queen) and Sarah. What I did not care for was reading the parts of their 'lesbian liaisons'. It left me with a sick feeling. I don't think my husband would be quite so understanding as John was - even if it was to secure my station! The politics over religion were very enlightening and educational.

I remember hearing if love should go on the radio several times and liked the song. Lonely woman's cry is the second best song on the cd. All tracks are good and have a harder edge to them than most Kansas cd's. It's not a great cd but good. It had some different stuuf on it for the time. I think it compares favorably with the Kansas cd Power but is a little harder edge rock wise flavor to it. It sounds better on a really good cd player not that it has bad sound but it brings out the good parts of the cd better than a boom box."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than Kansas","review":"I loved it when this album came out. I was playing all over the northeast in a rock band called TransAtlantique, and these songs were featured, If Love Should Go, and Move On were always fun to do.

Pay no attention to the amazon.com reviewer; he probably does not like contemporary country music. My rating is a 9.5/10. Enjoy the samples, and buy this CD!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Rascal Flatts not up to par","review":"On their second time out, Rascal Flatts once again blend their exquisite vocal harmonies with rolling pop-country hooks and high-energy beats. They seem to have matured a lot, both in vocals and lyrics, and their songs don't seem to be as bubbly on this album as on their last. A great album for the pop-country fan, Rascal Flatts will knock your socks off with their electrifying style and charming look and sound. That being said, however, Rascal Flatts' sophomore release is nowhere near as good as their debut. The first album had tons of energy, youthful exuberance, great vocals, and a full disc of excellent songs. This record seems to be missing something - their song choice is not nearly as brilliant. The lyrics and musical arrangements are lacking. Their performance of the songs, as always, is excellent...but they could have done so much better. Fans should buy this, but if you're looking for your first pop-country album, go for Rascal Flatts' debut instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"I love it!","review":"I couldn't wait until Rascal Flatts new CD came out and I was NOT disappointed!

Overall this new effort is a work in progress.The harmonies by the members of this band are really fine, but, as other reviewers have noted, there are a lot of filler songs presented among the few goodies like this CD signature song \\"I Melt\\". This has happened to other new artists as they evolve, and as Rascal Flatts are fairly fresh to the country-rock scene they have lots of room to roam in their style and to grow as songwriters.

You go guys!"},{"rating":"1","title":"How do you spell muck?","review":"It seems to me that the whole music industry is predicated on the belief that if they can put at least 1 or 2 worthwhile songs on a CD and pad it with filler they will rake in the dough. Case in point: Rascal Flatts \\"Melt\\". \\"These Days\\" was all over the radio when it was released and it was quite the ear worm...infecting itself into your brain and staying for days. Although it was overproduced in ways that only Nashville can manage, it was a servicable song and a good lead off single for this album. Unfortunately, nothing else on here even remotely lives up to that.

See the customer photos for side-by-side shots. This is the only one I don't plan to use again. It's certainly fine, but it isn't as good as theProdyne Wine Pourer. The Metrokane pourer drips whereas the Prodyne has a lip that directs drips back into the bottle itself. The Metrokane stopper is also more difficult to get into the bottle and I'm skeptical it will fit all bottles; it is not clear when it is really \\"in\\" and ready to poor whereas the Prodyne settles nicely on the bottle. We don't store bottles on their side, so I cannot say whether this stopper is better/worse than the Prodyne pourer in that respect.I'd also recommend theMetrokane Wine Sealerover this pourer. While the sealer is not a \\"pourer\\", I don't think that feature is great on this Metrokane pourer anyways.

But some of the stuff in this book is quite questionable. The pictures are practically useless as all that is shown are flicky kicks that could never harm a tough opponent and useless punches that prolly woldn't have great efeect, that is, even if they hit. The stances shown are laughable. How easy it is to get taken down in one of those stances is ludicrous and the power behind your stances will leave something to be desired. Every stance that is built for speed lacks power and every stance built for power lacks speed.

Fleming can write, and I'm sure he knows his subject. But his \\"unlikely voices\\" are indeed that, coming from obscure places and people throughout history and offering what I thought was some pretty off the wall, and consequently, unhelpful advice. If it's your cup of tea, OK, but I would not recommend this book as a great source of leadership advice."},{"rating":"1","title":"A struggle to read.","review":"Flemming's book is easy to dismiss for it's ethereal approach to modern, or more accurately post-modern, leadership. I found myself feeling angry and frustrated that he was wasting my time as I forced myself through early chapters of this book. Occasionally Flemming wrote something that coincided with my own experience and I was able to compare my own interpretation of this with his. This process was helpful as it critiqued my own ideas and allowed me to refine them. Sometimes Flemming gave voice to something I felt but was unable to articulate and I appreciated the validation this offered to my developing leadership. Finally I appreciated the focus Flemming put on people and relationships while still retaining the value of output. This initiated much reflection about what I focus on in my own leadership."},{"rating":"2","title":"Timeless Wisdom!","review":"This book is by far one of the best leadership books I've read.

Someone like Ingmar Bergman would have made it more cinematic but it is worth having because of Elizabeth Taylor and Diana Rigg. I think Elizabeth is a perfect Desiree and Rigg is ideal. Had the film been a commercial success she might have received an Oscar nomination. Several songs are cut including the chorus' comments throughout but I still find it fun.\\"A Weekend in the Country\\" is perfectly done and one wishes Hal Prince had directed the whole movie that well.

The sound is familiar yet, different. The lyrics are again well thought out, clever, and insightful. You will not be disappointed with 'A New Day at Midnight' if you enjoyed his first album."},{"rating":"2","title":"And It Continues...","review":"He has done it again. David Gray has never and will never (well, hopefully) disappoint me. A New Day At Midnight has been a long-time coming and I have to say that he exceeded my expectations. He continues to croon himself into the depths of what it REALLY means to be a singer/songwriter in a time when Pop and Hip-Hop rule the airways. It's refreshing to know that there are new artists that are able to keep the old-time feel of real music (with updated twists, of course)...and it just so happens that David Gray is a master at what he does. His lyrics are thoughtful, deep, and un-restrained and I'm sure you'll love every song on this disk. Do yourself a favor and buy it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"As usual, no complaints about a good thing.","review":"I am a new fan of David Gray, though I have heard his song for several years, January Rain caught my ear with friends the other week and I quickly purchased 3 CDs. I am not disappointed at all. His unique voice has a hint of the style in the late 70s, and with todays accents. He is an accomplished musician and can sing up a storm, with his mellow raspy voice. His songs are a delight to sit back and picture in your mind being seated next to him or playing along. Just a very down to earth style of music. I will buy more of David Gray."},{"rating":"1","title":"Alas, all good things must end","review":"I have been a David Gray fan for years, way before White Ladder came out. I have loved every single album that he's done. But this one stinks. The drum machine is overused, the lyrics are mundane, and the music is, overall, boring. I have tried to make myself like it, but all the songs start to blend together in a monotonous drone by track 7 or so, and I just can't get into it. I would have given it only one star, except that there are a couple of songs that are still interesting. Dead in the Water, for example, is solid, and reminiscent of songs off his first release, Century Ends. I don't know what happened, but I'm afraid that my favorite singer/songer might have been unwittingly describing himself in that song.Buy any album of his EXCEPT this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Incredible!","review":"I purchased this record the day it was released, still extremely elated from the music on 'White Ladder'. Although it is slightly different than the previous, 'A New Day At Midnight' is far from disappointing. The songs flow through, and just sound amazing. Each and every one owns a different feeling, and believe me when I say you will feel every emotion that you've ever experienced in your life while listening to this, or any of David's music. I've had the privilege of seeing David in Detroit a week ago, and to hear these songs live is just amazing. My favorite by far is 'Be Mine', the process of falling head over feet for someone. A couple others are 'Freedom' and 'The Other Side'. A definite must-have for any David Gray fan!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very moving release!","review":"This, and The Church 'After Everything Now This', are my 2 favorite CD's of 2002. This latest DG release is superb in every way. David wears his emotions on his sleeve on these tunes, but in a way that works. Minimalist perfection!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Incredibly Beautiful Album","review":"David Gray hit it big with the massive selling album, White Ladder, but its follow up may just be better than the blockbuster. White Ladder have some amazing melodies, but this album has more subtle melodies of its own that are equally beautiful. A New Day At Midnight contains some amazing tracks such as \\"Dead In The Water\\", \\"Real Love\\", \\"Knowhere\\", \\"Be Mine\\", and \\"The Other Side\\" that make it one of the best albums I have ever heard. Amazing effort."},{"rating":"2","title":"Is Gray. Is Good!","review":"Clearly, David Gray adheres to the adage, \\"If it aint broke, dont fix it\\". White Ladder's delicate combination of folk and electronica sold big time and it sounded pretty darn good too. \\"A new day at midnight\\" sees Gray treading the same patch of earth and from the bouncy infection of the opener \\"Dead in the water\\" Gray doesn't put a foot wrong. His simple yet oh so moving songwriting works an absolute treat. From the frisky love confessions of \\"Caroline\\" to the brooding lament \\"Meet me on the other side\\", Gray covers every facet of human emotion with good humor and admirable persistence. Ones only complaint might be that Gray could perhaps at times, rely solely on himself and his trusty guitar. Tracks such as \\"Knowhere\\" and \\"Last boat to America\\" seem just a tad constrained by studio trickery. No matter. This is a worthy follow up to a watershed record, from an artist who is consolidating his excellent repuatation on both sides of the Atlantic."},{"rating":"2","title":"David Gray: A Century Begins","review":"With the much anticipated follow-up to the hugely successful White Ladder (and his sixth album), David Gray's release of A New Day at Midnight is a monumental offering. With moody tones and eclectic sounds, Gray delivers a compilation of powerful songs that will undoubtedly define 21st Century popular music. His soulful voice and deeply reflective lyrics demonstrate talent. Beyond talent, his youthful energy and unwillingness to rest on his laurels have produced a sound to be reckoned with. Along with his song writing partner and nuclear dynamo Clune, David Gray has outdone himself. Tracks such as The Other Side and Caroline are destined to be classics. This is not White Ladder II, but an incredible contrast that propels Gray's musical vision into the next century. Grab a pint, turn it up, and see for yourself."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great CD-Purchased as a gift","review":"I purchased this CD as a gift for my wife. She loves it and plays it alot!

I've tried upgrading three times (v 5, v6, v9); each time, the program failed to perform as well as CC Plus. Tech support is useless; forum is useless. I only need a calendar program which can print out a month-at-a glance on two facing pages. I don't use pictures, or other art work in my calendars. Amazon.com might consider selling CalendarScope which works beautifully for my purposes, but does NOT do picture inserts. It can be purchased to sync with various smart phones as well. Their tech support is prompt and courteous. I debated posting this, but it took me days and days to find this program. I'd given up hope because CC Plus would no longer run inside a 64-bit machine.

This low budget movie had a couple of Oscar nominations but the dialogue and banter between the three main characters was limited and spermatic. Both had issues they were dealing with but those issues, I feel, could have been developed with detailed flashbacks before returning to the main slow paced story drifting to nowhere. The wedding rehearsal ruined any sympathy I have for the Sergeant-hero and the Captain's attitude and demeanor caused me to write him off early in the story.

I thought it was about notifying family about the loss of their loved one in a war. That's what it was supposed to be about but because of all the vulgar language and nudity, I couldn't watch it for even 30 minutes. I was so disappointed. I saw one occasion of family notification but the rest of what I saw and heard was vulgar language and nudity.

Slywotzky ends each chapter with a How to Profit? takeaway. At the end of one chapter it reads, \\"Invest the time and effort to build a customer profitability system.\\" Statements like these are vague and frustrating as he does not tell us how to do the things he recommends.

In particular \\"Muroc\\", \\"Deep Spaceship\\", and \\"Glyder\\" are songs I always have on my cell phone to listen to anytime.These songs are extremely relaxing songs which are great for meditating to, and for removing stress from one's life. They also help me sleep when I have insomnia.Unlike Serrie's earlier work, this music has a more daytime ambiance to it; I feel while \\"Planetary Chronicles\\" is great music, it's best to listen to at night. \\"Flightpath\\", on the other hand, I can listen to during the day just as easily as I can listen to it during the night.My favorite song on this album is \\"Glyder\\" which is also my number one all-time favorite song. I have been listening to this album since 1989 and the music never gets stale."},{"rating":"2","title":"Heavenly","review":"\\"Flightpath\\" is a fantastic follow up to an almost unbeatable \\"And The Stars Go With You\\". It is extremely easy to visualize yourself soaring high in the atmosphere. \\"Flightpath\\" has some of the most deeply peaceful tracks by Jonn Serrie. The only track I'm not too fond of is the opening track. It's peppy, upbeat style sounds almost like the soundtrack to a space cartoon, like the Jetsons. Otherwise the c.d. is definitely worth having in anybody's ambient music collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"Flightpath of the imagination","review":"On my preverbial list of favorite Jonn Serrie albums, I'll admit that this one doesn't rank all the way up at the top, but it's still a testament to Serrie's remarkable ability to carry the listener away. My favorite track has always been \\"Deep Starship.\\" It's full of deep, dark rumbling sounds and eerie monotonous drones, but it's all interrupted about 3 or 4 minutes in by a spooky synth melody that emerges out of the mix and dominates the song for about 2 minutes. To me, those are the best 2 minutes on the cd. The lovely \\"Muroc\\" is also notable. It's like a soundtrack to a beautiful ambient dream - like seeing angels or something. Perfect for a beautiful late afternoon when the sun's rays are slanting across from the west horizon.Flightpath is not really geared towards space. Instead, it takes you on more of a journey through the upper atmosphere. While not quite as fresh as \\"Planetary Chronicles Vol. 1\\" or \\"And the Stars Go With You,\\" it's still an enjoyable ride."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sail away on the beauty of the music...","review":"Thanks, Sam, for the heads-up about the three tracks to download.

It turns out that Sapphire included two 1x Molex to 1x PCI-E adapters in the box. However I was still determined to use this one since it pulls power from two molex separate connectors. The PCI-E connector was really tight and refused to go more than halfway in on the HD4870.

The book's uniqueness rests in that the story of the origins of securitization is told by its founders. Lew Ranieri, Larry Fink, Leland Brendsel, Dennis Cantwell, working at Saloman,First Boston, Freddie Mac and Chrysler Financial respectively, along with others, relate both the challenges they faced and the promise they sought in launching the concept. Every effort is made to identify the principles necessary to expand securitization to new products and fields domestically and internationally. Professor Leon Kendall, Kellogg GSM, Northwestern University, Editor."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great background but dated","review":"Kendalll and Fishman's book provided a wonderful historical perspective on the rise of mortgage-backed securities, including the roles played by several of the GSEs (government-sponsored entities) and the Resolution Trust Corporation, which was responsible for cleaning up the balance sheets of failed S&Ls; in the early 1980s. I would have liked to see more math, but other than that, the various lectures describe the demand for securitization, how it benefits the housing market, as well as how mortgage-backed securities were received by institutional investors.As has been noted in other reviews, you have to ignore the publication date of July 31, 2000 because most of the lectures were collected from the mid-1990s! Also, it's difficult to understand the perspective of each article, because there is no detailed biography of the contributor.Despite these caveats, the articles are very well written, and the historical perspective is quite valuable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth it","review":"Interesting concept, but difficult to keep my child level.

I feel the results of the exercises, and I got this book used so it was very cheap."},{"rating":"2","title":"Challenging Workout","review":"I think this is a good book and I really enjoy the program, but I do want to mention a couple of things. This routine is hard, especially for a beginning exerciser it would be very difficult to complete. I'm in pretty good shape and I'm struggling with Week One! The exercises do make me feel more supple and relaxed, and they definitely make me stronger without a lot of equipment.The other thing is that it takes longer to do the routines than the author states. He claims that Week One should last 20 minutes, but even at the end of the second week of Week One (like I said, it's hard!) it was still taking me over 30 minutes to complete it. By the end of the program he states that you should be doing the program six days a week for an hour, so I would schedule at least an hour and a half.There's some decent diet advice in here, and overall I'm happy with the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cardio Barre, the book","review":"This is a great book to get you motivated to start the Cardio Barre program. I have been working out for quite awhile, but I am short and would like longer looking muscles, which is what you will get when you do this workout and smart eating program consistently. It forces you to think about using your muscles, especially your core; your posture improves, you feel it in places where you never felt it before. I really like it. It is a little difficult to follow the exercises in the book; it ends up taking longer than the book suggests in the beginning. I will probably purchase the videos that accompany it as well, but you can only get them through the official site.

I think most other readers will find it likewise!

The work has an intriguing topic, that is, the history of one elite African-American family in Charleston. Unfortunately, the narrative and context are too selective and the history is thin, relying too heavily on family documents and stories. Slaves in the Family was enhanced by the personal tone; here it is distracting and feels amateurish.

It did not happen with the previous brand we had.Now, when the kettle is full, it stands firm on its heating platform. As soon as the water level reaches 1/2 or lower, the kettle gets too light to stand straight on the platform, because the clamp seems to be tight that it pushes the kettle out of the platform and the kettle tilts forward and has no contact with the clamp to continue boiling water.

Good only for emergency wash water when the water heater is down."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very unhappy","review":"This pitcher worked about 3 days and on the evening I had company and had to use it it would work.

Therefore, we had to watch it and manually shut it off when it started boiling.2. Filter is difficult to fit in.Major Issue:After a few months, SMELL OF BURNING RUBBER FROM INSIDE the kettle became the norm.

This was great and I really appreciated the automatic shut off, because my boyfriend keeps burning up our tea kettles. So I saw this one, read the reviews and decided to get it. I am so disspointed.

I do not recommend getting this model."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buyer Beware!!! Dangerous Item!!","review":"Well, I've owned this tea pot for about 6 months now. It seemed to work fine until 2 nights ago. I used it, set the pot back in its holder and walked away for the night. The next day, I noticed moisture all over the front of my new custom cabinets and in fact one of the door's laminate finish had curled up. The tea pot NEVER shut itself off which is supposed to be one of its safety features. Not only is it supposed to shut itself off after it reaches a certain temperature, it most certainly should have after its use. I am grateful that our home did not burn down with us in it but would not want this to happen to others'. Ours was promptly thrown away!! There's a reason the price is too good to be true. Also, it was very bulky and the heating elements are on the inside."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Trust This Pot 's Auto Shut off!!!","review":"This pot was wonderful for three days. boiled the water and shut off. Excellent. I used it a lot. The fourth day; i turned it on and went to brush my teeth while i waited for it.it didn't shut off.in that small amount of time it had boiled nearly all 1.75 quarts of water into steam which condensed under, on, inside of and on top of my kitchen cabinet and counter. The steam condensation ruined my cabinet in that short span of time. that $20 pot that i now can't use will end up costing me at least $350 plus labor...Made a wonderful steam room - so if that's what you're looking for buy it.If not and you still decide to purchase it - DO NOT TRUST THE AUTO SHUT OFF AND WALK AWAY FROM IT ...I'll be going back to the microwave which i can trust to shut off) for one cup heating or my whistling pot for two cups plus.

Loved that it was a large capacity kettle and cordless, set it up but as soon as I filled it and sat it on it's cradle stand it didn't sit flush on the base and wobbled from left to right in it's cradle. Hence it wouldn't switch on as wouldn't connect. Geeez. I cleverly cut a small piece of cardboard out which I put in the cradle base to help it level it and it worked but it often goes on and off and often never boils fully. I am so mad, it was a bargain at $20 but it's such a hassle and cost to return, isn't it?Will most probably have to go back to tried and tested Krups which I have used prior but they are 3 x times cost.

Too soon to comment on whether the unit will hold up, but it's very flimsy. The base is too light, so when you pick up the kettle the base often comes with it.Also, the cord uses a 3rd grounding pin-which makes the cord very thick, inflexible, and hard to stick into the channel in the base, to allow the base to lie flat on the counter. My previous kettle, a Krups model that started to leak after 7 years, used a simpler 2-prong plug, which made the cord more flexible.I picked up a new Braun kettle today to replace this one. You can get it on Amazon for what I paid for it--$43; the extra $20 or so appears to be worth it in terms of sturdiness and quality."},{"rating":"1","title":"It heats water but ...","review":"It looks better in the picture than in person.

The kettle only shuts off automatically if the lid is shut completely, and I mean COMPLETELY. It has to actually snap into place before the auto-shut-off feature will work.

It makes the tea taste like something drained from an industrial waste site.Besides some problems with the electrical connection with the base, this kettle does boil water like crazy. This would be OK for some industrial reason; like you want some hot water to clean engine parts. If you want hot water for consumtion; DO NOT BUY A PLASIC KETTLE.

Wheelwright has apparently chosen his subjects with care -- each winds up being dislikable, or is proven to be a liar. Wheelwright is disingenuous about his purposes, and condescends to the veterans in a coy way.When it comes to the evidence, he has already decided, based on his work with oil spills and his reading of the Agent Orange literature, that Gulf War Illness(es) may be real, but since they can't be tied to any particular single event, they can't be paid for by the VA.This book proposes to be in-depth reporting, but reveals a writer with an agenda, a science writer from Life magazine who ironically is unconcerned about environmental claims, and a method that is as badly flawed as the studies he attacks.For an alternate viewpoint, read Seymour Hersh's _Against All Enemies: Gulf War Syndrome: The War Between America's Ailing Veterans and Their Government_."},{"rating":"1","title":"Experiences with Princeton Review","review":"I have bought this book based upon the reviews above, but the content and example questions that I got were much easier than those of my textbook questions from SCHOOL!!

Just would like to assert and to reaffirm that fact that the script is well structured, with no redundancy in word, in the theatricality, or in the direction. I have personally not been able to see either the play on stage or the movie on screen, but I must say the drama as written in word succeeded abundantly in producing suspense while maintaining its poise (without ever divulging more than is necessary).

Luckily, my wife persisted I read Track of the Cat and now I'm almost through the series.This one is regrettable."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a letdown!","review":"Like many other Nevada Barr fans, I'm eager to read each new book. This one was a serious disappointment. The writing is stilted, packed with florid adjectives and mixed metaphors. What happened to the lean, mean prose Barr used to write?? In the novel, Anna is reading a Wilkie Collins novel, which made me wonder if Barr has immersed herself in that genre to the point where she is emulating it. Whatever the case, it doesn't work. I've read Collins' books several times and never feel I was wading through dense prose and tortured clauses -- which is how I've felt slogging through this book. (Which makes me wonder why professional reviewers don't mention these things and spare readers the cost of the hardback...)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Waiting for Anna's return to the West","review":"I really enjoyed Nevada Barr's Ill Wind, Track of the Cat and Firestorm and recommend them highly for mystery readers. I loved the isolated park experience that created these books setting. In \\"Liberty Falling\\" the city setting robs me of the things that I want to love about the Anna Pigeon mysteries. The action heated up toward the end of the book, but I had to fight to stay with it. I am waiting for Anna to return to the Southwest or Yosemite or Glacier National Park. This is one of the features that makes me love these books."},{"rating":"1","title":"A disappointing read.","review":"I really enjoyed the first several books in this series, but I find this one too bound up in the relationships between Anna, her sister Molly, and Frederick, the erstwhile FBI agent who has had relationships with both women.

The mystery is tightly spun, and the National Park backdrop that always plays such an integral role in Barr's novels is intriguing and spooky.

I usually bond with the main character in a book, and can't wait to find out what happens next.

However, with this last novel, I've come to the sad conclusion that the series is running out of steam. Anna seems tired. Much of this latest novel is descriptive material rather than action. I learned more about Ellis Island and the Statue of Liberty than I ever wanted to know, and I'm one of those immigrants that passed through Ellis! I do not recommend this book. To those who are first time readers of the series, I would urge you to read the first several books - those are outstanding! Also, a question aimed at those who are Anna Pigeon fans: what happened to the characters Christina Walters and her daughter, Alison? They were favorites of mine, but after the first couple of novels, they somehow disappeared. What happened to them?"},{"rating":"1","title":"A major disappointment from a writer who can do better.","review":"Nevada Barr's earlier books were fun to read. However, I gave up on \\"Blind Descent\\" half-way through. I thought this one would be better but, if anything, it is worse. The writing is turgid and leads nowhere. For example: \\"The timelessness of a summer evening was the only tase of immortality most humans ever got, and as Anna cherished the soft golden forever, she wished she could capture it, carry it across the harbor to Molly's windowless world.\\" After suffering through dozens of such phrases, I just gave up. She should get back to the kind of writing she demonstrated in \\"Track of the Cat\\", \\"A Superior Death\\", et al.

I recommend she re-read Strunk's \\"Elements of Style.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Barr needs a rest and Anna Pidgeon needs character depth.","review":"It's very difficult to maintain a single protagonist-driven mystery series. And Nevada Barr's \\"Liberty Falling\\" shows us just that. Barr gives her usual fantastic \\"like-you-were-there\\" background/color. But there is only so much you can say about the site. After all, it is an island and while detail is what Barr's best at,the book quickly gets boring when she can't move her characters very far. As for Anna, she's not moved very far since the death of her husband. Even psychiatrist sister Molly now has a boyfriend. Anna's issues remain the same and they too have become dull. The alcoholic thing, the \\"no man is an island except Anna\\" thing, the no-friends thing, the death of her husband thing, no real color outside that of the book's setting. And while I was intrigued with life on Ellis, the previous book, in which Anna is forced into caving, is by far Barr's best to date."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ugh!","review":"I never thought there'd come a time when I'd be embarrassed to recommend a Nevada Barr mystery novel. But, the time is now. This story was unimaginative and strained, the description repetetive and overwrought (if I had to read about the ivy tearing down the works of man one more time . . .), and her \\"patriotic\\" descriptions of the Statue of Liberty and of Ellis Island were nauseating. And there was none of the geeky nature information that I usually enjoy in her writing. I've turned on a number of fellow mystery buffs to the Anna Pigeon stories. I may have to suggest that folks read no farther than Blind Descent if her next novel is as poor as Liberty Falling."},{"rating":"1","title":"NEGITIVE TEN","review":"I don't know how such a dull, boring book could get published.

Perhaps it is because her other books are set in the wilds of nature instead of NY City.

Although I have never been to any of the sites of the Anna Pigeon novels, the others seemed much easier to imagine (especially Blind Descent and Superior Death). The descriptions of the NY city environs made me, as well as Anna, long to get back to a good read about a less populated park. That said, I thoroughly enjoyed the continuing development of the characters of Anna, Molly, and Frederick. Some of the other characters, Dr. Madison in particular, seemed pointlessly, as Frederick would put it, \\"ishy\\". I also hope that in future adventures Anna will not get so beaten up...she is obviously bright; perhaps she could use her brains to avoid some of the physical violence in this book and the others."},{"rating":"2","title":"What A Surprise!","review":"When I first read the synopsis of Liberty Falling, I thought, New York?

My only complaint about them happens to be a pretty big one: The horseshoe-shaped part that holds the guitar is too wide for the headstock on all the guitars. So all four of the guitars are actually hanging with the weight of the entire guitar on the tuners (machine heads) instead of the headstock. At the very least, this results in the guitars going out of tune every time they are put away. At the worst, it will damage the guitars. The guitars are each made by different manufacturers and are standard sizes, so it's not a guitar-size issue. I tried to improve these hangers by bending both sides in toward each other. It helped a little bit but not enough to solve the problem. Aside from this problem, the hangers are fine. They seem solidly built and the materials seem reasonably good.

The characters are gentle, and the mysteries are appropriate for any age group, but the stories keep the reader interested and eager for more.

Few of these \\"things\\" will be useful in a business sense--honesty, loyalty, hard-working, etc., can't be detected--but other peripheral attributes can be uncovered by some highly intuitive practicioners.Klara Roman is one of these gifted practictioners.

Quite good in this limited sense, and a pleasure to read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Advanced modulation techniques","review":"After reading this book, I found this book very usefull.

Multi-h modulation schemes: This is an important new topic that can't be found in many digital communications books. Detailed: A good feature in this book is that it deals with the fetails of the advanced digital modulation schemes.Most digital communications books talks breifly about this topics.Therefore, I think that this book is a good reference for researchers and students."},{"rating":"2","title":"At Last!","review":"At Last!

What a disappointment! While the author touches upon most of the major \\"platillos Peruanos\\" he misses the essence and soul of Peruvian cooking. He forgets to sauce the lomito with vinegar or lemon juice the causa--and his seco which should be revoltingly sea green with cilantro boasts a paltry 20 sprigs.

So, when this book came out, I was ecstatic. However, the cookbook is no good. I made several recipes several times, and they never came out tasting very good. For example Chupe de Camarones. I've had some awesome Peruvian shrimp soup in the restaurant. However, even though I got to know my local fishstore well in the process of making my own stock for the three attempts at this soup, and even though I tried the different version, the result was consistently dissappointing. I asked Peruvian friends I knew what they would recommend, and their spice suggestions were much better, plus they had more detailed advice about how long to cook the shrimp than the book. The book leaves out too much. Perhaps it is best seen as the first rough draft for a Peruvian cookbook in English. In the process of revising it, maybe it could get much better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Inaccurate measurements","review":"A lot of Mark Copeland's measurements are incorrect!

California Cooper is one of the best, and one of my favorite writers, and the years I waited for her new work, Some People, Some Other place, were worth it.Ms. Cooper has assembled a multicultural cast of people of all races, classes, and life backgrounds, and given a rich story full of life lessons (as only a J. California Cooper piece could!), commentary on history as it affected her characters (as well as real people!), and a reflection of how people can be in life.Though the novel focuses primarily on the intertwined lives of EulaLee and Madame Elizabeth, we are also given rich supporting characters who help us (and help EulaLee and Madame) see their gifts and flaws.This novel is excellent, I hated it when I reached the end, but I was so satisfied. If you're looking for a substantive and engrossing story, look no further than J. California Cooper's latest, Some People, Some Other Place. Five stars!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Enjoyable Read","review":"I have always been a great fan of Ms. Cooper, and have thoroughly enjoyed her previous literary works. Having an unborn child as the narrator was genius work. However, I feel that SPSOP is not her best. I did not \\"get to know\\" the main characters. I would have enjoyed knowing more about Jewel and Earle, as well as a little more about the older siblings that left home. Did some of them get an education? Become successful? Also,there were other loose ends. My opinion,\\"Wake of The Wind\\" and \\"Some Love, Some Pain, Sometime\\" are her best works. In all, Ms. Cooper continue to be one of my all time favorite authors."},{"rating":"1","title":"Incomplete","review":"I am a fan of JC Cooper but this book was average, at best....In fact, I am a little upset with the whole book. It started out slow but slowly gained my interest, but the ending attempted to wrap up loose ends but did so only superficially...I felt like I wanted to like Eula Too, but now that I am thinking about it, you never really get to know her. You know what she does, but not really her. I think the characters of Ha, Lona, and Iris, which you meet almost at the end, are more vivid than Eula and Madame. The book was OK. Definitely just pick up a copy at the library instead of purchasing it like I did.

J. California Cooper is a great storyteller and normally I enjoy her books very much. This book, however, had too much proselytizing. Everything was \\"Satan this..Satan that..\\" \\"God loves this...God loves that...\\". It was extremely annoying and constantly pulled me out of the story. So many times I wanted to shout, \\"Would you please just tell the damn story!!\\" Like you had a really good friend who suddenly got religion and every time you turn around, there she is, right there, eager to tell you \\"the good news\\". Sigh..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Read!!","review":"I am a recent J california Cooper fan and as I get to know her work. I fall in love with it more and more.

If anything I wish the book would have been longer so I could continue to see the characters develop."},{"rating":"2","title":"Some other people some other place","review":"I think this book was awesome, it was my first read by Cooper and I will be rushing to the library to get her others. I think the narration by an unborn child was very interesting and have never read a book where this or anything like it was done.

I really did not like this book at all. The story did not flow well and the characters simply did not attract me.

I believed it got in the way of tell the real story."},{"rating":"2","title":"Her Best Book Ever","review":"I love all books written by J. California Cooper. It's because of her as a matter of fact that I learned to like short stories, but mostly only the ones written by her. \\"Some People, Some Other Place\\" is stupdendous. I started reading it this morning when I woke up and I have not been able to put it down until I turned the last page, tonight at midnight! The story unfolds through the eyes of an unborn child and drags only in the middle when Cooper focuses on some of the other characters, but all in all, there isn't a dull moment. This is one of the best books I have read this year. Please don't walk, but RUN to get you a copy of this book. It's J.

The second DVD contains bonus meterial such as Countdown to UFC 87, Behind the Scenes, etc.- There's nothing worth watching on the second disk. Out of 10 fights, only the one between George St-Pierre and Jon Fitch is excellent. Jon proved he was a very tough opponent in all 5 rounds. GSP could not deliver a knockout. UFC 87 DVD set is worth buying just because of this match.- The highly-anticipated heavyweight fight between Brock Lesnar and Heath Herring is a huge disappointment. It's an one-sided match. Brock was too big, too strong for Heath. He was 15 pounds heavier than Heath. Brock always dominated the fight. Heath could never counter attack.

I bought their first release on tape (yes that's right they only released it locally as a cassette). I was a huge fan. So when I searched the net (years later) and found they had put out a CD I was thrilled. The songs took me right back to their awesome shows. One big draw back however is they they dropped their lead singer prior to making this album. They were four guys and a woman with an awesome voice. They kept the songs and Josh does a great job singing them - but the songs and the band was better with her. So if you heard BWU back in the nineties when they were a great college band you won't be dissappointed (too much) and if you never heard them before you will like this album.

Some of the scenes from this book are so real that you feel you are in the same room with the characters. I could smell the aroma of the smoke and picture Laci as she began to look more and more like an addict. I like the way that the story wasn't told from one point of view and you always knew what was going on in the heads of all of the characters.

In another case the author wrote the a character had a \\"since\\" that something wasn't right instead of \\"sense\\". There are too many of these mistakes to count.

Nothing I \\"Knew\\" about the topic changed and the film didn't take me deeper into the world of Bigfoot. If the same old rehashed reports, (\\"I saw Bigfoot...he walked like this...I was a-skeered\\") and uneven, overly dramatic footage from the field are what passes for what is new and exciting in Bigfoot research, then maybe this IS the Citizen Kane of Bigfoot documentaries.If you have ever watched more than one History Channel or A&E; show on the topic of Bigfoot then you have already seen this film.Once again, the grandiose claims of Mr. Biscardi fall FAR short of the truth."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Good Documentary plus Unusual Physical Evidence","review":"This documentary offers unusual locations, encounters and physical evidence (bones and tissue). Eye-witness accounts from mostly new witnesses and law enforcement (minimal reenactments). It features active BF areas in TX, OH, NY, AZ and MN rather than the usual Pacific NW. Three examples of bones and soft tissue are featured (I didn't expect this).I thought the approach was very honest and the production value was comparable to BF docs seen on Travel Channel but not quite as high as History Channel or Discovery. The producer explains that he had worked with Ivan Marx and some of Marx's controversial photos are briefly featured in the film.

However, when they are researching an island, a team member states that they were being followed and fresh tracks were located, so what does Tom say for Bigfoot evidence? DEFINITE!

So wouldn't the scientist that made the study be really eager to talk about finding the DNA of a new species?

The alleged bigfoot leg is clearly a Bear, come on maaaaaan, its obviously a bear and all the footprints are fakes, probably courtesy of biscardis cronies.Dont be taken in by this man."},{"rating":"1","title":"Con Man At It Again","review":"Anyone who would buy anything from this con man gets what they deserve.

Horrible!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Very unconvincing","review":"After watching this I became less convinced that bigfoot might exist. There was no \\"hard\\" evidence gained and the researchers were looking for clues that supported their theory, which is the absolute wrong way to approach any investigation.The credibility of Mr. Biscardi is questionable in my mind when he referred to the known bigfoot hoaxer Ivan Marx as \\"my partner\\". He also showed several photos that were obviously hoaxed, including Marx's crippled \\"Bigfoot\\" and an absurd-looking rubber and hair costume supposedly chewing on a deer's leg.Also ridiculous was the alleged photo from Clarence, NY, which showed a person in an a bad gorilla suit beside a John Deere Gator.But the clincher for me was when Biscardi was \\"wood-knocking\\" on a tree at night and then when the echo came back said \\"he just responded!\\".Overall a very disappointing, uninspired and unconvincing effort."},{"rating":"1","title":"More of the same nonsense from Tom","review":"How many hoaxes does Tom Biscardi have to have his hands in before people realize he's just out to make a buck?

I'm glad I didn't purchase any of them.Jeff Meldrum knows his stuff and hes a professor at ISU. Hes the one to follow on the subject.

It was clearly compiled as an act of love. Mrs. Smart appears to have spent a considerable part of her adult life gathering information about her mother's family (The Rector Family of Wayne County, Kentucky). This Rector family descends from the 1714 Germanna Colonists of Fauquier County, Virginia. Her book tracks the descendents of Samuel Rector and Rutha Simpson, who emigrated through the Cumberland Gap into Wayne County, Kentucky and were married there in 1807. Their large family and many descendents are documented in this book well into the mid-1970's. Mrs. Smart's special talent was in doggedly pursuing all leads. She has sections on related families that are quite interesting.

I am a big fan of 35mm film but I must say that this does come close in quality for picture type. One reviewer has mentioned that his pictures were grainy. the manual says if this happens it is likely that the camera has been malfunctioning dur to dropping, or extreme temperatures. it has a lot of nifty buttons to impress anyone, and the best part is that it makes movie clips with sound. It comes with softwars to transfer photos and clips.You can make a home movie when you add all the movie clips together with special effects and sound using the software that comes with the camera.*****recommend getting at least a 128mb compact flash card 32 mb is not much.

When we researched the problem on-line, we found that it had been recalled due to a piece malfunction. We turned it in for repairs we were told that the problems weren't due to the recall and we'd need to pay over $100 to repair it.

Which after over the past 13 months of owning has only worked maybe 4 of those months. I finally packed it up and sent it back to canon. I still have not heard from them.

I Do not reccommend this Digital Camera. It will break down."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best Camera Ever","review":"I love this camera. I has so many wonderful features... the flip out screen (used to protect the screen, shoot from odd angels, take pictures of yourself that you can line up), the option to hold the picture you just took to share (you know everyone wants to see the picture after it's taken and it takes just too long on normal digital cameras to load the picture).A great buy!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"my images, must not look like yours...","review":"I'm not sure why I am not as happy with this camera as everyone else seems to be.

(well it did, until it stopped working) I've done a lot of research and there always seems to be that one person on each user opinion section that has the same problems I do.

However, I pulled the pics up on my computer, and they look blurry there as well. I agree with a previous reviewer who said that she had a 2 MP Kodak that took better pictures. Mine did too, except it had a problem with shutting itself off for no reason.I see where someone below also said that by figuring out how to use the camera, you can take professional shots. Our poor pictures are made on the auto setting, and the subjects of the pictures are standing still in good light.I just hope someone else at my wedding had a better camera, with better pictues they can share with me.

I had bought an external flash, and an L-bracket, and toting around all that junk was tiring. I wanted something to point and shoot. Well, the PowerShot A85 isn't it. The Coolpix is an old 3 megapixel camera, and it dances circles around the just-released, brand-new 4 megapixel PowerShot in picture quality. The PowerShot, out of 20 pictures, had a white \\"flare\\" circle appear when using the flash. This was a against blue velvet drapes--no glass or anything to reflect off of! My brown-eyed 17-year-old had redeye, which means the blue-eyed people looked EXTREMELY demon-possessed. (Yes, redeye-reduction was on.) And the pictures had noise in them. The quality of the pictures is just plain poor. I sure hope this camera is just a lemon and not an indication of the quality of the A85.

Boy, aren't I glad I didn't actually waste any $$$$.I am only giving it a 2 instead of 1 star because I really did enjoy the Christmas Day scene with the family. I felt like I was part of it.Other than that, I was really disappointed. The so-called mystery isn't really a mystery. The reveal of the murderer came out of no where. It felt like it was just thrown in together at the last minute.In addition, I really disliked Lucy. She gossips a lot, complains a lot and is somewhat a witch (aka another explisive word to replace witch). She accuses someone of murder just because she doesn't like him! Her reaction to her mother's depression is mind boggling. Instead of trying to understand and help, she whines about now having to worry about her.

The first half of the book was extremely slow and once it actually started to pick up a little there was next to no mystery for the reader to figure out. Details were suddenly thrown at you.

As soon as the sister announced her plans for going on a camping trip in the woods, I knew exactly what was going to happen. You will too. The plot is predictable.

Even the extremely nice Ultra Pro deck protectors that include 50 sleeves are around $2.50 for solid colors with protective backing and $3 for foil looking protective backs.

Unfortunately, this book make a number of good points but it's not all that interesting. Many of the points should be fairly intuitive and obvious for marketing people who have a clue. Some points made are interesting refreshers, like the importance and potential impact of invoking multiple senses in the consumption and purchase experience. Unfortunately many of the chapters are not newsworthy and can be summarized by their lame titles, such as \\"Women: The New \\"Shoppers in Chief\\" and \\"Gay and Lesbian Consumers: Sincerity is the Best Policy!\\"The book mostly gives examples of brands that have done X or Y really well without leaving the average reader or business person with any concept about how the point is relevant in a gernalizeable sense.Final gripe is that the book reads a little bit like an advertisement for the author's firm."},{"rating":"1","title":"OUTDATED - \\"updated and revised edition\\" full of old examples","review":"I agree with the sentiments of many of the other reviewers, but to add to the conversation --- reading this book is like being in a time warp with tons of outdated examples...such zingers as \\"the new millenium\\", the success of Kmart via Martha Stewart, references to Compaq to name a very, very few.The book says it was updated in 2009, but they didn't do a sufficient job in my opinion.Despite the outdatedness and the fluff, it's a decent book.

If that's all you wanted though, you would simply order porno in bulk......right? What this genre is all about is lesbian VAMPIRES. Vampire and prey culmunating in a lustful embrace of pain and passion called a \\"bite\\". Remember that? Remember when vampires did that?Vampire Vixens doesn't have any vampires in it. There's a chick in a cape and she can fly. Is she Wonder Woman or what?I couldn't tell you about the dialogue or the story, although I'm sure there was nothing erotic. One does not catch much of the story or dialogue while scanning in FF mode looking for the vampires.Why two stars? There are naked women who are at least trying to act like they're having sex. That really only gets 1 1/2 stars, but it wasn't an available option so I rounded up."},{"rating":"1","title":"I didn't understand this movie at all?","review":"This movie makes no sense at all. It's called Vampire \\"Vixens\\" but there is only one vampire in the movie. The dialogue all seems adlibbed and some of it's just wierd. The woman are all really atractive but the scenes of the girls getting interviewed for some job have nothing to do with the plot. It's just an excuse for nudity. It's like watching two movies at once that have nothing to do with each other. It cuts back and forth between lesbian scenes and the vampire and her lacky ploting to kill Wally. I only even gave it two stars because it's got Darian Caine. Her scenes are worth watching. Except the last scene just cuts off abruptly to the credits. Overall disapointing, I expect better from Seduction Cinema, yes there super low budget but they're usaully better than this."},{"rating":"1","title":"I FEEL TOTALLY CHEATED!!!","review":"I got this movie because they sold it togather with carlitos angels. a funny hispanic comedy about some ghetto girls that fight crime and smoke out.

Biz's selection weaves together 22 jams, such as Booker T & The MG's \\"Hip Hug Her,\\" Isaac Hayes' \\"Hung Up On My Baby\\" (sampled by numerous rappers over the years), Staple Singers' \\"I'll Take You There,\\" Jean Knight's \\"Mr. Big Stuff,\\" and others.

The book is written with less personality than Al Gore! Smith's writing is so dry that it is a struggle to wade through the slower parts(and there are many of them). Amin is infamous for his insanity, his humor, and for his brutality...Smith seems to want to focus more on his politics. Idi's politics weren't very interesting, hence the dullness of the book. Don't get me wrong, some of the madness is captured here. The trouble is that Smith can't keep his obvious bias and lack of comprehension out of the book. Idi Amin was a terrible human being, make no mistake about it, but Time magazine gave me more to hold my interest in one 1977 article than Mr. Smith manages in this 198-page yawn. Look elsewhere if you want to see the train wreck that was Idi Amin!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice little system for the money.","review":"I just wanted a small system with a turntable so I could play my old records.

It arrived within 2-3 days of ordering and was exactly as promised... decent sound and a great value for the price. About 4 weeks after receiving, though, it just stopped playing. Calls to TEAC Customer Service (a VM-only system) told us that we had to take the unit to one of several service centers... none even remotely convenient... to have it serviced under warranty. We ended up taking it to a local tech (at our cost!) and we are still waiting -- 4 weeks later -- to see if he can get the part needed to fix.

The ability to put my records on tape is a great plus. The sound is much better than the vintage-looking brands and it still doesn't take up too much space. Note - a prior reviewer said the volume knob doesn't work, but it does. To increase/decrease the volume you have to repeatedly turn the knob in the direction appropriate. This way it doesn't blast and you can make subtle adjustments in volume. My only criticisms are inadequate explanations of how it works (as the volume issue indicates) and difficulty seeing the details of the different functions with old eyesight like mine."},{"rating":"1","title":"Thank God they don't sell this anymore.","review":"I bought this for my mom and it worked well till just after the 1 year warranty was up.

One wonders about the authenticity of the author's knowledge of the subject at hand.He also seems unaware of simplistic \\"witchcraft\\" such as the symbolism of a headless dove placed on your backporch.

Her directive tone is so domineering that she almost has to be insincere at the core. One does hope to open up to another reader's suggestions about a text, but this author has the effect of making me want to slam my doors and shutter my windows.

The three sections Southbound, Hiatus (winter habitats) and Northbound, are organized by geography and include lists of birds that use particular migratory strategies, wintering grounds, or flyways. Especially in the early part the story moves along somewhat ploddingly by describing his experiences studying the birds in Alaska, the Argentine Pampas, the mountains of Jamaica, etc. Sometimes the lurid descriptions of habitat destruction overwhelm the migration story, but there are many interesting insights and questions posed about the needs and habits of migratory birds -- for instance, birds that are territorial in the north but gregarious in the south, or birds with specific habitats in the north, but generalists in the south or visa versa. Altogether fascinating, but sometimes hard work to read.

Has that 'northern exposure-feel' to it. Not a 5 star but, definitely a 4. See this movie and you may just want to see it again!"},{"rating":"2","title":"It's No Mystery That This is a Great Movie!","review":"Mystery, Alaska is the story of a small Alaskan town that revolves around \\"The Saturday Game,\\" in which locals compete in weekly hockey games. The players include the town sheriff, a grocer, an elementary school teacher, and nearly everyone in the town plays some part in the games, on or off the ice.Conflict arises when the town's boast that \\"no one can beat their team on a pond\\" is carried off to New York by a native Mysterian, who convinces the New York Rangers to challenge the Mystery players to a match that they will never forget.This is a thoroughly enjoyable movie for hockey lovers and even for those who know nothing about the sport (like me). It incorporates a good deal of humor amidst light-hearted drama, and is just a great story!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Crowe showing versatiliy in \\"Mystery, Alaska\\"","review":"If you don't like hockey, okay. But don't let not liking it keep you from seeing \\"Mystery, Alaska\\". This movie is about the human spirit and it's ability to overcome great odds. Crowe learned to skate in two weeks or so for this film showing he can overcome odds. This ability is what lead him to an Oscar. But he doesn't carry this movie alone. Every cast member brings originality to their characters which makes this movie funny and heartwarming. If you are looking for a good laugh and a movie you'll watch over and over, it's \\"Mystery, Alaska.\\" It's a must have for Crowe fans and a good entertainment dollar spent for movie lovers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Snowbound Fun","review":"The first five minutes of this sweet little flick sets the stage for a poignant laughter-through-tears story. This town gives new meaning to the word 'dysfunctional' and all have to pay their dues. The rag-tag hockey team is a group of unlikely guys who each have their own misbegotten charms. There's a sheriff (who's sons spend way too much time in the locker room), a trigger-happy grocer, a high school senior and one character appropriately named 'Skank' who can't seem to keep his pants on. This is one of the better David-And-Goliath sports movies out there and if you like hockey...RENT IT! Russell Crowe always gives a good performance and there were quite a few surprises from the other actors as well. Even Burt Reynolds' performance was enjoyable. All-in-all, it was great fun and I will definately own this one on DVD. Spectacular sound.

Thin, non-sportive males are sent away, presumably with some homosexual insults thrown at them: Quite typical for some of the more squalid little towns out there. The story focuses on the oh-so-tough players on the frozen village pond, and their oh-so-heroic fight against some US league team. If you're into Burt \\"I can't act\\" Reynolds and brutal sports action, you might like this film. If not, then you'd better not touch this film with a ten-foot pole: Boring story, mostly lousy acting (Russell Crowe being an exception). And a rather painfully stupid romance angle that must have been edited into the script during, probably, very many amateurish script re-writes."},{"rating":"2","title":"A movie about friendship, not hockey","review":"If you were looking for a movie about hockey, sorry. This movie is much better than that. It is about friendship and the bonds people form when they spend their lives together. The small town atmosphere is so true.

It ruins a movie; this was not good for watching with your family. It was also really not that good of a movie without that stuff, maybe that's why they put it in there, to distract you from a movie that stunk.

But, if you're a sports fan (especially if you ever played Hockey) you'll like the show. Sure it's pretty predictible, but the actings decent and the underdog story is good, albeit typical.

The characters are likeable, and each grows in their little way by the end credits. Russell Crowe provides an enjoyable performance as the town sheriff/hockey team captain who is bitter that he has been removed from the town's hockey team in order to make room for the next generation of hockey stars. The film centers around the small town hockey team taking on the NY Rangers, and the conflict that this causes throughout the town of Mystery, Alaska.

The hockey part was fun.I'm sorry, but I can't provide a complete review. I had to turn the movie off when my teenage kids came home.Why didn't I turn it on again later? Well, the story line wasn't believable. (Apparently the whole town turns out every Saturday to watch the same people play hockey for 13 years straight.) And, I had been expecting a comedy, but nothing seemed to be funny. BUT the real reason I didn't turn it back on - after 1/2 hour of watching, I didn't care enough about any of the characters to be interested in who wins the big game.I guess some people in Hollywood think we'll watch anything as long as it has a big name (Russell Crowe) or two (Burt Reynolds) to attract attention."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just so Lame","review":"Really, this movie was flat out dumb. I have to admit there was some clever dialoge and Russell Crowe showed to be capable of dry comidy. He was really quite loveable, a take off from his typical ultra macho roles. The scenery was spectacular but the story was just so stupid and predictable. Too much profanity to be a kids film but nothing to hold an adults attention except: hope, that at some point the film would just have to get better or that Russell would show some skin, for us female fans.

Good: The scenes in the locker room, the Biebe kids' comments, Burt Reynolds \\"judge\\" character and coaching, Bailey's law, the heart of the town and heart of the players. Hank Azaria's final realization about Mystery, Crowe's deftly played performance as the approximately 30 yr. old Captain.There was nothing really bad, it was just that after all the emotion and laughter churned up during the entire movie, it just sort of ends nicely, not bad, but not a terrific ending either. Just sort of lackluster ending.The husband/wife interraction between McCormack and Crowe was especially realistic. Crowe has not had such great chemistry with anyone since Meg Ryan in PROOF OF LIFE. Mary McCormack would have been the perfect wife in his upcoming \\"CINDERELLA MAN\\" film!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The best hockey movie next to Slap Shot","review":"I'm a big hockey fan and I for one loved Mystery, Alaska.

His character has several difficult scenes and he does a very comendable job with them. The entire team have foibles and faults. Russell Crowe is Russell Crowe as usual.

A hysterical story to tell, a small handfull of quirky-funny chararacters with action (of all types) including the glorious sport of ice hockey, drama & suspense, located in beautiful Alaska. That's a mouthful to say & this movie is absolutely everything a movie should be. Mr. Russell Crowe makes acting appear effortless with so little said. Flawless & smooth Burt Reynolds, Colm Meany... all the actors are spot on. It's a great movie & the kind where ya sit on the edge of your seat, laughing & excited for the coming scenes.

The best players participate in the \\"Saturday Game\\" where citizens play 5-on-5 hockey on a small pond with no lines, no boards, but lots of fans. A former Mystery resident, now a promoter, comes back to his home town with a proposal that the hometown boys take on the New York Rangers. What are the chances--but who cares when the town joins together in mutual pride to face down their vaunted rivals. Nothing too deep here, but just good fun and old-timey, small-town spirit. You'll find yourself cheering for the undermanned team from the frozen north and having a great time while doing it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simple fun","review":"I liked the movie. It was fun to watch a movie that was simple entertainment....I like Russell Crowe and think his portrayal and acting was right on.

I loved this movie and wished they could have rewritten that part...maybe have Stank(?)and her caught necking or something because the married couple's relationship was an important aspect of the plot. Colm was such a stuffed shirt! Maybe you and I are a little naive to think this would've been believable to the so-called sophisticated movie goer. Also, that last comment from the little kid durng the game was stupid, but the director let him redeem himself later in the game action."},{"rating":"1","title":"This movie was weak dude","review":"Who in the world greenlighted the script on this one whoever did probably got fired it is just one GIANT cLIChe of a movie"},{"rating":"2","title":"Must have for any serious listener of music","review":"Another review here has hit the nail on the head. The key word is: SIMPLICITY. . . in its truest form. The other key words are BEAUTY and TRUTH. (Where I have heard that before, Keats lovers?) Murolo takes us through an often familiar repetoire of Italian favorites in a manner that cannot be surpassed. This is music at its most pure. There is no more poignant version of O Sole Mio than his, just a voice and classical guitar. Any serious music listener should have this moving and essential CD. This is MUSIC."},{"rating":"2","title":"Short but Sweet","review":"If interested in Folk Music or Folk Culture,in Italy or abroad,Roberto Murolo should be made part of your collection.

This takes the long done out genre of romantic comedies, and adds a new feature-an erupting volcano.

You also love the characters."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great disaster film since Earth Quake.","review":"Spectacular Visual Effects, make the best disaster film since Earth Quake.

The cinematography of this film is absolutely wonderful! The Special Effects are so realistic, You will actually feel like you are really seeing this disaster happen! The action is fast-paced and breathtaking as the heartfelt characters do all they can to make it out alive! Pierce Brosnan and Linda Hamilton bring a romantic chemistry to the film that energizes the emotion of the film as well as the action! They work so wonderfully together and I hope to see them appear together again. DANTE'S PEAK is one fun ride of a movie that I will never forget! It's as exciting as movies come!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Spin off from \\"St. Helens\\"","review":"In 1981, \\"St. Helens\\" was released on video. Now \\"Dante's Peak\\" is pretty much of same. \\"Dante's\\" is the worst volcano disaster movie I ever saw compared to \\"St. Helens\\" (1981). Very cheesy.

Supposed to be a suspense/action movie, but I laughed through a lot of it, probably even more than when watching Top Gun."},{"rating":"1","title":"Are you serious?","review":"Reading through the reviews of this film I can't help noticing that there are two distinct categories of reviewers - those who thought this film was a special effects blockbuster with great acting and others who thought it was terribly acted with duff effects. I seem to be caught between two stools because it's both these things - TERRIBLE acting from the human characters - how does Pierce Brosnan get employment? GREAT acting from the dog. TERRIBLE effects - just wait until you see the damn bursting - GREAT special effects - the town being blown away - all this combined with the most ridiculous plot imaginable.Immensely enjoyable even though I didn't know whether to laugh out loud at the film's most sensitive moments... I could equally have given this film 5 stars although it depends on whether you've got a sense of humour. Sometimes the 1 star films are the best."},{"rating":"1","title":"One of the worst movies of the decade.","review":"Terrible acting, terrible plot, terrible special effects.

END"},{"rating":"1","title":"Completely Rediculous","review":"This movie was horrible! They drive a truck through lava, and even spin the wheels in it; when they escape it, the truck is fine and so are the tires. That is almost as good as the lake of acid. The acid is eating through the metal boat, but Pierce Brosnan can wrap his hand in a shirt and paddle, and his hand is perfectly fine. These are only part of the reason I found this movie one to make fun of. It was completely rediculous."},{"rating":"1","title":"zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz.........","review":"The first movie Ive seen where the making of featurette was better than the movie itself. I bought this on widescreen and Im sure after watching it once that I never will again. I dont know how you could call this better or worse than Volcano w/ Tommy Lee Jones. They both stink. It was a whole hour before anything happened then 30 minutes of boring close calls. I will give them credit for the bridge scene. I had no idea those trucks were miniatures. If you want to see a good disaster flix with LOTS of action get Daylight w/Stallone. Not great, but at least that was action throughout the entire movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"very unhappy","review":"I ordered this along with 2 other DVD's on Feb. 27, 2011 and have only received one of the items so far (today is April 5, 2011)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Movie","review":"I liked this movie alot, it was suspenceful and fun. I also appreciated the DTS (it was worth the extra $)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Superior Disaster Thriller","review":"Except for Volcano, it is possible to make a great movie about a volcano. Dante's Peak is probably one of the best action/disasters around, plus Twister. Pierce Brosnan and Linda Hamilton are very good together! The FX are brilliant. The DVD is one of the best, with interesting behind the scenes stuff."},{"rating":"2","title":"Why do I like this movie","review":"I have seen Dante's Peak at least ten times and I still can't quite put my finger on why I keep going back to it. I do like Pierce Brosnan, although this certainly isn't his best performance. This movie, I think, is the epitome of why we all watch movies: a couple hours of distraction. This movie has a very appealing look to it. And the premise that we might be living in a very dangerous location helps make this story a riveting one. Academy Award caliber? Never! But for sheer entertainment, this is one of the best."},{"rating":"2","title":"A fun, well-made disaster movie","review":"Dante's Peak is as about as good as disaster movies get. First, Brosnan is very good as the hunk expert with a hunch; he's certain that that volcano's gonna blow, but is not egotistic about it. He pairs up with Hamilton very well, and is extraordinarily good in the scenes with her children.The special effects in the movie are absolutely first-rate, and the movie uses these with great energy and excellent pace. There are a few wacky, completely-forget-about-science scenes, but not too many to be overly bothersome. Bottom-line is that Dante's Peak is a lot of fun to watch, and it easily passes the watch-again test. Recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Movie review","review":"This was purchased as a gift for a december birthdahy. It is a very good movie and even better in HD.

The CD is formatted for the UK which is different than the US. And to be quite honest, not worth the hassle of returning because then the cost of shipping (to and from me) would be more than what I paid for.

However, without ruining the ending, I will say he ends up having a change of heart which causes him to risk everything, including his own life becoming threatened to save a mother and her children."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Movie","review":"Love this movie, love the action and on the edge scenes.

A true winner!","review":"Dante's Peak was one of my favourite movies of 1997. It's exciting, smart, fun and has really outstanding special effects, some of the best I have ever seen. Why wasn't this movie nominated for best visual effects?? Pierce Brosnan and Linda Hamilton ignite the screen! What a rush!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The best volcano movie was a BLAST!","review":"Enough of that stupid lava, magma effects. The outrageous, over the top plans, scenes, and people screaming at the top of their lungs. This movie had NONE of that to be honest. It had wonderful acting, amazing plot, and the greatest effects that I have seen in a natural disaster movie. So I can sum up that this film is really good, one of my #1 favorites, and recommended for everyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic Favorite","review":"Watching Dante's Peake is like watching the Wizard of Oz. People snuggle down on the couch with a batch of popcorn and watch at least once or twice a year. It is a simple enjoyable movie plot about a town in denial, a single mother with children who falls in love with the geologist come to save them all. There are funny, romantic, and scary scenes and even though we memorized the plot, our hearts still speed up at the frightening parts."},{"rating":"2","title":"Conventional volcano film","review":"Despite its conformity to the conventions governing volcano pictures, the film makes for pleasant viewing. There are no real villains in the piece, lots of fireworks, and an attractive cast. The director fits the piece together nicely, avoiding too great an emphasis on pseudo-scientific explanation, and letting us see Pierce Brosnan and Linda Hamilton in various stances. Should appeal to most members of the family without creating difficulties over language or behavior (save for some minor expletives). Well done entry in the genre."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's the DTS!","review":"Dante's Peak is a reasonably good story, well acted with excellent special effects and Richard Snell's makeup effects are awesome. I rate the story four stars, but the transfer and sound are a full five stars. We need a rating system here that separates the film from the DVD quality. This was my first DTS CD and I have to agree the sound is MUCH better than Dolby Digital."},{"rating":"1","title":"A volcanic dud","review":"Are you kidding me? A nice plot, but ridiculuous action scenes. Grandma pulling the boat through the acid lake--but the dock (wooden) is still standing.

When we saw Disney Pixar had come out with a DVD focusing on short films we were thrilling, thinking it would be something a little different for our twin boys. From the moment the first short film began I became skeptical. Short is an understatement to the length of the film, if you can even consider it a film. My 2 yr olds were everything but interested in any of the short films. Typically we have been happy with most if not all of the movies we have seen, even keeping the parents entertained. This DVD fell completely short of that. I certainly feel we overpaid for a DVD that did not offer much in terms of entertainment."},{"rating":"1","title":"So Disappointed!

However, with the exception for the 'story of' featurette, it's 100% recycled material. Don't get me wrong, it's nice to see them all in one place, but $25 (or even $20) is a complete ripoff without anything NEW. They're almost all on the older DVD's someplace, so unless you're the type of person that likes to pay for the same thing multiple times, skip buying this one and just rent it on netflix."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pixar Short Films","review":"I've seen a few of the short films in other Pixar movies, so I thought it would be cool to see the other ones. The movies start in the 80's and go to the present. The best(few) ones are within the last 5 years, and, for some reason, they were the ones I've already seen. This wouldn't be so bad if it wasn't being sold at a movie price. All in all, I think everyone would get more satisfaction and entertainment out of almost any movie.

Seemed liked a good value, with a well-known brand name (Orbit). Unfortunately, the spray patterns are inconsistent and wayward. Some of the nozzle openings became occluded...perhaps using a \\"screen\\" washer instead of a regular washer at the hose connection may have prevented this? My biggest complaint with the multi-pattern nozzle handle: the handle fails to return to the \\"off\\" position when I release it. I have to use my other hand to pull the squeeze lever away from the grip to turn off the flow of water. I recommend spending a little more money for a better-made nozzle or nozzle set.

Unfortunately I've had to return two of these kettles because of the poor quality plastic used in the handle. In each return (and even some boxes that I opened in a store) the problem was the same: the platic handle broke. I guess the outward pressure of the metal portion of the handle is too strong for the plastic used and it snaps. When it happened once, it could be a fluke. It happened twice, I'm starting to get suspicious. I open boxes in a store and see the same problem and we have a design flaw. I've given up on this kettle and will keep looking for a stylish kettle."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fusion Stainless Steel Teakettle","review":"This teakettle is well constructed and heats the water well. The heat resistant handle and the drip free spout are nice features. I have two complaints about the kettle, however.The first is very minor. The care instructions included are obviously generic instructions which apply more to plain steel kettles, not stainless. The instructions warn about letting water sit in the pot,etc... That isn't a problem with this kettle due to its construction.The second issue is that the kettle doesn't whistle very well. Most of the steam escapes through the spout instead of the whistle on the lid. If you cover the spout, the lid whistles, but it doesn't if the spout is uncovered. (There was no plug/cover supplied for the spout, and I haven't seen one in any of the photo's.)"},{"rating":"1","title":"The quality is not there","review":"I've used this teakettle for a few months before the lid knob broke off and there was no way to open it except to stick a knife and try to get it out. There seemed to be no way to re-attach the lid knob. No issues with the handle and it is a pretty nice looking tea pot, it just does not last."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the same quality as it used to be","review":"I had this tea kettle years ago and loved it. When it was time for me to replace it, I wanted the same one. I ignored all the bad reviews because I had my own positive opinion about my old kettle. I should have believed the negative reviews because I hate this kettle. The ball that makes the whistle kept falling out the first week I used it. I finally jammed it in good enough that it stopped but the spout got very rusty quick and the handle is way too hot! This kettle looks nice and looks like it did years ago, but the quality is awful. I gave one extra star for looks, but I would never buy again and do not recommend at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"If you like a strange brown film in your teapot....","review":"Heats up just fine, handle stays cool, and the whistle is not ear piercing...good! However, after a week of use we noticed an odd taste, and rubbed off what looked like rust meats iron filings from the inside...nice. It built up again after a week or so. We're done with this kettle."},{"rating":"1","title":"This kettle has so many flaws","review":"This is a handsome tea kettle but it functions very poorly. Let's start with the package insert that came with the kettle that instructs us to empty & DRY the inside of the kettle after each use. Honestly. Who does that? Just emptying the kettle is an uncomfortable task - as others have noted, you have to tilt the kettle 180 degrees just to pour it. I've taken to pouring mine \\"back handed\\" to avoid wrist discomfort and if I pour too quickly it dribbles down my hand. Here's the flaw that bugs me the most: the little screen in the spout has completely rusted in the course of a few months & collects pet hair (no I'm not a slob - I keep my kitchen as tidy as the next average-non-Felix-Unger-gal). I have yet to find a way to clean this little screen. Yuck. Copco, it's a tea kettle - why would you use a metal in the spout that's prone to rust?!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Rip Off","review":"I searched long and hard for the perfect tea kettle. This definitely was not it! What a waste! After just a month or two the handle came loose on the top. After a few more months, the metal in the bottom was floating around in the water. Yuk! Yuk Yuk!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Pours Slow and leaks","review":"We had to return this because it pours out slow where you have to tilt the pot a full 180 degrees. We mainly need a tea pot to heat up our kids bottles. So we find ourselves pouring the thing forever as well as it leaks from the top and where the handle is connected. From China equals not good. The little whistle function worked ok but not worth the hassle to not have to flip the little lever to open up the spout.The main thing is that it leaks and that shouldn't happen on a $40 tea pot."},{"rating":"1","title":"Copco's tagline: \\"Better By Design\\"------NOT!","review":"I've had mine for several months. It looks really nice and blends into my stove area quite well. However, like what others have reported it suffers from many design flaws. I'm sad to report another flaw: the lid comes apart.The lid is made up of two pieces. On closer inspection of the lid I found it's not held together by rivets, weld, or even screws-----it's just held together by bent metal. Really?! Didn't they know the lid is the most used part of a teakettle since one has to remove it to add water?! Especially in this model since one can't pour water through the spout since it has a metal ball in the spout to make the kettle whistle.Seriously---it's just a teakettle for cryin' out load! How can one manage to mess it up? Teakettles are meant to last decades---not months. I hope not they didn't make too many of these----since most will probably be discarded. I never knew a teakettle would have a large carbon footprint."},{"rating":"1","title":"Broke after about 6 months","review":"This teakettle worked well for about six months, although you have to tilt the kettle to an uncomfortable angle to pour it. After six months, the handle broke, separating from the main body. Sounds like a similar problem others have had."},{"rating":"1","title":"Warning!","review":"This pot Broke into two parts!

This can be characteristic of multi-DVD products sold for a buck or two at a dollar store or Walmart, but it should not be the case for a collection of quality movies. If the management of Image Entertainment were capable of shame, they should have experienced it when choosing to deliver a product like this.Image now markets Blu-Ray versions of Mona Lisa and The Long Good Friday.

Looking for design? There are a few tips you've probably already heard, some pictures of hostas (mostly closeups) and five \\"designs\\" that are colored pencil sketches.

The author began the book by throwing in a large number of characters and the most children I have ever seen in a mystery. It was very hard to get a handle on who they all were (even with the family tree in the frontispiece - which is actually a line from the book). Because there were so many people, I felt they were presented in a very shallow way. I like for characters to have some depth so that I know whether I like or dislike them. This just had a large group of people all wanting money. Greed, greed, and more greed. The intended murder victim was EXTREMELY obvious by page 21 and the murderer before I was halfway through the book.I think this author is just not for me.

In order to get the 2008 map you have BUY the update from Garmin for $75.Second is that even on the 2006 map I can't get the map, neither on the handheld nor on the PC, to find addresses I want in NYC. I tried my own address (this building went up in 1927), but I can't even get the street. I tried a resturant on Union Turnpike in queens, there is no Union Turnpike listed.I am underwhelmed by the handheld 60CSX as well but I could live with the onscreen keyboard if the maps worked.I was thinking to go for the new Edge but after my experience with this map there is no way I'd ever deal with Garmin again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mapquest in the palm of your hand","review":"I wanted to include a \\"My House\\" map with the pointer at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue, Washington DC, but I couldn't get a screen capture.I loaded as many maps as I could fit in my eTrex, and I'm amazed at how up to date the maps are. There are businesses on the map that weren't even built until recently.One of the things I enjoy doing with it is to plot a route to a place I know well, and then take a different route. The eTrex calculates a new route quite quickly, but it sometimes takes a little while to convince it I am NOT going to make a U-turn.The software on the computer is not quite as friendly. The routing tool hangs on to the mouse pointer and that sometimes results in unintended waypoints.Good GPS software and almost good computer software."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful program","review":"We just purchased the North American map for our Garmin GPS and we had such a great time using it. We saved time finding streets and we didn't have to stop and ask for directions. Great program. One great feature is that it lists hotels, gas stations, ATM's and all types of shopping for every exit. It was wonderful. No guessing games or taking chances with gas stations."},{"rating":"1","title":"would love to be able to use it !","review":"I ordered this product from Europe and had it sent to my daughter who lives in PA. I wanted to use it during my next trip in the USA with my C320 streetpilot from Garmin.

From his fiery tenure as manager of the New York Yankees to the legendary barroom brawls, \\"The Last Yankee\\" probes the tempestuous days of this brilliant and volatile manager whose hirings and firings by Yankees owner George Steinbrenner became the stuff of soap operas in the 1970s and '80s. This book is a good one, even if it possibly falls a bit short of the biography of Martin written by Peter Golenbock. The author makes it clear that Martin was a troubled human being with deep personal problems. A lust for alcohol and a need for acceptance ran deep in his soul."},{"rating":"1","title":"Slow read","review":"This book, all be it very informative, is very slow. Most of the information comes from people who \\"knew\\" Billy and not from the man himself. Several parts are very conflicting in their stories and the author is not exactly sure who to believe.

It catalogs techniques for transforming household herbs & fruit and veggie seeds into beautiful houseplants. Although I have yet to germinate the elusive avocado pit, I have a much brighter kitchen because of this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Older is better...","review":"I like how this book is set up. I also like how the medical information has been updated. I was born in 1979 and my sister, in 1988. We both had a version of this book. That's why this only receives one star. The older version was much nicer, as it was not a big and bulky 3-ring binder. Also, there are a few sections that have not been changed for the better from the vesions we had.Unfortunately, while Amazon offered the older versions, they kept e-mailing saying there was a delay in the shipment. After 2-3 months of delays, I finally bought this newer version. I'm disappointed with the changes, but it's still one of the better books out there and I have it for both my children."},{"rating":"1","title":"overpriced.....","review":"After much research I enthusiastically ordered this product. Upon receipt I found the binder to be flimsy and the inside pages poorly designed. The poor print quality and design left me disillusioned. This binder won't stand the test of time as an heirloom. The well considered content is masked by poor graphics. Previous editions are superior."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best choice available","review":"This is probably the best choice available for baby books. It is the same one my mother used for me although, back in those days (1945) it wasn't ring bound. The binder is a nice feature for adding pages but it would be better if the pages were sturdier...maybe some ring reinforcement.Other than that I find this book more complete that most and better for adding useful data."},{"rating":"1","title":"My mother kept this baby book for me when I was a child","review":"My mother kept this baby book for me when I was a child. When I found out it was still in print I replaced each of my three son's baby books with this one. It is very complete and includes lots of good medical advice in the same section as the place to record the baby's information. For someone who does not journal well, this is great because it contains lots of fill-in-the-blanks.The three ring bound version is not as delightful as the one previously published by C.R. Gibson. The illustrations are very rough and I am concerned the holes in the pages will tear through. Unlike many three-ring binders, this one does not have a plastic insert to keep the pages from curling around the rings. Overall I am very disappointed with the quality of this latest version even given the \\"deluxe\\" cover."},{"rating":"2","title":"great musicianship","review":"Having been raised a classical musician, who also loves everything from Yes and Led Zeppelin to Tool and System of a Down, I am always looking for new things to expand our already bursting at the seams collection of eclectic music. Thanks to Minnesota Public Radio's The Current, we found Great Lake Swimmers. I think I have pretty high standards for my music and really seek complex composition and true musicianship. This album fits the bill. His voice is haunting and melodic, the banjo peaks your curiosity and the lyrics are wonderful. I recommend this to anyone looking for a great CD to listen to while having a cool summer drink."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simplicity as a virtue...","review":"I had never heard of Great Lake Swimmers when this album popped up as a suggestion here on Amazon. I listened to the sample tracks and read some of the reviews and gave it a try.Ongiara has become one of my favorite albums. The quiet, calm, soothing music and vocals of Tony Dekker are the perfect, relaxing end to days that are so often filled with nothing but noise. The perfect music for a long drive or to play in the background as you fall asleep. Simplicity is Tony Dekker's greatest virtue, but he never lets the music get boring or overly sleepy. It's just simple, beautiful music done well.There is a folksy americana sound to Great Lake Swimmers that is somewhat similar to Fleet Foxes or Iron & Wine, but that doesn't quite define their music just right. However you describe it, it's beautiful music. Give it a try."},{"rating":"2","title":"This One Caught Me Off Guard","review":"There's a much longer review in me but I need some time to process what is already a great album. Check it out."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great album by a talented group of musicians","review":"I had never heard of Great Lakes Swimmers until listening to their set on Mountain Stage. It was a short set but I knew I had to hear more of this band. This album is richly textured and gets better with each listen. I have been listening to it several times a week since I purchased the CD and have turned several friends on to Great Lakes Swimmers as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"funny how this came about","review":"I recently bought a zune mp3 player and today I decided to hit the shuffle all button. After a few hours the song \\"your rocky spine\\" started playing. I liked it instantly but was a bit confused because I had never heard it before. Aparantly it came preloaded on my zune and beat the odds (I have over 6000 songs on it right now) to reach my ears. So the point of review is twofold 1)you'll like this in an instant 2) unbelievably preloaded songs on an mp3 player is good advertising."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not quite cutting it.","review":"Rather bland, which was my initial reaction to the first listen. One year later -- still bland. It's too bad, I really like this band. Their self-titled debut is a must for any fan that likes Iron & Wine. So, skip this and buy self titled."},{"rating":"2","title":"A perfect collection","review":"It's new so the quality is superb. Also, each song leads to the next: this is a well put together collection. And finally, Parkening - what hasn't already been said - the phrasing is simply unbelievable in every song... sheer perfection of performance, and also the FEEL is better than I have ever heard on any CD... truly a Segovia celebration."},{"rating":"2","title":"A worthy heir to Segovia","review":"Parkening remains one of the few classical guitarists that I enjoy listening to. Unfortunately, I have not had the joy and opportunity to see him perform live, so my impression of his artistry is relegated to recordings only. This particular recording is superb, sublime, and sweetly performed. The emotion and intensity that Parkening embodies in his playing is noted in every nuance and expression as he plays, from pianissimo to forte'. Although I am not familiar with all of the pieces on this CD, I enjoy hearing them repeatedly. It would be quite interesting to put Parkening's recordings of these pieces alongside Segovia's, to compare and contrast the Teacher with the Student to see how they differ, if at all.I would recommend this as CD as a must-have for those who like Parkening's works, but I would not recommend it for the average classical guitar enthusiast, as I think there are probably better recordings of these pieces (certainly those of Segovia's).Peace Out."},{"rating":"1","title":"Parkening: Not worthy","review":"I don't understand why Parkening is hailed as such a brilliant artist and musician after people listen to this album, or any of his other recordings for that matter. The only reason that people admire him is because Chris has done a fantastic job of marketing himself to the degree that the public actually believes it. After hearing him play live last year, I concluded that he is one of the most insensitive, unmusical classical guitar players around today. His recordings may seem well done, yet hearing him live paints the true picture. If you love classical guitar, listen to the likes of Antigoni Goni, David Russell, Margarita Escarpa, and Roland Dyens."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dark Transcendence","review":"Simply beautiful! Darkness and light in constant struggle across every track. A tension not found in a lot of ambient music. Got it about the same time as I got a troubled resting place and see it as an indispensible companion. Turn out lights and try to sleep to it and see what happens! Spooky in the best way imaginable. Will suck the air out of any room at the right volume! Nothing compares.

If your not into \\"Dark\\" this problbly would not be for you.... On the other hand if you like \\"Dark Ambient\\" this CD is a classic like Trances and Drones... A must have"},{"rating":"2","title":"Robert Rich in top form","review":"Robert Rich is a very talented ambient, electronica artist. He is in the same category as Steve Roach and Brian Eno. Unfortunately, he releases a lot of noodling and has made more than a few albums that sounded like he was on auto-pilot. If you are a master of drones, this is easy to pull off. Just hold down those adjacent keyboard keys and power up your computer! His best albums are Somnium, Trances and Drones, and this one. These are true ambient soundscapes that are intelligently and thoughtfully put together, not simply allowed to drone on until the full 74 minutes of a cd elapse. This is highly recommended. These pieces are dark, somewhat uncomfortable, with an oppressive air about them. They are easy to get lost in. This sounds great being blasted from my car stereo. It is also lulling enough to put me into a deep sleep. Interesting to listen to actively. If you are getting into Rich, make this one of your first purchases."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dull disappointment","review":"As much of a Robert Rich fan that I am, I have to agree with what the other reviewers have to say. This collection is far too homogenous. While these soundscape pieces are vaguely reminscent of Robert's early work on \\"Trances & Drones\\", most of these tracks are indistinguishable from one another and become quite grating after 20 minutes, particularly the middle tracks (2-4). The lengthy first track has its moments and succeeds in capturing the feeling of deep outer space. \\"Liquid Air\\" is the really the standout track (and also appears on the \\"From Here to Tranquility Vol. 1\\" compilation). \\"Requiem\\" is also decent, but not quite on par with what Robert is capable of. This one is for Robert Rich completists only."},{"rating":"1","title":"a wrong musical path for Robert Rich","review":"This is Rich's worst CD, I actually traded this one back.

I got the impression that this CD was more intended to take one down \\"memory lane\\" than truly recreate and represent a Catholic High Mass. No nostalgia for me with this CD.

I'll tell you.First of all, the painting on the cover does not look like the actual woman in the film. One or two of the reviewers liked the way she looks. Okay, to each his own, but don't be surprised if you find her unattractive.Second, the nudity. No, she is NOT nude all the time. Nor half the time. Nor a fourth of the time. Nor... She's nude a few seconds now and then. No more than any other movie.Third, the movie is only 79 minutes, and the first four of them are skippable.The movie is mostly a man fighting with a Neanderthal survivor. Both behave more childishly than primitively. You'll see more convincing behavior in Clan of the Cave Bear.There are NO explicit sex scenes. Also, no effective sex scenes of any kind. Even the fight scenes are disappointing.Oh, and did I mention that the dialogue is a joke?Bottom line: for almost every viewer, this movie will not be worth watching even once."},{"rating":"1","title":"A young Vanity - nude - weird movie","review":"This is a very bizarre movie. Some Ape creature becomes friends with Vanity on an island where only she and her lover are. Her lover becomes jealous and then later the Ape creature and he battle over Vanity. Appears to be a dream. Vanity is cute and nude in the movie, but she hardly looks like herself. Very odd movie, if you are looking for Vanity nude, you are better off getting a copy of 52 pickup a better movie or Action Jackson. She shows skin in both. Here she does have a full frontal scene, but it is not all that long anyway."},{"rating":"2","title":"CAMPY","review":"This is one of Vanity's earliest movies and I found it very interesting and I did go out and buy it. There are a lot of nude scenes of Vanity but what grabs you is the acting in it. It's strange how although the theme of The Beauty and The Beast portrayed here and it's predictable out come can still be entertaining. The male lead is quite convincing in his maddness and the story is good. The film quality is good, and a nude Vanity is always good but what you'll enjoy mostly is that it's funny too."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ha!","review":"I got this for giggles. And boy was it funny.

The picture quality on the DVD isn't much better (if any) than the videotape and the story still sucks. Yea, Vanity gets naked but it's done in such an unsexy way that it's well unsexy. She looked sexier with clothes on in THE LAST DRAGON.The story if you can call it that is about Vanity pining for her ex-boyfriend, one night she falls asleep and has an 80-minute dream about them living on a tropical island together. Soon she finds a freaky looking gorilla and starts a relationship with him.

It's Tanya's island, sheesh!Somehow they manage to carry a huge tent, accessories, pots and pans, the whole nine yards, and set up camp on a beach near a jungle. Nakedness ensues. Girl meets Gorilla. Girl becomes infatuated with gorilla. Boy becomes jealous. Boy builds fort with a cage, keeps girl in cage. Okay, rewind. He builds a fort? Sure. All it takes is a bit of bamboo and a machete - oh and, in the real world, a month or two.Anyway, boy steals girl from gorilla, gorilla steals girl back from boy, gorilla is, er, not so nice after all ...Dumb movie, but worth it if you like flat-chested chicks frolicking about."},{"rating":"1","title":"no redeeming value","review":"anyone with an IQ over 40 and an old 8 mm camera could have done better.

Michael Douglas plays President Andrew Shepard who falls in love with lobbyist Sydeny Ellen Wade played by Annette Benning. For all you Michael Douglas fans out there, this movie is a must-see! Douglas is perfect as the President and at times (pay attention to his speech near the end) you almost wish HE was running for President....Hey, you never know. This is America after all!

As a reviewer, I do have to let you know that there is noticeable political bias here. I don't criticize it; just be aware of it.As romantic comedy, it works quite well, and the political setting elevates it so that one who usually doesn't like romantic comedy should give it a chance. Somebody compared this with DAVE, and this will appeal to those who liked DAVE.The cast definitely carries the picture. I'm not a Michael Douglas fan, but he's quite effective here, as is Annette Bening.As far as believability is concerned, sure, the movie misses here and there, but do we go to see a movie to see things exactly the way they are? I doubt that myself.This is a movie to enjoy, as long as you don't let the political bias bother you."},{"rating":"1","title":"An affair to remember, The american president & Love affair","review":"I was about to get in touch with you because my purchase has been a disaster. All 3 DVDs are not compatible with the European standards, and it says on the back of at least one of them that the item are not allowed to be sold outside USA and Canada. I did of course not recognice this before I had given them away as a present to my parents, they had for such a long time wanted these movies. It was a sad moment when they put the first DVD in the DVD player. So they are of course all unwrapped because I was sertain that a well known company like yours did not fool around with theyr customers......I am so dissapointed.I had to pay toll on them as well when they came to Norway, so if I get 3 new ones send I will have to pay toll once more???? Then the purchase is becoming rather expensive for me.So what can you do to make amends? I am rather angry about this.Rango"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a bad movie if you can overlook the politics","review":"There are some good lines in this movie and the acting is better than most. Unfortunately, the liberal slant of this movie tends to pull it down several notches.I think Michael Douglas did a good job in his role as the President. The writers went a bit overboard with their portrayal of the \\"evil\\" Republican (Richard Dreyfuss).Overall, it's a good drama/comedy. The speech that Michael Douglas makes at the end is a classic leftie diatribe...the other guys are all about symbolism, but I'm going to really do something about crime by getting assault weapons and hanguns off the street.

Basically, this movie is Hollywood's ecstatic dream of a Leftist president of a Leftist America getting acclaim for declaring that he is a \\"...card-carrying member of the ACLU...!\\" Well, aren't we all?If the script could have avoided gagging the viewer with a high-pressure liberal rant, this could have been a charming movie about a handsome cool widower President and a gorgeous and charming girfriend. That alone would have, or at least could have, have made for decent entertainment. But no, we simply have to take our medicine in the form of 200 proof Leftist bias, and unfortunately many of us just cannot choke it down.If you don't mind the bias, there is a decent (not great) movie in here somewhere. Good luck finding it. RJB."},{"rating":"1","title":"The American President","review":"A great movie. Arrived broken though. The attachment that holds the dvd in place is missing three holders.

The storyline however, is blatant liberal garbage, such as the president (Michael Douglas) proclaiming that the ACLU is an organization dedicated to defending the Bill of Rights, please, how sick can this get. But, what can one expect from the wackiest of liberal fanatics, director Rob Reiner, and a cast of Hollywood left wing nuts like Martin Sheen and super wacko-liberal Warren Beatty's wife, to name a couple.

No, I don't think you can. Every movie or television show the last fifty years involving politics has the Republican being a mean, evil guy. And the democrat is the supposed role model for the nation. This goes all the way back to \\"Seven Days in May\\" in the 60's, up through \\"The West Wing\\" and on into today's releases.

Having established that fact, I thorougly enjoyed it. Great cast. Almost true to life dirty politics.The political infighting, the lies, the mudslinging, the broken promises. If a real life portrayal was intended, it was, oh, about half as vicious as it really is in congress today.Had to remind myself that I was reviewing a movie, it was that engrossing at times. Not like, \\"Gosh, I just can't wait to see which lie is coming next\\", but that it did give a sometimes accurate view into today's congressional intrigue. Too bad that in real life, politics seldom reaches the level of actually doing good for our nation.Didn't intend a political sermon, but movies, at least a few of the well made, do tend to reflect society's actions, after all."},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic finally out on Blu-Ray","review":"This predecessor to \\"The West Wing\\" -- Sorkin's future work can be seen in many layers here -- is at long last on Blu-Ray.

Some good lines of dialogue cannot cover the preposterousness of the story, with a president too liberal for conservatives and sometimes too conservative for liberals!! It swerves too much and really only gets going in the last five minutes. In fact, it ends JUST as it was about to get really freakin' interesting!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Is there a conspiracy to prevent a decent version of this film from being released on DVD?","review":"Still non-anamorphic?

One can take it seriously or not depending on how politically involved one is (or how politically incorrect one is). This movie does have a dose of reality about but it is for fun. I have found movies in the main-stream that have mixed reviews are worth investingating. Don't take it so seriously and ENJOY!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great movie, so-so DVD","review":"One of my favorite movies. 100% feel-good (if your politics don't get in the way).However, the 2.35:1 letterbox format plays poorly on 16:9 screens. It only uses about half of my 60\\" screen and looks like less than that."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great Film!","review":"I have seen this movie so many times, and I never get tired of it. I saw it twice in the theatres and dozens of times on video and I just bought the DVD. It combines great romance with witty humor, political intrigue and fine acting performances. Douglas is brilliant considering he plays a president who is too good to be true. Benning is charming and competent (it is great to see that the female lead is not a \\"damsel in distress\\", but rather a person in her own right). Martin Sheen is fantastic. However, the best performance was by Michael J. Fox, who plays a presidential advisor perfectly. The film was touching, exciting, humorous, dramatic and intelligent. The musical score was also fantastic and added much to the film.

From the opening credits with a rich, presidential (although the Democrat leanings even begin here) score to the sharpness of the daily White House precision to the tough lobbying activities to the comfy-cozy apartment of Sydney Wade (Bening) and her sister to the fantasy courtship ride of a popular President who happens to be a witty and charming widower. Rob Reiner cuts a clean film which must have been easy with such outstanding script and acting talent at his disposal. I watched it back to back and the only thing leaving a sour taste in my mouth was the blatant Democratic party platform grandstanding. Obviously, each political party is passionate about their issues but I felt the movie \\"Dave\\" did a better job of blending liberal politics with a similar fantasy theme."},{"rating":"1","title":"2008 \\"reissue\\" is the old DVD in a new package","review":"Buyer beware: the 2008 \\"reissue\\" of The American President is simply the original DVD release in a new clamshell case. Although the new package describes this release as anamorphic (implying a new and hopefully better transfer than the awful original DVD release) it is not. You'll get the same, poor quality original release DVD. It IS widescreen, but in 4x3 letterbox format with a lot of artifacts. The movie is great, a real charmer, but it's hard to watch with such low picture quality. WHV has announced a Blu-Ray release of the film in late 2012, but I've seen nothing about a good quality DVD release to come. Four stars for the movie plus zero stars for the picture quality & misleading info about the transfer averages out to two stars. Skip this release."},{"rating":"1","title":"The American President","review":"Great movie, excellent acting! Annette Benning is priceless as the love interest in this film about a widower in the White House. He seeks a relationaship with an environmental lobbyist, of all things, and though their relationship is open and above board, the politicians use it against the incumbent during his run for reelection. Politics are ugly, but truth prevails in this optimistic movie. My husband and I love this one and we have watched it many times. We always love the ending because we enjoy love winning and truth being stronger than bad politics. Easily one of my favorites."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst DVD Transfer To Date","review":"It's hard to imagine how a DVD transfer could have been worse. Considering it is a dual-layer disk there is absolutely no excuse for the poor quality (artifacts, HUGE pixelation problems, etc.) and lack of extra features.

The picture quality is terrible and is akin to the kind of picture one would expect to find on a bootleg DVD. In fact, I have seen bootlegs with better picture quality than this.I would suggest waiting for a \\"Special Edition\\" release with a newer transfer. Or, one may consider the possibility of purchasing the Region 2/4 Edition, as I did (assuming, of course, that one has a multi-region player that can handle PAL). It is anamorphic and has a MUCH better transfer!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful movie, but DVD is poor quality","review":"I've always enjoyed watching this movie on TNT, which is what compelled me to purchase it on DVD. Michael Douglas is charming and believable as a man who falls in love while facing the continuous challenges of being both president of the United States and a politician fighting hard to get re-elected. The set design and the dramatic scenes with Douglas and his \\"cabinet members\\" and \\"high-level military personnel\\" were also very believable. However, the quality of the disk is grainy, and the \\"movie screen\\" format not only shrinks the images, but it also distorts them. The movie's frames \\"hang\\" in spots, suspending the action for seconds at a time on and off throughout the film. My recommendation: Stick to TNT's reruns."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of my favorites1","review":"This is one of my favorite mocies for a couple of reasons.

If Kyuss is hard to get hold of for you then this album is a good way to find some rarer songs. The live tracks too deserve a special mention.

The first incident completely ambushed me, and I didn't bother to continue to read to see if there was a second.The book went in the trash.I'm sure there are better authors who can tell an interesting alternate political story of the world, with stooping to what this author does.I mean come on, Stephen Kings novels are part Science-Fiction too, but they are put in the Horror section.

Reading it you quickly realize it is a world not just a story. A world of flesh and blood, cities and ice. From the first book to the last I found myself completely surrounded by a place that seemed realer than any science fiction I've ever read. Some say it's racist. It is, because the world is a world of prejudice and power. There are parts that are hard to read because they go to places you don't want to go. Some I still remember years after reading them. The villain is also the most believable and epic person you could imagine. The heros have flaws that make you wince sometimes.

It is a definately a male-orientated book. This book and indeed this entire series has countless injustices in it, but there is also some truth to some of the authors ideas. It is a book about power, and intrigue. It's about life and murder, senseless and practical. It holds within it the power to warp a person's personality so severely that at times I found myself questioning the ingenuity of my own mother. The good guys are sometimes hard to identify because the author apparently believes all men have dark sides and no one walks without corruption. The plots are always playing with each other. One of my favorite quotes from the book was \\"The relations of men cannot exist without the bitter consequences of power.\\" True that. True that. A splendid novel worthy of your cash and time.

When I found the first two books on Amazon, I got excited and started reading them again. I guess my standards have changed because I found the writing self-absorbed this time around. There were long meanderings that hammered certain plot points to death and then there was the overuse of some words like \\"shiver.\\" Warning, there are graphic scenes of sex and brutality that effectively illustrate the culture, but could have made the point with less excruciating detail. Yet . . . the plot continues to enthrall. The futuristic setting of a restored Chinese Empire that now rules the entire earth is gripping, and the characters are deep and well-drawn, like living people.

You are left with no indication of how to find the reference other than to use the \\"find\\" function. And even then, so many times there is no reference related to the question you are having ifficulty with... The real pity is that the books that this product is based on are good books, so if you do eventually find the correct reference in the .pdf file, you can usually get some good information.

Try to find a phone number or web url in the supplied documentationfor support. It does not exist."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disappointing!","review":"I Never expected anything like this from Cisco! The Books for CCNP are great but this Training kit is far from being a reasonable product! The Learning Mode is OK, but for the incorrect answers you have to dig yourself for the explanation thru the link they provide, which is painful. It would be great if the explanation is right there for you like most of the selftest software on the market. It would score on time saving and less pain on neck!The exam mode is the worst feature of this product. You don't have the option to choose an indivual exam mode. This feature is annoying since you must accept to test for all the subjects weather you're going to take a single exam or Not. GREAT!I don't recommend anyone to spend this much money on the product. Buy a selftest software that provides an answer and explanation, and you'll be glad you did!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"There Is An Update You Can Download!!","review":"Go to the Cisco Press website and download the CCNPTKUpdate1.exe file.

What a disgusting guide. I'm amazed that they can call it a \\"guide.\\" It's more of a low quality kind of toilet paper.My two major gripes are that there are not enough practice questions, and that the few answers of those included are not explained correctly. That's true of all English Literature review books, since the questions are all somewhat subjective, but this book contains the most severe problems.From cover to cover I finished this \\"book\\" in 1 hour. It's much too small to be effective. That's unfortunate, because if it had been a bit better, this book might have been worth your time. Move along, I recommend Peterson's AP Success.. Not great, but definately better."},{"rating":"2","title":"visionary true avant-garde music-maker","review":"The layered textured electronic rhythms of this cd are fantastic in how they remain -- simple -- but very complex. The repetitiveness of it, thick & thick, puts you in a, an um, thick world. One of the most exciting aspects of his music is how organically it's made. For instance, sometimes he just actually touches a wire to make the music running through it fizzle. I can't address in this review all the great ideas he has. He's good. His music is good. I hope I'm not just passing on an unsubstantiated rumor, but a great bit of information I was once told about him is that upon being asked what music he listened to, his response was to just sort of shrug & to say well nothing much really, Bach sometimes. Wild avant-garde composer & serious tabla-player, he's a whole expansive world of his own.

Not only do they not burn cleanly, but they've put some kind of extra layer of printable surface on the discs, making them large enough to get stuck in car cd players (or really, any slot-loading cd player, they're fine in tray loaders). I had to wedge the last one out carefully with a key. These are awful CD-Rs, I can't believe there's so many positive reviews.

They seem to have arrived undamaged despite the wrapping being broken, although other reviewers have complained of damage to the CDs during shipping. I burned a couple of them as music CDs without any problems. My printer was able to print on them nicely using my Epson printer, with the CD printing system.I plan on using these in my car audio system, but I have not tried them out yet. My only complaint, so far, is that they arrived without any secure way to keep them from being damaged during shipment. I feel that I was lucky with this order.Based on the price, how easy that my computer wrote to them, how easy it was to print on them, and the lack of a secure container during shipping, I have given this product 4 stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"White Top No Good","review":"The quality of the disc is fine as far as musical quality is concerned. The ink or whatever it is that makes up the white top, however, gets stuck in a lot of car stereos. This freaked me out the first time it did it.

From the very beginning, the scent stung my nostrils, I expected a well-established brand such as Kerastase to smell much better. While the product did make my hair slightly softer, the effect is not much different than using a $3 Pantene conditioner. Overall totally not worth the price. If you look at the ingredients, the main ones were water, cetearyl alcohol, and glycerin, the primary ingredients of cheap soap. I'm turning to something more natural. If you're looking for a good natural hair mask, a mashed avocado and honey are great. But I am never buying this again for sure."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth every penny!","review":"I LOVE this product!

I used this conditioner once and left it on for ten minutes in the shower. My hair really does not look or feel any different than any other deep conditioner I have ever used.

My split ends are virtually gone. My hair feels less frizzy, and it feels like it can actually grow long again. With dry hair, I coat the ends of my hair with it at night before I go to bed, and it needs to be rinsed out in the morning to get the product out, and my hair feels GREAT!

Also the layout of the book is odd - the full page photos are not of interiors so much as more like style pages, and the actual photos of interiors, which are of designers' homes, are fairly small so that I considered getting out my magnifying glass in order to see the details. There is a lot of writing and I began to wonder who she thought she was writing for.The other odd thing is that these homes were seemingly all in the United States.

I was disappointed. Having purchased it, I would say it should be categorized as a teaching aid, and the book itself suggests that it may be useful to doctors, nurses, or teachers-anyone whose work involves talking with people about their bodies. Unfortunately the book is for sale at Amazon in a section that suggests it is an art book. The coy cover also suggests that this will be a book that seeks to explore the female genitalia in terms of the abstract beauty of the human body. It was on that assumption that I bought it, anyway. In fact, the photographs have little artistic appeal. They are quite clinical. There is little erotic appeal either-for the same reason. If you need a set of examples of female genitalia for some illustrative purpose, this book is fine. If you are seriously interested in art photography, go elsewhere. If it's pornography you're after, hit the newsstand-or your browser button."},{"rating":"1","title":"Interesting subject with boring solutions","review":"The subject of this book, the female genitalia's close study, could have been handled in various very interesting ways. Unfortunately the photographer did not choose any of the ways I'd find interest in. All the pictures are set in the same way, no playfulness, or any ideas conveyed beyond just plainly showing the subject. I admit, it is a question of taste, one's idea about what photography is for.

As I see it, the importance and beauty of this book is its willingness to portray women's genitals in an honest, non-sexualized way. Art or abstraction is entirely opposite to the purpose of portraying the reality of women's bodies, as free as possible from the typical conceptions of Western culture (think of how naked women are usually shown in canonical art, or, better yet, pornography). The remark one reader made that many of the vulvas depicted would scare male readers is quite telling. They might scare a lot of readers, and the confrontation and analysis of that fear is what makes this book immensely important rather than just visually beautiful."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Important Work of Art","review":"A number of reviewers here have objected to the classification of the images in 'Femalia' as art, on the grounds that they fail to measure up to their aesthetic ideals. But art, as any public gallery worth the name will attest, is far more than mere pretty pictures.True Art challenges one's worldview. And 'Femalia' certainly does that. It is a brave and lonely voice challenging the contemporary view of the female body, so overwhelmingly submerged in fantasy and falsification.This is an important work. I highly recommend it to any man genuinely interested in the female form, and to any woman estranged from her own."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fascinating, shows off the variety of female genitalia","review":"These photographs are fascinating. The female genitalia are at once the most provocative, and the least depicted, part of the human anatomy. I know of nowhere else you can see the great variety of size, shape and color.

It is good film, lots of back story and good acting. It gets a litle slow in the middle, but picks up. It is about a group of friends who take the cable car up from Palm Springs to the top of the mountian for a private party. The owner of the cable car is one of the friends. Lightning strikes the wheels and melts the wheels to the cable. As they hang there, the cable slowly startes to snap. During this there are flashbacks that shows their life as friends and it all plays out like an episode of Knott's Landing. I live pretty close to where this was filmed. I went up on this cable car once. It was not fun. It is frightening enough without having to worry about it breaking."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hanging By A Thread","review":"This movie is awesome!

I was pleased with its appearance when it arrived but quite disappointed when I put it to use. It has a nice whistle but when you pour, water seeps out from under the lid in addition to the spout. This is messy and a little dangerous. I am packing it up and shipping it back today. I think Amazon would do their customers a good service if they pulled it from their inventory."},{"rating":"2","title":"A wonderful first look at physics","review":"This book is a pleasant, painless introduction to particle physics and the applications of symmetry in the universe. I could see how it might annoy an experienced physicist with entire chapters full of metaphors and analogies intended to solidify the reader's understanding of the concepts, but for a beginner these are quite helpful. It also includes a long and detailed history of the major discoveries in atomic physics, which is a tiny bit too long, but still informative and well written.

This is like any other psuedo-analytical Evolution debunking book on the market, the author attempts to belittle Evolution (and he obviously has no real grasp on the theory) by listing supposed logical attacks by Creationists and NEVER once gives the scientific explanation to refute the mis-informed claims. Bottom line is, this is not a book which will even give you an ioda of understanding of Evolutionary Science, it is simply a collection of biased rhetoric written by a Creationist with the sole purpose of making other Creationists feel justified in their silly beliefs. If you are a person who wants FACT and TRUTH, I suggest you read something about Evolutionary Sciences, because this book just goes to show, anyone who disagrees with Evolution can't fully comprehend it and would rather find solace in some imaginary hocus-pocus God of their mind's invention."},{"rating":"1","title":"weak and disappointing.","review":"This is a poor film. The storyline seems to have potential at the start but totally fails to deliver. The biggest flaw in the film for me was that I failed to make any kind of connection with the main characters especially that of George (Daniel Auteil). I had no empathy for them whatsoever which turned into a disinterest as the film rolled on. I've no problems with Juliet Binoche, she is a brilliant actress and did what she was asked but in this instance it was far too little. She is capable of conveying so much more feeling than this. In my opinion the weakness of this film is due to the director, the story is ok and could have been so much better. One final note which I did not like about the film; there is a scene where a cockerel clearly has it's head cut off. Although this happens throughout the world everyday I thought the days of harming animals for films had passed us by."},{"rating":"1","title":"Limited play value","review":"I usually love Melissa and Doug toys.

This Cd is not good as the first, but there are 2 killer infamous tracks: \\"gangstas roll\\" and \\"My Priorities\\".

Problems we noticed right away: The whistle is not loud enough to be heard from another room, plus the lid fits so tightly that it has to be pried out with a knife, and water boils out around the handle of the lid. Although we washed it every day and refilled it with bottled water, within three months, the bottom of the inside was pitted and rusting!

A southern shrub planting must have plants like these that provide evergreen fullness and color! More importantly it lacks clarity --- it just rambles on from one page to the next with no page breaks from one shrub to the next, and the main info you need to know about a shrub is either hard to find or non-existant. I recommend buying Taylor's 50 Best Shrubs for anyone, beginner or pro, and forget this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poorly written","review":"Although easy to read, this book was poorly written and in sore need of editing. I was rather annoyed at mispelled words and portions of text missing. The logic at times was rather weak and Mynchenberg does more borrowing of ideas from other people than developing ideas of his own. As someone who has studied both physics and evolution I felt as if his review of these was a virtual whirlwind. This portion of the book should have been condensed and important points made rather than just listing facts/theories. Scientists and especially non-scientists would find this area quite boring. His criticisms of religion are less than novel and if you are really interested in reading a quality critique of religion try Thomas Paine's, The age of reason. Despite the impressive title, this book is a disappointment."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice, but not what I'd hoped for","review":"I watched this product on Amazon for a long time, waiting for an acceptable price. I'm glad I waited. It is a high-quality product, but not quite what I was hoping for. If you're looking for a supplement with ideas on how to integrate American Indian-style characters into the D&D world, this isn't it. It is a very specific setting, largely separate from the rest of the world, and the Atruaghin are based VERY loosely on the actual, historical people they resemble. Don't get me wrong, the exterior artwork is beautiful, the new spells are interesting, and the backstory is well-thought-out; it just wasn't what I wanted it to be."},{"rating":"2","title":"My Favorite Movie","review":"This is absolutely my favorite movie of all time and I have seen it over 100 times.

She also is trying to do what she thinks God has demanded her to do as a Christian. The young man tests her kindness, but in the end God works everthing out for the both of them.This is a good book for teachers to read for encouragement when they are faced with students who they have to dig deep to find potential in. Teachers could greatly benefit from reading about this young man and how the older lady dealt with him.We rate this book a four because it was slow reading. It took a while to get to the core of the story. We think young students would have a hard time following the slow beginning. Overall it is a good book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Review of Walking by Wayne Davis and Tracey Arnold.","review":"Mattie Rigsbee is the personification of a truly Southern lady.

She has two children who have very little time for her, so she spends her time taking in stray dogs, juvenile delinquents, leading the Lottey Moon offering at church, and cooking for anyone who will come by her house. She often finds herself in quite a predicament, such as being stuck in a chair for hours before the dog catcher finds her, or taking in an escaped criminal.

The setting, characters, and theology are all loosely depicted...bland such that they are familiar and unquestionable. I finished the book knowing as much about the characters and their takes on the world as I did upon first being introduced to them.I did enjoy some of the humorous scenes with Mattie, the undauntingly good-hearted protagonist, and the coloquial dialogue, and I do recommend reading it if you have a couple uncommitted hours and can borrow the book from someone.

I was lucky to find a copy in a local store so I could thumb through it before an actual purchase.

The interiors are not \\"inspiring\\" and there is really nothing about these rooms that one would want to emulate. This is particularly disappointing given the resources the homeowners must have had at their disposal. Attractive photographs do not make up for lackluster ideas.One other point - it is my opinion that the three 5-star reviews given to this book must have been written either by friends of the author or perhaps employees of the publisher.

The video game references were fantastic and was thoroughly funny through and through. I went into this movie expecting to see a decent film, but WOW, I did not expect this. After seeing it on opening day, I was pleasantly suprised how well the comic book effects worked and how great the acting was. I later decided to see it a second time in the theatre, a. because it was one of the best movies I've ever seen and b. because I wanted to make sure I felt the same way about it the second time, and I laughed just as much the second time through as I did the first.

After seeing this I bought the graphic novel to read as well, but the live action movie really brings these odd characters to life.

The movie makes fun of itself, and is just a joy to watch. I love the 3rd villian - Go Vegan Power!

But do not under any circumstances download this movie! Buy it in stores. That is the sole reason for the 1 star rating. The download comes with digital rights management (DRM). This makes it impossible to watch the movie on anything but the computer you download it on. You cannot burn it to a dvd, you cannot transfer it over to personal computers. I bought this download for a friend for Christmas since I couldnt find it in stores. Now I have to re-buy this movie because I can't copy it over to my friends computer or burn it for them."},{"rating":"1","title":"How in the hell did anybody like this movie?","review":"This movie is THE WORST movie I've ever seen. I saw all the good reviews and decided to watch it because it sounded like a really good comedy. I didn't laugh one time during this movie and I thought its attempt to humor failed miserably. I can't believe I wasted a dollar renting it and I also can't believe I watched it all the way through. It blows my mind as to how many people actually liked this movie. K.O."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mehhh complete kids flick, but rated adult.","review":"Unless your ages 12 - 17 this movie is not for you. The worst part is that is a Adult movie that plays like a cartoon network show. A little like adult swim, but not as good. I have never written a review before, but for this movie I was so mehhh I had to. Do not rent this movie, If you want to watch it do it on netflix, though don't expect to watch the whole thing and enjoy it.It reminds me of kickass, but without all the things that made it a good movie. I gave it two stars because despite not liking it I kept watching, I would compare it to animal planet, where you know the poor baby giraffe is gonna get eaten by the lions but you can't turn anyway, or a video of someone throwing puppies in a river, its wrong on so many levels but you keep watching to see how much worse it can get."},{"rating":"1","title":"What the ......... Was this actually a movie?","review":"I don't drink or take drugs, but that might be the only way to appreciate this movie. Sanity called and wants my TV back. I am very frightful of the future due to the positive reviews this movie has received. If I feel dumber for having watched this thing, what about those who don't even realize they are dumber from having watched it. I will admit that it wasn't the dumbest as there was a few entertaining points to it, but overall I was stunned at the presumably acid induced idiocy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst movie I have ever seen","review":"After watching the first 5 minutes of this movie, I was blown away by how utterly terrible it is. We wanted to turn it off and just watch TV but we decided to stick it out. Bad choice. The movie didn't get any better. It just kept going down this slope of stupidity. I swear whoever made the movie was on acid the whole time. We watched it on bluray, the picture was very grainy and disappointing. Will not watch ever again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Thank God I rented it first!","review":"Ug. What a horrible movie. I am so open-minded when it comes to movies...you don't even know. I could tell from the first 20 minutes that I wasn't going to enjoy this one. I sat through it anyway because I don't believe in walking out or turning off a movie when it's not finished. Otherwise, you can't really form an opinion. I can't even explain how much I disliked this one. I didn't get one bit of it. Let's just say my roommate walked through the living room a few times and caught bits and pieces of Scott Pilgrim and he thought it looked horrible. He was right. lol I can't find one thing to defend in this movie. Not even gorgeous Chris Evans could save this one for me. :("},{"rating":"1","title":"was this intended for children?","review":"I would leave a long discouraging review but this movie already waisted 2hrs of my life so I'll keep it short and say don't waist your time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great movie, don't buy the blue-ray","review":"Loved the movie, purchased the blue-ray.But Sony decided to put eight minutes of CRAP advertising at the load of the blue-ray, that cannot be skipped, fast-forwarded through, or bypassed in any way. Who wants to watch previews for crap movies EVERY time a disc is loaded?So, I'm returning the blue-ray.I probably won't be buying any more blue-ray discs, cause I hate this advertising crap they put in, and you have to watch this putrid crap every time you want to watch the movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Quality film making","review":"I saw the movie, and I absolutely loved it.

To conclude, what can I say but \\"We are Sex Bob-bomb, 1-2-3-4!\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"A Weirdly Appealling Mishmash","review":"I'd never heard of this movie or the book that it was apparently based on, but watched it last night. This movies is a weirdly appealing mishmash of twenty-something angst, a comic book plot, videogame fight sequences and hard-driving punk rock. It's also one of the funniest movies I've ever seen with a huge number of laugh out loud sequences and dialog, example:Scott, picking up a guitar: \\"I wrote a song about you.\\"(plays a tender, haunting song mostly repeating the name Ramona)Ramona, after song ends: \\"That was nice, let me know when you've finished it.\\"Shot of Scott looking perplexed.Ramona: \\"Back then I was bi-curious.\\"Female Evil-ex: \\"Now I'm BI-FURIOUS!\\"I'm not going to get into the plot of the movie, which is mostly irrelevant anyway. This film is just an escapist roller coaster. Forget about anything making sense and enjoy the ride. It's a blast."},{"rating":"2","title":"I'm not going to repeat what everyone else said but...","review":"This movie is freaking hilarious! It is an over-the-top action movie featuring some creative film making. The whole premise of the movie is that the main character dumps his cute Chinese girlfriend \\"Knives\\" for a more alternative bad girl type. She gives him her number with seven x's below which he believes symbolize kisses. It turns out that they are her \\"seven deadly x's\\" each of whom he must battle in a Tekken-style fight. Whenever he wins the fight, arcade music plays and coins fall out, which he gladly swipes up.WARNING: If you can't handle some cheesy humor, some gayness, alternative music, and video games. This film is not for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"I so Lesbians this movie!","review":"This movie is great. Best movie of 2010. I did not expect this to be a good movie before I watched it. Boy was I wrong. It's a non stop ride that left me exausted and happy at the same time. It's definitely an experience more than a movie. It's clever in its script and the actors all work together to make it a fresh movie experience. This could have been done wrong and been very cheesy but the clever dialog, editing and special effects along with fun actors makes this movie great. Highly reccommend this movie. You are guaranteed to lesbians this movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful Format","review":"The format of the movie clarly places it within the confines of a video game, and it has all of the halmarks that a 5 start game would contain, well blended into a solid movie.

The characters acting was juvenile, the \\"hero\\" (Scott Pilgrim)a total unbelievable dork (if that was the point, than it was cast very well), the girl who played Ramona Flowers was disgusting, as was the Asian girl who was CrAzY in love with Scott (you have GOT to be kidding me). My 13 y/o had this on while we sorted thru her sock drawer (me doing most of the sorting, her watching this trash), and believe me, the sock sorting was A+ compared to this mindless drivel. This movie was horrid - please don't waste your money adding it to your DVD collection. Watch it thru Netflix or on the net if your that curious."},{"rating":"1","title":"This film is a poison to society.","review":"This is the most violent film I have ever seen in my life.Lucas Lee is a famous actor who DIES in a skateboarding accident after Scott dares him to grind a rail that leads to oblivion. No one seems to care that this famous actor has just died. No news report on his death. No ambulance. No signs of remorse from anyone. Nothing. Scott smiles and cheers when Lucas dies. He's proud that he KILLED someone.The fact of the matter is : Scott Pilgrim is a murderer who seems to only care about himself. He gets all whiny about some relationships and stuff, but shows zero remorse when he commits murder. This film's lack of basic logic is astonishing.The comic series (and I use the word \\"comic\\" lightly. Scott Pilgrim isn't worthy of being in the same category) is already bad enough. Now we have a movie?Do not buy this. Buy something good, like Twilight Eclipse."},{"rating":"1","title":"A modest \\"student film\\"","review":"Except for the expensive CGA work, this seems like the production of a Canadian undergrad film school student.

I consider the outlandish promotion of two young men french kissing to be an abomination of the highest order.Do not buy this DVD unless maybe you don't mind son turning out to be kinda funny."},{"rating":"1","title":"Scott Pilgrim","review":"I started watching this movie expecting more than what it really turned out to be. Some movies exist in a fantasy world where impossible things happen, but you know that going into them and that's exactly what they were made to be, where Scott Pilgrim tries to be a normal movie in a normal world with all kinds of impossible stuff going on in it, and nobody in that world finds it odd. The special effects are pretty good in the movie and the last fight scene with the G-man is pretty cool, but the overall movie was too odd and sometimes boring. The part Michael Cera plays is also old and worn out. It was funny to watch in his first movie, but really didn't help the movie here since its the same basic character he plays in every movie. I guess if you have read and enjoyed the books you will probably enjoy the movie. Those that have not may find this to be not worth watching."},{"rating":"1","title":"PUSHES THE LIMITS OF THE GENERATION GAP!","review":"Boy! Do I feel old.....I'm usually a pretty hip guy, but this film made me feel like I was 80 years old. Scott Pilgrim leaves a lot to be desired...if you're over 40(maybe younger?). I admire the fact that they tried to do something fresh, but I found myself getting bored with the \\"bad trip\\" antics after 20 minutes or so. I have always liked Cera, so that wasn't the problem and I like movies that think outside the box, but this one just flew over my head....WAY OVER!If you're younger(20 something or younger)you will probably like this frantic train wreck of a farce, but for anyone who was born before 1970, this one will leave you scratching your head(and reaching for an aspirin bottle!)and bored to tears! If ever a film separated the genration gap to its limit, Scott Pilgrim IS THAT FILM!!I wasn't going to review this film, but my Twin Andrew gave it such a glowing review(youngster that he is!:-D) I just had to tell the tale of the other side of the coin. ;-b"},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't get it","review":"Made it through 45 minutes of the movie. Did not like it whatsoever. Not my type of film. Thought it was pretty ridicuolous."},{"rating":"1","title":"not so great","review":"Seeing all the amazing reviews here I decided to buy this movie, but it was very disappointing. I loved the style of the movie, but I thought that the action was mellowed down. There was so much potential to make this a hardcore action flick, but they decided to make it funny, and is not good funny. The comedy that is thrown at you is pathetic, sometimes funny, but mostly baaad.Again, the style of the movie is quite refreshing and I really liked that. But by the end of it, I was wondering why I bought this movie at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fantastic Flop","review":"Like others, I expected a lot more from this movie. Based on the previews and description, I believed it would be a great, funny movie. I was disappointed. I found it to be childish and, well, stupid.

If you want to see this movie, I suggest you rent it, that way you will have only lost maybe $5, rather than $20."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pointless, a waste of time and energy","review":"I couldn't even get through the whole thing.

The combination of Michael Cera's awkward humor and Aubrey Plazas deadpan style performance made this movie for me. Great for when you want to watch something ridiculously over the top and funny."},{"rating":"2","title":"7 Evil Exes... and Sex Bob-omb!!!","review":"This movie was highly underrated in the theaters and did not get the publicity I think it deserved. At its core, it is a romantic love story. At face value, it is a collision of pop culture, video games, film, comic books, anime, and action martial arts films. Edgar Wright did a wonderful job, in my opinion, of capturing the comic book it is derived from, and his direction makes for a very fun action packed heartfelt film. Highly recommend the BluRay version as some of the action sequences only look better in hi-def."},{"rating":"2","title":"Napoleon Dynamite Meets Dragon Ball Z And Nintendo O__O","review":"This movie is an awesome combination of Napoleon Dynamite, Dragon Ball Z, and Nintendo video games. I saw the movie first, and it was awesome. Then, i read the books, and the books were better than the movie. But anyway, the movie was great and fun. It should've been animated like the books. But who cares, Scott Pilgrim FTW!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A pop-culture smoothie","review":"A pop-culture smoothie blending old school video games, live action anime, and mumblecore cinema with a squeeze of the 60sBatmanTV show. The proportions are just right to deliver a tasty treat. Michael Cera's stock Michael Cera character plugs perfectly into the story. I know he's making bank playing this character but, good god, I'd like to see him do something different. Even Schwarzenegger shows more range than this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing movie!","review":"I feel kind of silly rating and reviewing such a mainstream movie since most people are going to see it and decide on their own what they think. I do feel most will either love it or hate it not much room for the it was just okay crowd (a little though).However, I am part of the loved it crowd. Of course that is why I bought it, in today's world there is no reason to buy a movie you don't like since one has a 1001 ways to rent/view a movie before buying now."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Movie of the Year","review":"Of course this movie is pointed at a certain demographic (of which I'm in), but even if you're not there is an artistic style here that anyone could appreciate. Visually attractive, has been labeled a movie for the \\"a.d.d\\" generation. Could be, but you must admit that it's a movie of quick wit, in it's dialog and how it's edited. Edgar Wright is an amazing director and it shows here, even if you don't care for the content.Now speaking for one that grew up in the 80's and 90's playing 8-bit nintendo games, this is the movie of the year, from my point of view... This movie is an anthem to retro gamers of that time frame, probably the first videogame related movie to come out that was truly handled with care. It's already a classic in my eyes, I'll be enjoying this flick years from now. It's an amazing movie that hits a spot Hollywood has never been able to successfully hit before."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cant get enough of it!","review":"This movie is a gem and instant cult classic.Within the first 15 Minutes of the film I found myself laughing to all the small jokes in the film.I have been back 3 times to see this movie, and pick up new things every time I see it.From the font they randomly display on the screen to the little details from the comics.I highly recommend this as one of the best movies that's honestly original."},{"rating":"1","title":"worst movie ever!","review":"Need I say anything additional.

Ugh hated it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"THIS MOVIE IS TORTURE TO WATCH","review":"Cannot even begin to convey how much I hated this movie. It is so NOT entertaining. It is so pointless. It is so mind-numbingly bad in every respect--writing, directing, acting, editing, cinematography, sound, SFX. This movie should be used by the CIA in their secret overseas prisons as a torture device--just strap their prisoners into a chair and make them watch this movie (I mean torture device) and I'm sure by the second or third viewing the detainees will be screaming to give up any information they have. Yes, this movie is that painful to watch. I went into it with huge hopes because I am a huge fan of Edgar Wright. I consider Shaun of the Dead and Hot Fuzz to be masterfully made films in all regards. Unfortunately, it seems like Wright is going to be one of those wildly uneven directors who makes both the best and worst movies of all time. Hopefully this movie will be Wright's all time worst. It's hard to believe any movie could be worse than Scott Pilgrim."},{"rating":"1","title":"Please, someone stop Michael Cera","review":"I wanted to like this movie. Appreciation for comic-book culture: check. Appreciation for video-game culture: check. Appreciation for well-crafted irony: check. Little did I suspect that after my wife and I decided to rent this movie for a quiet night together, we would spend the entire playing time wishing (a) that we had rented something else, and (b) that we could punch Michael Cera in his whiny, emasculated face until he promised never to act again. If it had cost more than $3 I would be requesting a refund."},{"rating":"1","title":"very original great movie, but it eventually bored me to death...","review":"I understand all those people who liked it or over loved it.I thought it was original and kind of fun. But there was absolutely nothing that I loved in this movie.In the end... I was just bored to death. Actually, even before the end, right from the beginning, but somehow I was expecting something to actually happen in this movie. Nothing happened. It's just a loser who's 22, going out with high school girls he won't even kiss, and who \\"kind of falls in love\\" with a weird girl who's way too cool for him...I guess this movie was way too cool for me.

I'm surprised by all of the negative reviews really. It's exactly what it should have been. Granted, the comic version is a bit different but this movie really retained the feeling of the comic. Michael Cera did a perfect job bringing Pilgrim to life.I would have given this 5 stars. The only reason I didn't was because of the packaging. I wanted the DVD/Blu-Ray version. When it arrived, the packaging only mentions the Blu-Ray specs with absolutely no mentioning of a second disc. I ended up contacting Amazon support because the only way I would know there was a second disc was to open it and rendering it unreturnable by their standards. Turns out there was a second disc (tech support offered to accept the return if it was wrong).

I don't want this guy to get the girl, or any girl, or anything. I want the League of Evil Exes to crush him. I want to see him badly broken and working in a McDonald's to make ends meet, lamenting on his wasted youth. He's terrible. The special effects, the amazing and very entertaining supportive cast and the quirky humor saved his from being a one star, but with the main character of the movie being so unlikeable I couldn't get past a two star.

It was easier putting the new one in than taking the old one out. And as far as performance goes it far surpasses our old one. It's easy to use and quite powerful for a compact microwave. The only negative was the price, but the performance makes up for it. I would highly recommend this LG, especially to anyone who needs to replace a microwave in an RV where space is limited."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very scholarly","review":"Was too scholarly for me, though very detailed and well footnoted historical record.

It covers a large span of history in each chapter, but each chapter is only about 8-10 pages. In such little space, it leaves no room except to give a few quotes and then largely leave the author's biased view that Joseph was not inspired, a sexual miscreant and was ready to murder to hide it. So be it, I've seen such before, but this book should not purport to be a balanced view of the subject which is what I was looking for."},{"rating":"2","title":"Most accurate and unbiased study available in print","review":"This is a very well-researched and balanced history of Mormon fundamentalism. As a former polygamist myself, I am impressed with the author's ability to look at all the available information and report it fairly. If I were to have any criticism, it would be that he doesn't sufficiently consider the axes that some of his sources (especially 19th century ones) were grinding -- but perhaps that is because he doesn't seem to have one of his own. Most information on Mormon polygamy is _very_ biased, either in favor or against. This is one book that doesn't lean either way, but just tells the story. And whether \\"Latter-day Saints\\" like it or not, there ARE other people who are _NOT_ members of their church, but whose allegiance to the Book of Mormon and to the teachings of Joseph Smith (many now disavowed by the LDS) nevertheless qualifies them to be called \\"Mormon\\" -- and the Mormon fundamentalist polygamists are among them!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Anti-LDS","review":"I considered the content of this book to be very anti-LDS. The author said that he was just stating facts, but he quoted a lot of \\"hear-say\\" rumors. He spent a large portion of the book slandering the Prophet Joseph Smith. If someone is looking for an anti-LDS book, I believe they will enjoy this one. But if they are looking for an honest history of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day-Saints, I would say to keep on looking. For a book that presents both sides, yet doesn't get sleazy, I would suggest \\"The Bible & Polygamy, Does the Bible Sanction Polygamy?\\" It is published by Archive Publishers in Grantsville, Utah."},{"rating":"1","title":"There are no \\"Mormon\\" groups who currently practice that!","review":"The LDS church excommunicates any member who enters into a polygamist marraige.

What's commendable about this video is that she really takes time to EXPLAIN HOW TO PROPERLY DO EACH MOVE, and she gives good advice to how to modify the move for people who are not as strong or have bad backs. It really makes a beginner not feel lost in terms of how to coordinate the new motions. However, for anyone who is beyond the absolute beginner level, this tape is VERY BORING FOR MORE ADVANCED USERS because more than half workout time is spent listening to her talk about how to do each move, rather than just doing the moves; even after the 1-hour workout I felt like I only did 15minutes of exercise, so it was a waste of my time.

The basic workout is 20 minutes, and the advanced is around an hour.

But let me be fair, her moves would help show more toned muscles on people who are already slim. However, to claim that you'd lose the weight doing her program...I don't think so.

However, the frame does not support, well, anything heavier than clothing. I had scrap-booking supplies in this item and the wheels broke off. I could understand that if I had filled it with paper or something heavier but it had inks and stamp pads and markers and other not-so-heavy items along with some paper and the wheels still broke off. The first one came off the first few days I had the cart. The second was about a week later.

We bought them to store our son's Legos and K'Nex. They worked fine for that purpose, and he liked that he could roll them around to where he was building something. When he outgrew his toys, I \\"borrowed\\" these units to store craft supplies, because they fit neatly beneath the lowest shelf in my craft closet. I did not store heavy items in them, but discovered that after opening the lower drawers, you can't get them to close again without pulling out the unit and physically lifting the drawer back onto its little seat. This is inconvenient and is some kind of design flaw. I have replaced them with new, narrower drawer units which work much better and hold a lot more stuff more efficiently -- just a better solution for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Really helpful item!","review":"This is not the first time I've purchased this item. While living in a camper with my daughter and granddaughter for several years, we needed a place for clothes that fit into the one bedroom we had, so I had ordered more for them. I was able to put two in the closet and two under the bedroom counter area. They fit perfect without the wheels. Now my son and grandson live with me and they needed a quick, inexpensive way to store their clothing as well. I ordered these from Amazon.com and was absolutely AMAZED that while I was reading the confirmation email that thay had shipped, they were being placed on my front porch! I've never seen anything so fast! One word of caution: do NOT sit anything heavy on the top or it will eventually sag down making it difficult to open the top drawer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome !!!","review":"I had been looking for something like this for a while but all of the ones i found seemed to be too expensive, however, for the price it was perfect for extra storage and it looks great, I LOVE IT."},{"rating":"2","title":"Organization on a big scale from Amazon.com","review":"I'm so tired of rummaging through boxes looking for things in my closet.

I can see why Amazon sells for double the price because you are actually paying for packaging and shipping. Sterilite made this drawers with different width. The ones that is not too wide as this works a little better. I only use this one to store baby clothes, towels next to the changing table because I can see it at the store the plastic will not hold anything heavy. The sliding drawers are not smooth after you put stuff in it. When it is totally empty they slide fine. I put a radio digital clock on top of the drawers and over time the top started to bend so the top drawer cannot close all the way.

This cart arrived damaged and used, it was covered in animal hair, sticky glue and had four broken holes where the wheels were supposed to go, one wheel didnt even match the other 3. I will never buy another item from Sterilite again. The good news is Amazon arranged for it to be picked up immediately and will refund my money that I spent for this."},{"rating":"1","title":"streilite drawer disappointment","review":"I bought this item to store craft supplies. Unfortunately, the drawers aren't strong enough to support the weight that the size allows. I don't think it can function with anything heavier than socks. The top is not reinforced so if you place anything on it, it soon warps which prevents the top drawer from closing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Broke instantly","review":"Take heed that this flimsy excuse for a cart can only handle the lightest items.

I bought this to hold paper instruction manuals and once I had the drawers more than half-full they started to sag. With all 3 drawers closed it is functional but don't expect to be opening and closing it when it's got stuff in all 3 sections. Even rolling it around at that point was an issue since the drawers can 'deform' the frame as it rolls around. I did a lot of rearranging (heavier papers in the bottom drawer) to see whether it made much difference---nope! Might be an inexpensive solution for excess underwear, socks, or ties, but not anything heavier."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good one for household stuffs","review":"I keep my books, sometimes clothes and sometimes food as well in it.

It did take a little while to figure out how to flip up the whistling cap and keep it up. (As a side note, the whistle is very soft until it's almost ready to boil over). My problem is that the enamel on the bottom is chipping horribly and worsens every time I use it. So, I'm in the market for a new kettle already."},{"rating":"1","title":"I don't think it's broken","review":"I see other people have gotten this and thought it was broken. I thought mine was, too, but I think it's actually just really poorly made. The button on the top flips the whistle-part up, but you have to manually flip it back down by pressing on that whistle part. Sometimes when you flip it down, it snaps back into place, but sometimes it doesn't go back all the way. I tried to force it down, but it just pops back up again, and the whistle doesn't work with it open like that. I looked at it, and nothing appeared broken. I gave up and returned it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Little Red Teapot!","review":"I had this exact teapot before in yellow but I really wanted it in red and couldn't find it anywhere. I finally found it on Amazon and was so happy! I love this kettle because it has the spring on top that you can just push down on to open the spout so you don't burn your hands or have to use an oven mitt. Amazingly so many kettles DON'T offer this feature. You can also remove the cover in the middle to easily fill the kettle."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hit with the kids","review":"We use these short videos as a bedtime treat when a full length video won't do.

Was first disappointed to see that they used an unnecessarily large double-wide DVD case for this release. It's such a waste of space on the shelf. However, I was devastated to look at the back and discover this was presented in 1.33:1 FULL FRAME. This show is aired in 16:9 widescreen in the UK and released in that format there.

You don't have to feel too guilty about watching it because it doesn't play out as an educational show - just a bit of entertainment that parents wouldn't object to showing their kids. Really it's a slapstick silent comedy (with clay sheep), and the characters show personality without ever saying a word. Plus, the Wallace & Gromit creators dip into a huge pool of cultural references that's really entertaining to spot in various shorts.Looking at the discs, well, we have a 16:9 widescreen image that was *squeezed* into a 4:3 frame rather than cropped, making everything look squished together.

Anyone outside of the Christian faith was portrayed as either total evil or hapless lambs. Apparently, there was no strength exhibited unless you gave yourself to Christ. Very little is mentioned about those Christians who actively worked throughout the war, putting their lives at risk, to help. Our 'heroine' looked the other way during the war and reaped the benefits of being SS until things changed. At the end of the book I felt the author, with all of her research trips, missed the opportunity to fulfill the promise of the setup of the story. I felt like I was promised one story line and halfway through it totally changed. VERY DISAPPOINTING! A missed opportunity by the author."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good read","review":"I enjoyed this book. It is well written,and even though it is fiction I found a lot of history also.

Written well. Really drew me in. I would give the first half 4 or 5 stars. The second half of the book is like an entirely different book. It was almost like a sermon. Someone else mentioned the 700 club. I mean at one point almost every page was talking about finding Christ and this book is supposed to be about the plight of Jews? It seemed to me the author used the Jewish story as a ruse to lure people in and then present the real reason she wrote the book. The two halves of the book were just that different. It got so bad I finally had to quit reading and I never do that. It just wasnt any good anymore. I would give the second half of the book a 0 or 1/2 star if I could. A shame, it really had great potential."},{"rating":"1","title":"First and second half deserve different ratings","review":"I agree with others who point out how the beginning of the book is good but the latter part takes a turn for the worse as the religious messaging becomes blunt and distracting. I decided to read this because I have an interest in World War II that goes back several decades to my pre-teen years. I've consumed as many non-fiction sources as I could get my hands on and set aside time to read or watch, and have watched some \\"historical fiction\\" movies, so I thought I'd try a historical fiction book, especially since it was presented as a well-researched work focusing on the aftermath in Europe, which is not something I've read much about. I gathered that there might be a religious element to the story, but I did not expect the focus to shift so much to that. The first part was a reasonably enjoyable read, but the second part left me with a negative overall view of the book. I only finished it because I don't like leaving books unfinished."},{"rating":"2","title":"Picky English teacher LOVES this book","review":"From Dust and Ashes is an amazing read. Because I teach the finest literature written, I approach my personal reading skeptically. A book must knock me over to make me keep reading. This novel did just that. The story is compelling.

Unfortunately, it did not deliver. I wanted backround and research to support it, but none was forthcoming. The authors write mainly from the philsophical point of view and do not bother to examine whether MBPS is a valid diagnosis based on case study or clinical research. Many MBPS mothers endorse this book because they believe that it vidicates them, however, the mere overdiagnosis of a disorder does not prove it's nonexistance. A reader interested in this subject would do better to read Marc Feldman's book \\"Patient or Pretender\\" and/or review the joural articles on Medline.

There were times when I could not stand Lee. She was so dumb and blind. Taj... oh how I wish he was real. He was the man I wanted. Reading this book made me feel as if I were there.

I enjoyed reading about Vera and Taj, the doctor that I am sure everyone wishes really does exist. Aunt Cookie and Uncle Boy were off da chain and those devious girlfriends could be sweet or shiesty; depending on the time of the day. The midget had me rolling and my heart went out to Rowanda.

Several other websites including http://www.ebaysucks.com, http://www.auctionwatch.com mention concern over the recent account suspensions that are unwarranted.This author gives some good information, but it is extremely outdated. Any time you buy a hard copy, it's going to be at least a year out of date, especially when dealing with an ever changing company like ebay.

The acting by Streep, Zellweiger, and Hurt is outstanding. The only reason I don't give this movie 5 stars - sometimes it tugs on the heartstrings in obvious ways. A bit more subtlety could make it better. Yet, I've seen this movie at least a dozen times, and I don't get tired of watching it. I keep wanting to believe that Hurt's character is not a \\"bad\\" man, and that Streep's character has not made trade offs to maintain her marriage. There are enough complexities in these portrayals which allow me to see that nothing is black and white in this family relationship."},{"rating":"2","title":"A favorite","review":"A great movie!

I use it so much, I forget when I use a conventional mouse at home, that I have to move the mouse.

Out of 6 employees in my department, only one continues to use it and she admits to not liking it very much.the scroll wheel is so out of place, it doesn't feel comfortable at all to use. The resistance of the primary click is greater than the right click. (this makes no sense.) If you have long fingers like me, you'll have to bend your thumb in to click with the tip of your thumb or else flex your thumb out to use the inside knuckle. no thanks.i shoved this thing back into its box and went back to my Logitech Marbleman - which is balanced, comfortable and allows you to use it with both your left or right hand."},{"rating":"1","title":"Logitech Trackman","review":"I have been using Logitech trackman original trackman for many years and thought this would be a great upgrade.

On top of that saying it's cordless is not quite correct, while other cordless mice use a thumb drive this still has a very long cord that you don't know where to put. (I am using a laptop). I love the original trackman and don't understand the purpose of having the ball on the side. The ball on the side causes my hand to cramp and I am not able to navigate very fast. It is as bad as going back to a regular mouse.

I am still using a trackball \\"Logitech Trackman Marble Mouse\\" that I purchased in 2000 after talking it to war in Iraq in the desert. It still works like a champ. I bought this wireless one to use with my Boxee Box as mouse navigation is really slow on the device. The default tracking sensitivity is so low though that the ball was way to unresponsive. I believe you can fix this with windows settings of the software that comes with the mouse but that does not work for Boxee. Beyond that, I am not sure why they changed the ergonomic design so much from the \\"Logitech Trackman Marble Mouse\\". I found this design to be bulky; the wireless receiver is large and the trackball did not feel comfortable. Also I found the button placement to be awkward. For me I do not think my comfort would be improved with more use, it just felt rather carpal tunnel inducing."},{"rating":"2","title":"I like it.","review":"I read up on reviews before I buy a product, I especially pay attention to the one star reviews.

I was having difficulty re-connecting the wireless mouse after a battery change (the button is hard to push) but then realized I wasn't doing it quite right. I got this track-ball mouse because I wanted a scroll button and my other track-ball doesn't have one. I do love the programmable buttons and the ease of choosing what they do. There is one strange thing I'm not so sure about: because I put my mouse on my leg when using it, I've noticed that the color on the bottom (red) stains my skin. It doesn't leave color on my pants or table, just my skin, and it does wash off."},{"rating":"1","title":"short life","review":"I love this device -- easy to set up and it works very well.But they just don't last.

I was so impressed with theLogitech VX Nano Cordless Laser Mouse for Notebooks - Mouse - laser - 5 button(s) - wireless - 2.4 GHz - USB wireless receiverthat I ordered a year ago (it works flawlessly past ten ft) that I thought this would definitely work since the transmitter was 10 times as large but no dice.

The scroll button makes browsing websites way easier. Personally, I like have the ball placed so you can use your fingers rather than your thumb. I feel like I have more control that way. I started using this particular track ball 7 years ago at work. When I left that job, I actually bought my own because I was so addicted to it.

In the past I've used Logitech's marble trackman and Microsoft's excellent, and sadly discontinuedMicrosoft Trackball Explorer. Without going into too much detail, Logitech's Optical Trackman is the greatest replacement for the input device I miss the most. I used it for both gaming and CAD work and it excelled in both roles. The left click is a little too close to the two other side buttons and it is a bit small and in games it can cause you to switch items/weapons at inconvenient moments and you get used to it. Unfortunately these input devices aren't built to last. In the period of two years I owned two of these. Within 8 months the left click and become dull and unresponsive and would require extra, wrist tiring, effort to get button cover to trigger the switch. I recommend not getting one unless it comes with a warranty."},{"rating":"1","title":"Initally pleased....","review":"I was initially very please with this mouse as I love trackball.

I used it for about a week, and then had it shipped back. It caused severe hand pain and cramps if I used it for more than a half hour or so. I assumed that it was just because I needed to get used to the new finger tip controls. My hand never adjusted to having to crane my fingers up to use it. Hence the pain that this device caused was worse than that of the mouse I was trying to replace.The cordless feature seems like a great idea, at least at first.

This might be great for a guy with large hands, but as a female with medium hands (wear large size in isotoner gloves) it is way too big.The way your hand rests on the mouse, I kept accidentally clicking the right mouse button.Few people just use a mouse to scroll around without clicking. Since carpal tunnel usually makes your thumb and first finger hurt, constantly clicking with your thumb is not too good of an idea. My hand hurt worse in 30 minutes of use than with the regular cheap mouse.I'm returning this and trying something else. I think a trackball that uses your thumb to move the ball would be less hand stressful than this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money","review":"This trackball is a big disappointment in many ways, largely because the ball and the left-click button functions work poorly and are very imprecise.

The answer for hand discomfort.","review":"I am a psychologist, and an internet hound. I spend a lot of time on my laptop (2-5 hours a day?). A year ago, I began having pain in the tendons along the top of my hand, from my index finger through my wrist. This was not \\"carpal tunnel\\" pain (that is on the underside of the wrist) but was apparently tendonitis aggravated by typing and mousing.Anyway, I decided to make a radical switch, and the relief was instant. I have fairly big hands and this stationary mouse is like laying my hand on a custom recliner. Combined with a small mousepad and raised wrist pad, I literally never have to move my hand or wrist at all...just tracking with my middle/ring finger and clicking with thumb. The index finger is mercifully spared.Gaming is a downside...especially for high-speed games like shooters.Rarely does a product do everything you hope it will. This one did.

The fingertip control works fine for me, and is very adjustable. Its much better than a thumb controlled ball. I have set my buttons to close application, expand all, minimize all, back, cut, paste and more. Logitech has given me some bad service before, but their equipment generally works well.

Their speakers and keyboards have also worked well for me, and their prices are ok!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Microsoft Trackball Explorer Replacement, Not!","review":"Microsoft stopped making the Trackball Explorer mouse which in my opinion was the best trackball mouse ever made. They are still available on EBay but at $150 a pop. I went to XP 64 bit and the Microsoft mouse drivers have a major bug which cause my computer to get the BSOD so off to finally finding a replacement (my old Trackball Explorers went to EBay).First let me say that this in not even close to a replacement for the Microsoft's Trackball explorer but it was probably never meant to me. I gave it a full week's try but my brain had a hard time adjusting. The layout is not natural for me. I could not lay my hand on it natural and be productive. I had to move my hand up on the mouse and cramp my fingers to make it work but that was not comfortable.I ended up with the Logitech Trackman Wheel.

With in the first 3-4 months what i thought was a durable rubber coating had worn completely off leaving black plastic and a very ugly desk obstacle(i am not that hard on a mouse). I started to realize the drag and drop was dropping my files in other folders as i dragged across the desktop. That was fun, so i thought replacing the batteries would solve that but that didn't matter. It also became painfully evident that i prefer the basic usb/ps2 wire and i will not buy another battery powered mouse. Design wise the trackman is pretty good. I do wish the right click button was placed more forward but overall it is good. Now it sits in a bag in my office waiting for its next unsuspecting victim."},{"rating":"1","title":"Six months later, it decided to stop working.","review":"Purchased the unit in August of 2011. This past month, in January 2012, the left button began to lose sensitivity. It would no longer highlight text, grab and move files, etc. Pushing down hard on the button and moving it around would bring back a measure of competence--for less than a day. After which the problem would repeat.I checked out the Logitech forums, and discovered that this issue is not at all uncommon with this particular trackball. Various users have even listed the many attempted remedies they've applied, without success. All agree that the only sure cure is getting a replacement.Which is what I've asked for, now. We'll see. In the meantime, I can laud this trackball for its performance...when it works. A shape some flaw in its design or manufacture causes a number of them to cease working, after a time. At least it's still under warranty."},{"rating":"2","title":"only way to go","review":"I've had this model track ball from its initial release, and still love it! Using a track ball ever since I found one available has been, for me, a perfect match. I do a lot of cad cam work, and find using a track ball a necessity. This is the best track ball I have found available to date. If I need to place a con on this track ball, its that while being cordless, its very easy to knock it off the desk while engrossed in a design on the screen."},{"rating":"2","title":"Smooth and easy","review":"I purchased this product because the mini trackball on my keyboard stopped working. Although it's a pain to have to use two different products when I'm on the computer, this trackball is a great product. It moves smoothly and it is easy to position on the screen. I'm a quadriplegic and I'm unable to use the buttons so I can't speak to their usefulness."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works great ergonomic","review":"I got this due to I have nerve damage in my rt hand and a major shoulder problem. I would have given it 5 starts across the board except I have smaller hands and it could be a shade smaller and the USB receiver thing is rather bulky to deal with.

So this results in having another tethered wire thing that dangles from your laptop when you move it. Not very portable and negates having something wireless.

I have used trackballs from Logitech, Microsoft, and a few others I don't remember. I really like the features of this particular trackball (Logitech Cordless Optical Trackman) except in one regard; it expires quickly.The first one I purchased lasted several months and then died. I purchased a second one thinking that the first one was an anomaly; it lasted about a year or so & then recently bit the dust as well.Strangely enough, I still have the first Logitech trackball I ever purchased; it a little grumpy but it still works. Does Logitech continue to make a product that is a loser when it comes to life span. Don't know for sure but this is my experience. Would I recommend it to a friend or enemy. NO!The sad part of this narrative is that I love everything about the trackball except its length of life and seem unable to find another with the same features."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great mouse when it worked","review":"The moral to this story is keep your receipt if you buy this mouse.Usually, I wouldn't keep a receipt for such a low ticket item but I've owned 2 of these now and both have broken within a few months of buying them. I loved the mouse when it was working but for some reason after a few months windows stops recognizing the device as a mouse. It just shows up as an unknown device. I'm very computer savvy and I have gone through all the troubleshooting with Logitech to determine that it is defective but logitech won't honor the 3-5 year warranty unless you have the original purchase receipt.So, don't be a me, if your going to buy this mouse, keep your receipt."},{"rating":"1","title":"Real Disappointment","review":"I've been using a Microsoft Trackball Explorer 1.0 for several years,and really loved it, but eventually it began cutting off for short periods. I ordered the Logitech Optical Trackman to replace it, but what a disappointment. Somehow this trackball wasn't made for my hand, since when holding it comfortably the only buttons I can reach are the ball and the three left side buttons. And the right click button can not be changed from an awkward left side location, or another button substituted for the right click. The smart move feature is poor compared to my old trackball. I'm using the cordless optical Trackman now, but sure miss the comfort and ease of using my old trackball. I like and respect Logitech, but I think they blew it with this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Does not fit my hand","review":"My son has a Logitech Cordless Optical Trackman & uses it as a back up to a corded mouse.

Other Logitech products use what they call a \\"unifying\\" receiver, which is this tiny little nub that plugs into your USB port and through which you can connect up to 5 different Logitech devices. This \\"cordless\\" mouse is NOT compatible with the unifying receiver, so if you have another \\"unifying\\" compatible product you will still need an extra USB port for this mouse. Want to use a trackball style mouse with a unifying receiver? They are rumored to exist, but I can't find hide nor hair of them on Logitech's website.

I recommend it especially for seniors with arthritis or trouble moving their hands or arms."},{"rating":"1","title":"Left Click Button FAIL","review":"I bought this mouse both for my home and for my work. My work mouse lasted only a few months before the left click button stopped working. It got lodged inside somehow and wouldn't click anymore. I sit at a desk at work and there's nothing excessive that could've caused this. My home mouse left click button moved from working all the time - to only the top part of the left click button working - to only working when you press super hard. I have temporarily changed my left click button to one of the other buttons, but I should not have to do this. Other than this left click button debacle, the mouse works very well. But I need my mouse to function and not stop randomly working."},{"rating":"2","title":"Relative Ease","review":"I will get right to the point. I am a CAD Designer and using a reguler mouse tends to be troublesum. I got my first Cordless Trackman about 6-8 years ago. In no time at all I was really liking the ease of use of the trackball. From that point on I have used nothing but this trackball. I had one ordered in my last company and after 7 years moved to a new company and have the same one here as well. I was a bit worried that they would not be available after so many years but sure enough it was available and my company now got me one.Not one out of the three stopped working and I could not be any happier. There are so many functions and buttons that you can program any button to do whatever you want that would make life easier for you.This trackball is by far worth buying and would continue to use them as long as they are on the market."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great trackball, quality has slipped quite a bit","review":"I bought an early version of this model and used if just about every day for 10 years. A terrific device where all of the controls became natural to me quickly. I like that the long fingers operate the ball.2 years ago, my Trackman died. I bought a new one immediately. Since then, each has gone bad quickly. If my current one goes bad anytime soon, I will have to go find something else, looking for something not Logitech.A general note: as with any new and different HID, it will feel wrong and strange at first.

Furthermore, after I loaded the software, I couldn't go back to my previous LOGITECH WIRELESS MOUSE -- the conventional kind.

This Logitech trackball is a little different, but a good second choice. I do CADD design, and so far, the Logitech trackball is as accurate and easy to use as the MTE. My only gripe is about the placement of the scroll-wheel. I use it in CADD as a pan command, and I had to reprogram that command to another button to make it easier to use. Also, the range seems to max out at ten feet. not a problem for me, but maybe you want to know."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best trackball left on the market","review":"Pros:Wireless. It's a trackball. Not a power hog.Cons:Button placement could be tweaked for a better fit, especially the right button. Logitech's SetPoint software has to be downloaded, since the version included is never the latest version available.I've been using trackballs for over a decade and my favorite is Microsoft's Trackball Explorer. Unfortunately they discontinued it a few years back and this is the second best trackball available. This is my second Trackman and it's a nice piece of hardware and I gave it 5 stars because it's the best available. However, if they moved the right button to just above the left button, instead of being located to the right of the trackball, this would be a much better product, since there is a tendency to hit the right button when manipulating the trackball."},{"rating":"2","title":"a mouse that has achieved PERFECTION!","review":"In the past I have had Kensington roller ball mice, several other logitech mice including the old version of this one.

The reviews that talk about small buttons and awkward position and stiff buttons are all correct. But I was willing to live with it to have a trackball. I also found that I had to spin the ball more than I would have like to travel across the screen.

I need to see what the warranty is and get it sent in for repair if it is still in warranty. I am starting to wonder about Logitech quality.

It is well designed, I like the size of the ball, but the button placement leaves a lot to be desired, especially the main button (\\"left\\"). There are two things Logitech must improve. First, this thing is a battery drain, which is expensive and environmentally unsound. Second, it's interface to the computer (Mac OS X) is strange. Many times the behavior is as if the left button is continuously pressed, it would attempt to drag objects I have no interest in dragging and so on. This device will end in the trash and I will buy a new trackball from another manufacturer. Other, less important irritants are erratic pointer movement and the fact that it does not work well in direct sunlight."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor performance","review":"Logitech has been declining for a couple years in quality.

Then the problem is the distance between the wheel and the ball is too far apart. And by shifting the fingers back and forth, I suffers lag time.

All trackballs which require me to move the ball with my thumb did nothing but make my hand feel even more strained after just a little use, but this product was just the ticket. It feels natural and non-straining to roll the trackball with my index & middle fingers. The ball rolls smoothly, there are enough programmable buttons for my needs and it's a snap to set up.I do wish there was a \\"wired\\" version, though (since it and my 9 x 12 Wacom tablet like to \\"fight\\" with each other if they're too close which happens often since the tablet takes up a lot of desk space).

This talks to the trackman so while you can say the trackman itself is cordless, you need another unit with a huge cord to use it. The amount of cords you are packing is the same as a corded mouse with the addition of the large trackman. Most cordless mice/trackballs use a small USB dongle, not an external box.Look closely at the product pictures and you will see this external corded transceiver.What's the point? If you want cordless it's so you don't have to deal with cords."},{"rating":"1","title":"What's the point","review":"On other wireless devices there is true wireless, just a small receiver protruding from the USB slot.

The receiver works perfectly, but the ball is horrible.Out of the box it is off by about 45 degrees, and you have to install the (Windows-only) software to correct it. But nothing can correct the DPI. It's like using one of those really really old bad mice when the rollers got dirty: it jumps from one place to another without ever passing the pixels in between. Maybe I got a lemon?The software replaces the normal mouse settings in the control panel, so if you switch to another mouse you cannot adjust the settings on it. So basically, if you use this track ball, you can never go back.

Logitech's website even has an image showing the evolution of cordless receivers, and the Cordless Optical Trackman has a receiver Logitech dates around 2002.

After the uninstall ran and I tried a few things to get my other keyboard and mouse working again, I called customer support. We finally figured out that the only way to reactivate my devices was to uninstall my USB port, and then reinstall it as well as all the numerous devices that were attached to it. The process took about 3 hours. Amazingly, the automatic reinstal of all drivers worked without a hitch, but this very complex process should not have been necessary.Something was wrong with the uninstall, and Logitech had not tested this important part of the product, at least not thoroughly!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"good product with some ergonomic flaws","review":"I wish logitech would come out with a wired trackball with a scroll wheel. I eat a trackball about once a year. At 25 bucks a pop, it's annoying. The wireless version is twice as much. I bought it solely for the scroll wheel. The right button on this is a little too far back so you have to move your fingers off of the trackball in order to click it. That makes it a tad inconvient to use and impossible to use for gaming. Also, it has no additional buttons (unlike their standard wired one which has two extra programmable buttons - fantastic for gaming - especially games using controller modding tools and scripts)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great track ball","review":"I have worn 2 of these out.

This happened to me less than 6 months from purchasing it new through Amazon and Logitech hasn't responded to my support queries at all. DO NOT BUY THIS UNIT IF YOU'RE LOOKING FOR A TRACKBALL!!!!!

So I tried this thing.Ergonomic placement of auxiliary buttons is not good, and the hand contorts just enough to be annoying.But the worst problem is cursor stability at the moment of the click. If you are doing precision work, don't even think about buying this trackball, because it's hard to perfectly locate the cursor. And to make clicks work properly, one must remove one's thumb from the ball before clicking or the cursor will be pulled off target.Unacceptable."},{"rating":"2","title":"trackball","review":"by far the best trackball on the market, love the layout. this is my secound one the first one lasted almost 6 years of non stop use."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awsome device","review":"This is the best trackball I have ever used, and the wireless funcationality is superb."},{"rating":"1","title":"Premature Failure --> Unreliable Tracking","review":"During the last year I have had 3 to these trackballs.

This is the updated version. Although slightly different, it is a great device. I find the dexterity of fingertip control much much better than thumb control track balls and much easier and intuitive to use. It is far more comfortable than a mouse (especially the one that comes with a Mac) and for general control as well as specialized application I use in Photography, it is a real time and fatigue saver. I don't know what the complaints are about I see here and there with this device. The ball runs smoothly, button are right where they need to be, fully programmable with my Mac....works great.

Nor are they likely to be able to adapt. Your middle finger or first finger are adapted to going up and down moving a wheel is logical, but not side to side on a ball. Your thumb, for most human like animals has the most motion dexterity and it is not even used here. I disagree totally with another TrackBall comment; the middle finger is far far over worked here and is not capable. Study the motion and evolution of the hand, the thumb is the progress of apes, the other fingers grab and make a fist the thumb works. I Have all of 5 or six warn out TrakBalls in my drawer, this is a problem with them, they ware out and bind.

If you're still awake.This movie is dull. There's really nothing else to say. After 15 minutes, most of it spent at an AA meeting, I was ready to give up.It tries to be 'realistic' but that really means it's poorly shot with unclear, badly lit scenes and the sound is too low to follow the dialogue.There's potential here but the production values are too poor and the plot is padded from a 15 minute idea to a 90 minute film.Stay away!"},{"rating":"1","title":"amateurish bit of horror claptrap","review":"This is a senseless, gory film about a serial killer who escapes from prison and continues to slash and kill on his way to find his former girlfriend who turned him into the FBI.

In the program she meets a charmingly supportive fellow AA member who is an inept sexual partner (premature ejaculation). This serial killer has thousands of \\"fans\\" and copycat killers (sickos). The story line is predictable and the camera work nauseating. The camera work reminds me of my parents attempts to catch family events on their old 8mm camera and heads are cut off and things go in and out of focus.

We see two people agonizing over what they are doing, a male serial killer who feels compelled to kill and a female driven to drink. We see each of them groaning, sighing, moaning, crying, breathing heavily, as they think about what they have done, how it is destroying them, and the agony and difficulty each is having trying to gain control and stop killing and drinking. The female is controlling her drive, but with difficulty, but the male is unable to do so. The film moves at times from the present to the past, as do people when they think about what is driving them. Without revealing the stunning ending, once we understand the psychological drives and dilemmas, we can understand the ending of the film better."},{"rating":"1","title":"A horrible way to die is a horrible way to make a movie.","review":"The writer, Simon Barrett, wrote a commendable and very interesting story which the director/editor, Adam Windgard, completely butchered with the help of the photgraphers, Chris Hilleke and Mark Shalhorse.The cut from one scene to the next over used black screens of varing lengths which made you feel like they were cutting to a commercial. The POV for many of the takes were ill chosen and lacked the kind of professional continuity expected for a filmm transferred to Blu-Ray.The photographers probably never heard of a Steady-Cam as the screen bobbed continueslly up and down and from side to side. If they think this was a hip technique it was tried years ago and was amateurish then.The acting was for the most part was excellent especially Amy Seimetz and A.J.

This movie was in no way better than The Matrix. Regardless of if anyone's said that it was or not, this movie fails to deliver in a lot of ways. First off, they don't tell you what the horrible way to die is. You have to use your imagination and make up your own mind to figure out what it is. I hate it when directors leave something open for interpretation, and this is another one of those cases. It's like how The Shawshank Redepmtion is a rip off of Escape from Alcatraz but just with more drama thrown in.The graphics in this movie were ok, so i'll give it an extra star. They were almost as good as God of War 3's."},{"rating":"1","title":"Okay concept, poor execution","review":"I admit I love horror movies and also admit I am willing to accept some less-than-professional productions along with suspension of disbelief to get my spine tingling. That's the point: I can forgive a lot if it scares me. It's the same with comedy, it it makes me laugh, that's the bottom line. A HORRIBLE WAY TO DIE wasn't scary; it was dull. Kudos for some good character development, but the story lacked the necessary suspense to draw me in. And, as so many others have mentioned, the cinematography was so amateurish it pulled me right out of the story--distracting."},{"rating":"1","title":"A HORRIBLE WAY TO SPEND 90 MINUTES","review":"A HORRIBLE WAY TO DIE is an annoying film. It is directed, filmed and edited in a choppy, disoriented style, almost like it was a film student's first attempt.Its time shifts are confusing and awkwardly inserted. The plot focuses on the escape of a convicted serial killer and how he figures in the life of an alcoholic dental assistant on the road to recovery. There is an unexpected plot twist but it's pretty far-fetched and hard to swallow. The cast of unknowns tries gamely but fail to overcome the movie's ineptness. Its languid pacing and misdirection make it difficult to get involved and only a patient viewer will make it to the end."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible","review":"Just Horrible!!!!

I read the brief plot off to the side of the scary looking picture on the front. I played it at home and watched it alone, lights off, etc...I usually watch all of my horror movies like this. This movie was not so much the type you want to hide under your covers afterwards, just a little more aware of having a volitale relationship and the lengths guys can go to, in order to have control over their ex. I think the way the filmed it was appropriate it had more of a feel of authenticity that brings the viewer into the mind of the female lead character. You are seeing this through her eyes; experiencing the nightmare of being stalked and held for hostage as a sacrifice to her ex. I liked it, I would watch this again and buy it when it's on sale."},{"rating":"1","title":"A good sleeping pill","review":"Wow. This is one slow movie. Flashbacks, flash forwards, horrible photography, low-key soundtrack, and mostly off-screen violence make for one dull serial killer flick. Actors are actually pretty good, but they are so soft-spoken and almost dazed half the time. This is a very slow ride and will require a lot of patience if you want to make it to the end, which is ridiculous and fairly predictable. Nothing scary here, folks. I would have welcomed an occasional scream, chase or exagerated musical note to wake me from my coma."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful, memorable stories and anecdotes!","review":"A nice collection for anyone interested in all things medical.

I found 30% of the book to be worth reading. Its a good book to pick up and read a few poems from but its certainly not a cover to cover read. If you are looking for a book to help you get more insight into being a doctor or a doctor's life this book is not for you. I would not recommend this book to anyone, but its really cheap and there are a few good poems in it so if that is what you are looking for this is the book for you!"},{"rating":"1","title":"This dryer sucks","review":"My old gold-n-hot dryer broke and i bought this model as a replacement since they no longer make the model i like. The speed and heat settings were fine however i was displeased with the adjustable attachment. It would not stay in place and pulled my hair out. While i was 1/4 through drying my hair, it fell off and would not attach again. I had to dry my hair with a comb which made my hair very frizzy. Needless to say, i had a very bad hair week. This dryer does not take universal attachments so now its useless to me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the money","review":"I bought this blowdryer and I hadnt used it because I had been going to the hairdresser's to get my hair done.

It's a little miracle worker. I had my low heals on without socks all day and didn't have to use any tape. I'm not sure how it does it, because it is not oily or greasy at all. I did reapply about two-thirds of the way through the day, but that's a small trade off for such a great product. I'm going to tell all my friends about it."},{"rating":"1","title":"How Can You Feel Good - Charging Money for Poor Quality?!?","review":"I looked at the printed book's \\"Look Inside\\" preview, and it appears to be a reasonable quality, at least in the first pages that were show in that preview. The Kindle book is horrendous! How can someone charge anything for such a thing? Is there no quality control at Amazon, that someone would simply say, \\"This is such a bad OCR scan - we won't allow you to place this title for sale until you clean it up, and make it more readable...\\"? I'm sorry to have to say all this, but people should know that until the Kindle version is cleaned up A LOT, I wouldn't even think of purchasing it. I'm glad that one can look at a preview! There is a 99-cent version available that looks like a good clean scan. Surely we should expect something costing over three and a half times as much to have a similar quality? I'd be happy to withdraw my review upon seeing an improvement."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yawn","review":"I'm sorry to say that this book almost put me to sleep. I'm not quite sure what the problem was, but something was definitely off. The novel is set in London 1811 with the heroine, Emmaline, trying to support herself and an aging aunt by means of a marriage broker service. Unfourtenely her first paying customer dies near her doorstep under suspicious circumstances. Enter Adrian, the duke of Trent who has been reluctantly recruited to determine if the lovely Emmy had something to do with the death. A love-hate relationship quickly develops between Emmaline and Adrian, and the supporting characters (Emmaline's ex-actress aunt and Adrian's man-of-affairs) do everything they can to throw the couple together.Individually I found all the characters likable (especially the canary) and the plot interesting, but as a whole the book was uninspiring. There was no nail-biting tension, no steamy passion, and no real reason to turn the pages. I sorry to say this was a yawner."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful","review":"I read Ms. Putnam's book, \\"Never trust a Rake\\" and thought that it was without question, one of the worst books I have ever read. This follows right behind and I shall not bother reading another of her books again! This was a romance with zero chemistry and not very likeable characters. Adrian, the Duke of Trent, was weirdly cold. Sad childhood sort of thing. Emmaline is desperate for money and hires herself out as a matchmaker. A man who just hired her dies on her front step and the government asks Adrian to investiage as this man was a spy. So he pretends he needs her services to find a bride. The story does not work because of a) no chemistry and b) how could there be chemistry with a man who gets out of bed each morning and steps into ice water? Even when the reader finds out why he thinks he is so cold, in the end, it did not make sense or really explain his weird coldness. The sex? blah...In the end, who cared???"},{"rating":"2","title":"I like this book!","review":"I really liked this book. I was surprised to read the other reviews that were so negative--I actually enjoyed the fact that the hero wasn't so \\"dashing.\\" I get awfully tired of the stereotypical hero types, which do not exist in the real world and are often entirely too smug"},{"rating":"1","title":"It Sounded Good?!","review":"I don't know I guess that it was boring both characters really did not have anything in common and I did not really understand why the hero was \\"tortured\\" or why the heroine kept hurting both of them when they wanted each other and its kind of obvious that about the possiblity of the heros father I got that from the get go, but any way I found myself going in circles that I finished the book in half a day because I skipped a lot of parts. I know a book is good when I put it down because I don't want it to end.

Avoid this guide and get a more general Mexico book written by more authors."},{"rating":"1","title":"don't bother","review":"I am an avid LP fan and have used their books in several other countries, but found this one to be incredibly unhelpful. We ended up stranded on a military base, sleeping in our car for a night, and the guidebook had the wrong number for the hotel we were trying to reach. Furthermore, the book seems to breeze over some of the nicer off-the-beaten-path spots, like Mazunte and Zipolite."},{"rating":"1","title":"WORST Reference Book I've Ever Purchased","review":"Not only was this guide not helpful, it was agonizing to use. The index is incomplete, the maps are scattered and inapplicable, nothing is cross-referenced, and the descriptions are more often than not completely irrelevant. I've just returned from my trip to Mexico's Pacific Coast, and found that relying on the book for information was counter-productive, as many facts were missing or wrong. It was more productive to ask anyone than to open the book. Do not spend your money or time on this guide."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lovely voice; heartfelt lyrics.","review":"Wow!

It's still a beautiful sound, just not as rich. But there's still plenty of good pop songs here, lead track \\"Around the Bend\\" and the title track being my favourites among the bunch. I can't wait for her next album."},{"rating":"1","title":"Reality or fiction???","review":"Having read the book it sounds wonderful.

His style is opaque and his insights non-existant. Rout neither understands the intellectual and spiritual inheritance Bonaventure recieved from Francis nor does he ever grasp the depth and meaning these great Churchman have for the next millenium. His exposition on the mystical dimensions of Franciscan spirituality can only be described [and I am being quite charitable] as stupid. Where have all the good books gone?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Merely a magazine article.","review":"In this book Father Paul Rout - a self proclaimed homosexual - tries to tackle these two pivotal Christian thinkers. He produces a mere 'magazine article' geared for the below average in intelligence reader. It might be good for a bored middle class housewife who found Shirly Maclane interesting a few years ago but has moved on to more 'traditional spirituality'. However, the intellectually orientated and academically sound reader will find this book merely a magazine article. By the way, dose not the Pope disapprove of Gay Priests? Is it not against Canon Law to be openly Gay as Rout so proclaims?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Needs more intellectual 'meat'","review":"In this popular account of the life and work of Saint Francis and Saint Bonaventure Paul Rout missed a great opportunity to address these unique thinkers. One is forced to endure a poorly written account which anyone off the street could have written. His sentimental account of Francis and the Sulton misses the mark altogether - Francis went to convert the Sulton not to 'enter into dialogue' with him. This section does not act as a model for ecumenicalism but rather as a basis for why such poorly written scholarship should not be published. A student of mine wrote the publishers of this book to complain - and bully for her I say - about the lack of insight this useless book has to offer. This silly tome needs more intellectual 'meat'."},{"rating":"1","title":"Could use more research","review":"The author of this slim volume did not do his homework.

Mr. Rout is irresponsible in his treatment of both of these religious figures and offers a mere journalistic account of their ideas and beliefs.

DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS NON-SENSE!"},{"rating":"1","title":"poorly written with little academic vigor.","review":"Rout has produced a poorly documented volume which may be of interest to the general reader but has little or no value for the academic. His expository section reads like a freshman paper which was written the night before it was due and he offers very little critical analysis. In short it is a waste of time for the scholar."},{"rating":"1","title":"Intellectually Poor","review":"Paul Rout seems to miss the point in his 'popularist' exposition of Francis and Bonaventure. He fails to promote the essential message of these unique and profound thinkers.

Rout's attempt at explaining the process of Franciscan mysticism in two pages is laughable and any discerning mind can see that he lacks any intellectual or spiritual depth.

However, the current work amounts to rehashed lecture notes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Research","review":"Paul Rout's attempt at capturing the essence of Francis and Bonaventure fails in several key area. The tone of the book is pedantic and misses out at capturing the totality of the mystical process which the two saints in questions went through.It also is somewhat muddled in its expository section. It is obviously a 'feel good' book intended to proffer the deep mystical insights of thinkers to the New Age crowd.If it were more thought out it might have had some redeeming qualities, hiowever, it misses the mark. Poor reasearch plain and simple."},{"rating":"1","title":"Complete non-sense.","review":"In this book Rout - a self proclaimed Gay priest - tries to suggest that both Francis and Bonaventure were gay.

Two, you cannot switch between players."},{"rating":"1","title":"Flawed Design","review":"The concept is fascinating and the scenes are graphic, but two things ruin this game: 1) Teammates get stuck in place.

The single player needs some fixing. your teamates don't always respond to commands and sometimes they get stuck. Otherwise the game is good"},{"rating":"1","title":"too many bugs! crappy online play!","review":"socom is best when played online. well, it was but not anymore. now it is impossible to have a decent game online. too many cheaters (people with rapid fire rockets, double health, invulnerability), vehicles that can climb mountains, invisible vehicles, pistols more powerful than an assault rifle, and many othe glitches!!! i had been waiting for a long time for the developer to fix the problems but they're not doing anything at all. don't waste your money on this one!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible and racially biased","review":"This doll is horrible looking. She looks like a street hooker in winter clothes. Why is it that Cloe always gets the pretty clothes and minorities like Jade,Yasmin, or Sasha get the dinky clothes and are always rated the lowest. However Cloe dolls are rated the best simply because she has blonde hair and blue eyes its about time that MGA realizes that there is another vision of an american girl other than blonde hair and blue eyes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great doll","review":"This doll is one of the best bratz dolls I like her because of the cool wintertime clothes, you would never see clothes like this on barbie thats why I love the bratz because they have way better fashions than barbie I know this doll is pretty price but you will love her,I know I do."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bratz Doll Cloe for Winter Wonderland","review":"This doll is the perfect thing to grab and go!!!!!!It is a very fun doll and I guaranteed that your daughter will want to play with it as soon as she gets into the car!!! Buy it now before it runs out of stock!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"cloe rocks","review":"well i don't have this doll but i'm saving my money to buy it and i know that's it's great.but it's very expensive and i'm trying to wait for sales but i'm afraid it will be out of stock.i hope it dosen't get out of stock"},{"rating":"1","title":"oh my god","review":"Is this Bratz doll actually wearing...CLOTHES? Believe it or not she's actually covered from head to toe. What a change from the the skimpy hooker clothes they usually wear."},{"rating":"1","title":"A brilliant marketing scheme!","review":"Okay so I'm not a sheltering parent by ANY stretch of the imagination, but I don't doubt this toy is the most popular thing to hit the market in years. Why? Becuase highly sexualized toys are always the \\"coolest\\" and \\"hippest\\" toys out there, just like the highly sexualized and best dressed girls are always the most popular in school. I just couldn'tgive my daughter a doll that looked like the girls who torture other girls in high school...because that's what this toy is! It's a miniature \\"popular girl\\" all her own, that will always be the best dressed with the coolest accessories and that will never make fun of her. What a great segue into early sexualization and a life of materialism! And if you think I'm just being alarmist, wait till your baby starts asking for tacky clothes, stretch flare jeans and a cell phone...because face it, they're called \\"Bratz\\" for a reason..."},{"rating":"1","title":"eww","review":"this cloe is hideous her hair is white her lips are glitter brown what a ugly color and her hair is a wild nightmare and that pink shirt ain't workin' for ya honey it makes her look old her outfits are wonderfull but her face my god its ugly get dana yasmin or sasha they are the best from the whole group or get hollywood cloe she has such a pretty face and her curly hair is to die for i love bratz but not this one its an illgeal alien"},{"rating":"2","title":"Johnnie Taylor","review":"Got it for a friend...he thought he'd have to fight off friends and family to keep them from stealing it... so I guess that means he liked it."},{"rating":"2","title":"He is one of a kind!","review":"This old schooler was something else. He was a artist about life and just told how he felt about it. I like his music because of how he put his words in good use."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not all that...","review":"Very weak and light, can't seem to make it tight enough for it to not wobble. It does the job of looking good and allowing the pillows to rest on it nicely, but never rest your back on it unless it is pressed tightly against the wall:)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not all that good","review":"Tai Chi Master was a lot better than this. I was pretty bored watching this movie. No real good moves, just plain boring. I didn't even watch the last 40ish minutes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible the worst Yuen Woo ping movie","review":"I had read the other reviews and people were saying that itwas the best YuenWoo Ping Movie but trust me it isthe worst Yuen Woo Ping movie i had watched the subtitledversion and it was very difficult to followbecause theSubtitles were burnt on to the print.I would not recommend this movie to anyone especially thedubbed version because i know how bad itis please save your money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Yuen Woo Ping Does It Again","review":"This movie is an excellent and effective combination of comedy, martial arts mastery, likable characters, and rapid-fire action. Although it lacked a solid story--self-taught Tai Chi fighter helping Chinese revolutionaries dressed in English attire butting heads with traditionally clad Chinese militia in cohorts with opium-smuggling English citizens--the well positioned, amazingly choreographed fight scenes are well worth the purchase. Jacky Wu is a fresh face in the world of Hong Kong martial arts movies of today. With his acting and martial arts talent--highly evident in this movie--he is sure to go far."},{"rating":"1","title":"One of the worst Woo-Ping movies","review":"This is a horrible movie especially dubbed in english,although I haven't seen the sub-titled version which probabley isn't as silly,I doubt it's much better.So what's so bad,hmm,let's see,no plot,un-interesting characters,and some not so funny punch-lines.The fights are ok, but definitley sub-standard for YUEN.I definitley cannot reccomend the dubbed version,but it's possible that the Chinese one sports a better plot."}]`),M={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:D},data(){return{visibleCount:6,poemsData:O,isLoading:!1}},computed:{visiblePoems(){return this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(o=>setTimeout(o,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=6,this.isLoading=!1}}},N={class:"card-container"},C=["disabled"],x={key:0},R={key:1};function B(o,e,n,u,r,s){const c=w("PoemCard");return a(),i("section",null,[e[1]||(e[1]=t("div",{class:"top-banner"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🎉 Your SNAP 🥳")])],-1)),t("div",N,[(a(!0),i(y,null,f(s.visiblePoems,(h,g)=>(a(),p(c,{key:g,poem:h},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),s.hasMorePoems?(a(),i("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",disabled:r.isLoading,onClick:e[0]||(e[0]=(...h)=>s.loadMore&&s.loadMore(...h))},[r.isLoading?(a(),i("span",R,"Loading...")):(a(),i("span",x,"See more"))],8,C)):b("",!0)])}const P=d(M,[["render",B],["__scopeId","data-v-7c965dab"]]),L=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"people/59.md","filePath":"people/59.md"}'),W={name:"people/59.md"},j=Object.assign(W,{setup(o){return(e,n)=>(a(),i("div",null,[v(P)]))}});export{L as __pageData,j as default};
