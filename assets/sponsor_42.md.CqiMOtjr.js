The first three songs Persuasion, You Don't Care, and a live version of Black Magic Woman are definite keepers. Also quite special is Guajarina, L'Touisanit De Overture, and the mellow Stormy.Personally, I would explore the first three classic Santana recordings as those CD's have many other high quality tunes not available on this compilation. Also, Carlos Santana has so much talent brimming in his fingers that it would be worthy to check out his other CD's to gather a better feel for his latin flavored styles which always soothe the soul.

I find that the handle grippers strong enough for me to use as an exercise really dig into my hands/fingers and can hurt. Im sure this could be solved with gloves or whatever or with one that has a padded handle. This circular one is completely comfortable for me.The disadvantage is that after using it for a while I think it is slightly less springy and offers a small amount less resistance than it did when it was new.

I don't believe all gay relationships have to take on this serious a tone, and it certainly isn't the way that most relationships work.

The hooks on the grill to hang the utensils aren't wide enough to hold the tongs securely and they didn't drill a hole (though I suppose I could) through the bottom of the U in the tongs to tie a leather thong.

However, the info is really good and if you are an Illustrator user, like me, you'll likely learn a few new tricks.

In trying to cover so many models, it is necessarily vague and non-committal on many items. The book also inexplicably uses a Piper weight and balance chart as an example instead of a Cessna one.

I got a different set of larger screws for these (wanted to be sure it would hold to the wall) and screwed into the wall studs. Did not trust wall anchors.

I live in a small condo, so this would help free up some space. These guitar mounts were descent. The holder itself did not feel cheaply made and the wood grain is a nice touch. I had the guitar mounts on my wall for approximately 2 months and then the inevitable happened. One guitar mount came ripping off the wall. They tell you to mount these on studs, which I did, but the top screw came out on one of the mounts. I caught my guitar before it hit the ground. I had to take off one star because I think they should come with anchors not just wood screws.All in all, I would definitely buy these again, but maybe invest in better screws so my guitars don't fall off the wall.

The Hercules hanger is sturdy and secure, - it provides a spring mechanism to hold the guitar securely when hanging and give quick release when guitar is removed. I now have 6 of these hangers and they have opened up my music room. These hangers often sell for over $30 each, so Amazon's price is about half of that elsewhere.A great solution at a great price."},{"rating":"1","title":"Had to revise - WARPED NECK !!!","review":"I really liked the theory of this wall mount. Get the guitar out of the way, display it for all to see. However after about 3 months, I started to notice the neck of my guitar was starting to move. Strings started to buzz on frets 1, then 2. The Guitar shop couldn't do anything the fix it. 6 months later and keep it stored in the case, it has started to shift back, but still not what it was. This $15 item totally screwed up my $3000 gibson acoustic.ORIGINAL REVIEW:\\"I live in a small apartment, floor space is limited so a typical floor guitar stand wasn't going to work in my office area. My acoustic looks great on the wall and the mount went up easy!

Principle use is for wildlife photography, and have also had some success with astro-photography; such as the recent lunar eclipse. It's convenient that it uses the same filter sizes (67mm) as my 18-70 kit lens. The auto-focus is fast and accurate, and when I stop the lens down to F8, clarity at 300mm zoom is very good on distant birds. The resolution of the lens exceeds the capability of my current camera. All-in-all, I highly recommend it. The Vibration Reduction works VERY WELL, and the lens is the best thing I could buy shy of purchasing a pro model such as the 70-200mm VR for almost three times the money. This lens has the advantage of lighter weight. My only caveat is that the manual focus ring could have been differentiated better, as it's a little hard to find quickly when looking through the view-finder."},{"rating":"2","title":"All that I hoped for!","review":"I have enjoyed this lens.

From 250mm to 300mm, you may need to stop down two stops or do some post-processing to sharpen the images a little.Focus is fast and silent. VR works as advertised. You generally gain about 3 stops. You can get reasonably sharp images at 1/15 sec at 70mm, and 1/30 sec at 300mm.As a full-frame lens, this lens has no vignetting on DX-sensor DSLRs.This lens is definitely one of the best tele zoom Nikon has ever made. The level of sharpness from 70mm to 200mm is on par with Canon's pro-level L lenses. At this price, Nikon is making a deal for everyone.Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"The pictures are worth the price","review":"I really like this lens, it is sharp, has good contrast, and produces good color. The autofocus is quick and accurate and the vibration reduction is effective. The bokeh is very good. Could it be sharper at 300mm? Yes. Are the images it produces at 300mm usable? Yes, even at 100%. This is not a fast lens, so when shooting in low light this lens will not perform as well. For me, the bottom line is, I have taken some great pictures with this lens that I would not have gotten otherwise.

It worked well enough on my Nikon D60, considering it is a consumer quality lens, but only for about 5 months. Early in October, '09, on about every 3rd shot, the lens would grind during autofocus and zoom, and the image in the viewfinder would shake uncontrollably. This shaking and grinding would continue after I released the shutter button. Needless to say none of the pictures turned out at all. I shipped it back to Nikon in NY, and it was returned, supposedly repaired, 3 weeks later. The day after I got it back, the shaking and grinding continued. It also malfunctioned on my friend's Nikon D40. I contacted the seller, who would not replace the lens, so I had to ship it back to Nikon again, where it should be by now.

Actually I like the is build quality than the Nikon 16-35 VRII. But the lens had a piece of dust (maybe metal particle) inside. The replacement had a larger piece of dust even. The 200-300mm is kind of soft. Other than that, it is a very decent lens for its price. The VR is quite effective. Focus speed is fast. Color rendering is good."},{"rating":"2","title":"Took the lens on vacation","review":"I took the lens with me to Gettysburg, Lancaster and Williamsburg. I got some wonderful pictures. The autofocus work perfectly even at the highest setting 300mm. Also the VR is a must.

I would recommend this lens."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lens Rocks! Discard the poor reviews due to shipping etc.","review":"I am very impressed with this lens. It is wonderfully sharp. The auto focus can hunt slightly in dimmer conditions but you would probably expect this with a 4.5 lense. Don't let this stop you at all. I would by it all over again for sure. By the way, I bought mine from ritz camera (.com) on Sunday and delivered on Thurs. (I paid $504 due to the $25 off for using paypal plus free shipping and no tax). Many photos are better than my 18-200mm VR lens. I'm so glad I bought this as the extra reach is going to help me out on the softball field where my 200mm was just short. One other thing I noticed was it is slightly noisier than my 18-200mm VR (but not terribly much more). It is enough to notice, but no show stopper. Your going to love the photos you get from this. I'm thrilled to have it and now be in the 300mm range. What a keeper. I plan to keep both my 18-200 and my 70-300. Mine comes with a 5 year warranty directly from Nikon."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sharp hand held telephoto images at last!","review":"Frustrated with hand held not quite sharp images from my previous Nikon ED AF 70-300 zoom; I recently bought this VR version.

Even (especially?) on my D700, this lens wasn't very good. Maybe on a DX sensor body it'll be better, but I hated it on my FX body.

The VR is really efficient: with good light, you can take picture without tripod at 300mm without any trouble.The only cons I have is when the light is not strong enough: this lens needs a lot of light.. or a tripod. Otherwise your pictures will be blurry.But for this price and this great quality, I don't really care and I am enjoying it!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A very nice, lens","review":"I have had this almost since it came out and have been very happy with it. Very sharp up to the low 200's and still good at 300mm. Nice color and contrast. The VR in this lens works very well. 3-4 stops with regularity. I use it on a Nikon D50.Other lenses owned... Sigma 10-20mm, Nikon 18-55 (Ver 1), 18-135mm and 50mm f/1.8 as well as some older film lenses."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent lens","review":"This lens was to replace our existing Sigma 70-300 APO. Not only is the Nikkor far sharper, but it also has the built in silent focus motor (AF-S) and vibration reduction (VR). This is our first lens with VR and it works very well allowing the lens to be hand-held. We always used the Sigma on a tripod. While it's no match for the 70-200 F/2.8 Nikkor, at 3x the price, this lens beats other consumer telephoto zoom lenses I've tried. By far the best 70-300 available."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice lens for the price","review":"I've had this for a couple of months now and I have liked the results so far. Been doing a lot of indoor sports photography (lacrosse and swimming) and once I got used to the limitations of the lens (small aperture) I am getting very good results for a lens in this price range. Autofocus is fast and pictures are sharp. Looking forward to outdoor sports this summer!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great lens - just get it","review":"I've been using this lens for two years and thought I'd add my thoughts. While this is a plastic, consumer-construction Nikkor, the optics are great. It's light, produces great images and is a convenient size to take anywhere - this lens is very compact for a long telephoto. The big, fast pro glass is great if you need f/2.8, but for daylight shooting this lens delivers. The bokeh is surprisingly nice, too. This is one of the best values in Nikon's lens lineup.I've used it on FX, DX and film and it generates good results in all three formats. The VR feature is perfectly matched to this type of lens, too, and works well. You'll get sharp results at all focal lengths for most reasonable shutter speeds.The focus speed won't blow you away (it's not slow, but it's not blazing fast either), but I think Nikon got the price / performance balance here right - slightly slower focus and cheaper construction in exchange for good optics, particularly up to 200mm, and a low price."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nikon 70-300mm VR","review":"Great lens for a low price upgraded from the Nikon 55-200mm VR lens, then from that too the Nikon 55-300mm VR lens, and now to the 70-300mm VR Lens and this is the best of the other lenses. Faster focus times Strong and better VR, easier to hold steady around 300mm because of better constructions and build. I have the Nikon D40x and the Nikon D7000 cameras. Lens are great on both cameras...its just the D7000's higher ISO settings(Clean 6400) can use the lenses in lower light settings since the 70-300mm VR starts at F4.5 at 70mm vs the D40x (clean 1600) or lower noise if your a good photographer. practice..practice..practice. don't let your gear limit your skills.

I'm gradually advancing in my photography skills since my wife gave me the D60 as a present. I bought this one as my original 55-200mm that came with the camera broke. The 70-300 is heavier, but great tele and ideal for portraits from not too close. It's a nice step-up from the 55-200 to better quality without the tremendous jump in price to some of the more expensive lens. It is a little bit less versatile perhaps than the 55-200 in that starting at 70mm you really need your objects to be not too close in order for you to use this lens.Very fast auto focus in good light situations with the D60, not that great in lower light situations.Enjoy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Lens","review":"This Nikon Lens is wery sharp and hes a very usefull range for my Nikon D800.

For the money ($500 at the time of purchase), it takes great pictures throughout it's range.In lower light, you'll need a tripod for clear shots while zoomed out towards 300mm - your hands just won't be steady enough. It also had occasional trouble focusing while zoomed all the way out but none while zoomed in just slightly from there.I thought it had good bokeh and no vignetting that I could discern although I'm no pro and I didn't compare against anything else. It also held up well during a relatively rough two-week trip during which it got rained on a bit and taken out on back-country day hikes - it never missed a beat.Overall, a great value for the money if you keep in mind it's few limitations."},{"rating":"2","title":"Weather flag, did the job.","review":"Nylon bad weather flag is what this reminds me of.

I love Oasis' music, own all their albums, but this live recording just sounds terrible. Liam's voice is really rough (too much smoking & drinking?) and he sounds half asleep/drunk on many of the tracks. I really like the new band members and Heathen Chemistry was just awesome, but they sound really new and not that great yet live on this recording. They should really release some live recordings from years ago - How about the Knebworth show? Oasis should take a lesson from U2 - They still sound great live after 20+ years in the business. Hopefully Liam will work on his voice and stay off the booze for shows in the future..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent CD, ALMOST perfect...","review":"This CD is an excellent example of the overall mastery that Oasis demonstrates on stage. Mood, energy, delivery, irreverance, it's all here. The on-stage banter makes me feel like I'm there again. Even if you're a casual Oasis fan (are there any?) this is a CD to add to your collection. My only regret is that they didn't take more of the songs from the Milwaukee show. I, too, was at that show, and it was stunning. The band was tight, the crowd was electric, and Liam was completely ON! A couple of the songs on the CD seemed to be obligatory, and for that reason Liam comes off a bit flat. All in all, it's well worth the money. Long live Oasis!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Oasis Live!","review":"The only time we could hear Oasis live on CD was through rare B-sides or expensive bootlegs. Now Oasis has selected a gig worth recording (Wembley) onto a CD with Familiar to Millions. Having gone to their concerts every year, I can safely say the sound quality of this CD is top for a live album.You'll hear the energy and spontaneity that goes into their live act. The big bonus is hearing their covers of Helter Skelter and Hey Hey, My My. Hear their greatest hits and also enjoy their rare live performance of Step Out.This doesn't rank up there with the ultimate live album, The Who: Live at Leeds, but it does a sufficient job. If you're an Oasis fan and want to experience their live act, pick this CD up. If you've never been to their concert, get the DVD or video as well. Great companion piece to the CD.Side-Warning: Just make sure your VCR can play the European version of the video. Some of them are not compatible."},{"rating":"2","title":"Would have been perfect if not for Liam","review":"Familiar to Millions features excellent renditions of classic Oasis tracks-the band sounds great for the most part, especially Noel's outstanding guitar work. However, the overall impression one is left with is that Liam is an annoying buffoon, completely superfluous and distracting. His vocal performance is consistently whiny and he mumbles through many a verse over the course of the cds. His indecipherable remarks and audience taunts (sometimes occuring in the middle of songs!) are amusing at first but quickly grow tiresome. Contrast Liam's poor performance with Noel's awesome vocals on \\"Step Out,\\" \\"Don't Look Back in Anger,\\" \\"Hey Hey, My My,\\" and \\"Helter Skelter\\" and you have to wonder why this joker is still associated with the band. To summarize: the cuts with Noel singing are perfect, and the band's great playing saves the cuts with Liam's crappy vocals."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Live Album","review":"I initially thought that this album was pretty bad. Liam's signing was awful - too dark and raspy. However, after a few times listening to the album I began to realize how well his singing fit with the rock-and-roll atmosphere. There are a few gems on here; I particularly like the cover of the classic \\"Hey, Hey, My, My\\". Of course, the greats are in here - \\"Live Forever\\", \\"Don't Look Back in Anger\\",\\" Wonderwall\\", \\"Supersonic\\"... though unfortunately many of the best songs are left out, especially those from their third album Be Here Now. But all in all, it is an excellent live album that will be appreciated by all devoted Oasis fans."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great live album, only that ...","review":"Liam's voice is almost lost. This was the end of their summer tour and what a way to end it! But Liam's voice was so tiring and couldnt really hit the high notes, altho Noel, his brother, usually does that but Liam couldn't even tried.Still it was two great shows and if you could own the DVD own it aswell since the stage is groundbreaking. My favorite track is definitely 'Who Feels Love?\\" and ofcourse the cover \\"Helter Skelter\\" (this is only on the album, not the dvd). I would say the latter is Noel's best vocal performance with also great guitaring and drumming by the band.No disapointment, guaranteed!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Cummins Bar Clamps","review":"The old adage \\"... you get what you pay for...\\" is the truth.One of the 24\\" clamps failed entirely after only the second use.

I'm sure you can figure out the plot just based on the characters since it is as obvious as they are.

The music quality was good but not great.My main trouble was with the photo storage. I downloaded the first days photos directly off the compact flash card. The download time was adequate. I have a Canon 5D camera which is a 12.1 mp camera. The files are quite large so I was happy with the download time. My main trouble with it is that after the second download session the unit stopped accepting the Compact Flash card. I don't know what happened.

D&D showcase series. Essentially a collection of sketches, the module serves little purpose beyond bulking characters up to 15th level. This is the worst sort of dungeon crawl; imagine your party wearing ties and carrying briefcases, and you can almost see them collecting their paychecks at the end of the day and returning home to watch TV and read the paper.

The shame of a single-star rating is averted by the inclusion of an interesting new race which can be put to good use - in a more enterprising module."},{"rating":"1","title":"A disappointment at Best","review":"This adventure seems hastily written and hastily put together. It lacks a real adventure hook and is basically a collection of encounters. And it's boring. I would have given it two stars for the interesting race of bat creatures within, but one of their special attacks lacks a DC, so even that isn't done correctly. Another annoying thing about the module is that it contains magical solutions for current technology, such as SCUBA gear. Super lame.

The inclusion of other big bands mimimized Kenton's exposure to a fraction of this DVD."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy it for cigar lighting","review":"This product was recommended to me as a cigar lighter. I regret buying it, as the flame barely stays lit; even in a still room! Outside, it is virtually useless. Also, the child safety on it makes it even more annoying to use since I'm constantly re-igniting it. There has to be better products out there - don't make the same mistake I made!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best lighter","review":"This is the third time I have purchased a Blazer and will keep doing so (I keep giving them to friends).

The Blazer has never failed me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Can comment on cigar lighting only","review":"I was looking to buy another PB207 so I came to Amazon, as I bought mine about ten years ago from an online welding supply house. To be honest I was amazed at the poor reviews. The quality of the product must have went south as I use this lighter on a regular basis with no issues. Once in a blue moon I need to click it twice to light. Overall it has been very reliable for lighting cigars indoors and now all most always outdoors or in my truck. I use Savinelli butane all of the time as it is has been my \\"go to\\" fuel for over 20 years. I smoke a pipe and use a Savinelli \\"Old Boy\\" with an angled flame. I do not sell lighters or do I have anything to gain by my positive comments other than expressing my good luck with this lighter. I guess the only thing I do is always make sure it is full of fuel I have never let it get less than half full. I have the clear model with no child safety feature."},{"rating":"1","title":"Piezoelectric sparker wears out","review":"The piezoelectric sparker stopped working about a month in. It still sparked, but the spark wasn't strong enough to light the gas jet. As a mechanical engineer, it is obvious to me that the designer of this lighter had no experience working with piezoelectrics and didn't even bother looking up their fatigue dynamics. While the lighter was extremely hot (hot enough to melt a penny if it was made after 1982), had a giant flame, and generally looked badass, I strongly recommend against buying this lighter on the basis of sparking mechanism wearing out after just one month."},{"rating":"1","title":"Did not work and was a waste of money - sorry","review":"I had used one of these types of lighters in the past and they are great for candles where the wick is difficult to reach. This one never worked and the mechanism was very challenging. Some kind of rocking motion was required. Threw it out as the gas seemed to leak as well."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Torch that does not work","review":"You do not have to worry about burning yourself with this torch because the odds are it will not be lit. I bought one to use as a lighter and could not have been more disappointed. The only way it will work is if it is on full, so the flame adjustment is useless. When it does light it will blow out for no apparent reason.This is the worst \\"Torch\\" or lighter that I have ever owned.Do not waste your money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works for me","review":"I purchased one of these about 10 years ago, it worked flawlessly lighting cigars, soldering wiring terminals and lighting an outdoor cooking fire or two. I lost it one day and purchased two more. The replacement has been working for five years, and I sent the other to a friend who needed one. Now mine went through the washer, so it is a little harder to light, but still works. I just ordered another."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Mis-fire","review":"Upon receiving this small pocket torch I was very happy with the way it performed. Exceptionally hot flame and seemed to be working fine. A short time later it wouldn't even ignite. I wish that I could say that it was over-used or abused and therefore it failed but unfortunately this isn't the case. After light usage, the torch simply won't work. I used the best gas available for these to no avail. I enjoyed it and was very pleased at first but having stopped working in such a short time I have to say that although this is a good idea, it simply doesn't hold up."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good light but can be finicky.","review":"This was the first lighter I've bought that's over $10. My main purpose for buying it was for lighting cigars, small soldering projects, and a survival lighter. It works well for the first two uses and I would imagine it would be reliable in a survival situation seeing as it has a nice cap to cover the part where the flame comes out which avoids getting water in it. The only negative thing I can say is that sometimes it misfires and the flame goes out on the lowest setting. I actually haven't had it misfire in a while but that could be in relation to the fuel level. When it's full it seems like it misfired more but now that it's under 1/2 it seems fine. I also cleaned out the torch area with a q-tip and that seemed to help too. I was lighting off fireworks with it for the 4th and I think some debris got into it and it actually wouldn't light at all. Overall it's a good quality lighter and will surely last longer than what you would find at a convenient store."},{"rating":"1","title":"horrible product","review":"This product worked fine for the first 20 lights then the next 10 lights you have to flick the lighter at least 15 times to finally get it to ignite. It gets worse and worse as far as flicks to get it to light. I just got off my deck and I counted 20 flicks and finally it lit. The butane level is almost 3/4 full and still I have no idea why it still won't light. I will be returning this product as soon as possible. I thought paying this price would give me a reliable lighter on the golf course and in heavy winds but all it has brought to me is frustration and dismay. I hate this lighter with every ounce of being that I contain and everything it stands for. Give me my Ronson or Bic and this lighter can rot in hell!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Dissappointing - well maybe not","review":"This lighter worked great for a while then began losing its spark. It is pretty easy to blow out (no wind resistance at all - which I expected) but then having it be difficult to relight is a pain. Seems like there is no more spark.After writing this original review, I took the lighter out and tinkered with it a bit. It seems that the small igniter (the wire that shots the spark onto the burner) got pushed down into the lighter somehow [not sure how, I pretty much always leave the little cap on] - anyway that was the cause of the misfires. After nudging it back up above the burner, I get a light almost every time. Leaving the setting a 4 though - cause I cannot figure out how this may have happened to cause the misfires in the first place."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy this lighter","review":"this lighter is impossible to fill, the piece at the bottom is very hard to turn and finding the right tool to turn it is very hard.

Do not buy this lighter!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed once again","review":"The Blazer microtorch went off the general market for awhile and was only sold as an industrial tool. It was always plagued by poor workmanship and a limited lifetime. Now it seems to be back. I hoped for a better product. Mine lasted about a week. The same old issues seem to remain. The center piece that appears to distribute the gas becomes loose and the lighter becomes useless. I've ended up throwing several away. I had one a couple of years back that lasted for over a year. Oh well. I've gone back to bic lighters."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the greatest lighter","review":"The lighter worked well when I just received the product (just not windproof at all), but after a while, it'll lit up but get blown out for no reason, lasting less than a second. I had to turn the lighter upside down to start it and then turn it straight for it to work. Quite a waste, though the blue flame looks great."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dissapointed again","review":"I have bought a few of these over the years and each time something has gone wrong with the injectors putting out the butane. I even bought a case of Blazer fuel which is triple refined but eventually the injectors get clogged and the lighter ceases putting out any butane.The last one I bought stopped working just a month or two after the purchase and I won't buy another one again; I don't know what happened to quality of these lighters but this USED to be a good product. The first one I owned lasted a long time and never failed me; but I lost it during a hiking trip and none have worked that well since.I would have once recommended this to anyone and everyone, but now I would suggest buying a butane torch from Harbor Freight instead of this.Thanks,"},{"rating":"1","title":"It was great then it stopped working","review":"I bought this lighter after reading some rave reviews here and other places. I wanted a no frills bulletproof lighter I even went with the clear so I could always easily see how much fluid was in it. I used the lighter for cigar lighting mostly. I only ran vector butane. The lighter worked for a couple weeks then it failed. It would not light most of the time and then not at all. I liked the idea, strong flame large fuel capacity durable design. You can find a lot of different variations of this style torch lighter but if its not going to be bulletproof guaranteed why waste 30 bucks. You can try your luck on a 5 dollar version. For what it is worth I do have a Xikar Element and its been my durable fail safe and would recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a good choice!","review":"PROS1. Very hot flame2.

Ten weeks of off and on reliability and then kaput. A total waste of good money."},{"rating":"1","title":"PB207 Blazer Lighter","review":"Like so many others who have left reviews for this lighter I ordered multiple PB207 lighters and instead got the model PB207-CR which is the child resistant (CR). At 60 years old, the dexterity of my fingers have trouble with the CR \\"locks\\" so I did not want this model. I called to make the order to avoid this and specifically asked Amazon to NOT send the Child Resistant (CR)lighters and they assured me they would not. They did anyway.

I have a Portasol butane mini torch which has a hot gun tip but it will not light using the internal piezo-electric starter so I use the Blazer to heat up this tip until it starts. I prefer the hot blower to a straight flame when using heat shrink tubing because the straight flame can often burn the tubing spoiling the appearance of the work. It's nice to have the stand and the little \\"always on\\" switch if you need to heat something and have both hands free. The Blazer is portable so when you are sitting around with friends and a \\"who has the coolest lighter\\" competition starts you will always win with this little guy.

I used it for everything from cigar night to lighting birthday candles at lightening speed. Unfortunately it died when I put some old (bad) butane in and could never get it to stay lit again. The new lighter is working as well as the old one, great to have it back. The only con I would give is I wish they would put out a non-childproof model again. It's slightly annoying and my kids are grown. If there is one available I couldn't find it. It's been a great product for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great","review":"I have used this lighter for 4 years now. It is hands down the best lighter I have ever owned. This thing always lights and holds a lot of fuel. You can refill it and it light's right up unlike other ones that would have to be bled. Buy this lighter and you will not be disappointed.

RZA is at his best when using a sample-based production style. Tracks like \\"Domestic Violence\\", although they could be done better, are RZA's bread and butter. This album shows that when RZA decides to create a track without samples, the outcome will dissapoint. He's an arranger, not a musician.Some of the beats sound like someone's little sister sitting at a casio, pounding random keys out of time (and I am speaking about one of my favorite producers of all time here).This album is not Wu-Tang style.

Hmm. Some of the lyrics are clever. 'Girl you look as pretty as a brand new glock/or a thousand hundred dollar bills inside a shoebox' is about the best line that I have ever heard. There are a couple tracks that expand upon the Wu-formula to great success.

A great buy, I love these things."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cute and oh so handy","review":"I know these mini bowls don't dominate anyone's kitchen but they sure are handy for adding spices, etc. I've got them in the cabinet next to the stove and find myself reaching for them all the time. I also use them to collect 4 days worth of vitamins to put in individual bags for me to take. They are just an all around good addition to anyone's kitchen. I hand wash them because I do that for all my plastic or silicone things and they are perfect.Like I said, not a necessity for everyone but they sure have come in more handy than I ever thought they would. I live alone so make things in smaller amounts and these help especially when I'm making an Indian dish with a variety of spices."},{"rating":"2","title":"great for prep work","review":"I received a set of these bowls as part of a wedding present. Useful, aesthetic, and durable. My wife and I spend lots of time in the kitchen together and we enjoy trying out new recipes. Having all our prep work done first, and everything measured out before the cooking itself is always useful with a new recipe.The \\"pinching\\" is a better feature than I had thought it would be- it makes it easier to pour than if the bowls were hard sided.These little bowls clean up easily and stack conveniently for storage."},{"rating":"2","title":"Kitchen helpers","review":"In my family we work full time jobs and commute everyday 1.5 hours in each direction, and we still cook dinner every night. With these little guys I can prep all of the spices and small chopped items on the counter and as we cook we can dump them right in without much fuss.

I literally have an entire bedroom closet full of games. I was excited about this game, it \\"sounded\\" great. My friends and I quickly realized that this game was awful. The sounds are ridiculous. The one that caused us to pack it in after many incorrect guesses was the \\"pillow being put into a pillow case\\". HUH! I am the type to hold on to many of the bad games I buy if they have any redeeming value whatsoever. I returned this one to the toy store the next day and got all of my money back. What a stinker! Plus, it was expensive. BEWARE SECRET SOUNDS."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buyer Beware!!","review":"We purchased this game for family play and returned it to the store within an hour. It was the dumbest game we've ever played! The sounds on the CD are totally ridiculous--who would know what the sound is for putting toothpaste on a toothbrush?? All of the sounds are practically identical--you cannot tell one track from another. Do not recommend this game to anyone!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The worst game I have ever played...","review":"I purchased this game to play with my family during the Holidays. What a mistake! This is, by far, the worst game I have ever played. The sounds in this game are muffled and completely unreal. For example, the \\"buttering bread\\" sound sounded more like sandpapering the side of a car. If I buttered my bread the way it sounded I would have a big gaping hole in the middle of it. To make it worse, I attempted to return the item to Amazon with an explanation of my complete dissatisfaction. I only received a refund for 1/2 the purchase price since it was already open (how are you suppose to check out the game without opening it?). I should probably be thankful that I received even 1/2 the money back, but I just think it is unfair that I, basically, just paid $13.00 to receive nothing."},{"rating":"1","title":"More Like a Warm Night in Ballymuir","review":"I find it hard to really care about prickly Jenna, or her bratty sister, Maureen. The effort to keep Dev's business interest mysterious, just ends up making it uninteresting. Apparently it had something to do with some modern resort or shopping center ruining Ballymuir's charm (and Jenna's restaurant).I really like reading about Ireland, but the characters put me off enough that I couldn't even enjoy some of the descriptions of the country.By page 150, I gave up on the story and flipped ahead trying to find the \\"Hot Night\\" that was promised. Never did spot it, but I'm sure it's there somewhere hidden in Jenna and Dev's sparring."},{"rating":"1","title":"Left me Cold","review":"Weary, stale, flat...but apparently profitable. This formulaic second book in Kelly's series leaves one as cold as...well any real night in Ireland would. All there was of depth and promise in the first has fallen sadly short here. With a tiresomely predictable heroine, Jenna, and her inability to leave control of even the smallest detail or greatest pleasure, to the conflicted momma's boy for a hero, Dev, clearly meant to be the Devil, one must wonder what deal the author made that would force such compromise in what could have been a truly rich, deep, and Irish story line. Where \\"Last Bride\\" excited and inspired, \\"Hot Nights\\" , just makes the reader cringe in embarrassment for its author, and wonder if the third book, if there is one coming, will be worth the time to read it, or better thrown in the fire to try to generate the heat this book lacks."},{"rating":"2","title":"Home sweet home!","review":"Our little 21 pound Lilly loves her new house! I'm glad we went with the larger size because it gives her lots of room to move around and plenty of room for her stuffed friends.

We did have one of those large plastic cages but it stuck out like a sore thumb in our living room and was hard to transport to the dog sitter. The only thing I would want is a place to hang her water bottle."},{"rating":"2","title":"great dog home","review":"This is our second PetMate used for a Golden Retriever. It is lightweight to carry around, we used it in the car and house. Easy to wash. First one used for 7 years, then zipper gave out, but after so many years of use, did not bother me. Our current puppy played with our first one too roughly so don't let that happen-the top metal support bar started to stick out, which was dangerous. Still love the product, just don't let a dog jump on it!! Zips together, then just unzip to store flat. Has comfy washable pad, and mesh windows. Mostly like it for being lightweight. Our dog loves it, goes in willingly most nites. And it was a reasonable price."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too bad...","review":"I bought this product for our toy poodle puppy. It is a nice product, but I am very disappointed that my tiny puppy chewed zipper and broke it in a few days. My 3 pound chewed two spots, and then the zipper doesn't work anymore. How can this product be so weak!? I like the design, and my puppy was so comfortable in there, but it's useless as I can open/close the zipper at all! The company needs to improve the zipper part so that little innocent puppy cannot chew."},{"rating":"2","title":"Portable pet crate","review":"This is an easy to set up, very handy portable pet crate. As soon as it is unzipped from its case, you zip up the sides to set it up. No tent poles to figure out, just the zippers.

Screen windows give it lots of air circulation."},{"rating":"1","title":"so disappointed","review":"We bought this travel crate for our 7-month old puppy to sleep in during vacation. We selected the large size so she could have something to grow into (she's a pit/catahoula mix, so she's going to be a big girl). During our first night, she became startled by something and pushed through the front \\"door\\" of the crate, pushing through the seam between the net and the zipper. It's now completely unusable.We've have several Petmate metal and portable crates, and I'm absolutely disappointed with the durability of this item. If a 40lb puppy can cause this damage, how secure would a 65lb dog be in the pet home?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great temp crate","review":"This crate is great for when I travel and need to be able to secure my dog for small periods of time.

Every time I wanted an example of a method or function, I looked in the index, went to the page noted, and found a grid with the list of exposed properties, methods, etc. No concrete examples there. To me, this was little more than the MSDN help files bound between two covers.I'm in the midst of writing code, and this book was no help, so I didn't bother to finish it because it didn't seem like a good use of my time. Maybe if you're learning from scratch it would be a good tool??? I will try the advanced ADO.NET book from Microsoft.

It has turned out to be a miserable experience for me.The book comes with a sample database in both MDB (Access) and MDF (SQL Server) formats. The author neglected to include an LDF file (a log file), which is an essential part of a SQL Server database. Without it, you can't attach the database to SQL Server!So, I'm unable to attach the sample database to SQL Server. Since all the exercises in the book are built around the sample database, it's more or less useless.Don't waste your money; at least, not until Microsoft gets this title right.

The switch was delivered QUICKLY. It appeared to be a very nice switch. It was about 2 weeks before I got a chance to install it. After installation, I was disappointed in the loud clicking noise it made. I could not use it in the morning due to the fact that someone was still sleeping. I was EVEN more disappointed after 2 additonal weeks when the switch failed to completely shut off (but clicked sporadically), causing the motor on the fan to start/stop fairly rapidly. Obviously, the motor in the fan would have been destroyed in a short period of time. I removed the switch. I bought an Intermatic switch locally and installed it. It is VERY quiet and has worked well thus far. Only time will tell how long it will last, but at least I am optimistic."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for GFCI branch!","review":"I bought two of these timers. One was for a shower vent/light that is part of a Ground Fault Circuit Disconnect (GFCI) branch. The timer on this GFCI branch blows the disconnect after 3 or 4 switch operations. I found no declaration that this was a known situation in any of the descriptions. I wired the switch to a simple light fixture and it still blew. I traded the two timers positions to see if it was the design or just bad luck on the individual unit.

In my opinion, Chris was an example of the unique American nobility where one's greatness is measured \\"by the content of their character.\\" He belongs in the hall of fame with Pat Tillman, Susan Butcher, Henry Tureman Allen, Daniel Boone and the like. We are fortunate to be able to hold on to these memories through his music.There is something about the simple, smooth and clear nature of his voice that exposes the fun and honest personality which comes though every song.Some songs are better than others, but I haven't heard a song by him I don't like.

After all the years Chris recorded, surely there are at least 10 unreleased songs somewhere. Capitol could have used the new song on this CD and the two previously unreleased songs on the first box set and then found seven more. Maybe Capitol could even have persuaded Garth Brooks to include his tribute song to Chris.Since 1994, Capitol has released NINE compilations of Chris' previously released material (two box sets, live, best of, greatest hits, re-recordings, and two other collections).

This is another poor effort.I love the guy -- seen him 50+ times -- but skip this one and buy any of the other live records (Australia, 11-17-70, especially Here & There) for the real deal.How about some archived live shows from '76 or '77, the '79 and early '90's solo shows with Ray Cooper, or the '95 shows at the Garden? Any of those would be terrific."},{"rating":"1","title":"WHERE IS THE REAL ELTON??","review":"Although there is a bunch of great Elton's early classics and also the sound of the band is really big, Elton's voice is depressing!! Even his outfits do not remember the great 70's and early 80's Elton John's, I mean the personality that he used to transmit on stage. That hairstyle he's wearing is ridiculous!! But the mean problem is about his voice. Elton has better live albums, such as \\"Here and There\\" or \\"17-11-70\\". Sorry, for me this one can go directly to the trash can."},{"rating":"1","title":"sonic disater","review":"I cannot believe that in this day and age, with all the technology available, that a product as bad as this can be produced and passed as 'good'.

When I put this in my player, what came out could be nothing short of an absolute horror. Much like a multi-tentacled Lovecraftian beast, this THING wrapped itself around my head and beat it with its boredom.

He is one of the few truly gifted and enduring talents.This CD: Basically it would appear to me that Elton needed to fullfill his record contract and/or generate some income; he should slow down his spending and skip efforts like this CD. There are better albums that cover these songs and the live venue for this recording does not show-case his voice. Bryan Adams and Ronan Keating (duets with Elton) sound as if they need a rest or were just not warmed-up.Skip this CD and wait for his studio album he has being working on with Bernie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Also . . .","review":"Contrary to earlier reviews1) Nigel is NOT the primary drummer on this record -- in fact you can't hear him at all.

Do not buy this album with similar expectations. While the concert included an emphasis on the older songs with extended piano playing, minimal accompaniment and great vocals -- this album failed to come even close to meeting those standards.If you are looking for a \\"live\\" greatest hits package, with a weaker voiced Elton John, assisted by others when he no longer can reach certain notes, buy this."},{"rating":"2","title":"nobody is better","review":"elton john is the best musician in the world and this album proves his geniouse all his songs are great"},{"rating":"2","title":"HEAVY DUTY ITEM","review":"I prefer this solid style heavier post over the light weight models.This one will easily go 40 years laying exposed in the floor of a jon boat."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pankration: The ultimate book","review":"This book takes place in ancient Greece.

Then Nic is captured and sold as a slave. Gellius was not captured. This story tells about his search for a friend, and his struggle.I think that this was a great book. My friend thinks it was too convenient for Nic sometimes and a little unrealitic, but I loved it.This book was exciting, and made you think about your life too. This book was a wonder to our class(as we read it aloud in class) I give this book five stars. It was a book of great pain, suffering, and happiness.

Like the other reviewer said, the hammer started breaking immediately--but even worse, the nails were completely impossible to remove after my son hammered them in partway. Neither my husband or I could remove them (or the people at the store where I returned it)--making it impossible to fold the bench and making the toy pretty much worthless. What were the manufacturers thinking?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the trouble","review":"This toy is not worth the money! You can't really hammer or screw any of the pieces without adult help. Once you hammer the piece in, you can't get it out. When you screw in the screws, you have to hold a piece under the bench, which of course, a child can't do. It is also very heavy for a little one to move around and the pieces will fall out since there is no storage.

This book is a good book for anyone of any age. It is fun and lighthearted. I also recommend Charls M.

KROQ has always been a supporter of Moz and it's great to hear these live versions. \\"There's A Place In Hell For Me And My Friends\\" ditches the lonley piano for a decidedly more upbeat version and both \\"My Love Life\\" and \\"Sing Your Life\\" are performed well and are quite lovely. a nice little treat for fans."},{"rating":"2","title":"Smashingly good Morrissey EP","review":"The only thing that I would change about this EP if I could would be to make it longer. Morrissey's renditions of these three great songs of his left me wanting to hear more of the same!Most EPs and CD singles have only one or two songs that you can't get on a regular album. \\"Morrissey at KROQ\\" has three different versions of three of his songs, versions that you can't find anywhere else. The style is unlike anything else that you will hear in Morrissey's other work. \\"KROQ\\" has a very old-style rock sound to it, with an old stand-up string bass on the bass line, while the other musicians are busy with newer harmonies. Especially on \\"Sing Your Life,\\" the tempo is quite upbeat.This EP really gives us a side of Moz that you don't hear much of outside of his concerts."},{"rating":"2","title":"What everyone else said","review":"Unique rockabilly arrangements of three great Moz tunes, performed to perfection.

The rim is thicker and the shape slightly more squat."},{"rating":"2","title":"Replacement item","review":"I purchased a set of the Waterford Araglin Claret glasses (6 of them) about 8 years ago in Ireland and just recently one was broken. I thought this item was discontinued but then found it on Amazon and elsewhere on the internet. At other sites it would have cost me $30 more to replace it so I ordered from Amazon and it arrived in a timely fashion and was extremely well wrapped to prevent breakage. Needless to say I was very pleased with the price, packaging and delivery of this item and it matched my other pieces perfectly."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too dry and hard to use","review":"This was the first hamburger bun we found after our celiac diagnosis. Comes unsliced, was very hard to cut through. They were very dry and too bready. To be able to eat them at all, we had to wrap them in wet towels and heat/microwave...and eat FAST as they harden up quickly. No way you can toast them or grill them and have them not come out hard as a rock! Not much flavor either. The size is better than the tastier Schar brand we've found since though, actually is the right size for a regular burger patty."},{"rating":"2","title":"My little girl can eat at in and out now","review":"My little girl has food allergies the big ones , wheat, dairy, soy , nuts and a bunch more. There are not a lot of good bread products on the market for her, but these hambuger buns are great. We heat them up for a minute in the microwave then take them to in and out burger and make her a double without the cheese or the sauce and she loves it.

Mine arrived already dried out. When removing them from the package they were cracked and crumbly. My sons who are Celiacs almost cried. They miss hamburger buns so badly and I thought with the reviews I saw that these were the answer for them.Both are six years old and both practically gagged on the texture and taste.. all around just plain bad. Even our dog wouldn't eat them and he eats just about everything.. he sniffed them and walked away.. That says it all right there."},{"rating":"2","title":"These are pretty good for microwave use","review":"I love the fact that these cover and prevent most splatters in the microwave. I really love the fact that it has decreased the time we require to heat something up. I hate that the edges curl and semi-defeat their purpose. They are easy to clean and would fit in any microwave. The various sizes are also convenient."},{"rating":"1","title":"Melted in microwave","review":"I sent this back.

Needless to say, food starts to splatter from the sides because the item is no longer flat to cover the food.I consider these more disposable than a reusable item, certainly not very durable. Not recommended!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very easy to use covers.","review":"I had been having a hard time getting my husband to cover food when heating it in the microwave. Anyone could tell that by looking inside of the oven! I was continuously having to clean it. Now, I leave the covers laying on top of the microwave and he'll use them every time. I'm so proud of him!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This product saves time money!","review":"I have had a set like this for at least 10 years and I still am using it! My married kids keep asking for a set so I am ordering for them and an extra for myself. I've never had trouble with curling as other reviewers have mentioned. I keep them in the cupboard next to my microwave and grab one whenever I need to cover something. Far easier than grabbing plastic wrap. When finished, I just put them in the dishwasher. I've never had any problems when they touch the food either. Do put the ridged side down,smooth side up."},{"rating":"2","title":"micro cover","review":"These are so transparant, I used them once, and can't find where I put them. Dog gone it! I liked them the one time I used them."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT APPROPRIATE for MICROWAVE USE!","review":"Bought this Norpro set of Micro-Covers with high hopes based on the description and reviews. Followed the directions carefully to avoid problems. First use was in heating microwavable oatmeal. What a disaster! The Micro-Cover was way too light and exploded off the amply sized microwave dish. There was oatmeal splattered all over the inside of the microwave.Second use was on heating some water in a cup using the small Micro-Cover just like it is pictured on the package. No good! The Micro-Cover curled up from the heat and was therefore useless.I certainly would not recommend this product. The Micro-Covers are way too light for their purpose and explode off or curl up from the microwave heat. I gave it one star cause that's the minimum allowed."},{"rating":"2","title":"A handy tool to use with the microwave","review":"First of all, this item is a handy way to easily cover items in your microwave. It replaces using plastic wrap, wax paper, paper towels, or another dish. It's also handy because as they get dirty, they can be washed by hand OR in the dishwasher. Covering the food allows it to heat faster. All good things.I also think that the item is somewhat mislabeled. Micro-Covers and the image on the product shows a small plastic cover to use with a cup. And there are two of them in the package. There are also two others. One is 9\\" square and 1 is 7\\" square; large enough for many serving dishes.This is a handy kitchen tool."},{"rating":"1","title":"MAJOR disappointment-waste of money","review":"I can't believe anyone found these covers to be effective - makes me wonder if the reviewers are \\"plants\\" from Norpro. Like the previous reviewer a few days ago, I think they are worthless. Upon using each of the different sizes, they immediately curled up. This causes them to blow off of the food the majority of the time (from the micro's fan, I'm guessing)and just lay on the turntable. This is due to the gap that now exists when the cover is lying across the container and is curled up instead of lying flat. The whole purpose of these was to safely cover food to prevent splattering within the micro and to help contain the heat - they do NEITHER! WHAT a waste of time and money. I can't believe the positive reviews below. Just doesn't make sense unless the plastic was of a different grade. I'm going to return these."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sounds like a good idea...","review":"I also bought this set so I wouldn't be using disposable plastic wrap or waxed paper to cover dishes in the microwave. But, if you use them to heat up soup - or anything that you want to get really hot - they get permanantly pock marked (like a plastic bowl does when heating up spaghetti sauce). And they warp."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worthless","review":"Steam and heat from the food below cause the flimsy covers to fall off, making them entirely worthless."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice idea, bad product","review":"This looks like a great product, but it is a piece of junk and does not work. I read other reviews how it doesn't lay flat, but thought I'd give it a try for a few bucks. Don't waste your money - it doesn't work. Because it doesn't lay flat and rolls, food splatters out the sides. Not even work the space it takes up in the cupboard. It they sent it to you for free, it wouldn't be worth it. Amazon should remove this product from their store."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible product - Warps when heated","review":"I am surprised that anyone who gave this product a rating of more than a 2 ever actually used it.The covers curl up when heated making them useless, unless you weight them down with a saucer or other heavy object. Hardly convenient. Once warped they do not flatten, making them worthless for the purpose intended.A frustrating product that was obviously never tested for its intended purpose. It makes me wonder if they are even safe to be used around food."},{"rating":"2","title":"Norpro Microwave Covers","review":"Using these is much easier than wasting a plate or some other dish or papertowel, especially if you're trying to recycle and go green and they are easy to clean. The microwave isn't a mess.

And certainly, this 20-track CD offers a much better, and broader, overview of Joe Ely's career than the 12-track \\"20th Century Masters\\" collection. Whether you are a fan already, or interested in hearing music by this heralded texas troubadour country-rocker, this is an excellent collection that should meet your listening needs. Joe Ely is one of America's most underrated recording artists. He's been making fabulous music for the past four decades.

He instead chose to mostly write an autobiography in which he made that fatal error common to many autobiographists in assumming that his life minutiae was of the same interest to to others that it was to him. The result is a suprisingly bad book.

This is a classic set, but there is a problem. I find two of these episodes completely boring. The Living Dead and Never, Never Say Die are so boring. The Living Dead is an interesting plot, but the way it was made, they didn't do a good job(in my opinion). Never, Never Say Die has an interesting plot also. It's about substituting some certain people for robots in their place. It's neat, but for 20 minutes or something like that you just keep seeing this robot walking around. The Hidden Tiger, The Correct Way to Kill, Epic, and The Superlative Seven are all very well done.

The songs are all soft rock tunes produced in a very 70's way (funky with a lot of wah wah and phase shifter effects). George plays most of the melodies in octaves (like Wes Montgomery did on his Verve recordings); he doesn't solo as much as you would expect; and horns and violins are added to each song in in the style typical of CTI. Anyway, here is the song list: Theme from Good King Gone Bad, One rock don't make no boulder, Em, Cast your fate to the wind, Siberian workout, Shell of a man, and Hold on I'm comin'. All the songs are instrumental (mostly Dave Mathews tunes), except George sings on the last one. If you want funky 70's dance music, I guess you might like this. If you want to hear what a great jazz guitar player George Benson is, I'd try something else (like one of his earlier albums)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Elegant and solid","review":"Nice...handsome and pleasing to hold, doesn't seem fragile like many wine glasses.

I easily found one at a local book store chain and the second on Amazon. I know the new reissues are more bass-heavy and audiologically more state of the art. But, the memoires that come from hearing the American versions of those albums blasting from your stereo speakers cannot be replaced. AND, the second collection now has the impossible to find George Martin instrumental tracks from HELP! And, in the end, Beatles is Beatles is GREAT music!g. moore / Staten Island"},{"rating":"1","title":"Zapped Again","review":"After having received my copy of The Capitol Albums, Vol. 2 from Amazon.com, I first noticed that there was a yellow sticker pasted to the long box that included an \\"SK1\\" designation, which supposedly indicates that the set has true mono mixes of the songs on the 4 albums within (yes, a CD is still an \\"album\\"). However, my set definitely has the false start on the MONO version of the song \\"I'm Looking Through You\\". So much for quality control at Capitol and at Amazon. I have been aware for many years about Capitol's lack of regard for artists and customers. So thank you very much Capitol and Amazon for your unending contempt for your customers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Needless and overpriced","review":"I bought it because I'm a completist. But I have to be honest, I didn't want it. I want remastered versions (mono and stereo) of the UK releases. When, oh, when, almight Apple?? Hopefully sooner than later, but until then I have this (and volume 1) for historical purposes only."},{"rating":"1","title":"SHAME ON \\"CRAPITOL\\", SHAME ON AMAZON!","review":"On May 13, noticing the nice little disclaimer Amazon had listed then about how they now were only shipping a \\"correct\\" version of this CD with the authentic mono mixes for \\"Beatles' VI\\" and \\"Rubber Soul\\", I placed my order. What did I receive 1 week later? The BOGUS \\"mistake\\" version, with the fake mono, \\"folded down stereo\\" mixes! GRRRR!!! You blew it BIG TIME, Amazon! And as far as this \\"mistake\\" by \\"CRAPITOL\\" Records is concerned, I don't believe this was a mistake at all! Think about it, people: what in the world would ANYBODY today use folded-down stereo for, except to avoid searching for the authentic mono masters and taking the time to actually remaster them too? This neglect of duty is inexcusable, especially coming from CRAPITOL, who has made hundreds of millions off Beatles sales and stands to make even more millions off this reissue! RIP OFF!!! RIP OFF!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Beatles are the Best.","review":"This is everything that it is advertised to be. The updated, scratch-free productions are superb. Some listeners will be annoyed at the stereophonic mixing of voice and instruments. But you have to remember to enjoy the hundreds of great tunes the Beatles created in their careers. The songs are what you will remember. I never heard the entire sound track to Help before, and it is very interesting and creative. It shows George Martin at his best."},{"rating":"2","title":"You've got a ticket to ride","review":"When I saw that they were finally releasing the Capitol albums, volume two was the one I most wanted to get. \\"Ticket to Ride\\" is one song in particular that has two very different mixes-or remixes. The opening guitar riff is much more up front and there is more echo on the Captitol version. It sounds much more powerful than the version on the English version of Help. \\"I'm looking through you\\" is another. This mix is roughly the same, but someone decided to chop off the beginning of the song for the English album and I've been stuck with that for quite a while. I grew up with the longer version and that is the version I like. Try as I might, to this day, when I hear the English version, I think about that. Now I have the version I know and love."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too much drama not enough action","review":"An okay entry into the series but, way too much drama.

I have read all of the Dark series and I can't put them down. This one took me days to get through,I had a hard time picking it up. It was truly one of the worst books I have ever read.

I found Destiny to be monotonus, and Nicolae a weak carpathian."},{"rating":"2","title":"A fun Feehan read","review":"You can read everyone else's reviews and there are tidbits of truth in them all.For me, it was a fun read. For some reason Destiny reminded me of the Myers-Briggs INFP personality type....those believe they are battling the evil in themselves. Her struggle is to find that what she carries inside her (vampire blood) is not 'who' she is.And Nicholae is probably up there in my top 5 favorite uber-alpha-macho Carpathian males. He's protective, but he's also very aware that she needs her space and freedom. That forcing her will only drive her away or into madness.His actions speak more of true love instead of auto-response to Carpathian genetics."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just like the others . . .","review":"and that's the problem. I've probably read all of the Carpathian books, but I'm now finished with the series. So many of the characters are the same, especially the men. For the women, different things may happen to them, but I feel like I'm reading about the same people over and over. I was really looking forward to this book recapturing what I liked about the first few in the series, but it didn't. If you haven't read any of Feehan's other novels then you'll probably enjoy this one, but otherwise just avoid it."},{"rating":"2","title":"so wonderful!!","review":"It was so great to read this book, it broke up any monotony (not that there is much at all) that the series may have.

I found it to be terribly... well... dark, and couldn't imagine Destiny ever having a normal relationship after what she experienced in childhood. Not without years and years of therapy anyway.That clouded the whole experience of reading the novel for me. I did think it was well written and some of the secondary characters were fun and had nice storylines. I just couldn't believe the romance aspect of it. It would have been better if I was expected a paranormal mystery novel rather than a romance one."},{"rating":"1","title":"self-flagellating, preachy trash","review":"Ok so maybe starting the series on book 11 is not a good idea, BUT this trash was so not worth the time to read. The main female character goes on and on and on and on and you just wish she would shut up. The main male character ends up coming off the patron saint of patience, soooo not based in reality. Then of course throughout the book we have the homilies of the holier than thou population. There is a kernel of an interesting plot within and I had hopes for the book for the first 150 or so pages, BUT of course it did not live up to it and by page 300 I couldn't care less if the main characters lived. However, I will not get a book and NOT read it (was bought in a collection of supernatural romance lot). The book should have been 100 pages shorter. The only way I finished it was to put it in the bathroom where I was forced to finish it."},{"rating":"1","title":"This was an awful book!!!!","review":"I bought this book because I wanted to try something different. It was different alright! In a word, this storyline was STUPID! I knew it was about vampires but there was just a little too much reference to blood and drinking blood in this book. It started to make me a little sick. I think this author has some kind of sick fascination with the eroticism associated with vampires. The story was boring and inane. I tried to keep on with it but gave up after 150 pages. There was no romance at all. All I wanted was for those evil vampires to put the bite on the heroine and get rid of her! Suffice it to say, I will NEVER waste my hard earned money on any more of Ms. Feehan's novels."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lile 5-minute Coffee","review":"OK, I am anavid Feehan fan and will read and buy anything she publishes. But be warned that Dark Destiny is not what the first \\"preview\\" chapter makes it out to be.First, the book deals with issues that are more disturbing than informative. From child rape...to more sexual intense moments this book was gory to take for something that could entertain you.Secondly, after the 5th chapter the book goes into a depressing and repetitive tone that is just boring...the love tangle between the two characters does not seem authentic, more like forced by the author.I was really disappointed by the book, and will be more careful when choosing books in the future before reading reviews like this.People easily jump into conclusions that this is the greatest read in the world...but to be honest I put the book down too many times to allow that statement.I recommend that you BORROW or get the book from the library and preread some chapters to see where you stand...good luck."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sighsss this just doesn't compare to her previous books","review":"I don't know what happen. But it seems that her creativity is spent towards Mind Game. The Dark Destiny lacks the spark that is found in her previous Cara. books. Those special intimacies between the main characters making fun of the ingrained arrogant... he-man.... know it all male characteristics is not as funny or enjoyable as it use to be. The concept of having a female hunter versus a male hunter is a great idea but not plotted well in this particular book.Ironic her other book recently released \\"Mind Game' is by far a better book to read.Not worth the purchase. Perhaps used... maybe ....... or just borrow from a library before buying it if you really want buy it for your collection."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible","review":"Though I have loved the other books in the Dark Series, this one is terrible. Destiny is very whiny and seems to enjoy her victim status. Nicholae is a good character but the relationship with Destiny has no sizzle. It was mostly blood and gore with very little romance. Even though I have been a strong Feehan fan, I can NOT recommend this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"zzzzzzzzzzz","review":"Since others have mentioned the plot problems, I will only say that if I were the hero, I would have preferred to walk into the sun. What an annoying heroine. What a pity, a good premise which the author didn't develop. Instead we get the same kind of suffering hero, waiting for the damn heroine to realize he's not a vampire...the bad guy...again and again...I couldn't take the repetitions. The reader isn't stupid. We got it, please move on!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I was expecting.","review":"FYI: the actual shoe covers do not resemble the picture shown for this product. There are no actual silver buckles, but instead just painted on buckles that look very cheap and tacky.

Raw and brutal. Heavy metal perfectly blended with bubble gum pop and good old fashioned rock'n'roll nostalgia. Here is perhaps the greatest punk band of all time at their prime. This after their first 3 or 4 albums before they'd gotten bored of these songs. If you get a chance to hear their later day live output, its too fast and sounds sloppy. Here they sound perfect.

And people get quite annoyed if you disagree with their point of view on this issue. Basically, this is a pointless arguement, because the only thing that matters is the music and how good it is. The Ramones, The Sex Pistols, The Clash and many others were absolutely excellent, so please Punkers, stop argueing POINTLESSLY and concentrate on the music! This album compliles some of the best and most recognised hits from the Ramones, including great tunes such as Blitzkreig Bob and Surfin' Bird.

The other reviews collectively capture everything I'd like to say. This IS the Ramones, straight up. This is the closest you will ever get to experiencing them live (since they're gone).

It was recorded on New Year's Eve 1977 with the group's original lineup. The band tears through 28 songs, from their first three albums. That's two thirds of the songs they had recorded at that point. While the songs aren't as polished as the studio versions, they are played with a lot of heart and energy before an enthusiastic audience. I wish I could have seen the Ramones back then, but I was only ten years old at the time. I did get to see them later, but that wasn't the original quartet.

To reiterate a previous review: lets hope that this is not the future of ethnography. The personal slant to the writing, along with seemingly pointless flowering and embellishing was quite embarassing to read. Hagedorn comes off as being very self-centered. I read this is in a seminar, and unfortunately, all anyone wanted to speak on was the confusing writing style. The content of the book was lost in the presentation. I would not recommend this book to anyone wanting to learn about Santeria or Afro-Cuban culture. I would perhaps recommend it if you are studying folkorization, or performance and wanted a supplementary reference."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your time on this one","review":"I have never written a review on Amazon, but I feel obligated to after reading this book. Absolutely one of the worst books I have ever read. If you have any interest in Santeria, do not read this book. If, however, you are interested in Ms. Hagedorn's personal experiences in Cuba, then this might be the book for you. Any of the \\"insights\\" of this book are simple common sense but the bulk of the material is devoted to Ms. Hagedorn talking about herself. This book is not scholarship, it is not cohesive research, it is egocentric rambling. Furthermore, I didn't receive the CD that goes with the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"the new ethnography?","review":"I sincerely hope this is not the new wave in ethnography.

If you have not seen an episode of Angel, then you must buy these box sets.No other show so gracefully embraces themes of humor, drama, romance, morality, self-doubt and heroism than this show. And it carefully weaves them all together in a way never done by another show, not even its parent, Buffy The Vampire Slayer. Angel: The Series leaves you caring about the fate of its characters, central or otherwise, after the end of every episode.This series was genius and ended prematurely.Season Four marks the return of Angelus and some serious growing pains for Team Angel - there is heartache and loss, and a message to be sent to everyone in our modern day era concerning the price of bringing happiness to all.Do yourself a favor. Watch this show."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your money","review":"Don't bother spending $40 to buy this season on DVD. Get cable TV, wait for the Season 4 episodes to re-air. Then, tape the following episodes: \\"Deep Down\\" and \\"Awakening.\\" If you do that, you'll have the only episodes in the entire season worth watching more than once. Believe me, if you skip the majority of the season, you'll be better off emotionally and pyschologically.

Despite a few creative low points, the cast and crew rose to the challenge of Angel's new full fledged story-arch format, with all 22 episodes weaving together to create one feature-length episode.The season deals with issues such as fascism, religious persecution and world peace brilliantly, staying subtle, yet getting the message across perfectly. However, the season's real highlight is the shocking relationship between Wesley (Alexis Denisof) and Lilah (Stephanie Romanov), creating one of the series' most eerie, dysfunctional and altogether fascinating relationships."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Angel Yet","review":"Season 3 took the characters to a pretty dark place, and left them there. It also lacked crossover visits from Buffy characters we have come to know and love. Season 4 emerges brilliantly from that place! Each episode was at least very good and most were great. I particularly liked the crossover episodes featuring Willow and Faith!Season 4 had some wonderful suprising plot twists. I think that a theme was the reversal of character orientation (in terms of goodness and evil :). Angel turning bad. Wesley becomes good again. Gunn becomes a murderer. Fred briefly might be bad (in Shiny Happy People) And Cordy bad as the beastmaster! And the big-bad, Jasmine, good or bad?I really like the whole Jasmine twist! I thought it was much better than the Pylea thing at the end of season 2.Also the fight scenes in season 4 are excellent! In my opinion season 4 is the best so far, and I really look forwards to season 5 on DVD."},{"rating":"2","title":"The weakest season of Angel but still great","review":"Angel season 4 is easily the weakest season of Angel throughout it's 5 year run.The show dropped all pretense of having stand alone plots and became one long 22 episode arc, although to the hardcore fan this should be wonderful news, it doesn't exactly work.The problem is the plot isn't all that strong, it starts great, and than becomes more and more disorganised, Conner, Lorne and Cordelia are all given less than stellar material to work with, and the plot sags a bit near the end.That doesn't mean this season is in anyways bad, a bad angel season is still much stronger than the vast majority of television shows. It is still better than the weakest Buffy seasons (season 4 and 7 in my opinion) and it is still very entertaining even at it's weakest point.If you bought the first 3 seasons this is a must-have, and leads into the phenomenal but different final season."},{"rating":"2","title":"I want to say it's great...","review":"The first season of Angel was a lot of fun. I found it lighter than what was happening over on Buffy's show where everything was the \\"end of the world\\" and I liked the personalities, relationships and plot twists. As things have progressed, however, doom and gloom has permeated the Angel world and, by season four, I'm beginning to actually notice the absence of Joss Whedon's writing. The grand plan still seems to have the Whedon touch and some of the twists are vintage but most of the writing is not Joss' and it shows (where it doesn't show on Buffy). I loved Firefly, I was addicted to Buffy and I will watch all five seasons of Angel but I feel that, by this point, there's something missing."},{"rating":"2","title":"This season is great!!!!","review":"This box set gives any fan what they want.

She's always been irritating, now make her evil. Otherwise, David Boreanaz is great as Angel or Angelus and Alexis Denisof is so much better as a tough Wesley. Vincent Kartheiser would not have been my choice as Angel's son. He looks nothing like him - kind of weaselly.

All in all, I loved it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dont get the wrong impression","review":"ok, everybody else here is making season 4 sound terrible. its not. while it might not be the best season, it still very good, and the only reason that people dont like it as much is because they are comparing it to the rest which are even better. So, dont get the wrong impression, its still good."},{"rating":"1","title":"The worst of Angel","review":"I was so disappointed with the direction this season took from making Cordy evil to having her sleep with Connor (ewwww) to the whole evil Jasmine storyline..there are a few good episodes but this season almost made me stop watching this show...and the fact that this was to be Charisma Carpenters last season even though she and the fans wanted her to come back made it all the more harder to swallow...I am surprised to hear that Joss thought this was the best season as it truely is the worst"},{"rating":"2","title":"Angel","review":"I love Angel and give it a 5 cos' it is excellent but one major annoyance for me is that it kills me that we can't buy the DVD on the States but here in the UK they have all the seasons for sale so much earler on than in the States. Unfortunately even though i live here temporarily (military) i only own a US DVD player. Whats up with this!!! The shows made in the states but you have to go to the UK to pick a copy of it up."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst season so far","review":"As a huge fan of Angel and Buffy I have to say I was surprised to dislike Angel Season 4. The cliffhanger of Season 3 had me chomping at the bit to buy this box set and find out what happens to these great characters. Then by the last disc I didn't even really care what was going to happen. Jasmine absolutely sucks as a villain and Cordelia's character went very much downhill. This is the writer's fault by the way not Charisma's. In the beginning of the season I had high hopes as The Beast was pretty interesting, but then it all just got corny. The soap opera part of the series which is necessary to really flush out the characters was just too \\"soapy\\". The episodes with Faith almost brought me back, but overall the story was just too terrible. I'm hoping season five brings me back or I won't even care about the cancelation."},{"rating":"1","title":"Angel's 4th****Hey that should be 5 stars","review":"A mixed bag, this season was. I have to agree with most, that the fourth year was certainly one of the most chaotic and they missed many chances to make season four as good as 2 and 3. The biggest flaw was Vincent Kartheiser, who while a fine actor, made Connor so annoying and so bland one could careless if he survived or not. Then came that awkward sex scene in"},{"rating":"2","title":"angel season 4","review":"This is one of the best seasons of the show. It was clever and to the point. I loved \\"jasmine\\" as a woman of color, a very beautiful woman of color and the idea of Angel being a grandfather.If you love the Angel world and the people that live there you are sure to want to add this to your collection. I can't think of which ep. is my favorite, i would have to say the ones with Faith... yes the rouge slayer is back and better than ever. And there is a visit from Willow and those are always fun. Great season!!!!! Enjoy!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Just Awful","review":"This was the worst season of Angel and wrecked the series for me. Why did Cordelia have to go evil? They also made Fred go strange in Season five. I think this is misogyny on the part of the creators. There's lots of misogyny in the Sci-fi/fantasy universe and this is more of the same. Notice that the dumb blonde Harmony is the only female character to come out unscathed? This show doesn't work without Cordelia, and having her become posessed and sleep with Angel's son (gross) to cover for the actrice getting pregnant was just an awful idea."},{"rating":"1","title":"Absolutely the worst","review":"This season of Angel had few redeeming features whatsoever. It centered around the ghastly and ill-conceived Phaedra/Hippolytus relationship between Cordelia & Connor and their \\"daughter\\" Jasmine. Fred's unbelievable relationship with Gunn continued, as Wesley made \\"the beast with two backs\\" with Lilah, the last really good recurring character left on the show. Gwen Raiden was a good but underused addition, along with the sight of Gunn in a kilt, and the episode Spin the Bottle was fun. I also enjoyed seeing Darla again, albeit briefly. I am not a big Faith fan, so her return did nothing for me. I don't understand why Gunn killed Professor Siedel when all he had to do was to push him into the portal and let him suffer as Fred had suffered. All in all, it was a season that I won't bother watching, let alone buying the DVD's."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best season of Angel... breathtaking and original","review":"It's hard to imagine anything being better than \\"Angel\\"'s second season and parts of its third, but Season Four ultimately wins out with me. It's like a single intense season-long episode, with a sustained arc that is one of the finest achievements in the history of TV. It's an increasingly shocking, weird, wonderful, heartbreaking and elevated roller-coaster ride. Needless to say, Connor and his relationship with Angel are among the highest points in a series that had many high points, and by the time Jasmine and Faith and Wesley's relationship with Lilah were added to an already embarrassingly rich tapestry, as a viewer you almost felt you couldn't take any more, so glutted were you. It was \\"Angel\\" at its essence; it filled every potential developed over the years, exploited to the fullest every aspect of the show's unique character and brought the series to its pinnacle."},{"rating":"2","title":"Season Four shows actors real skills","review":"Angel Season Four was unlike any other show on T.V that year. With the return of major charecters Angelus and Faith, Joss Whedon and the cast proved once again that the show can hold it's own without Buffy to hold it up. This season started out with kindof a lag and the Cordy/Connor thing wasn't really that great epecially when you have the contervorsy of older women sleeping with younger men. But I loved the way they ended it, and it's so sad that Angel was cancelled after the fifth season, when Angel was really hitting it's stride. Angel season four is a great season and it's for major Buffy and Angel collecters!"},{"rating":"2","title":"angels best yet","review":"angels most tightly dramatic season by far and most disturbing and violint from the beast to evil cordy to jasmine to the end of wolfram and hart this is a must have season"},{"rating":"1","title":"Typical Joss - he ruins a once great show","review":"Although a once hard-core BtVS / AtS fan, I gave up on Buffy in Season 6 and Angel in Season 4. Typical Joss Whedon - he makes great characters and then can't resist ruining them by introducing more and more plot contrivances and less and less subtlety, in what I assume is an ongoing effort to one-up himself.This season of Angel, though well-written and well-acted, takes the downward turn in plot that started in Season 3 (Connor, the Cordy ascension, the icky and ham-fisted Cordy/Angel 'romance'), and plunges even further into utter crap. The entire Cordy storyline is out of left field and a real character assassination, and the 'Big Bad' of the season is ridiculous and more annoying even than Holtz.Honestly, I guess this season is worth a watch if you're a fan of the show, but it certainly isn't worth buying."},{"rating":"2","title":"Darker, and a little soapier","review":"In its fourth season, Angel gets a little more like a soap opera. The season only has one or two stand alone episodes. Most are about the central arc following the Connor story line. It has more of a horror movie feel with scary music leading up to things jumping out of corners. I think season four is my least favorite of Angel, but still worth it for a fan."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Character of Cordy was Ruined!","review":"Angel is an awesome show but season 4 is the worst season.I have no problem with the Jasmine story arc but the evil Cordy story arch was dragged out way longer than it needed to be and Charisma Carpenter who I normally like was just off this season. She seemed bored and like she would rather have been doing something else and like she had no energy. I don't know maybe it was because of her behind the camera battles with the WB executives or maybe it's the fault of the writers that Cordy was so boring this season!"},{"rating":"2","title":"22 part story arc","review":"Joss Whedon took Angel to the next level in Season 4. You are sucked into the story in the season opener, and it doesn't let you go until the end credits of the season finale. Nearly every episode ends with a cliffhanger keeping the tension levels very high. I watched the entire season in about 4 sittings.This season is much darker than the previous seasons. All the characters get to explore their darker sides. And bringing Angelus and Faith back make the season even better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Crap","review":"Crappy Crappy McCrap Crap, just about describes this season.Angel season 1 and 2 were great, nearly matching the standard set by Buffy, beginning of season 3 was ok, but then we met HIM, the child of satan, son of beelzebub(otherwise known as Connor.) Connor ruined Angel, his weedy looks, annoying lines, bad dialogue-everything about him was crap, and putting him in the centre of a storyline that made you hate him even more made this series terrible. The whole Connor/Cordy thing was the worst thing ever done by Whedon, and the end of the series really made you wonder whether Angel had had it or not. Luckily season 5 saw Spike enter the balance which kept viewers interested, but season 5 still seemed to lack the fun of 1 and 2. Season 4 ruined Angel.

Quotations are divided into 17 chapters that cover work issues in everything from Politics and Union Organizing to professional Sports. There's 19th century drawings, photographs and current cartoons that address the issues covered by the quotations. Visually, the book looks like a labor of love--each page is outlined with quotation graphics, and drawings and photos are handled well. To summarize, this book is a great source for quotations; they're easy to track down through 3 different indexes. But what is surprizing is all the history that's presented through the quotations, citations, author comments, and biographies of labor leaders. It's great fun and a very rewarding book.

As a result, even with this dvd, trying to explain such a complicated machine, you still need more smarts than more than one of us who viewed the dvd and manual many times.In all fairness, we use the digital mixer section of the 2480 as a rehearsal board now and that portion is fairly straight forward."},{"rating":"2","title":"awesome snack for young and old","review":"I first heard of jaffa cakes while reading the Gold Box forum.

First of all, the recipes in this book are complex -- but -- there are books that are much more challenging. Haute Mexican and Japanese cuisine are more difficult, the first because it grew out of a class culture where the food was cooked by maids the second because it is so unlike western food. There are things in this book that are exotic, even to Bostonians where \\"the Italian North End\\" was made such an imprint on the city. There is a pasta based on yeast raised dough that is wonderful on a winter's night when snow is falling. There are superb chicken dishes and magnificent desserts.

I followed up his career when I purchased his debut CD \\"Ghetto Hymns\\". \\"Ghetto Hymns\\" was good but not as good as this one. On this CD I feel as though he slowed it down a bit, not as much drama and it's not as \\"ghetto\\" as his debut. When I first heard the single \\"One Woman Man\\" from this CD, I just knew I was going to purchase this CD. What really influenced my decision further was when I saw him perform some of the songs on BET. His performance was bananas. I went straight to the store after that. The CD has nice variety of songs, basically he doesn't have too much of one sound. My favorite songs on this CD are as follows: \\"\\"We've Come Too Far\\", \\"One Woman Man\\" (my absoulute favorite), & \\"I'm Not Complete\\".

The story has great potential as a reminder to kids to be themselves. The laminated pages make this a sturdy book.

In my opion, the Omega was an easy decision considering the quality, look and Amazons cost (less than 2600).The watch is a perfect weight and size, not too big or too small. Super sharp, people always notice, it was everything the reviews said it was. The only thing I feel that's necessary to say is the picture on Amazon is a touch different, the colors are brighter on the site than in real life.

Is he a true card-carrying member of the neo soul camp, or is he just another poseur that got lucky? Personally, I think he's a legit artist whose love for the old school comes across as genuine. His debut album is a solid mix of comtemporary soul, with hardly any of the gloss you'd find in trendier records. It's smooth without being slick. The lyrics, which could use some tightening up, leave something to be desired, but the disc truly stands out in mood and atmosphere, creating mellowed-out soul that borrows liberally from Stevie Wonder. (Seems like everybody likes to pay tribute to Stevie in their music. Lord knows if neo-soul would have ever existed were it not for him.)

If you like raw, undisguised emotion and lyrics to match, this is the album for you. Now, don't get me wrong... Although there have been numerous comparisons to D'Angelo and Maxwell(?), Musiq is not a premiere vocalist. He's solid, though, and his lyrics and head-nodding tracks paint a musical picture that's hard to resist. Some of my favorites are \\"You and Me\\", \\"Love\\" and \\"You Be Alright\\".So, pick this one up, and if he swings through your town, check out the brother in concert.

What about the album title? Well I guess that was enough hints before I bought the CD. Musiq is not very good with words. Don't get me wrong, this brother has the voice, he definitely shines on \\"Love\\". But take his first single \\"Just Friends\\" for example, the lyrics are simply unbearably superficial. And that's what separates a true artist from the average singers. I mean, R. Kelly can talk about bump and grind as much as he wants, but he hasn't had a song like Marvin Gays's \\"Sexual Healing\\" or \\"Let's Get It On\\" yet. Musiq is no way near Jill Scott lyrically. In fact, he has a lot to learn from her. However, the production is pretty solid and consistent throughout the album. By the way, the CD booklet design is ruined by the last page where it says \\"PHILADELPHIA P.A.\\" and has 4 pictures of Musiq.

I wasent sure about the cd but after one listen I wanted to get it. The interludes are tight but the songs that really stand out to me are: Seventeen, Just friends, Soulchild, girl next door, popartzi, and settle for my love. He really put soul and hip-hop into this cd to make it different from the rest. people who hear his voice will think d'angelo or Bilal automatically but his style is different and all his own. This is a good debut cd form bilal and might take a while to catch on but take my word for it when I say you should get it, especially if your into soul music. he is something like the male jill Scott and the funny thing is they are both from philly.

I love the entire record, but my two favorite songs are \\"SPEECHLESS\\" & \\"SETTLE FOR MY LOVE\\". \\"SETTLE FOR MY LOVE\\" was written & recorded in 1979 by one of my favorite singers/musicians, PATRICE RUSHEN & Soulchild & A TOUCH OF JAZZ did a hell of a job on that track!

I read it once and couldn't put it down. Then i kept thinking about it enough that I went out and bought my own copy. I would seriously recommend this book for anyone with a taste for mystery, magic, and fantasy, as well as those who are not quite as into fantasy, as there are only some elements of the book that are really fantastical. All in all, a great book, and one that I will enjoy reading over and over again."},{"rating":"1","title":"crass","review":"One would have thought that three excellent writers combined are able to come up with something that is at least average!

Yet I simply couldn't get into this book. The writing styles were just too different, and the story moved too slowly...this is a danger of multiple perspectives: the authors must backtrack to catch \\"their\\" character up to the others, and the reader is left slogging through a 400-page mess. I think that if this book had been a little better organized (and the characters a bit more believable) I would have enjoyed it more.

Six chapters in, still nothing. The characters go on and on and on about what they're going to do and what they're feeling and what they're wearing. If their feelings were more than one-dimensional, that at least would be interesting. Of all three of these women writers, not one can write a story about war. Or running a country. The way they set things up is beyond unrealistic. The reader will only suspend disbelief if they know as little about gov't as these authors do. Why does everyone do EVERYTHING in secret? They are RULERS. They have RESPONSIBILITIES. They act like immature children who can run around doing anything they want, just because they're women born of a special \\"breed\\". We need good, strong stories about complex female characters, including women rulers. This story is nothing but typical fantasy fare."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great way to introduce Television and Broadcasting","review":"I teach an Introduction to Video Broadcasting class, and I have had trouble figuring out how to introduce the history of Broadcasting without completely boring my high school students.

(That's not meant to be a criticism, just pointing out that it's different.)Only one real dog on this disc which someone else already mentioned. The rest of the tracks showcase these superior musicians' eclectic influences which virtually guarantees that they (still)won't get much radio airplay and the resulting recognition they deserve.It's a very good disc and worth owning whether or not you're a die hard Little Feat fan.

The construction is adequate. There is paint slopped inside here and there, but I'd still rather have that than a plastic toy with no paint at all.

Not recommended for a comfortable bath towel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Uncomfortable, poor absorption","review":"This thing feels terrible against skin. My girlfriend won't use it, and I'll only use it if it's the only option. Also, I was expecting it to be super absorbent and easily wrung-out. I was wrong on both counts. It's less absorbent than the cheap cotton towels I usually take. Also, it doesn't wring-out very easily or completely. It was still extremely wet and heavy even after I exerted a high degree of torque attempting to twist the water out of the towel. The only positive point I could find was that it did dry more quickly than the cotton towels, but since I rarely need to dry a towel quickly, that's not a big gain when rubbing a plastic/rubber sheet against my skin. I am not pleased with this product and cannot recommend it. Cotton towels feel better against your skin and if they get lost or destroyed, it's no big loss since they don't cost much. This microfiber towel skips across the skin like a sheet of rubber, isn't very absorbent, and has a much higher cost."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not sent the size advertised","review":"I ordered two of these towels, both through Amazon, but from different companies.

I found this book to be a disjointed attempt to create a patchwork of content collected from multiple sources into a single logical discourse on the importance of the Eucharist in our lives. I think his approach falls short of the goal. I'd say well over a third of this book is not even Dr. Petrisko's own original content, but collections of other writers and visionaries. While it is all very interesting and thought-provoking, I think Dr. Petrisko lays out just enough information on a particular topic to get the reader interested and then leaves him hanging."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good single","review":"I like this single.

After many fruitless explanations to my daughters that the sink was for imaginary water only, they still found water (from the dogs water bowl) and now the sounds no longer work.

While I always enjoy Hamilton's walks on the wild side, this book had more plot than the last two novels in this series. Mistral's Kiss started off being quite similar to the last two but about two-thirds of the way through I realized this book was going somewhere other than the nonstop sex. It's about time Merry realizes who she loves - geez! I also liked having Sholto reintroduced. I'm not too wild about Mistral though - I'm just not into *that* much pain. As a journalist I spotted several typos and hope they were caught before the book was released. Is it just me, or are her books getting shorter? Micah (Anita Blake) was, of course, a novella, but this struck me as shorter too.

Hamiliton is an improvement but more so since it has some actual character developement in it besides the as usual nice sex scenes. However this should indeed have been the back half of Book 4, not book 5. While it good, I do not think it warranted a book of its own, especially as it takes up almost literally in the next paragraph from the last one.I've always enjoyed LKH's worlds, but I find I'm getting increasingly out of patience with the continuing sex scenes and the plots wandering if at all existent. The Merry Gentry series seems to be a bit better than her Anita series, simply because there is a timeline and eventual goal to the whole series as opposed to the Anita books, which have become simply the continuing adventures and soap opera of a very interesting world.LKH is excellent at creating worlds and characters, but she really needs to get back to a goal and end focus for each book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another Disappointment","review":"I debated whether to give this book 1 or 2 stars.

I hated what she did to him which I'm not going to say because I don't want to give anything away. However, to me it seemed like LKH was taking the easy way out. She took away any \\"specialness\\" and made it \\"ordinary\\". The scenes between Merry and Sholto could have been Merry and AnyGuy.There were many other disappointments for me in this book.

YES, her books sell BECAUSE her fan base knows what she is capable of delivering...but those same fans will abandon ship if this farce continues. I'd like to finish the series, but another book like Mistral's Kiss will end it for me. Anita Blake is on the same path to ruin, AUTHOR NOTE: Please get off the greedy train and write another book with plot, character development, and ANYTHING original outside of more weird group sex scenes...Bring back Frost and Doyle."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing...","review":"I have been a great fan of Hamilton's work but it almost seems as though Hamilton is just trying to make money with 'Mistral's Kiss' by drawing it out over a couple of hours where nothing much happens except sex and explaining information we already know. Please Hamilton, try not to spoil this series. Give your reader something with meat in which she can sink her teeth into and find some satisfaction because right now the impression you're giving is not one of an author concerned with crafting a great story and character but one who cares only about generating quick, short books with an eye just for profit."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointment","review":"The book is short, and has essentially no plot development; the entire story fits into about 12 hours, enough for a little running around, a little more interior decoration through sex, and plenty of kinky sex--some rough, some tentacular. And disappoingly, the tentacles are only present in spirit.At the end, everybody is home in LA again, giving some hope that the next story may have a little less Redecoration of Faerie and a little more plot."},{"rating":"1","title":"Still hungry...","review":"I am a terrific fan of the world that LKH created in the Merrie Gentry series, and looked forward to following Merrie's sexual encounter with the goblin brothers, the pregnancy contest with Cel, the visit to the Shining Court, the visit to the Goblin Court, the resolution of who will rule the Unseelie Sidhe, the romance of Doyle, Frost and even Galen...all of the intriguing plotlines that LKH weaves so well. But those were hardly mentioned. While Mistral's Kiss moves the ball forward with the reawakening of the sithen (but now that it's awake, what now?), the seductive Mistral (although his fate is left hanging), and the rise of King Sholto (but what does that mean to the Unseelie Court?), it ends in a rushed conclusion that leaves alot of dangling, unfinished threads.I am still an LKH fan. I hope she won't leave us hanging! I will watch for her next, hopefully much longer, much more satisfying, novel."},{"rating":"2","title":"Short and Short on Plot","review":"Wait for the paperback on this one.This would have been far better on the end of the previous book, than as a stand alone. In this series I don't mind the overabundant sexual scenes, as much, but I'm troubled that the author's books are covering shorter and shorter time periods, in this book, only a few hours pass. I understand leaving the book where it stopped, but it would have been better on the end of the last book, and some of the sex scenes shortened (and redundant bedroom talk removed).Overall, I wish Hamilton would ditch the chapters and chapters of smut from Anita, and leave it in Merry's world, and put more plot in both.And ditch the cover art, too."},{"rating":"1","title":"So disappointing","review":"I wanted to love this book as I loved the first two Merry books. I waited and pre-ordered and read Laurell's blog every day for tidbits until finally the book arrived on my doorstep. What a let-down! The series plot hardly advances at all, it felt like a rehash of the previous book, and things seem slap-dash and unfinished at the end. If this had been the quality of the first Merry book, it never would have been enough to get me hooked. And I really, really, really had been looking forward to this installment in the series."},{"rating":"1","title":"total joke","review":"I felt like it was scraps from the editing floor. The book couldn't stand alone if it tried ( though, it is part of a series ). There was no mention of the previous book, no questions answered that were posed in the previous books, heck no questions posed in this one! Out of the 4 scenes in this \\"book\\" 3 were sex scenes. It was a waste of a book, and I will be taking it to a used b-store. I'm really mad about this because Merry had SO MUCH POTENTIAL it's disheartening. I should have known this series was heading this way when in the first book of the series, LKH spent like 4 chpts as MG as a detective and the rest in Faerie. Does MG, (or even LKH for that matter ) remember what she does/did for a living? And when is the freakin' ball gonna happen? I'm 23 years old now, will I be 60 when MG finally gets there? Well, there's my TWO CENTS."},{"rating":"1","title":"Could I have gotten a kiss first.?","review":"You know the saying, \\"A fool and his money are easily parted.\\"Well, let me introduce myself, \\"Hello, my name is Fool.\\" I cannot believe I fell for the okey doke.I mean really Curious George has more movement then this book.Seasame Street has more movement then this book.Teletubbies has more movement than this book.Before I get yelled at, I'm not talking about horizontal acrobatics, I can purchase a copy of Hustler and get better written sex scenes.I've spent nearly thirty bucks, reading about Merry flouncing around the sithen, bringing things back to life, like Jenna Jameson ala Cordelia from Angel, with a bag of Miracle Grow and a bunch of long, haired Anime boys posturing and jockeying for a position in her bed.How many more books before we get to visit Unkie Taranis, was that not the entire premise of the visit to Illinois or am I the only one who remembers that."},{"rating":"1","title":"I've written longer term papers","review":"Like so many others I love these books, I also like the Anita Blake stories. However, if one were to pay attention to the page size, extra large font size, spacing between characters and spacing between lines you'd notice that this isn't really even a 212 page book. It's far shorter. It is more like a few chapters, and not a novel. Certainly not worth the hard-cover price. I played these same games in college, I know them when I see them.This is the last time I will purchase one of these books sight unseen. Next time I'll view it in the store and see if she's playing the same games. If she is, I'll wait and get it from the library, or borrow it from a friend, or get it in paperback. I work too hard for my money to be taken advantage of like this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Refund","review":"I must say I got my copy of this book and was horrified. I have waited a year for a book that is normally about 320 or more pages long to get a novella instead!Without talking about the story I have to say this was just a joke. An author I love who at times has disgusted me with losing focus of her own series by not continuing with her own mythology gets a major release (advertising, gets full Hardcover status) for a book that is even smaller than any of her books when she was still being published in paperback. This is a joke! This book should have been released in the $6 paperbacks not as a full scale hardcover edition.I have read children's books better written and with more content than the latest Merry installment.This book should have been pushed back until a full edition was complete."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mystic world","review":"I find Laurell Hamilton's books different than the \\"normal romantic\\" books. This book as part of a continuing series is sometimes smoldering in it's sexual content. None-the-less the series of Meredith Gentry are a glimpse into a celtic mystical immortal world amidst a human society. The heroine herself is mortal despite the immortal world she inhabits. This creates a rift in that celtic society because she is a princess in that world. Minstral is one of her lovers' \\"given\\" to her by the queen in quest to become pregnant, then married. The ultimate quest is to become queen."},{"rating":"1","title":"Let's Just Say...","review":"If you're looking for a plotline - go elsewhere...

When i first became aware of her books they had plot and sex. i like both. but if this is like Micah you will feel ripped off i did and the last Anita Blake was all sex. Her books getting shorter and shorter.I saw that her Anita Blake books are being down in graphic/comic book style. perhaps she should now stick to that format since her books are so short.regretfully.. where i once preordered i will now wait till they hit the library"},{"rating":"1","title":"Money hungry #$*&#$","review":"Ok, this book just confirms it for me, LKH is a money hungry #$#$%!. She's no longer concerned with finishing this damn storyline. As long as people are shelling out $$ she doesn't seem to care that her books are not even worth a #$%# anymore. AND another thing, stop with Merry being tight. I'm sorry, she stopped being tight after the first book. I mean come on, I know it's fiction but the woman just had back to back sex with 2 men about what an hour before Sholto and I'm suppose to believe that she's so tight.... Pulleezee.. I am soooo happy I only spent $3 for the hardcover (used book) or I would have been really pissed. I mean, this book is sooo tiny and to add insult to injury, half of the book is about 1 sex scene, ONE FREAKING SEX SCENE. COME ON."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cut Laurell some slack","review":"One thing I can say about all LKH books is that they are very hard to put down. Sure you may flip past the somewhat unnecessary sex scenes that do lack an emotional quality. (Almost like flipping through too much fluff in romance novels, stars, moons, sunshine's, etc...) But I can't find myself putting this book away. The imagery is still real incredible to me, the way she described the Gardens, awesome!! And while the book was too short there was some plot development, I don't want to give too much away but it seems the next one will redeem the series depression. Such a long wait for such a short book, I hope the next one doesn't take a year; Cel running free has got my interest. Truly it deserves about 3 stars but since the overall rating is taking a dive, I'll grad on a curve this time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mistral's Kiss","review":"well worth reading excellent book. can't put it down.

This is the first time that I've read/listened to any of her books. It took me a while to get into it everytime I started to listen, I'd pop the cd out and choose a different audio book. I like to listen to books as I work. I did this until I only had Mistral's Kiss left before I had to go back to the library for fresh material. The story is thinnnnnnnnn! And it's very annoying that the reader couldn't pronounce Mistral correctly! Other than that which is very annoying by the way..Mister al is how she pronunces it, the book has made me want to check others that she's written, perhaps they will be better. I always love to find an author with a large vein of material to mine."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wow.","review":"As most of my fellow reviewers said, this story is mostly erotica, and I think should have been combined with A Lick of Frost.some interesting things happen, but not really much but fluff, sex, and *SPOILER* Sholto, who finally returns. *ENDSPOILER* It's important to the series and plot, so if you want to know what the heck is happening in A Lick of Frost, you might want to read it.Other than that, I can't recomend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK!!","review":"I BOUGHT THE AUDIO VERSION OF THIS BOOK IN HOPES OF KEEPING MYSELF AWAKE DURING A LONG ROAD TRIP.

This book lacks scope! It is simply another 36 (maybe that long) hrs of time added to the last book. It should have been added to the pevious book or sent to the readers in a paperback. I enjoy LKH's work but this book was too short for the money. It seems like the series is stalling and a book of some substance is what we are looking for. I really hope the next book covers more than the entourage's trip in the cab........"},{"rating":"1","title":"What happened to LKH?","review":"I am/was a huge Laurel K. Hamilton fan, but for the past few Anita books, and this book for the Merry Gentry series I have to ask what has Mrs. Hamilton been writing? Nothing but sex and fluff. Her books used to be more than just this. She used to write strong 3 dimensional characters, but sadly are now reduced to sex puppets. The sex in her stories alone used to be intriguing and flowed with the plot...now they are the plot. Her books have been falling short these past few times I am sad to say. If I wanted to read sex stories I'd head to the erotica section, but I am looking for a story. Besides this book is way to short to even be called a novel and to even demand the price on the dust jacket is absurd."},{"rating":"1","title":"Is this an actual book or just a chapter? Where's the beef?","review":"This was only part of a book, not a book unto itself. Where is the rest?I kept waiting for something to really happen in this novelette. Something big. Yes, this answered the question of what happened to Sholto. What's with the wild hunt chasing Merry? How did this advance the plot and why were the goblins just randomly wandering around in force? What we got was the wild hunt getting turned into dogs (intriguing but pointless), more sex (ditch Mistral, been there/done that), and finally at the very end, Cel got out of jail & Andais told Merry to go back to LA. We got a few tidbits thrown in that I really appreciated (how she's feeling about Doyle, etc), but I thought this was just not worth waiting for. Sad, but true."},{"rating":"1","title":"It left me wanting way more...","review":"I was soooo excited when I learned that there was finally going to be another Merry Gentry novel and I have to say I was rather disappointed.

It really left me wanting way more and I have to wonder why I spent the money on it because it almost wasn't worth it."},{"rating":"1","title":"This was a novella, not a novel.","review":"To short, to pricey, and to much sex. Unfortunately I had ordered the book from amazon, if I had seen it first there is no way that I would have bought it. This will be last of LKH's books I buy unseen, as another reviewer has already commented her next book will be read in the book store without buying it. Finally I am getting just a little tired of the ongoing adventures of slot-machine shiela, enough with the sex already, lets have some plot and story developement instead. I would not be nearly so p-----o---ed if this had been published like Micah as a paperback."},{"rating":"1","title":"What happened to writing some kind of plot?","review":"I love hot sex scenes as well as the next 58 year old grandmother, however I would like a plot thrown in too. I have read all of Laurell's books and have been a fan for years but her last 4 books have cheated her fans. I could read an adult magazine, i.e. Playgirl, Penthouse, and write 200 pages of steamy xxx sex. And if that is all I wanted to read I would buy those magazines or the paperbacks by Anonymous. Sorry but I am going on to other aurhors like Kim Harrison and I won't be back. Four strikes, and babe that's all my money you are going to get. PS I would write a review of the book if there had been something like a plot to review."},{"rating":"1","title":"Please just don't read it","review":"I read this book at the bookstore, in about an hour, yeah there was some plot development and I truly do appreciate it. It was not LKH quality and did not measure up to the previous books. This has been a trend in her books with less plots and more empty sex scenes (suprising for a women who used to hate writing these scenes). Her previous books were extraordinary and the only way we will see the type of quality we used to expect is to stop buying these empty books. These books suck and it is only her devoted fans who keep on buying it, but I say if your a real fan you won't buy because these aren't LKH's books and don't buy until she gets the message."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I'm more a fan of Laurell's characters than her writing. However, in this book the characters are f-l-a-t. It takes place over less than 24 hours. There is zero plot - just one sex scene after another. I give the book the two stars because Laurell does come up with multiple ways to write a sex scene - something that is not easy to do. Aside from a dream sequence, I don't believe Meredith wears a stitch of clothes throughout.I am quickly losing interest in Meredith Gentry. I'll give the series one more book."},{"rating":"1","title":"$10 top bid on Ebay","review":"Just wait till the paperback comes out or it tops out on Ebay at $10 since it's a 3 act play and there are porn magazines with more plot than the latest writing of LKH.Gosh--I wish she'd go back to writing stories instead of the collections of wet dreams that she's been churning out for the past few years. She's sitting on a gold mine of smart, funny female characters that have clearly lost their way and am sure that both Merry and Anita would love some sharp witty dialogue besides oh baby, oh baby.Catch it on sale.."},{"rating":"1","title":"A novel going nowhere","review":"I have to say that this is my least favourite of the Meredith Gentry books as it really didn't go anywhere or add anything to the story. I really wish that Laurell K Hamilton would put in a little less sex and a lot more storyline (or make the book longer and have both). This book completely fails to advance the storyline as I was expecting this book to contain at least the visit to the Seelie court. I was very disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Merry, Merry, where ha' ye gone?","review":"After reading the latest installment in the Merry Gentry series, it appears that Laurell K. Hamilton has decided to make it more like her current Anita Blake offerings. Meaning of course virtually no plot and almost continual *and rather boring* sex.Events mentioned in 'A Stroke of Midnight' promised that 'Mistral's Kiss' could be an action packed, exciting addition to the series. Alas, my hopes were not realized and except for character and location name changes 'Mistral's Kiss' could have been 'Danse Macabre' re-released.For the future I'm sticking with Carrie Vaughn, Patricia Briggs and Kim Harrison. I'm done with LKH."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wrong size","review":"The moment I opened my package with this book I thought that there must have been made a mistake. It look far to thin and I kind of hoped that the real book still should be coming. Just barely 200 pages and I had been waiting so long for it. The writing style is perfect and draws me in right from first page, but the events don't seem to be in proportion. I rather had the revelations and explinations longer and sexscenes shorter. Next time I will wait for the cheaper paperback cause to me it wasn't worth the money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Seriously?","review":"That's it? You've got to be kidding me... where are the rest of the chapters? I have never finished a book and said, \\"That's it?\\" out loud until now. The first book held so much promise and the second tried to deliver... but now I've given up all hope (and interest) that a plot may re-emerge. If you are expecting any questions to be answered in this book or any loose threads to be tied you will probably be as disappointed as I was. Such a shame.I'm just glad I bought it used."},{"rating":"1","title":"ARE YOU SERIOUS???","review":"...I waited how long for this book when it could have just been stapled to the end of the previous book. I have never written a review but after this I could remain silent!

I know LKH doesn't care anymore, she's just collecting a paycheck, I encourage all others like me who are waiting for her books to get better to just buy them either in paperback or used maybe then she and her publisher will get the hint.Her books should be moved to the erotica category and not be put in with the regular books."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bye Bye Merry Gentry! We Hardly Knew Ya","review":"What started out as a unique story line has turned into pulp. Ms. Hamilton has forgotten all about plot. She can stretch a single idea into an entire book but when all is said and done there's just not enough plot. Will I read any more of the Mery Gentry novels? Only if my library continues to carry them, because they're just not worth the price to buy them. It's a shame. The series started off with a bang but its now dying a slow death."},{"rating":"2","title":"Left me wanting more....and less.","review":"I have to agree with the first reviewer, we need more Doyle and Frost two men with whom there is a depth of character and possible intensity of relationship and yes even sex.While I am still an avid fan of LKH, this book was a little disappointing as it was too short, waaaaay too short. Three sex scenes, well I like sex, so that's okay. Merry really has to pull her head out of her behind, there are times that she thinks entirely too much like a human who is just a tourist and not someone who grew up in this world. Granted,due to the magic that she and her men are making, that world is changing, but there are times when her naiveté just gets on my #@$% nerves."},{"rating":"1","title":"MISTRAL'S KISS","review":"This book is so boring I nearly didn't finish it. Like the vampire hunter series which I dropped after about 5 books because there was no plot just sex (the sex doesn't bother me, but really wheres the story) I would be ashamed to call any of this series detective novels, the only thing being discovered is how raunchy the sex can get and with how many. I was inspired to purchase this installment after a passable predecessor. Originally the lack of plot in the third installment had convienced me I was done with this, But my daughter bought me the 4th book and I thought maybe the bad reviews had taken there tole and maybe LKH had decided to actually write a book. WRONG....."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good grief","review":"Don't even THINK about reading this \\"book\\" if you haven't read the earlier ones in the series. This one has no introduction of any kind, no plot that I could find, and lots of boring empty sex scenes... so tedious that Meredith is having conversations with those around her rather than engaging with her partner of the moment... until she all of a sudden (and at the last possible moment) gets moving. At least one reviewer is of the opinion that this novel feels like a small part of a larger one, and I agree. Disappointing at best, and I was really looking forward to having the story move along. Back to L.A. Oh, well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy this! Wait for the paperback","review":"Or better yet, get it from the library and save your money. I read it in one evening, that's right one. It consited of two very long sex scenes. Ok maybe there were three but it's hard to tell when one begins and the other one ends. Really, you can do without this one. You won't miss but a pinch of the on going plot. I was extremely dissapointed in this book. There was almost no substance. I know this stuff is light fluffy reading. To be honest I skip over most of the sex because it's starting to bore me to tears but I do like the Merry and the plot (when it exists) is quite different from other 'fairy' books I've read. But this? BIG waste of money. I only gave it two stars because I needed a book fix and it did the trick but it's like eating really cheap crappy chocolate when there's no Godiva....regret and a bad taste in your mouth"},{"rating":"1","title":"But a nail in it","review":"This the one that cause me to stop reading the series.

The first two books took me on a rollar coaster ride and I couldnt wait to get to the next book. Now i'm just wishing the end would HURRY up and get here. How about a book that goes somewhere? Better yet, how about a book at all. I think somewhere along the way LKH lost the plot and forgot why she was writing this story. I hope she finds it again. But from now on, I will wait till it goes to paperback and get it at the discount bin. I'm tired of spending 17-25 dollars of my hard earned money for this one - two scene crapola."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'm done with the Merry Gentry Series","review":"Ok, so I managed to get through 97 pages of this book and stopped reading because there still was no plot in sight. I went back a few days later and counted of the 97 pages I read, 51 were explicit sex scenes. I've decided to abandon this series due to lack of storyline.

I'm not looking for that in my trashy vampire/fairy/supernatural books.

Let's move on in the plot next time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Does not deliver","review":"I enjoy the Meredith Gentry series. I looked forward to this book hitting the market.I felt it was a short story that had to be stretched to make a very short novel. It was obvious that points/scenes were belabored to make this a very short book. This book was way too much of a dissappointment it failed on numerous levels; 1)plot was thin 2) story line was thin 3)way too much sex for so little action. This should have been a part of a larger book, it does not stand well on its own."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I was really looking forward to the continuation of this series and was disappointed to find that Mistral's Kiss did little more than fill out some of the events of the last book. The sex (although arguably sometimes too major a player) has always been imaginative and fun, but the more it drones on in the same theme, even the author seems to be finding it tedious. There is a hint of plot once the sex had been gotten out of the way, but it seemed little more than a rushed afterthought. Finally at a mere 200 pages of medium size type, it is here and gone in a few hours and you can't help but think the author has taken the money to go lay on a beach somewhere and read something far more satisfying. Faerie was a wonderful, rich world and this book does nothing to enhance it. Boo!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for everyone","review":"I like erotica as well as the next person, but this is truly bad. I was given this as a gift, and wished that the person who gave it to me had saved their money. I understand that there are books that come before this one; hopefully they are of better quality. This book has no character development, and exists only to provide sex scenes. I think that the writer probably knocked this one out in 10 minutes or less. Save your time and money and skip this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed by LKH again","review":"I found this a short story not a full novel and am very disappointed in the new direction LKH is taking with her writing style, not only with this story line but with her other one as well where I feel that the main character is stopping the plot every few pages for a therapy session, i.e. how do you feel about that? Her earlier books are on my bookshelf, but her newer stuff is going to the used book store for resale."},{"rating":"1","title":"A slower publishing pace please.","review":"This year saw the release of Micah, Danse Macabre, Strange Candy and Mistral's Kiss. Give the woman a break! Clearly the effort of writing two full books a year is too much. The plot suffers horribly. As Ms. Hamilton has a loyal fanbase that will read whatever she writes, perhaps it would help if she could be allowed off of that schedule. Maybe then feedback could be incorporated into the final drafts. Or, if something must be published, she could write a collection of short stories dealing with Anita and Merry. I hope Ms. Hamilton still enjoys writing. I'm begining to doubt it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money.","review":"I was so looking forward to the next installment of this series. I enjoy LKH's writing and truly enjoy the extensive love scenes she throws in. So, I knew what to expect before buying this one. BUT, it is only 200 pages long and I would say that 160 pages were one long involved sex scene. PLEASE! You would think Merry would be chafed raw by page 100. I could overlook that but the plot does not move an inch forward. I was really disappointed and I agree with many of the other reviewers, I won't be buying any more LKH books."},{"rating":"1","title":"Come On LKH","review":"I agree this book was much too short for a hardcover. Also as previously mentioned lately there has been ZERO CLOSURE. I mean there are so many things still hanging in the air ends that need to be tied up. In the Merry and Anita books. They are no longer standalones. This Merry book does seem like an intermezzo/future plot builder. I finished it feeling unsatisfied and as if like someone mentioned earlier we have been on the same night of Merry's life for the last three books. I would have preffered more plot and less sex. I would reccommend anyone just starting the series to start from the beggining or you will be lost. The next book had better be dynamic and up to usual LKH style or I will start to become disillusioned."},{"rating":"1","title":"LKH owes me a refund!","review":"I would have given this zero stars, but did not have that option so one will have to do. I will not spend another cent lining the pockets of an auther more interested in the bottom line than keeping her fan base. This book had no plot, the sex was a complete turn-off, and Merry has fallen into the mundane. And boys and girls you get all of this for the discount price of $23.95! Wow! Just think, I could have had a great pedicure and read something intelectually stimulating instead of wasting 2 hrs trying to find a plot. This was actually the end of book 4, but LKH and her publisher thought her fan base would be too stupid to notice. Hmmmm, Big mistake. Big!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Life returns","review":"Great book! Hamilton keeps readers enthralled, waiting to find out who will be the next Unseelie Hier. Finally the author picks back up with Lord Sholto that we hadn't seen much of since the first book in this series. I can't wait for the next book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Minstral's Kiss","review":"I love Merrie's adventures, though the plot is thinning out with this sieres. I enjoy them even more because I treat myself to the audio versions so I can listen to them in the car. I drive alot and find that they keep me company and before I know it I'm where I need to be."},{"rating":"2","title":"Maybe Hamilton's finally learning to edit","review":"Sure, it's only 212 pages (and 40+ of them purely sex), but just think -- it might have been 300 pages, 40 of them purely sex and another 40 (or more) of tedious, angsty conversation a la the last several Anita books.At least, the story is developing, and it's still all interesting enough that I want to know what will happen next. The Anita books have lost me completely, I'm afraid -- I no longer care at all what happens in that series -- but I'm still enjoying the Merry books enough to continue reading them and to continue recommending them to others."},{"rating":"2","title":"More of the same","review":"Well you cant say the continuity isnt there, what plot development there is in this short novella is worth the read, Merry opens up even more to stranger and stranger things, and the magic is returning to Fairy. Sort of short but worth it if you like the series."},{"rating":"1","title":"Personally, I'd like my money back...","review":"Yes, it's partly my fault. I did buy it despite the negative reviews, but I thought \\"How bad could it really be?\\" EXTREMELY BAD, as I found out. The book was a travesty - no lot to speak of. And no, rabif LKH lovers, it wasn't the sex that bothered me (though god knows someone should give this woman a few good erotica novels so she knows how sex scenes should be described, even a decent romance novel maybe), it was the complete and utter lack of a PLOT. I beg everyone, for the good of the genre, stop buying her books - perhaps then her publishers will stop having the gall to put out this shoddy work in hardcover and attempt to rip us off for $20."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mistral's kiss did not deliver","review":"I normally wait with bated breath for the next book in this series, but I was hugely let down. This book was really, really short, especially considering all the other books written by Hamilton (excluding Micah, which left me very disappointed both at its length [or lack thereof], and lack of substance). Not only was the book short, it also lacked substance and left me with a feeling of having been taken advantage of.I would hate to think that the author is now churning books out so fast in order to 1. meet a deadline, and 2. churn out profits. I will not be buying another hard-cover by Hamilton"},{"rating":"1","title":"Too brief in content & form","review":"I normally love all of LKH's work - both Merry and Anita. I don't have serious issues with the amount of sex in the series, either, but I did not like this book. It didn't feel like anything was answered here - what happened to the accusation that Rhys assaulted a Seelie woman at the end of the last book? Dropped. I was very confused about how some of the main characters acted, especially Sholto. I'll stop there because I don't want to give too much away for those who are still planning on reading the book. My bottom line is that it didn't seem like anything original happened in the book - and what did happen was brief and unexplained. It was a very erratic read. I won't be automatically buying the next book in hardcover - I'll read the first few chapters first."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tired of all the sex","review":"I wish LKH would get back on track. I understand that Merry has to get pregnant but all the sex is getting monotonous. I will have to state that there is at least some plot this time but again the sex is getting ridiculous. She isn't even getting all of her character descriptions correct, for example: Nicca started out having purple hair and lilac skin, now it is brown and brown, Sholto started out with white hair and now it is pale yellow, \\"like the sun shining on snow\\". I am no longer going to waste money on purchasing the books anymore, same for the Anita books, I am going to get them from the library, when and if her books come back up to the excellence they used to aspire to then I will purchase them again. I do hope that LKH gets things together."},{"rating":"1","title":"That's it?","review":"When I finished reading this book I was furious. I was actually yelling \\"That's it? Only a couple of hours have passed in this book!\\" I can't believe I paid full price for this in HARD COVER for crying out loud. I do not recommend spending your money on this book, you will find yourself cheated and dissatisfied."},{"rating":"1","title":"When did LKH stop being a great writer.","review":"I ran out Tues. as soon as I got off work to buy this book. I got it on sale for $14.41 and I should have waited for it to come out in paperback. I bought it hoping that it would be better than the last one. Yeah, OK we get it, Merry likes to have sex with anyone and anything! I want something with substance, plot, meaning, anything. I don't mind the sex but come on a person can only take so much. Porno's have less sex and more plot than this book. I started out reading Anita VH and I loved LKH's style, plot, descriptions, and her ability to bring you into the book. Both series no consist of nothing but sex. Why doen't she just combine the two and stop waisting time?? Maybe Merry and Anita can go at each other! Ok so I'm pissed that I wasted my time and my money on this book...It will be the last LKH book I ever purchase. LKH books just aren't worth it anymore."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dreadful.","review":"I wish I'd learned my lesson with the last Anita Blake book. Ms. Hamilton has lost the ability to write anything even resembling a coherent plot. Sure, there's some new characters and new \\"powers,\\" but the main point of this book is Meredith's sexcapades with the Faerie men.Sadly, the sex scenes aren't even particularly erotic. Just tedious.This is the last Hamilton book I plan on ever reading - I've given the author enough chances to demonstrate her earlier ability to write strong, convincing supernatural heroines, and she's let me down for several books in a row."},{"rating":"1","title":"refuse to buy this book","review":"I bought LKH's last book from the AB series and swore never to buy another of her books (at least nothing new, and also nothing hardbound) ever again. Even so, I'm still addicted to her two series, so I spent about 30 minutes perusing this book at the bookstore, debating whether or not to buy it and enjoy it over my winter break. Like everyone else who's reviewed this book has already said--it's super short and almost all sex. I don't know whether it's her fault or the fault of her publishers for rushing her, but these books are an insult to us, the readers. Do they assume that because we're predominantly females who like romance and fantasy, we're total idiots who are just going to keep on handing over our money as the books get worse and worse? Maybe I'll buy this when it's a paperback for sale for 90 cents. Shouldn't take long."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lost her place?","review":"In the last two books of this series the author seems to have lost the thread of her overall plot. Yes, there's lots of sex of the uninhibited kind, but having said that, nothing much seems to be happening with the basic underlying story line. I've encountered this before (see the Wheel of Time books)or, for another sexual-themed series, the Gor novels. it's too bad, the first couple of books had some real plot. The last two apparently occurred all in one night - and the night isn't over yet."},{"rating":"2","title":"Short","review":"Way to short. I did love the story however. Just disappointed with the length, I finished it in less than one evening."},{"rating":"2","title":"ok","review":"sort of dissapointing compared to the last couple books, it was short and less developed, more focused on description of certain aspects of the plot then other things"},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than it looks!","review":"After reading various reviews and making note of the number of pages, I thought I would be greatly disappointed with this novel, so I was pleasantly surprised when I truly enjoyed it and was glad I had gone ahead and purchased it. I agree it is too short and could have been part of the preceding or following volumes. I agree there's a lot of sex. But, the sex is literally magical and thus serves an important purpose in the logic of the series. The characters are true to themselves as they develop and the book does move the series plot along. When I finished the book and closed the covers, I was a satisfied reader. It just goes to show how talented Hamilton is--she can make too little seem just enough!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Pointless","review":"Tiresome, repetitive sexual descriptions, no character development, unexplained events, no plot, very little humor.Ten years ago, Hamilton was doing interesting work, exploring some moral issues, having some character development, and humor. Now both the Blake and Gentry series are predicable and sex obsessed."},{"rating":"1","title":"NEED MORE","review":"IF ANYONE FINDS THE REST OF THIS BOOK, PLEASE LET ME KNOW. 212 PAGES, HALF OF THEM SEX, LH IS GETTING LAZY. WHAT PLOT THERE WAS, NOT BAD. SEX, GETTING BORING. PACE, NONEXISTANT. I LOVE THE PREMISE OF THE SERIES. THE FIRST TWO BOOKS WERE GREAT. WHAT HAPPENED????? PLEASE LH WRITE ONE BOOK THAT ACUALLY SAYS SOMETHING. I KNOW I SHOULD STOP READING BUT I JUST CAN'T. I FEEL SO ASHAMED."},{"rating":"1","title":"check it out from the library","review":"I hardly ever purchase hard-cover books, but since this one came out right before Christmas I asked my husband to get it for me. I talked him into letting me open it early, and when he handed me the package I was sure he handed me the wrong one because it was so THIN. Ugh. I can't believe I fell for the holiday release date marketing ploy. I wish I'd read the reviews posted here before I asked for it because I agree with EVERY negative review. I won't repeat them because everyone else did a terrific job. I don't think the positive reviewers even read the book. (The queen is \\"Andes\\" and they live in the \\"Silth\\"?)I just can't figure out why I keep reading these. But I do. I am definately going to get the next one from the library though, and I recommend that if you haven't already been suckered into buying this one, get this one from the library as well."},{"rating":"1","title":"What??","review":"Although I have loved other books by this author, I had to stop reading this one. A 212 page book, I had to stop reading on page 136, but i should have stopped sooner. Very boring and the sex was really bad, very \\"unfulfilling\\". I did not get the plot or anything else from this book, skip it. I gave it 2 stars because I do like the author and hope she does better."},{"rating":"1","title":"A magical nightmare","review":"Many reviewers have written about the (endless) sex in LKH's books. In reading Mistral's Kiss, it seems to me that besides sex, Miss Hamilton is trying to imagine a world that is driven by magic. One where visions come true. While this is a great idea in principle, the lack of plot and disjointed writing makes it feel more like a 1960's acid trip of a book than something written today. Think Magical Mystery Tour (the movie) without a great soundtrack. Sadly good or bad acid trips are really not my thing.I would have written a review about the actual story, but there really isn't one."},{"rating":"1","title":"At last, some plot!!!!","review":"I wasn't too optimistic when I picked up this book. It seems like LKH has given up on plot and story and thinks her fans will fall overthemselves over her gleefully graphic, all encompassing, and mostly pointless sex scenes. There is a huge difference between a good book with sex scenes and a porno with some dialogue. LKH is not such a godlike figure that she can mask the difference by putting her name on a dustjacket.So anyway, low expectations. But this book <gasp> actually had plot. And fighting that was done outside the confines of the main character's brain! And even some story development! It was no where near the quality of her earlier Anita Blake books but it gives me hope that LKH has woken up, listened to the people who made her famous in the first place, and has attempted to go back to doing what she does best."},{"rating":"1","title":"not worth it","review":"This book was not worth waiting for.

It seems to just list features and functions without explaining (in a simplified format) how and why. The examples are also incomplete and a little criptic.

J.","review":"I bought this book on American Silver and Pewter marks especially because of the information on pewter and the extensive list of makers, being over 400. As far as a reference for silver goes it is woefully inadequate. I gather there were fewer makers of pewter than silver in America because of the demand, value and desirability. J. B. Kerfoot's classic book on the subject of American Pewter lists only about 120. None the less, the Thorn is a very good reference. If you want to get deeper into the subject of domestic pewter then buy Pewter in America by Ledlie I. Laughlin, which has over 500 marks listed in the back and important biographical information as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good performer","review":"I can see why this pan is so highly rated by others. What the pan lacks in aesthetics, it makes up for in performance. My pan did arrive with a chip in the non-stick coating around the rim, but it is well out of the cooking area so I didn't bother returning it. I purchased a Nordic Ware Pro pan at the same time, and that pan easily earns five stars. The Pro is a little more expensive, but well worth the additional cost."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nordic Ware 10\\" pan","review":"I have been looking for a 10\\" non-stick pan for a couple of years.

I found this book a good source to examine the existence of a historical figure Jesus. It is analytical in style, detailed and presents intelligent, cogent observations. I have recommended this book to friends who are looking into a historical Jesus as a well researched work on this issue. My only criticism is that Mr Doherty's style is so scholarly, it gets a bit dry at times.As a separate issue, there are, of course, polemic reviews of this work. A typical example, one reviewer discounts Doherty's entire work in one quote. He quotes the blatant christian forgery interpolated into the work of historian Flavius Josephus. (Doherty actually addresses this issue in his book.)

James was martyred in 44 AD and Mark's gospel is usually believed to be authored somewhere around 64-70 AD. The earliest date that historians will try to attribute to the gospel of Mark is 50 AD. So, an apostle of chirst is dead because of preaching the gospel before christ is ever invented.

Not really, of course, but...So many of his arguments were interpreted in such a one-sided fashion that it made me wince, thinking what a slam-dunk it must be for any Xian theologian to rebuff him.As an agnostic myself, I found, that this author sure hadn't done freethinkers any favors with this useless tractate."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hilarious....","review":"...Only, it wasn't meant to be. I'm puzzled why someone would spend so much time and energy to refute something as irrefutable as the historical Jesus--and then do such an incredibly bad job of it! Mark invented Christ? Why? If that's true, while he spread the tale, what were all the people he was writing about, who were well known and still alive, saying about it? \\"Um, Mark, who in the world is this Jesus guy that I supposedly purchased a tomb for?\\" \\"Yeah, say, Mark, I hate to be a jerk about this, but I never rowed my boat out further in the water because some guy named Jesus told me to.\\"Ridiculous. Absolutely ridiculous. Makes the raving asserstions of the nuts in the Jesus Seminar seem incredibly rational."},{"rating":"1","title":"Think about it","review":"It's kind of funny. All these books that prove that Jesus did \\"not exist.\\" I wonder if the authors considered the fact that hundreds of secular sources away from the Bible talked about Jesus. Not necessarily about the fact about who he claimed to be, but the fact that he was a real person, with a pretty powerful following. I am not a historian, but there is proof that Christ exists other than the Bible. If you are considering reading a book like this, first do some research and read some non-Christian historical sources that talk about the existence of Christ. Not for the fact that he is the savoir. That is for you to decide."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gorgeous doll","review":"This is a beautiful platinum blonde TNT repro from 1968 with an outfit that really resonates with the late 60s mod craze.

A mostly great supporting cast, other than the awful Miss Diana Dors, but including the lovely Dana Wynter who looks just like Betty Crocker, cannot save this underwritten turkey. I cannot imagine how anyone could find that interminable cabaret scene funny. It made me cringe to watch.No need to go on; this was silly, totally predictable, with all the content of a film made in a weekend by high school kids."},{"rating":"1","title":"Surprise!!","review":"These are just shelves, so I can't get too excited or upset. I received them a couple of days ago and installed them in my garage. Not to difficult . . . find a stud, drill a hole and attach bracket. No problem so far. I came home tonight and one side of one of the shelves had come unattached from the wall. I couldn't believe my eyes, that is, until I realized that the bolt head had snapped off (the bolts \\"bodies\\" were still securely in the stud). I guess I had over tightened (by hand) or perhaps the hardware was just too cheap? I have to move the entire shelf now which isn't the end of the world, but now I'm waiting on the other shelf to fail. btw - for those wondering, I only had about 30 lbs of stuff on the shelf when it fell (well within the documented limits).My recommendation . . . if you buy these shelves go invest in some $2-3 hardware from the local hardware store, or you might get a similar surprise."},{"rating":"2","title":"I Walk a Joyful Road","review":"Just a great old book.

After reading the first chapter, I realized this book is extremely trashy -- full of awful things I'd never want to be responsible for giving her to read. Parents who see these books in their daughters' rooms should toss them out. They have a seductive appeal in the way they're written, but are dangerous in the conduct they condone and encourage. I threw it in the garbage."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not happy","review":"I guess I'm number two to review this.Being an avid reader of this series, I waited and WAITED for this book to come out. I wanted to see if Blair got into Yale, the aftereffects that Nate's \\"infidelity\\" had on Jenny, and whether or not Serena could stay with Aaron for longer than two seconds.All but one of my questions were answered: Did Blair get in or not? Who knows?At this point, who cares? I was ready to put Blair through a wall. I find the character totally unbelievable, bitchy, and egocentric. While some may find her enjoyable, I wanted to vomit over her overflowing self-absorption.Also: If possible, all the characters are totally unlikable now. Even Dan, who was a bit neurotic, is now a rock-star poet wannabe who got rid of Vanessa because he became semi-famous. How annoying. At least Serena stayed the same.I'm not so sure if I want to read the 5th book (if there is one)Overall: Not impressed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not Always Picture Perfect","review":"Blair, Serena, Dan, Jenny, Nate, Vanessa and Aaron continue to walk the streets of New York City showered with wealth from parents that continue to have little to do with their lives.

I would have to say this is so far the best and just miiight top the first one, which I enjoyed so much. This is definetly Blair's book and some things we learn about her are interesting...but there is not so much of Serena. Mostly Blair, Dan & Vanessa, Jenny, and Nate. It showed the characters in reasonable situations, unlike some previous laugable ones. In addition, the author seems to have proofread this one a little more carefully than those in the past. Although this series isn't wildly intellingent (or close), it is highly entertaining and addictive...just like gossip. The characters now have a little more depth and are far more respectable, even when they are at their worst. It's worth the read."},{"rating":"2","title":"guilty pleasure","review":"It's like a guilty pleasure.

And they're mean, not to mention slutty. How can this book be a bestseller? It's trash. Don't people get bored with girls acting trashy and sleeping around?

In the fourth book, \\"Because I'm Worth It\\", you become even more confused and want to know who Gossip Girl is even more. I finished this book within a few hours and the question still burns inside of me, \\"Who IS Gossip Girl?\\" Will we ever find out? I've heard rumors that this is the last Gossip Girl, but I have a feeling there is going to be at least one more, with the ending that was given. Many different suspects are listed and asked as Gossip Girl, including Kati, Isabel, and even Chuck Bass. But who is the real Gossip Girl? Read the book, and maybe you might be able to figure it out on your own. Maybe not. This is a great book for the devoted readers of this series. Have fun.

I like reading about these girls, these girls whose lives are so drastically different from my own.

The manufacturer sent me a full set of replacement key caps as part of the warranty and advised that the only solution to the problem is to apply finger nail polish to each replacement key cap to slow down the wear.

This is a sturdy little dollhouse and so convenient to take and go someplace. I will say- the doll family that you suggest to go with this particular dollhouse is a bit too large for the furniture.(and the house) It doesn't matter terribly because kids are imaginative and don't need everything perfect...but I would have liked a family that was a bit smaller to go with this house. It would be very helpful if every company labeled the scale of the house and the size of the dolls so we'd have the best fit. I ordered the Ryan's room bunk beds, the cute little car and the nursery to add to the furniture already in the house...and the girls love these extras.(No matter if it all fits in- some of the dollies sleep in the yard!)

My mom liked that they actually had a stair case to go up and down stairs, that use to upset her as a child that there were two levels to a doll house but no stairs to go up and down (haha) My husband liked the good craftsmenship of the house very well built could withstand two roudy boys (very important in our house haha) I was happy with the size of the house, from what i could see on line i thought it was smaller but was pleasantly surprised how much bigger it was for the price.

Each track is fresh and unique, and sounds like a Native American experiment gone completely absurd. The first track sounds like something from Mike Patton's Fantomas bands, but don't let that throw you off, the second track puts you back onto the train of the album's original intention: To cover annonymous songs that aren't credited by any of the Native American's the album inspires on. It is a fresh approach, in similiar Fantomas fashion, but instead of covering horror flick themes, it covers something completely different. And each song has a hook that won't let you go. Tracks 4 and 5 really stand out as they are the darkest and grueling songs on the album. Very creepy stuff. If you enjoy fresh music that doesn't sound like your typical mainstream album, you'll see the light in this. Fantastic album."},{"rating":"1","title":"Glad they made it but I don't like it","review":"I understand why the guys in Tomahawk wanted to make this album.

Its just not accessable. You can't really ride around and listen to it in your car, and with the exception of one or two songs, you reall can't' sing along.I know there is always the exception.

Both times I found the book tedious and overblown.The concept of the book is a nice idea, but the actual segues and jumping-off points always seemed ham-fisted to me.The ideas are all there, but the execution is poor.

When I saw it at a bookstore I quickly snatched it up. Once I started reading, I became annoyed as seemingly every sixth word had me scrambling for the dictionary. Don't get me wrong I have a good vocabulary, but when was the last time you used the word \\"hemidemisemiquaver\\"? That's what I thought.Along with trying way too hard to sound smart, Okrent spends far too much time talking about the Brewers. Hey Dan, two teams played this game not one. By the end of the book I knew almost everything there was to know about the Brewers' players, but little about the Orioles' players. Had Okrent spent more time discussing the O's players too, I would have found this book more enjoyable. I wouldn't bother with this one unless you are a Brewers fan."},{"rating":"2","title":"Recommended for all baseball fans","review":"This is a fine book, recommended to all baseball fans. The book is structured around a single game in June 1982, with a description of the game and asides on players and events.

They also ask each director : \\"why do you film ?\\" and \\"do you think cinema is mortal ?\\". Like the answers, some of the films are interesting, some are trite, some are curious. There seems to be some common themes : some movies show other people filming some event, some movies show people playing or kissing, some others show groups of people getting interested about the camera. In all cases, simplicity reigns. It's especially interesting to see how using such an old camera makes everything look old, even modern trains or buildings.

Zero stars, for availability","review":"Holy Mackrel there, Zorro! This was released on 3 Nov 09, and within three months is out of print??? No wonder bootleg DVD's of shows like this are proliferating. I can understand outfits like Disney wanting to make limited releases of DVD's to either make them exclusive, or create an aura of urgency to make a quick return on investment through rush purchases, but isn't three months just a bit short? I can't wait until the Third Season is released...for two weeks only. Zero stars, 'cause I never got to see the darned thing.

It was wonderful to see how great the series was. Guy Wiliams is the definitive \\"Zorro\\". Handsome and charming and while this TV series is from the 50's (when action adventure meant something different than all the special effects we now have) each story is ~ 30 minutes long and has a resolution which is credible.The trick is to make sure you don't run through all 6 DVDs quickly; try to savor them like the original show --- one a time!A great find! Needless to say I know what to get my brother next year --- The complete second series !!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent for Zorro Fans and Clean Family Entertainment","review":"I was hesitant in ordering this set, \\"Walt Disney Treasures: Zorro The Complete First Season, \\" concerned that it would just be cheap reproductions of old, faded episodes. Definitely not so!! It is, of course, all black & white. However, it has been remastered excellently. The storylines are as wonderful as I remembered as is the whole production. There's plenty of action and intrigue! This is The Zorro of my youth, as I remembered it. It's serious; it's funny! The good guy (Zorro) is a stirring example of good triumphing over evil in the long run. In my opinion, Guy Williams is the definitive Zorro! How our youngsters need such an example of a good hero! I have watched all of this and I highly recommend this set! This set also comes with a collector's edition tin box to hold the DVD's (which are in a separate holder that holds them securely). This is a beautiful set which I will enjoy for years to come and hand down to my children someday."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very satisfied","review":"Very happy with this purchase.

Last minute at the store my husband wanted an XM, but was hesitant to spend the extra money for the Inno. That was about a month ago. Last night he went ahead and bought an Inno for himself.The NeXus, while cheaper, did not function as well. He had a hard time finding his recordings and they did not seem to play in order. Overall he felt that instead of an upgrade from an old Roady, this was a step back. It did not work well, he had lots of problems with playing music he loaded onto the unit.

Worked great, small drop out in volume after each 1-hour set but I can live with it.Did not try loading mp3's, I don't really have any mp3's as I like XM to much.Now the problems. 7 days into using it, the unit died. All static if any output. I bought a 2nd unit, tested and found that the Passport chip is okay, but the Nexus unit itself went bad.

As a 28 year resident of Levittown, I was truly excited about reading a book on the town that I grew up in in the 60's and 70's. Instead I am subjected to the author's personal recollections and family history. The book should be retitled \\"Levittown, the Way I Was.\\" In two words: Who Cares? It may have been salvaged with some quality photographs, but they were even more disappointing than the text. Apart from the photos of Mays, Times Square Store and St. Bernards, the reader is presented with either the author's family photo album or non-descript vacant lots and electric towers.

Journalist Mark Manning is a likable, thinking man's hero, and his lover, young architect Neil Waite makes an appealing foil. The more Michael Craft developes these characters and their relationship, the more I like his mysteries--although, I gotta say, the religious fanatic thing is getting real old (there ARE other motivations for evil). Mark and Neil talk more than most gay protagonists, and about an interesting variety of topics. Craft has toned down the artificiality which affected characters and dialouge in FLIGHT DREAMS, first book of the series. Craft has plotted a solid mystery this time with plenty of action, and I particularly liked the way he handled the threat which developed in Mark and Neil's relationship (although it was far too easily and unrealistically resolved). I look forward to the next installment."},{"rating":"1","title":"You blinked!","review":"I read gay mysteries because I like action and adventure with my romance--and because there is no such thing as a gay romance novel (unless we're talking pirates or slave princes--yeech)! So relationships mean a lot to me in a book like EYE CONTACT. I find the relationship between Mark Manning and Neil Waite tantalyzing but unsatisfying. They always talk AROUND the point of whatever it is they are jabbering on about. I did think Manning's \\"temptation\\" was realistic and well-handled, but as usual the reader is left out of the juicy reconciliation. Come on! And enough with Manning in jeopardy. We know he is not going to be killed off. Let's have more of Neil, and more of Neil at risk.

No display, doesn't turn on on either batteries or the ac adaptor. Worse news, since it didn't have the adaptor included, I bought the one avaiable from another vendor. Since it is another vendor, I have to pay shipping to return the now unnecessary adaptor. The return shipping costs more than the adaptor.

Also, it's tiny - the platform is 6\\" x 8\\".Although you can weigh objects up to 75lb, you'll need to balance the object (if it's large) on the tiny platform to get an accurate reading. You can put a square of plywood on the platform without messing up the reading (see below) if that helps with large floppy items.If you leave the included envelope holder (or anything else) on the platform, the unit will automatically zero out the weight of the holder every time you turn the unit on. There's also a zero button which does the same thing. Neat!The detachable front panel is a lifesaver if you have to weigh a large box (which would hide the readout).At this price, it's highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"decent scale, bad display + No AC adaptor","review":"ProsDetachable screen is very useful for weighing large objects.Weight range is good for small and relatively large items.Compact size is good for a scale that goes up to 75 pounds.ConsLCD display is very hard to read.

I have never placed anything heavier than 3 pounds on the scale, and I've probably only used it 20 times during the past year. It has already died! The display stays at zero no matter how much weight I place on the scale. It's just stuck at zero. I called UltraShip and they said to return it for repair or replacement; however, due to the weight of the machine, it would cost as much, if not more, to ship it back to them than to just buy a new one, which explains how they can offer a lifetime warranty on these machines. They know that no one would bother to return a broken scale when, for the same price or less, they could just buy a brand new one. When I made that comment to the person on the phone, he said absolutely nothing in response. Although the scale seems to work fine in the beginning, don't count on it lasting a long time. Probably due to flimsy construction."},{"rating":"1","title":"Warning - Optional AC Plug means it does not actually come with it!!","review":"I have yet to use this item because despite the photo, it did not come with the power plug. \\"optional\\" means that it is not included in the package. i thought it meant that you could use either corded power or batteries (which is true, you just need to have a spare AC adaptor that has the type of connector needed to use with this item). note the instructions that come with the item do not actually clarify what type of ac adaptor to purchase, just that you should use the correct AC adaptor."},{"rating":"1","title":"INCONVENIENT TIME WASTER - AC Adaptor and Batteries NOT Included","review":"Typically I do not buy products that do not come ready to use out of the box.

Glad to see you here at Amazon Old Will!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I expected...","review":"Scale didn't come with A/C adapter(though in the picture and don't say \\"not included\\", the term \\"optional\\" is very deceiving).

Sold by DAB Nutrition and fulfilled by Amazon."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works well and is easy to use...","review":"I bought this to weigh occasional packages I may need to ship from eBay etc. it's a great little scale and does everything I need including weighing envelops. The face even detaches so you can weigh large items and still see the readout.I gave it a four star because it obviously doesn't come with C batteries, but it does not even come with a power adapter, although it accepts a 9-12v at 100mA adapter.

I was promised a black scale but when it came it was silver. No biggie. We're talking about the scale right?It works great for my all around shipping needs. I mail everything... and I mean EVERY kind of weight and so I needed a scale that could do light stuff and heavy stuff.When I first got it I thought it was broken because the weight would keep bouncing up and down and wouldn't stay still. Later I realized that its because of how sensitive it is. When I put a package on it, it read true!From mailing things weighing only 4oz. to mailing things weighing 30lbs. it reads exactly as it needs to. Cool deal huh? I for sure say this scale is good. IT IS a little ghetto. I mean, we're not dealing with high quality craftsmanship, but it does exactly what I need it to do... and in a world full of every techno gadget out there, that's hard to come by."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works well so far.....","review":"The only disappointment is that the AC adapter was optional as well as the seller did not respond to email query."},{"rating":"2","title":"Versatile scale, amazing value","review":"I have a small business that ships everyday and was looking for an electronic scale for postage weights and weights on merchadise, and as usual Amazon had a great choice, a scale that lets you detach the display module to weigh large boxes or luggage yet still read the weight. Has any feature that you would want: tare, calibration and choice of grams or ounces, kilograms or pounds. Runs on AC adaptor (not included) or batteries with an auto shutoff. It's only limitation is that it cannot weigh to the closest gram which would be nice.But it is well built and is as good as scales that cost over a hundred dollars so it's a bargain for anyone needing to weigh things at home or business."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good scale, but VERY MISLEADING SELLER","review":"The scale is fine for what I need. The seller, who claims to be honest, is completely misleading in both the picture and the description about the AC adapter for this item.

Then I contacted the seller who told me the AC adapter doesn't come with this item and it is stated so in the description. I beg to differ! Change your description to tell the truth!!!They will NOT send you an adapter and the seller doesn't carry the adapter. So, you can either purchase one from another vendor or return your item. Those are the only choices.Update 2/26 - The seller claims that Amazon is responsible for all pictures and descriptions and there is nothing they can do about it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the typical Jonathan Kellerman book","review":"Jonathan Kellerman is one of my favorite authors, so when I started reading The Butcher's Theater I was pretty surprised. This book is not written in typical Jonathan Kellerman style--a quick and easy read that you have trouble putting down. The fact this book was set in Jerusalem was very distracting for me. The author had to spend a lot of copy explaining the cultural nuances, unfamiliar words and terms, the political environment and tensions, the ranks is the Israeli police force, etc. As a result, the storyline itself unfolded way too slowly. I put The Butcher's Theater down and read two other books before going back to it thinking maybe I just wasn't in the right frame of mind the first time. Still, on the second try, I could not get engaged. I don't think ever before in my life I've not finished a book that I started...but, I just can't bring myself to finish this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheap Edition - Impossible to read","review":"This book was so cheap the print went right into the binding. I ended up leaving the book in a coin laundry."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tedious","review":"I am a fan of Jonathan Kellerman - have read all of his books and enjoyed most of them. This was the last one I read. It was too long - so many diversions that did not advance the story. It seemed that JK was caught between writing a mystery/crime novel and writing a history of the conflict between the Palestinians and Israels. This books was about 300 pages too long and very boring in many places. This was JK fourth novel and I am glad that he got his sights back on target."},{"rating":"1","title":"Critique of the book as racist","review":"I read The Butcher's Theatre some years ago, and recently read the reviews featured here. I am surprised that no one commented on the books most striking feature - its racist portrayal of the Arabs, and a corresponding idealisation of Israeli society. The frequent excursions into political history were very baised, and did not advance the plot. Given the authors standpoint, one knew from early on that the killer could not be Jewish, and this detracted from the suspense. The author is a psychologist, yet he shows very little understanding of his own prejudices. The virulent passage in which he accuses Arab men in the Israeli prison camp \\"Al-Ansar\\" of homosexuality (of all things - the least of their probelms in that hell hole) was very revealing of Kellerman's own mind. He might like to read some European anti-Semitic fictions from the early 20th century, where Jews are routinely accussed of corruption, murder, lust and homosexuality."},{"rating":"1","title":"Anti-muslim seems to be OK","review":"Having enjoyed Kellerman's Delaware stories,I happened on this one and was stunned by his cultural/racial bias. It is astounding how often the Arabs, Turks, Bedouins, Muslims are described as \\"sweat stained,\\" \\"filthy,\\" \\"lazy\\" and \\"shiftless.\\" The idiot Arab boy and the dishonest shop keepers are typical. The Israelis are always industrious, clean, eager to do the job. The \\"good\\" Arab detective, Mahoud, isn't even Muslim--he's Christian! The description of the 1947 and 1967 wars are difficult to consume, knowing the complexity of the issues then. This was an old (1988) book, and one hopes that Kellerman will stick to his detective/psychologist stories."},{"rating":"1","title":"One more pulp read","review":"Jonathan Kellerman can do much better. Has he run out of ideas? I found his earlier books better written and better plots."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Butchers Theater","review":"This was the very first Jonathan Kellerman book I had ever read. This is by far the best one he ever wrote. I don't think that I have ever read a book so riveting and suspensful. It's like watching a top notch horror/mystery movie. This has got to be my most favorite book of any by anyone. I still recommend it to people after reading it quite a few years ago now. I give this book a 5++++ star rating."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great Read!","review":"Jonathan Kellerman takes a break from his Alex Deleware series in style. This book has everything, you learn the workings of a psychotic mind, the past of a brutal killer, some history of a foreign land, and the workings of the police in a serial killing case. This is nothing like the previous or current Kellerman books, but it is definately equal to them and a good read"},{"rating":"1","title":"Extremely racist book","review":"Having lived and worked in Jerusalem for four years, I was looking forward to reading this novel set in that intriguing and complex city. It was a huge disappointment--incredibly racist. I expect Kellerman thinks he gets away with it, because the two main characters, a Jewish American and an African American detective, are well-developed and sympathetically drawn. Unfortunately his Arab characters are very superficial, distorted and stereotypical: a knife loving Arab, exploitive of women, duplicitous, Nazi-allied, a horrifically sadistic serial killer. If similar characters had been written about any other ethnic group, a publisher wouldn't have touched it. Really disgustingly racist."},{"rating":"1","title":"Racial Stereotyping","review":"The blatent and overt racial overtones of this novel were so unsettling I prefered to relegate the book to the waste bin.

The dialog between the two main characters was at times so unbelievable that I found myself snickering!Too much of the book is dedicated to a falcon and it's training, then it drops off. One would think that the falcon must have some important part in the story for the author to go on and on about it but it didn't.James is being hunted by both the English and the Scots, kidnaps Isobel, and is trying to save his cousin Margaret. But, he finds the time to tame a wild falcon which includes sleepless nights and patience. Come on!This is the first review I have ever written. I'm not happy that it is a negative one but I read all the reviews before I purchase a book (which were positive) only to be disappointed after reading the book so I thought another opinion should be included."},{"rating":"1","title":"history minus the romance","review":"I've ordered many books from Amazon but have never taken the time to review one before now. I like Scottish history and the story concept sounded interesting, so I had high hopes for this book when I ordered it. It is obvious that Ms. King put a great deal of research into this book and the historical content is excellent. However, the 2nd word in the historical romance genre is \\"romance\\" which was, unfortunately, seriously lacking in this story. In many places throughout the book the dialogue seems to be specifically designed to impart some historical fact or another to the reader, rather than flowing as a natural conversation between characters. In short, this story reads more like an history lesson than it does a romance and I can now say I know more than I ever cared to about goshawks."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed again","review":"This is the second book I have read by this author and it was as disappointing as the first. This book lacks the action, the humor and the building of the romantic connection that I have found in books from Garwood and Quick.I found the historical content to be intriguing and the way she wove the William Wallace legend into the book. Beyond this it was hard to stick with the book.

The author have not done enough research on INTERNATIONALLY RECOGNIZED facts on the region, it's history and geopolitics, and therefore is misrepresenting the region and may actually be offencive for the people like me, who grew up in that region.The names of some culinary dishes are misperperented and misclassified, too.Instead of spending money on this book, I'd recommend searching the information available online, where you can find more truthfull and up-to-date informaiton, and a variety of recipes for free!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Boooooooooooooo-ring","review":"Sorry, what did you say?

I stil have some of those inter-negs and prints and I can tell you that a digital scan from the Nikon 5000 processed thru Photoshop and printed on a large format ink jet printer are better than any wet process I have seen. Even my B&W TriX negatives have improved with age (and digital scanning). I can place a quality 8x10 from 1972 side by side with an ink jet print from the same negative scanned with the 5000 and the new print reveals more detail and tonal range than I could ever achieve in the darkroom."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor scanner crippled by even worse software","review":"This scanner is extremely slow, taking up to several minutes per negative.The Nikon Scan software that accompanies it is ugly and tries too hard to be user friendly, often making uninvited guesses as to what it thinks you want (remember MS Office and 'Clippy'?).

Additionally, with strip film holder, Coolscan automaticaly takes the strip but can not recognize the exact frame on the strip.

The Super Coolscan worked flawlessly on single slides, but the SF-210 slide feeder simply could not scan more than 2 slides without jamming.The instruction manual does say that the feeder basically works only with Fuji compatible slide mounts, and warns of problems with Kodak and other mounts - but it's buried in the middle of the manual and you don't find out until you've purchased the producdt. I have been unable to find those restrictions mentioned anywhere inthe literature. At nearly $400 per feeder, I would expect it to work - or at least have the sales literature mention its limitations.I complained to Nikon, but never even received an email response.

The scanner is slow as can be and making pre-scan adjustments with the software tedious and time consuming. Much faster with Photoshop! Bulk scanning in not a viable option due to the time it takes per image. I had the APS attachment and it failed continuously to take the film in. I sent it back to Nikon for repairs with detailed description of what was wrong and it came back with the same problems unfixed. Tried it with different brand films and still wouldn't accept rolls. For such an expensive machine it is barely worth it. Certainly not if you don't have much time to fiddle. This is all sad as the quality of scan is clearly there, just the ergonomics of using this unit and the ridiculously produced software are a typical Japanese pain in the neck.

She leaves no doubt that it is a place that you will not want to stay in, but at the same time you realize it is a place that you are glad exist because it gives you hope and the assurance that you will one day be in Heaven.

Many of the photographs in the book come from the photographic archives of Agnes Cross-White's father-in-law, Randolph White-my father. Dad and I took numerous pictures during that time which depicted life in the fifties, sixties and seventies as he founded and published the Charlottesville-Albemarle Tribune, a Black weekly newspaper, which Ms. White now edits and publishes.

Influenced by the world events, yet still desiring a faith to guide us and make sense of our spiritual side. This book will help people to explore options and understand why they may have had some different feelings about their spirit along the way. The CD that comes with the book helps keep the explorations fresh."},{"rating":"2","title":"Informative but dated","review":"This book must be read with an eye to the fact it was published in 1998. However, the authors accuracy for analysis of data and then predicting trends in American religion is impressive. What they demonstrate is that religion among Americans is in a state of flux, adaptation, and progress. For one, I hope they take the time to update their edition because this decade is going to usher in more stress over cultural issues and polarization among citizens."},{"rating":"2","title":"A True Masterpiece!","review":"Stripped is a fine example of Depeche Mode at their very best.

I recommend this single for any true Depeche Mode fan, this is without a doubt, one of their greatest songs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unusual disappointment for Ener-G","review":"I've tried several brands of gluten-free pizza crusts, I bought the Ener-G as my latest product exploration. Being a huge fan of many of Ener-G products, I thought this one would be a slam dunk hit. How wrong I was. The Ener-G pizza crusts are too thin, dense, and heavy, with very little taste. You would think \\"thin\\" and \\"heavy\\" would be contradictory, but that's what I really mean to say. By contrast, the Kinnikinnick pizza crusts are light and fluffy, with such an outstanding declicious flavor. I would strongly suggest buying a single package of the Ener-G pizza crusts from your local health food store first. I made a mistake trusting Ener-G on this product before I bought a whole case of it. It was an expensive lesson. But, nonetheless, a huge thanks to Amazon for offering so many gluten-free products.

This book does a great job of giving you a glimpse of life (and it was a rough life) the early minors and settlers had. One of the best features of the book is the uncanny ability of the author, P. David Smith, to bring out very subtle features found in these historical photographs. This just adds to the anticipation as you turn each page.The price of the book is quite high. The price and size of the book place it into the revered \\"Coffee Table Book\\" category. The only fault I find with the book is the binding and quality of the paper is lacking for a book in this category.If you enjoy understanding the history behind the places you visit and if you are planning trip to Southwestern Colorado (Durango, Telluride, Ridgeway, Ouray, or Silverton) then this book is a must read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Useful for rounding out Rogues; nothing outstanding","review":"I'd buy this book again because you can never have too many feats or prestige classes, especially for the always hard to play rogue. But in a word, this supplement is uninspired. Just a collection of mostly mediocre stuff of no great pizzaz. A few of the prestige classes are interesting (although the bard is severely shorted here). A few of the feats and spells are of interest. Most of the rest of it is of limited interest unless you like elaborate traps in which case it might be a tad more interesting for you.Of the 4 class supplements I have (Tome & Blood, Sword & Fist, Defenders of the Faith), this one is the worst. Hopefully it was a passing moment of insipidness. Otherwise, the rest of class guidebooks do not look promising."},{"rating":"1","title":"A little to little","review":"I waited with anticipation for the release of this sourcebook, but was sorely dissapointed. The section on traps was interesting and is a section I will use, but thats about it. The Prestige Classes gave the impression of thrown together the night before, and the choices of discussions never went to the heart of the bard or the rogue. This product has put me on guard for further releases. Is third edtion heading the way of the 2nd edtion, lots of quanity, but zero quality? We will see."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not bad, better for bards.","review":"I guess that I was expecting a book that was as good as the \\"Complete Thief's Handbook\\" from a few years ago. I think that the book is geared a bit more towards bards with all of the spells. If you are planning on getting all of the guidebooks, this is as good as the rest.All in all not bad, but some of the prestige classes were a bit un-imaginative. i.e. Tomb ... er... I mean Temple Raider. Come on guys. But, if that is what people want, I guess that is fine."},{"rating":"2","title":"DnDFreak1's Review","review":"As the rouge is my favorite class, this book is a very good book to have when using rouges.

I rather like my bard, and I was really looking forward to the release of this book.The book was a major disappointment. It's largely written for rogues - not bards. There are a few nice new spells, but that's the only part I found useful. Of the ten prestige classes, nine are truly written for rogues. The tenth, Virtuoso, is for a bard, but it isn't terribly impressive. The instrument descriptions did very little for me.Hopefully some third party will come out with a better supplement for bards playing D&D; - and soon. They really couldn't do it any worse than WOTC did. This book (...) certainly wasn't worth the cover price."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unimpressed","review":"After enjoying SWord and Fist and Tome and Blood, I was realy looking forward to the opportunities that this book would offer for my fighter/rogue. While the book does go into great detail on the art of trap-making (practically pointless and prohibitively expensive for my rpga campaign) and what different types of instruments are available for bards, the book does little to extend thecombat abilities of the rogue.This book may make an interesting supplement to a home campaign where you want skilled professionals (temple raiders, royal explorers and spymasters) but doesn't seem to hold much value for someone playing under rpga rules where a swordfight is much more likely than a locked chest, pickpocket opportunity, or a magical spider amulet that is the only way to access theneat (but unplayable) Fang of Llolth prestige class."},{"rating":"1","title":"Song and Silence","review":"Well, I waited until I had all five class books before I wrote this review, so here goes.This is the worst of the five books. Most of the prestige classes are lacking in both flavor and playability. Of the nice ones, the two best only fit as player options in an evil campaign. Further, the only bard-specific prestige class can't adventure!Some of the feats are nice, but the whole thing has this second rate air about it.The rules for the garret are so convoluted that you are better off making your own. (A garret is a length of cord used to choke someone--an exotic weapon.)The segment on poisons is really good, but that's just one section of the whole book.All in all, unless you are intent on owning all of these books or really enjoy books about thieves, this one can be passed over."},{"rating":"1","title":"Song and Silence - disappointing","review":"Song and Silence offers prestige classes for Bards and Rogues as well as a few new feats and skills. However, if falls very short of satisfying my taste or that of people I know. The prestige classes offer little in the way of imagination...and only one applies to bards.A few of the feats are useful, but you're better off flipping through the book and just remembering the useful ones. Also, I really enjoy bards, but there is too much space devoted instruments. There is also too much space devoted to thieves guilds. This could be interesting, but it is basically a rehash of stuff I've read about since dragon #40.All in all it's a cute read, but I wouldn't waste the money...it simply doesn't offer that much which is new or interesting.

I was sort of using it as an excuse for not converting an existing 2e rogue into 3e. Having bought it and explored it carefully I'm afraid to say it's not exactly any good at all. Roughly 40% padding (with a rehash on 'how your character gets on with the rest of the party' for goodness sakes) this book falls down on both content and value. The prestige classes are useless, and the whole thing reads like it hasn't been proofread. This really has left a bad taste in my mouth. I'm returning it for a refund."},{"rating":"1","title":"Traps","review":"Compared to the other guidebooks, this one definately falls short. The prestige classes are nothing spectacular, and the only truly redeming quiality was the section on traps.

So we're left with that Karen chick from Will & Grace.

They feel it is an insult to the Appalachia of today and just continues to portray an ugly picture to anyone who has not been to the area. Some 'holler' dwellers may be very poor and less educated than some of us but they are still family folks and loving ones. Are they any different from the very clannish New Englanders? Are not there areas in each and every state that could show areas of poor, uneducated folks?

Its a plastic thud kind of sound when you press the breaks or move the pedals back to center.I strongly advice setting up curves or you will find them far too sensitive."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great pedals for flight sims!","review":"I just bought these to help me get a more realistic feel in MS Flight Simulator 2k4 and Pacific Fighters. Haven't tried in MFFS yet, but they work great in Pacific Fighters. It totally changes the way the game plays and adds a new dimension to the sim. As for the physical product itself, they feel pretty solid, the movement is smooth and the toe brakes work very well. They come with a set of chocks to lock the rudder movement so you can use the toe brake movement with driving games, but I haven't tried those and probably won't. Overall, I'm very happy with them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good but not amazing...","review":"Easy to set up and use. They do have a cheap-spring feel and i don't think they're worth the price (I paid around $100 USD) but combined with the CH Products yoke they complete the flying experience really well.Note: The pedals are rather light and don't grip onto carpets (work best on a hardwood floor)...Overall a good product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overhyped","review":"I do not understand how this product contiues to get such great reviews. I fly small general aviation aircraft and these rudder pedals do not even come close to the real thing. The pedals have no feel to them and they do not have any method of adjusting the resistance. I had to adjust them so that their response was not linear just so they would operate in a reasonable fashion. I do not know if its the pedals or the flight model for the Cessna 172 in both Fs9 and Fs 10, but I am unable to perform a adequate forward or side slip. I've tried adjusting them, and that does seem to help some, but my biggest complaint is that they have not resistance to them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent","review":"I bought these after getting the CH yoke.

The game looked better in person and what was great was my 3 year old and 7 year old both were playing and having fun. One horse, the yellow one never work. My husband tried to fix it without luck, the spring mechanism was broke from the start.

The players repeatedly shoot a marble into a hole as fast as they can, which moves the horse forward. The problem is that two out of four of the horses were broken when we opened the toy: The blue horse didn't move forward, and the yellow pull-back lever to shoot the marble for the yellow horse was broken.

I am also growing Armenian and lemon cucumbers, and, despite being grown in the exact same conditions (sterile seed starter, peat pots), the Straight Eights were inarguably the losers of the bunch. I tried growing them on three separate occasions (this generous pack comes with ~100 seeds), and each time the seedlings would succumb to damping off and die as miserable, limp little heaps. I really, really just don't get what I've been doing wrong. Even my Mexican Miniature Watermelon/Sour Gherkin plants did better than this, and they were left unwatered for about four days. I just have a feeling that the seed stock for this isn't as healthy as it could be.

Now I have to go out and purchase some of the original kind to actually get rid of the rash. If you use diaper rash daily to prevent a rash, then this will likely be fine.

There's no way to see what radio station you're tuned to! I expected the front panel LCD to show what station I'm tuned to, but it stays blank with the radio on. The sound quality is very weak and bad; there's a persistent hiss. Even with the volume turned all the way up, it's weak - you'd think you could get more out of the speakers. The antenna is pathetic - fully extended, it's only 9.5 inches. The lid for the CD player doesn't pop up high enough; it wouldn't take long before it gets broken.

Finally, I cannot skip through the tracks on most of my CDs as doing so causes the unit to reset. I have to listen to the entire CD to get to the track I want.

At one point HMS Royal Oak is confused with HMS Ark Royal, at another the crew of the Dutch O-19 is reported as being rescued by USS Shad (it was actually USS Cod). American submarine captain Frank Latta is repeatedly called \\"Latte,\\" the sort of error frequently prompted by too heavy reliance on a spell checker. And, of course, USS Nautilus, while being the first nuclear sub, was not a Polaris missile sub.

A Gary Cooper Clone is hired as a sheriff to keep the Sod Busters in line. But, of course Gary Cooper can't do that.

I reccomend it for some of the darker techno fans."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best DM Song","review":"This song is one of the best Depeche Mode songs I've ever heard.

You get to verse all 3 buus and majin vegeta. after you beat all three tournament modes, there is a cell game mode. you get to have up to 7 health bars in duel mode. Dragon World mode is twice as long as in Budokai 1. in training, there is a traning mode, where you get to train to play the game. there is babidi's space ship. you get dabura and the buus there. in the edit skills, there is percentage of your game progress. i have 93% done. i also have Z and Z2 mode.

One I couldn't do was power up cause I had to fight just to keep my energy up and the gameplay could have been a little faster. Also if you wan't a DragonBall Z adventure DragonBall Z Sagas is coming to all three systems check it out somewhere around March.

Just the right amount of excercise to make you feel good. It is a little early nineties, but you get used to it."},{"rating":"2","title":"I Love Denise","review":"I really like Denise Austin. She is full of energy. She can take you from Basics to Advanced. This particular tape will help you keep your stamina up and will help you during labor and after. It's not too strenuous and its not a breeze. I also used another one of her tapes to get back into shape after my baby. I worked out 30 minutes a day using her tapes alone. It worked. I lost all my weight. I recommend Denise Austin products."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a very good workout","review":"I worked out regularly before my pregnancy so I am in relatively good shape. I didn't think this video was very challenging at all. I get a better workout by going on a 30 mintue walk. I also didn't like the music. If you work out regularly I recommend purchasing another video."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Mix","review":"I work out a lot and demand a good workout. This is a little easy for me but I like it because I am obviously supposed to take it easier working out for two! (If it got me pooped then I'd give it a 5!) The moves are very simple yet are some good exercises (like side abs, for example). She also makes sure you're doing things correctly, explaining certain positions, etc. I like the touch of having a physician Q&A, too. This is an old video for her, but I really like it. I finish up my workout with the last few minutes of the Buns of Steel-8 video (which I wasn't as impressed with). I recommend this to anyone of any fitness level."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Waste Your Money","review":"This video was a total waste of money.

Although by itself it will not keep you in great shape, having an easy and quick workout around actually keeps me more active because I AM MORE LIKELY TO ACTUALLY USE IT even if I am feeling tired. You'll never worry that any of her exercises will harm you or your baby. It is a little goofy but I've managed to get over that becuase I feel good when it is over. Also, she does a nice job leading you through exercises and stretches that will keep you limber throughout your pregnancy. I recommend using this in conjunction with another form of exercise or adding weights to the the 2nd aerobic segment if you're intending to stay FIT during pregancy."},{"rating":"1","title":"This must have been before Denise found her style...","review":"I am a HUGE Denise Austin fan. However, I found this video a little boring and monotonous, and most of the moves weren't especially helpful. It was great \\"working out with Denise\\" during pregnancy, but when I was actually in labor, I was wishing that I would have used a pre-natal yoga tape instead! It would have been nice to have already been accustomed to the deep breathing that is required to get through a natural birth. As I said before, I love Denise, but I just can't recommend this video to expectant moms."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not challenging enough, even 9 months pregnant and awkward!","review":"Don't get me wrong, I like Denise Austin. At least, I want to like her. She is so positive and upbeat. However, I found this workout to be WAY too easy. The cardio portion barely got my heart rate elevated. I found the workout very dull and repetitive. I did the workout probably three times before I finally decided that a good brisk walk would get me into better shape. Sorry, Denise. We can still be friends."},{"rating":"1","title":"How much do you like chipper?","review":"If you're not in great shape, like cheerleader chipperness, and don't pay close attention to beat count, this isn't a bad video. I found it just barely hard enough to be worthwhile doing the exercises while carrying my 30 lb toddler throughout! Also the constant cheerful encouragement got on my nerves very quickly. Last but not least, Denise is not consistent in her steps and counting, not fatally so, but another irritant.

Matt the fire truck races around the house rescuing the cat, putting out a fire on the bookshelves, and more. There is a fold-out page that contains a larger illustration of Matt the fire truck, and lists from one to ten all the parts of the truck. The illustrations are simple but focus on the most important things here: the fire trucks, whcih will delight your little ones. This is a favorite in our house and will be sure to please any child under the age of four, or any child who is obsessed with fire trucks. Every time we get to the part where Matt wakes up to discover he is a fire truck, my son gets a huge grin on his face--I'm sure he wishes he could be like Matt too."},{"rating":"2","title":"4 year old loves this book","review":"I agree with a previous reviewer that there are not many words to this book, and it would have made an excellent board book for younger kids.

I read all NDE books written by LDS and non LDS author. I read Suzanne Freeman's first book: \\"Led by the Hand of Christ\\" and I loved it! It was an amazing book and well written, but I wished I could say the same for the second book, \\"Through the Window of Life\\". This book was so poorly written, confusing and it just did not flow. The vocabulary was very limited more for third graders. I do not doubt of her experience, but because it was poorly written, I cannot give more stars for this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disassociated and meandering","review":"Though I have a fairly open thought processing capability, I had a hard time following her story line and making it make sense.

They do not appear to be uncomfortable,as a few reviews mentioned. Worth the price. My parents even ordered two more!"},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT bar stool for GREAT price","review":"I ordered these stools to replace the metal big box store ones I had been using for several years. I just wish I would have known something of this quality was available for such a low price before I endured flimsy metal stools that dropped screws on a regular basis.

Therefore, the spokes are basically of no use to an adult. Otherwise, the product is very good."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's a Win","review":"I purchased these for our vacation home, which was already outfitted with Windsor style solid oak dining chairs. Those chairs are 20 years old and solid as a rock. I was hoping these bar stools would be a match. But I was afraid they might be rickety and cheap. It is just the opposite -- they are terrific, very solid and supportive. I am 235 pounds and never feel that they are tipsy or breakable. Putting the base on the seat can be a bit challenging for those with less than nimble fingers, but if you read the instructions and work slowly you will succeed. The swiveling action is just right. These stools look like they will be good for at least 20 years."},{"rating":"2","title":"Can't be beat for the price","review":"Got 2 of these for 40 bucks each.. this look good, are fairly easy to assemble (the swivel is hard to move by hand and your need to do this to assemble) Finish and fit is good if not great.I would recommend these when on sale."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice Bar Stool","review":"We bought these because they were similar in style to our dining room chairs.

Smells like strawberry, tastes like chalk. I can put 2 whole bananas in my shake, and it still tastes bad. I normally drink one upon waking, and within 1-2 hours, I am sick to my stomach. I found that eating with my shake was the only way to avoid this. On the other hand, this powder mixes well, and it does smell good. SMELL good. I find that 3 scoops in 10 oz of milk mixes well enough, if only it would taste like something. I will go back to Labrada, at least chocolate tastes like chocolate with them. Oh, and good luck finding the scooper. Mine is always in the bottom of the can."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ms Dynamite is DA BEST!!","review":"This CD is my absolute favorite! I bought it the day after it came out March 11 and i've been listening to it alot and i still havent got sick of it! Every single song is great! And Ms.dynamite is no artificial star either. She writes all her own songs and u can hera how the lyrics reflect first hand experiences. Every song is different. \\"It takes more\\" is like a rap song then u've got \\"a seed will grow\\" with a reggae beat and \\"brother\\" which is a beautiful ballad. There is a song for everyone! I also recently discovered that on the clean CD after the song \\"a little deeper\\" ends there is a 2minute pause and a new rap song starts! Its great! Ms . Dynamite herself is also a great person. She does charity and she's pretty and cool yet she not a tramp like some of those other music stars.She's blown up in Britain and she was on \\"teen peoples hottest stars under 25 and now she going to blow upin the US for sure!"},{"rating":"2","title":"must have","review":"Most cd singles are throw aways but this is a must have. \\"dirty black summer\\" & \\"bodies\\" are great songs but the standout is \\"when death had no name\\".

A must have for any cd collection."},{"rating":"1","title":"Looks good but is stiff","review":"This watch band looks great but had I known it was soooo stiff I probably would not have bought it. I am having a hard time getting it to buckle and the watch kinda sits up off the wrist. If you have a very large wrist it might work better for you. It is just really hard material. Was packed great and arrived quickly. I would order other types of bands from this seller."},{"rating":"1","title":"Self Medicate","review":"If you're here because you heard \\"Self Medicate\\" on the radio and you think that the rest of the CD might be as good as \\"Self Medicate\\"...meaning a driving beat with lyrics that are understandable and sing-along-to...move on...you've come to the wrong place. If you've come for what sounds like Satan at the mic behind fairly rocking music, you are indeed in the right place. Self Medicate does not represent what the rest of this disc is about...just give the samples above a listen; the samples will give you a taste of the screeching that is predominant on this CD and confirm the deception of Self Medicate in order to get airplay. No stars. Sorry, fans."},{"rating":"1","title":"eh....","review":"i heard the song FE and rushed to buy the cd. that is a GREAT song, but save your $$ please and just download that song. the rest of the CD sounds NOTHING like that. its not a bad cd, just not as heavy and *achm* fun as FE. given, the cover of the album is pretty good. its too slow paced for my taste."},{"rating":"1","title":"NU METAL HAS GOT TO GO!","review":"Enough of this pretend I'm hard and sing about my feelings crap. We have too many of these generic band for this to warrant any stars at all, but since I have to give it at least one here it is. People need to move on, the days of prozac are over. Let's get back to some real music now and make all these wanna be bands who got signed by a record company looking for that formula to go away. If we don't buy them, maybe they'll change the formula already!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good","review":"This is a very good CD, particularly nu-metal standards. The band is very tight overall, and all of the members of the band can handle their instruments very well. In my opinion Max Illidge goes unopposed as the best nu-metal vocalist out today. This CD has alot of variety. Rain and Breathless are slower, more emotional tracks, but songs like F.E. and A Season In Hell will tear your face off. Overall if youre tired of nu-metal cliches this is something I definetely recommend."},{"rating":"2","title":"Oddly Enough..","review":"I was not a fan of 40 Below Summer's first CD. Frankly, I thought it was mostly trite songwriting and pointless music. This time, however, I was blown away by the changes they've undergone. The songs are tight-sounding, and are very nicely done. The vocals sound a lot better, and the overall feel of everything is much better. If you're looking for something groovy, similar to Sevendust in sound, pick it up on the cheap."},{"rating":"2","title":"COULD THEY BE ANY BETTER","review":"I've been into 40 below summer for a long time now. I love there sideshowfreaks cd, and I also loved invitation to the dance. Then they brought out \\"The Mourning After,\\" It was different, but not in a bad way, in an excellent way. It really gave a chance to hear what max can really do with his voice. The song that I believe best demonstrates his incredible voice is \\"Rain\\"I think they might have made a perfect cd, because they still have a very heavy edge, with max doing more singing. If you don't have this cd your crazy pick it up and you will be blown away."},{"rating":"2","title":"Glimmer of Nu-Metal Hope","review":"40 Below Summer has been a band that I have liked for a while, but I did not think that they would successfully follow up \\"Invitation to the Dance\\". That was a great album, but oddly enough, so is this. The single \\"Self Medicate\\" is a great way to start off the album and then they even put in a couple of slower tempo songs that are very effective. I was thouroughly impressed with this one. They got dropped from their label after the first one, so the production value on this one isn't quite as good, but 40BS continues to be one of the most unique acts in metal and I hope we can expect this kind of quality from them in the future. If you were a nu-metal fan or still am, this will be right up your alley. I would definetly reccomend this to people that like ill nino. Cristian from ill nino actually lends his vocals to the album, it's hard to hear, but he's on there.Band to Watch."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful Album","review":"Well iam going to make this as clear as possible,this is quite possibly one of the best albums i have purchased this year.40 Below Summer has really come a long way from their first album.Being a guitar player myself I pay more attention to the music,and all i can say is the Guitar on this album is a lot more well written then Ivitation To The Dance.This album has a perfect combination of slow ballads,and hardcore epics.This album is a must have."},{"rating":"2","title":"good cd","review":"In my opinion, this cd is a good change for them. bands change all the time but some bands connot get past their sophomore album. The cd has more of an emotional feel from their debut album. there are 10 tracks on here, i listen to 9 of them. not bad for a record. anyway dont buy this cd thinking that it's just as heavy as Invitation to the dance was. I mean, it is heavy,the riffs at least, but he sings alot more. Along with all the Nu-metal bands that have changed up, these guys are the only band in that pack that i actually still like. Check this cd out for yourself."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lyrical; haunting; erotic--truly depeche mode!!","review":"This particular CD is one I play on repeat mode frequently......it's soothing, pensive, amiable; I always include these songs whenever I make a tape for a non-depeche friend...to show their range that is frequently just stereotyped as \\"depressed mode\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty Good.","review":"The heroine, Kat Colorado, is interesting, brave, ethical, and has funny friends.

Unfortunately, I have seen more than one other video of King Arthur legends. If you want a truly enjoyable recounting of King Arthur and the Knights of the Round Table, or an academically valid documentary that captivates adults; you're still looking. This one is a snore. The narrator tries to add their own flourish of style to how they think Merlin might have talked. I sure wish they hadn't done that. Walt Disney Studios might be looking for him though."},{"rating":"2","title":"classroom use","review":"This is not a bad medium to introduce Arthur to high school or college survey classes. It's not the greatest film-making; images are somewhat repetitive, presented as backdrop over the main narration, and the dialogue is mixed a bit low in the soundtrack, but it is still visually interesting while providing students a basic orientation to the rather difficult notion that the Arthurian legends actually developed over time to serve evolving societal needs; Druid mysticism, prophetic kingship, the legitimacy of divine rule, the French influence of chivalry, recovering the loss of the Holy Land, Romanticism,and more recently, utopian constructions, and neo-pagan interests.

But as we have seen with Harry Potter, movies can't include every detail. And to put these stories on to the screen and not include every detail would ruin it for everyone.

It's as though sentences were constructed in the longest possible fashion simply to fill pages in the narrative portion. Or, the author is extraordinarily pompous with the written word. Hoping to learn more about the movement to establish \\"Westsylvania\\", I ended up skimming it for some facts that I can follow up somewhere else, preferably presented in a more readable, to the point manner. This is only the second time in a long book buying history that I've encountered writing so poor that I felt obligated to speak up. The lists of the pioneers in the later half of the book may be useful, but they can be found elsewhere for far less."},{"rating":"1","title":"No source for information","review":"I bought this book for about $20, hoping to obtain useful information about \\"Westsylvania\\". What I got was moreso a history of the authors' ancestors. The original \\"Memorial\\" of the inhabitants requesting the formation of a new state is transcribed, but the source of that document is not stated anywhere in the volume. The fact of the matter is that the Memorial existed only in the papers of Judge Jasper Yeates, who, in 1776, was sent to Fort Pitt by the Continental Congress as the Commissioner on Indian Affairs. The authors include a list of all the inhabitants of the region of western Pennsylvania in 1776 under the assumption that they were all signers of the Memorial. A good portion of the book documents the authors' ancestors from this region during the Civil War - as if that has anything at all to do with the idea of \\"Westsylvania\\". The book is essentially a glorfication of the authors' ancestry with a little bit of 'history' added."},{"rating":"2","title":"Boxes and Lockets: Beautiful!","review":"Of all the Tim McCreight books I own so far, I'd have to say this one is my absolute favorite.I had been looking at this book for a while but the price scared me a bit.

Sure, I recognize the atrocities HIV/AIDS have embodied for so many people, but it's not something I really want to be reading about when I have my hands down my pants.Other than that, this collection is fun - I recommend it for anyone who likes bending gender/sexuality in their fantasies and/or realities."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sorry - needs reworking","review":"It seems that lesbians writing as gay men do a better job of it than gay men as lesbians.Likely that lack of experience with female sexuality among the men limits their knowledge, so that they imagine that the female orgasm is as easy-to-provoke as their own.

It sounds like it's been mixed by N'Sync, there's no instrument seperation, the drums are over polished and fake sounding while the guitars sound processed and stripped of any sonic character.If they had recorded Antics the same way they did TOBL, and dropped some of the cheesy 80's throw-back stylings, I might have really liked this album.How does a band go from TOBL to Antics?

Turn on the Bright Lights made such a strong impact on me, I remember first hearing it through headphones. First off, these guys are incredible live, especially in suits. Also, the new album is great. I will agree that Interpol does not follow up with a dissapointment. The major thing I like about this album is Interpol is defining their existince and their musical signatures i.e. abrupt endings, changes in tempo, and deep & interesting lyrics. I think \\"Take you on a cruise\\" and \\"C'mere\\" are the most impressive tracks. These tracks represent originally and I'm glad Interpol have succeeded in the music business. 4 stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Interpox","review":"These fellas are just the sort of viral infestation that stamps out true genius.

This is so phony, I can't beleive it. I don't care about the obvious rip-off of 80's dark post-punk. There's a lot of great bands that are derivative. Don Caballero's \\"American Don\\" sounds like a hyper-complicated version of King Crimson's \\"Discipline\\". But unlike \\"American Don\\", \\"Antics\\" doesn't go beyond anything. In fact, it's even simpler and less diverse than Joy Division.The people who give this album 5 stars are mostly cheese-eating high school students that listen to \\"alternative\\" music presented on MTV and commercial radio stations.This is just a warning to people who might get fooled (like I was) into believing that there is something artistic going on here. No, this isn't even autistic!If you still want to buy this, please buy my used copy for sale. I haven't been able to move it for 6 weeks now."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"Antics\\" is slick","review":"\\"Antics\\" is a slick work of art. Unlike some, who reprimand Interpol for a lack of artistic merit, I feel they go too far. This is obviously the case of a bunch of pretentious artists, trying to pass off some slick minimalist jive. I can tell they're artists because they wear expensive designer suits and are always caught on camera in artistic poses.The songs all employ a similar 8th note riff on the guitars and monotonous drum patterns without fills or articulations. It's as if this is the statement of where music should be heading? This sort of uniform minimalism is indicative of the slick artist. It's almost like the slick composer who spends 2 hours tuning, and that was the performance!I would agree with the timeless remark, but as the band's own lyrics go \\"I'm as timeless as a broken watch\\". Indeed! Antics is as timeless as a broken Casio calculator watch that's stuck in 1982.I agree with \\"The Emperor's New Clothes\\". This is a slick work of art!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as good as TOTBL, which was just OK anyway","review":"Yeah... I picked this up at the mall after the cool alternative guy in study hall told me what a great band this is. I don't know what is so great about \\"Antics\\". I always thought alternative music is supposed to be different. This seems more boring than Brittney... as for Interpo' being cute, I'd have to say, being a guy, I prefer Brittney."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not timeless","review":"I recently bought \\"Antics\\" I found this album to be part of this new \\"80's revival\\" thing. The songs have the rigid poppy simplicity of 80's music. This means that when this whole fad is over, \\"Antics\\" isn't very valid anymore. I guess for some people, this may be OK, but when I pay money for a CD, I'd like to be able to listen to it for years to come. \\"Antics\\" unfortunately, was a poor choice. I would recommend the new Sleepytime Gorrilla Museum album, \\"...Of Natural History\\" if you're into timeless and artistic alternative music.I have no problem if Interpol were labelled a \\"rock\\" band. But they consistently get the \\"alternative\\" label, which is why I bought \\"Antics\\". Alternative means a different choice, but this is a rehash of 80's music here. There's nothing different here."},{"rating":"2","title":"4.5 stars----Different yet still excellent","review":"Antics is far different from their debut and I guess that is why some may be disappointed.

Every song is driven by the same lifeless staccato guitar riffing and simplistic drum beat meaning it gets very monotonous. The vocals are also uninteresting and try to cash in on the Ian Curtis worshipping. This may have worked for the band on their first album but it's only a matter of time before people realise this music has little substance and will be piling up in the discount bin of their local music store."},{"rating":"1","title":"alright effort.........","review":"im not a big fan of interpol but when i heard slow hands i thought i should pick this up. i think that you will either love it or hate it. i certanly dont hate interpol because they made good stuff in the past. this album is too short as well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dis be meaty ocre, I wanna help!","review":"Yo, homies.

Chop suey, even in Wisconsin, has some spice to it. No... This one is like mashed potatoes. Boring, bland, and full of starch filler...The more \\"alternative\\" music sounds like this, the more I distance myself from it.

But as long as the band looks \\"alternative\\", it must be."},{"rating":"1","title":"Blah...","review":"I have no pretensions about the purity of the indie scene. The only thing that concerns me is the music coming out of the speaker. And on that basis, Antics is a disappointing album. It's not so much that it's \\"bad\\" exactly. The feel is appealingly detached, static, and monotone, and Interpol sounds like a prom band from the 1950's as played by zombies- which is a concept that I kind of dig. But the songs melodically go nowhere, and the underlying emotion is unconvincing and fails to transcend the detached style. \\"Evil\\" has a good chorus but doesn't coalesce. \\"A Time to Be So Small\\" uses a chord progression with lots of potential, but there's no melody. Interpol need better content for their next album."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overrated","review":"Everyone seems really into this cd, but the painfully honest truth is this cd is nothing very unique, special or interesting at all. In general it is slow, drony, and minimalistic. Sometimes this works. \\"Take You on a Cruise\\" is beautiful. \\"Not Even Jail\\", \\"Narc\\" and \\"A Time to be so Small\\" are okay. But the singles \\"Evil\\" and (especially) \\"Slow Hands\\" are horribly overrated and a majority of the album sounds like modest mouse meets radiohead - a sound you would expect to be really cool, but just doesnt work here. I have heard their other album is better, but this cd didnt exactly get me into the band."},{"rating":"1","title":"too guitar-y","review":"This album is way too brainy and sophisticated or wahtever.

There is no way that this is anything less than a 3.5 star album at all. Has anyone listened to the crud on the radio today (britney, puddle of mudd, nickelback)... those are all 1 star albums. Granted, this is no Turn On the Bright Lights, but Interpol have released an album filled with memorable hooks, great guitar riffs, and fast moving music. Get over it, aging hipsters, not every band will be your \\"special little secret\\" forever... morons."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ignore the naysayers","review":"The wave of one-star ratings on Amazon for Interpol's second album, Antics, is disconcerting. Why be unfair to this band when so many others deserve it for putting out utter crap? Turn On The Bright Lights was a majestic work, and Antics is a logical follow-up to that. Yes, Interpol may reference a bygone era, but Antics is a collection of songs executed with a tremendous amount of skill and thought. I will admit that Antics is one of my all-time favourite albums; there is an emotional sincerity to these songs (an emotional \\"weight\\"), backed by a lethal rhythm section and unpredictable song structures. Better than what the cynics suggest. Much better, in fact."},{"rating":"2","title":"More Of The Same....","review":"but thats not a bad thing!!!

IMO, it's even better."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the Best","review":"Yes they sound like a lot like Joy Divison,( I love Joy Divison) Yes they are very derivative of that era. No they are not the best band of all time. No this is not the best record of all time. But it is certainly one of the very best I have heard in the last five years or so. An absolute killer, some of the cleverest lyrics I have heard in a long time. Best track beings \\"Narc\\" and \\"Take you on a Cruise\\", with \\"Evil\\" a close runner up."},{"rating":"2","title":"Surprisingly good","review":"Although Interpol can sometimes have a mechanical feel to their songs, this album has plenty of just good solid melodies and songcraftsmaship..I think it would be very hard to make a better album than their first, but although it's close there are several songs that really standout and I wish were played on the radio more often...There are at least 3 great songs here and it also grows on you just like \\"Turn On the Bright Lights.\\" Very good follow-up."},{"rating":"1","title":"Blowz Chunkz","review":"This is not that good at all. I've never hear Joy Division, so I can't comment on the plagerism/derivative issue. However, after purchasing this CD and listening to it, I do agree that I basically bought one song and paid for ten. All of these songs are the same. These guys are so into their shtick that they spoon out their monthly fruits of constipation and garnish their cornlflakes with them... Homogeneous, as another poster had pointed out, is a euphamism. I bought one song for $15.99. Please, figure out how to write a decent rock album! Can I return this album to Amazon or their record label? It seems fair, and in accordance with the law as well. This is fraud."},{"rating":"2","title":"The New Bed-Sit Depressive.","review":"Unfortunately, despite another reviewer here, the comparisons to Joy Division and Bauhaus are correct. This isn't a bad thing though. Interpol carve out their own niche in this genre and make \\"Antics\\" a decent, but uneven work. Add this to all the other bands of the second generation new wave movement that's going on right now and you've got one of the better releases of 2004. The single I heard first was \\"Evil\\" and this was enough to take a chance on this band. I do not have their first album. \\"Antics\\" also contains other strong works such as \\"Take You On A Cruise\\", \\"Slow Hands\\" and \\"Next Exit\\". The album is somewhat repetitive and uneven in spots, but overall, if you're looking for this type of music, \\"Antics\\" should slit the wrist--um, hit the spot."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Sophomore Album","review":"This is a great modern rock album. I didnt care much for their first album, Turn the Bright lights on (downer music supported by even downier lyrics, interesting but slightly boring) but this one is a much better effort. Some of the songs i didnt like at first grew on me. And singles like Evil and Slow Hands are irresistably catchy. If there are any complaints, it is that their influences (joy division, new order, maybe love and rockets, i think I even hear some Doors on Narc) are too evident. But when the music is this good who cares. Fans of the Killers and Franz Ferdinand will like this."},{"rating":"2","title":"loving their Antics","review":"With their beautiful guitar sound and amazing vocals, Interpol has become one of the few new bands of late to be on high roation on my cd player.With indie rock becoming more popular now a days, interpol should become a bigger influence in the music industry with this fantasic album.If you love music, get this."},{"rating":"1","title":"intricate and angular? spare me the hype!","review":"\\"Antics\\" is a very simple, formulaic pop album. Many people maintain that this work is \\"angular\\" and \\"intricate\\".People tend to confuse angularity with staccato. This is staccato and not angular. This is about as angular as a straight line. If you want to hear a good definition of \\"angular\\" check out \\"Larks Tongues in Aspic\\" by King Crimson, which is over 30 years old and is still more timeless, \\"intricate\\" and \\"angular\\" than Interpole could ever hope to be.As far as \\"intricate\\", I'd have to say this is quite plain, straightforward, and simplistic. It's a pop album, and not even a good one at that. It's about as \\"intricate\\" as a glass of distilled water."},{"rating":"1","title":"idolatry does not make for a 5 star record","review":"I've read many reviews for \\"Antics\\" and the word \\"idol\\" comes up. Yes, we live in an era where someone crooning to a pre-recorded sound track is considered a virtuoso and idolized by many. This would explain all of the 5 star reviews for \\"Antics\\".I saw Interpol on the Jimmy Kimmel show, and it was so obvious they were lip syncing. Pretty pathetic. The music is as simple as can be. There's no excuse for that.If you're 12 years old, and you look up to these guys, then no one can argue with that. Please don't make these people out to be something they're not. They're not creative. They're not good musicians. They're well attired, but the mod thing (on it's 4th come back) is not that original.They are part of a music industry platform -- the 80's revival movement. If you buy into what the music corporations have planned, you are pathetic. Period."},{"rating":"1","title":"Did someone say Ian Curtis?","review":"These guys rip off Joy Divison on every level. I'm sorry, but there is nothing exciting about Interpol. Buy a Joy Division record and ignore these guys."},{"rating":"1","title":"Musical Chop Suey","review":"\\"Antics\\" is about as alternative as chop suey is Chinese! This is a completely fake alternative album that is fine for the high school kids. Anyone in college who listens to college radio will find this tiresome. I'm not surprised by all the 5 star ratings. There are plenty of morons who would think this is the best album ever. This must be one of their 3 CD's -- the other two being Creed and Green Day."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not even as good as 80's music","review":"As a music fan, I like to break out and explore new things. I recently bought \\"Antics\\" based on a review I read, and all the buzz I've been hearing about Interpol. I'm a little bummed out by this album. It's not as alternative, or different as I thought. Even by 80's standards, this is kind of conventional. If you're into conventional music, then I should suggest \\"Antics\\". If you're looking for something different, try The Residents, or some other 80's band that did something special.Some say this sounds like 80's alternative music, but that would be a compliment beyond what \\"Antics\\" deserves. I'd say it sounds like 80's mainstream music, marketed as 2000's alternative music."},{"rating":"1","title":"A few steps back from where they began","review":"I eagerly anticipated this album with great patience, but to my dismay on the first day of release, I bought it and felt unimpressed. The great thing about Turn on the Bright Lights was the subtle varience in songs. I bought their first album on a whim, not knowing anything about them and it was a pleasent surprise. This album is a costant one note version of the same song. I love this band and I hope that they follow up with something that goes beyond the mediocraty of Antics. Nothing even comes close to the gentle beauty of NYC, will they do it next time?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Drone on","review":"More droning noise from Interpol. I think i would like this more if the guitar and vocals weren't so loud. The rhythm section is the most interesting part of this band except it's often drowned in a swell of noisy lifeless guitars and monotone vocals. There are some songs that work, mainly tracks 3 and 8, but most of it is rather dull."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brooding....with energy","review":"While Antics at time can sound overly morose and gloomy, it does, however, remain infused with an unmistakable energy that somehow both paradoxically detaches and involves the listener at the same time. Having read the latest Spin magazine and gotten to know the enigmatic innerworkings of Interpol a little more, I've ascertained somewhat more of an understanding of the both the brooding and energy behind the band. Guitarist Daniel Kessler has unmistakably molded and defined Interpol to what they are today, Matador's most financially and critically successful band ever.Now that their contract is up, there no doubt will be a veritable fight for the right to sign them. Let's hope they don't become mass-produced pop and sell out for a big label contract. Anyway, enjoy Antics while you still can."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interpol breaks through the mess to come to your ears","review":"The best thing about Interpol is that they can enjoy their current anonymity for only a short while longer. While the genre of indie-emo-rock has seen a recent explosion (95% of which I would like to explode), Interpol is rounding the circuit and gathering a true fan base. Their few hit singles have paved the way for cursory onlookers to get really into their overall fantastic compilation in \\"Antics\\". They are practiced musicians and are very talented at conveying their messages in their songs, which are extremely open to interpretation. They do not flip-flop between different genre's; rather, they have carved their niche, and operate within those borders. Their songs hold together a theme without cannibalizing each other's sound. Definitely see them in concert. They all wear suits."},{"rating":"2","title":"As good as the fhe first album","review":"Most bands that debut with a great first album, like Interpol's \\"Turn on the Bright Lights\\", struggle to put out a second album of similar quality. Interpol succeeds with their second album \\"Antics\\", which can only guarantee a promising future for this band. Most people don't get turned on to their style quickly, but those that do catch on to their released hits like \\"Obstacle 1\\" and \\"PDA\\" will love this album."},{"rating":"2","title":"More Miles on the Car","review":"This band has a real gift for building to a chorus in their music. In that vein, if you enjoyed tracks \\"The New\\" (#10) and \\"Leif Erikson\\" (#11) from TOTBL, I believe that the tracks \\"Narc\\" (#3) and \\"Take You on a Cruise\\" (#4) on Antics will find a home with you. I think this album does resemble TOTBL in sound and mood, but that's not a bad thing... bottom line is that most bands screw up when they try to depart from the sound that works for them. Interpol remains consistent and effective with this album.If you enjoyed their previous album, there is a better than 90% chance that you will enjoy Antics and find yourself spending extra time in the car just to listen to this cd."},{"rating":"1","title":"Please, no more 80's rehash","review":"I bought \\"Antics\\" and this is an obvious attempt to fit into the new 80's musical market space. You can't turn on the TV now without hearing the Cars or Modern English songs in commericals. To me, this is the trend Interpol is trying to cash in on.This is not art rock, but that's OK. I do enjoy much alternative music that isn't artistic.I'm not a musician, so I can't speak too specifically about what they're doing. I know that it sounds pretty simple, and the songs all sound alike. It sounds like 80's music.Please try and come up with something that isn't part of this 80's trend. I guess the only good thing is that, being trendy, Interpol will be forgotten in a few months."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dull music","review":"I can't comment on whether Interpol's \\"Antics\\" is derivative or not. All's I know is that this music is really simple. The strumming patterns are all 8th notes, and the music is all in 4/4 time. Even Country music is more adventurous. I think Garth Brooks is more \\"alternative\\" than these guys. I'm just a simple country boy from Texas, but being a banjo player, I at least know something about music. These guys are not musicians. They're hacks."},{"rating":"1","title":"Interpol have fallen from grace","review":"Interpol's sophomore album, \\"Antics\\" falls short. This is a band that had some potential, but decided to take the low road, and cash in their chips... \\"Slow Hands\\" isn't too bad, but that is only because it resembles the Joy Division classic \\"Love Will Tear Us Apart\\". The rest of the album is too similar to even bother listening to. They wrote one song, changed a few things to stretch it out into 9 more songs. Interpol need to spend a little more time writing songs than grooming and staring at themselves in the mirror. In the end, the looks aren't what people remember... It's the music."},{"rating":"2","title":"Outstanding","review":"This is what a sophomore album should be. It's progressive, yet stays close enough to their debut sound to keep fans happy. Banks' vocals seems a little more tangible in this album, not quite so distant...and I think listeners are going to appreciate that step forward. \\"Next Exit\\" would be my favorite off of the album, but you really can't go wrong with any of it. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"pieced together in ProTools","review":"I bought \\"Antics\\" a few days ago, and after 2 listens, I decided to sell it used. This is not a very good album at all. Interpol do sound like Joy Division.In addition to being derivative, this band has no talent. I read a recent interview in a recording magazine, and they pieced all of this music together in ProTools, giving this work the illusion of talent. The music is pretty simple to play. I don't get why these guys can't just record an album properly. The ProTools recording sounds very sterile. Maybe instead of spending so much time on their appearance, this band should practice and write better music.I'd honestly rather listen to Supertramp than this crud!"},{"rating":"1","title":"ZZZZZZZZZZZ","review":"Antics is incredibly disappointing. Interpol's first album was cool because it was dark, moody and dramatic. Now they have admittedly dropped that part of their sound and the result is just another The band. They should now be known as The Interpol. They're now just another band with a decent yet uninspiring album full of songs that all sound the same. This definitely goes on my list of most disappointing albums ever, and that's why it gets two stars instead of three."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't confuse melancholy for art...","review":"I think a lot of people are fooled by Interpol. They see the suits and the music is a bit depressing. People tend to think that if something is depressing, it must be artistic (Oh, the tortured artiste!)\\"Antics\\" is depressing because it's exactly what's wrong with alternative today. You have a site like Amazon that claims Green Day and U2 are the top alternative bands. Based on what? Record sales?Aestetically speaking, \\"Antics\\" is weak and appeals to the goth/shoegazer types that think anyone who whines about boring stuff along to some simplistic \\"ethereal\\" music is an artist.Yes, it is true that many artists led painful and depressing lives. But this doesn't correlate to great art... No. These guys are just another boring rock band, and maybe need to go to therapy and take some meds... But the black clothes and depression thing isn't artistic at all... unless you're in high school or something..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mostly filler","review":"\\"Evil\\" is an incredible song. I'd never heard of this band until that incredibly moving, heartfelt tune came on the radio. The rest of the album is really forgettable - slow hands is passable, as are maybe 2 other songs. The rest is filler, sounds like it was written by robots. Dull. Give Turn on the Bright Lights a listen if you want to see what this band's capable of."},{"rating":"2","title":"A hard one to get into.","review":"I first bought this album on the strength of it's two singles: Evil and Slow Hands. During the first listen I was shocked as to how much the album tracks differed from the singles. With the exception of said singles, I would way this albums rests between prog-rock and indie. Some of the riffs are repeated through an entire song and more often than not, the lead singer's voice is buried in the mix, making it hard to discern the lyrics. After repeated listens, although, I have come to love this album. Recommended for people who need time to take in albums. I would not recommend this to anyone looking for an instantly catchy record but to those who are willing to give it more than one listen before they form an opinion."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"Slow Hands\\" is good, but...","review":"I like the new Interpol album \\"Antics\\". Well I like one song, \\"Slow Hands\\" that they played at the homecoming dance. After shakin' my booty on the dance floor, I bought \\"Antics\\" and it made me feel sad.Since I only like one of the songs, I feel like I can only give this one star. If the review was for the single, it'd get a solid 3 stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful","review":"TOTBL was such a good record but this is just tuneless, mediocre crap.Shame, really.I haven't entirely given up on Interpol YET, but they definitely blew it this time.

Pschedelic Furs meet the Jam.This Band are fabulous, just think ...this is only the beginning."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interpol's Sophomore Effort","review":"Pretty okay album. Banks shows a bit more of his vocal range, and there are some pleasant melodies, as well as the fact that it was far less melancholic than Turn on the Bright Lights. I just wish there were more songs on the album, but what can you do."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy it","review":"I really love Turn On The Bright Lights, and I still listen to it on a regular basis, but this album is pretty awful. I've only listened to it once all the way through, and I have no desire to hear it again. There just aren't any memorable or noteworthy songs on this. It almost sounds like they're trying too hard to shake the Joy Division comparisons, and in the meantime it sounds like they're just going through the motions. Save your money. Maybe they'll put out a better one next time..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Inter..lol?","review":"Hummm...terrible thing...after third song my finger compulsively pushed the fast forward button....i mean i wanted to hear something decent but it was not until track Not Even Jail that i believed this was a mainstream band and not my neighbours jammin\`.There are too many awful things here, like the cover,hey!...you\`re paying 14$ and that includes a cover not a word office document.In TOBL they really delivered ,it was emotive raw and inspiring...but here this is a band on autopilot...There were many things to avoid from 80\`s post punk music and Interpol recollect them all here,off key goat singing,uninspiring lyrics,repetitive guitar hooks.Each song sounds exactly the same dull and monotonous.If i give it 2 stars it\`s because i like track Not Even Jail and i don\`t want to see the time come when i rate an album 1 star.Somebody said this reminded him to Kitchens of Distinction.Auggh what an insult."},{"rating":"1","title":"Falls Short","review":"I first stumbled across Interpol during the buzz of Turn On The Bright Lights. I was very hesitant to buy into it because I've been constantly disappointed by most new music. After a few listens I realized that Interpol had something. The music was sparse and the melodies were sparser but there was just enough there to form a very enjoyable bunch of songs. There were some weak points but for the most part Interpol had found the right blend of ingredients to create a memorable album.Antics is a valiant attempt to utilize those same ingredients but it doesn't work.The songs don't have the simple hooks that TOTBL had. There are a few songs that come close like C'mere and Slowhands but even those songs are only as good as the weakest stuff on Bright Lights. I was hoping for better because it's really time a modern band started producing some consistently good music... Still waiting."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'll say it now.","review":"Why does this chubby face kid keep trying to tell Rosemary and Sandy what is wrong with their lives?

Why people croon over these preppy pretty boys like girls at a beatles concert I don't know. They don't hold a candle to other bands in the genre.

Hearing the buzz about Interpol, I decided to buy this album. It was quite a let down. If this was marketed as a Top 40 album, I would be OK. I would have stayed away from it. But these guys are getting all this press in the independent rock media. They shouldn't be. Just a warning to anyone thinking of buying this... This is about as original as a Creed album. Even if you tolerate unoriginality, \\"Antics\\" is also mind-numbingly simple and bare... There's not much going on here.

These guys have done a great job of constructing a congruent album of creative guitar hooks and catchy vocals.This may not be a pop/easily digestible/made for the masses type album, but it was made for the music enthusiasts who like something more than the typical American junk that is turned out day after day.5 stars for Interpol"},{"rating":"1","title":"Vastly inferior to TOTBL","review":"Whilst TOTBL was definitely one of the best albums in recent times, i am astounded to read that interpol fans think Antics is anywhere near as good. Whilst Totbl has a wondeful variety of beautiful slow songs mixed with brilliant rock songs, Antics is a one dimensional album with the vast majority of songs so similar they blend into each other. The only exceptions to this are Evil, Slow hands and to a lesser extent, Not even jail. The beautiful chiming and the aching sorrow of TOTBL have been lost, only to be replaced by tuneless rubbish. Very dissapointing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice Product","review":"This watch has a wonderful HUGE display for an LCD type, and it can even be read easily at night with the built-in backlighting. The audible alarm is not very noticeable for my 63 year old ears, so I leave it off to give the battery some slack. The vibrating alarm is noticeable when I'm awake but iffy when I'm asleep. The alarm functions work great. The only issue I've had is that the backlight comes on for no apparent reason for periods of time. Also, the big watch with four big buttons on the sides means you touch those buttons on things often, and it alarms whenever you do that."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not one of my better purchases","review":"Worked fine for 3 months, but no more.

Seriously, I had vinyl of both of these releases in college and as CD's took over replaced my vinyl with this. It's pure psychedelic power pop done right, combining sing along hook happy elements of the Beatles, ethereal layered guitar work with background electronics that really put it \\"out there\\". Front man Mitch Easter of course played a hand in putting REM at the forefront of college radio and it's unfortunate that his excellent work with Let's Active never really made it into the mainstream consciousness.

Cutting guitars ringing, drums and bass foundating(?!),paving the way for a melancholy trip into love's pain and glee.

The song that I hate the most is the stupid remix of \\"2 Of America's Most Wanted\\". Some loser called Crooked I raps over Snoop Dogg's parts and Tupac's lyrics that mention Snoop Dogg are deleted. The only reason Suge keeps on releasing these Tupac albums with \\"new\\" material is so he can fill his pockets even more and try to keep Death Row Records afloat.

These beats sound like they were made by two guys who have filled their ears with cotton and added fuzzy pink ear muffs to further drown out their sense of good music. If Pac wasn't cremated, he'd not only roll in his grave, but roll up a blunt in his grave so he could settle his nerves. Only one word seems fitting for this release : GARBAGE.

Suge Knight is trying to milk the Pac legacy until it is bone dry. Well at least he has done something right if you ask me. It sucks that this is how we are forced to remember Tupac Shakur, over tracks chopped up into this. Die hard Pac fans won't even like this, if they haven't heard it already.

Anyway, this CD is horrible, the ebats are not \\"bangin\\" as others have decribed them, in fact, most of them are lame. The original songs were as Tupac saw them fit, otherwise he would have changed them before putting them out.

For example, Gimli, Legolas, Pippin, etc are not featured. This disappointed me a tiny bit, yet I know there were only so many pieces that could be made.

His Eurocentric bias is clearly apparent; when the only role a person of hue plays in this book, is that of a slave toted around the earth and seas.

CANAANITES were children of HAM, they are Hamites. Phoenicians are descendants of Canaanites. But this author knowingly tries to invert truth but it can't be done with the worthless scholarship and pittiful arrogance of this book. At one point he asks in his book Are we diffusionists racist?

I like Keiko's piano myself but having Alberto Del Almar as the guitar player is most welcome. His presence gives keiko's song an extra dimension.

This release \\"Mata Leao\\" seemed to cross over into the Metal genere, yet still using the infamous \\"Hardcore\\" SOund. A lot of bands that started out playing Hardcore all mostly crossed over to metal such as \\"Suicidal Tendencies\\" and \\"Danzig\\" and those bands pulled it off nicely and so does Biohazard.

The microphone volume is not good at all. No matter how high we turned the microphone in relation to the music we could not hear the singer without putting our ear right up to the speaker.

My fiancee can even hook his professional microphone (he's in a band) into it for a better quality sound.you have to fiddle with the camera and the sound controls, but you can even hook it into your stereo and run it completely through your stereo and TV, OR my husband even tried hooking it up to one of his big amps and it worked fine too, so theoretically we can have a big backyard karaoke party and have professional sound with this little machine.

I felt the book highlighted all the devastating things about the disorder and accented the \\"weirdness\\" of it.Particularly hurtful to me was how each form of therapy or treatment was profiled. The last paragraph of the section always told why that treatment could never work for long if at all. I remember the question \\"Is there hope?\\" being asked with the answer \\"Absolutely.\\" However,this book did not make me feel hopeful and in fact compounded my grief.

It has developed blue blocks of color on everything despite numerous attempts at cleaning, aligning, cartridge changes, etc. When I contacted Epson tech support they sent a document on how to clean, align, and change the cartridges.

I'm thinking of finally getting rid of it and buying something else. The set-up is a hassle. It's slow to respond to commands, doesn't' recognize some devices and is just not user friendly. Every time I use it, I have to do a nozzle clean, which is inconvenient and uses up ink and paper. The menu is quite laborious and slow. Maybe it's just too old, but I remember shelling out quite a bit of money for it a few years ago. Because of this, I would buy another brand."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great little printer!","review":"I totally agree with all the other glowing reviews... great photo quality, even better than that of the website I used to upload to and get pictures by mail.

This printer is a pleasure. It saves the time and expense of running to CVS to print photos. The quality is outstanding. It is easy to use, whether it is with the memory card, USB to computer or even camera to printer. As another review stated, it does not have red eye feature, I would suggest connecting your camera via USB to the printer first, adjusting the red eye through your camera (if feature is available on your camera) and then printing. In addition, if anyone has a Sam's Club nearby, you can pick up the picturemate photo pack for a great price.

Instead I find that it does not seamlessly interface with a MAC: it will print after you have to switch printers in several places to the Picture Mate, but sometimes it put white bars, like a border on the bottom and top of the picture, and out of Mac's 'Preview' it will only print a small piece of the total image. I have called both Mac and Epson and they refer me back to each other, neither helping me resolve the issue I have. Oh, and while picture quality overall is good, it is not great.

I HATE that I am forced to buy the ink in an expensive package, combined with 100 sheets of Epson picture paper. The print pack ink is guaranteed to last for ALL of the 100 paper's but it never lasted beyond 30 prints for me! I have built up quite the stockpile of left over printer photo paper now, so much for \\"guaranteed to last\\".

It is easy to set up and to use. The pictures come out fantastic. I would recommend this printer to anyone with a digital camera who wants to print photos quick and fast. I love the fact that I can print photos quickly without having to turn on my computer or use my bigger printers for photo copying. The 4x6 size photos are perfect for photo albums. This was a great item and well worth the cost."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pleasantly surprised","review":"This is my first purchase of a photo printer and I was not sure what to expect.

It wouldn't read my card, and when I called Epson (on my own dime as the number they give for tech support is not toll free) I was first told the printer was out of warranty (after having it in my possession for about 15 minutes) was then put on hold and was finally told it couldn't read 2 GB cards. This while I am looking at a sticker on the printer that says, \\"Any camera, any card.\\" When I asked about this the tech guy could only repeat that it couldn't read my card. I am sending it back.

I have a large format Epson as well as a couple of HP photosmarts, but as everyone who prints knows, it is a real hassle to fire them up and get prints. This little gadget easily and quickly makes 4x6's better than I have ever seen, including the local photolab. Bright, clear, sharp, and glossy. Unlike the previous reviewer, I have had no problem printing right from my 1 gig sd card."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent price, prints excellent photos","review":"We recently bought this printer, and have been very pleased with the product. It prints very hight quality photos, and has a lot of editing options available, so you don't have to go to your computer first to edit. One drawback is, when we use a 1 gigabyte jmp drive, it searches the whole thing for photos, and this can take a while. At first we thought it wasn't working, but it found all the photos, even searching all the subdirectories.The printer is very easy to set up and very versatile, given that it prints up to 4x6 inch photos. So far, we're quite happy with it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great printer!!","review":"The quality is fantastic. Only complaint is that the printer is a little slow.

There isn't any fiddle, harmonica, mandolin, or even much accoustic guitar. (All of the stuff that made me love REK in the first place). Instead, every song sounds like the same mixture of bass, electric guitar, and drums. This doesn't sound like country music (Texas or otherwise) in the least. It's just kinda weird.

Not only are the ingredients not right, the methods of preparation is incorrect. If you made the cabbage or eggplant Kim Chi as she states, they would be nothing but mush. She gives a recipe for Mandu that says how to make the wrappers, but not for the filling. I have no idea why. I think someone was messing with her when they gave her these recipes. My wife and I still wonder if she has tried these herself. I love Korean food and this is my thirteenth Korean cookbook. I would recommend any other one before this one.

First of all, how can you justify putting out an 11-track cd of songs which are usually 3 minutes long or less? Even more so when the artist in question was a legend even BEFORE he went solo? Surely Michael Jackson deserves at least 24 tracks. Millenium has done similar hatchet jobs on the Spinners, the Four Tops and Sublime.

The little family owned a little corner grocery store that let people buy on credit. There is a closness of the neighbors and their kids playing in the streets while the parents visited on the porches during the summer in the heat of the evening. They were poor people struggling day to day to get by much as our family did. There were some really dark times as well as there are in most peoples lives. But it was a very special time.

I can understand that the game doesn't know where the ships got put automatically - that takes some additional electronics to achieve. But would it have killed them to put in a bunch of cheap 2-color LEDs, to keep track of when you hit and when you missed? Would it have been so hard to make the voice clear and understandable? Why can't you press any buttons until the voice stops speaking each prompt - which slows the game to a crawl as you sit there, waiting for it to finish saying the same stock phrases, over and over? Who playtested this thing, anyway?Also, ships are poorly constructed - they sit on little stands and they fall off the stands easily - and you have to take them off the stands to pack the game up, so glue isn't an option.Basically, this is 1.25$ worth of badly engineered electronics in a $49 plastic box, made frustrating to play. NOT a good deal."},{"rating":"1","title":"too much trouble","review":"This game is really boring. You'd think the game would know where you put you're ships, but it doesn't!!

Inventing them is half the fun! The *only* electronic part is the sound effects, and they're not so great. The voices are painfully cut-and-pase sounding. I'm a big Star Wars fan, so I thought I'd like this game, but NO!!

OK but nothing special.- By the end I grew tired of Matt West as the author's \\"ah, but what I haven't told you is ..\\" device.- The ending seemed a bit facile, especially in tying off a few loose ends - but explaining would be spoilering so I won't.- The paperback edition I read had more tha a few errors (\\"softwear\\" for example)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Faith and Devotion","review":"This Depeche Mode single is sexy, danceable and just overwhelmingly good.

The authenticity of Schatz is over, in the book you find photos giving you the feeling of a \\"deja vu\\". It's a collection of model's books not conveying at all the particular touch Schatz always had in the past.Photography is continuous research, but why trying to have it paid by the money of past admirers, poor readers or collectors, using the name of a past glory?

The first two albums get a mere six tracks, truly an injustice. The Eagles were at their country rock best on these two albums, and more of this would have been desirable. Six tracks from the excellent On the Border seems like a lot, but the simply gorgeous \\"My Man\\" is inexplicably left off, perhaps because Bernie Leadon writer and singer of this track, left after just four albums, and no longer had input. I'd say 4.5 stars actually, but not 5, so I had to give it 4. Still, there's no better collection than this one, and you can always fill things out by buying the early albums."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is the Best Best of I've Ever Heard","review":"The Eagles who are an incredible band as it is have done it again by releasing this album. The first Cd which contains their best known classics does not let you down at any point wotht the songsflowing into one another.

I am aware that the band may have a different meaning for \\"Get Over It.\\" It is just that I like \\"Get Over It\\" because it serves as a musical reminder for me to turn obstacles into learning opportunities when things may go differently from what I originally planned. \\"The Very Best Of\\" by The Eagles is great for those who like classic rock music and/or at least seven songs by The Eagles"},{"rating":"1","title":"6 Stars For The Music....","review":"Negative 5 stars for the corporate greed.

But for those of us that go back to the start,The Eagles were, as follows: Henley,Frey,Meisner and Leadon. If you want the definitive collection, stick with the original greatest hits. After Randy Meisner quit, along with Bernie Leadon, The Eagles became The Henley/Frey Duo, with backing musicians.Don't believe it?? Take a long listen to The James Gang and Barnstorm. Then, Poco. Joe Walsh and Tim Schmit are both respectable in their own right. Sadly now, they are relegated to backing up Don & Glen. Even Don Felder was canned by them.

I was delighted with the songs on here that I didn't know (I only know their radio hits, and was unfamiliar with their studio album tracks). A big thankyou to the Eagles and their record company for releasing this superior 2-disc set and including a generous new CD booklet with liner notes, photos and more. I was very impressed indeed with this set and have been playing it all week in my car stereo. The Eagles were able to combine soft and hard elements in their songs, and had very good songwriting abilities. My favourite tracks here are the exciting Life In The Fast Lane, the smooth I Can't Tell You Why the gentle guitar-based Peaceful Easy Feeling, and the uplifting soul-pop of One Of These Nights. The Eagles were the best American singles band of the 70's and all their really good songs are here.Highly recommended!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"An Eagles Album from England","review":"Went looking for an Eagles song and couldn't believe I didn't have any!

The Eagles have become cultural icons in the 1970s and beyond. They broke up during their peak but rightfully so in my opinion. Every band member must have their solo chance. Some good bands that haven't broken up still write good music. But what about the Beatles, and Led Zeppelin? They are true legends but broke up too soon.Well anyway about this comp it is amazing that all tracks from both greatest hits albums plus selected Hell Freezes Over material and a new song can squeeze together. Only one complaint though: They left out one of my southern rock favorites \\"Outlaw Man\\". I recommend this. Keep your previous Eagles greatest hits comps as collectors items."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent collection, moderate recording quality","review":"The collection/song compilation is excellent.

It is a basic and VERY good book to get the mind working for new color schemes."},{"rating":"2","title":"This book is beyond excellent!","review":"Even though most of us have some knowledge of color combining, it's great to be shown specific groupings and to be given the reasons why some colors work and others don't. Some mysteries are great, but color combining shouldn't be."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Book for the color challenged.","review":"This book is simple and easy to understand. The authors wrote it in such a way that even the most color challenged quilter can figure out how to use a color wheel in determining what colors work well together. Lots of photo combinations of quilt patterns using different color harmonies so you have something to compare to. By explaining the color combinations as harmonies they take confusion out of all the art of color technical talk, even though they do use that to as a limited explination.If you're like me and find it difficult to understand how to pick out colors that look good together this is a tool for learning the concept without being in over your head."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works well","review":"This does the job without putting you to sleep or having a dry mouth I use it every spring and it stops the problems."},{"rating":"1","title":"Give me break","review":"This is a total waste of time.

We bought the one-show only disc. We watched and re-watched that great first show. We fast-forwarded endlessly through the post-1980's badly-done fake Alvin junk that overflows on this disc.This was a great series, created to be seen. What a joke! Now, it simply languishes in film-vault-limbo, seen by NOBODY. A sad and stupid ending to a fantastic memory. And all the while, a new version of Alvin (doesn't resemble him one iota) is everywhere (urk)."},{"rating":"1","title":"very disappointed","review":"I ordered The Very First Alvin Show, thinking that I would get all the episodes of the Alvin Show, that was created in the early 60's which I grew up with. I also liked Clyde Crashcup, the nutty inventor. I am very disappointed that there is only one episode from the original show and one from the 80's. I bought it used and I'm sending it back. If the new DVD costs over $20, you mean you only get three episodes for that price? Is there a DVD collection available which includes all the episodes from The Alvin Show from the early 60's?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Why just one?","review":"I love The Alvin Show! I want this DVD very much, but I will wait until a box set of ALL 26 shows are available. Yes, I would spend almost any amount to get it.( A box set). I can't justify $14.99 for this disc! I do not think it is fair, in my opinion, to put one classic cartoon on the disc and then fill it up with other animation from the 70's, 80's or 90's. We are the baby boomer who really like this show from the 60's. Please give us what we want at a fair price without the Chippetts, Achy Breaky Heart (or whatever). The (ORIGIONAL)Alvin Show featuring 2 shorts, Clyde Crashcup and a sing-a-long would be just fine. I don't want to sound like a snob, but please just give us the good stuff, the stuff that we over 40 years old would like."},{"rating":"1","title":"Misrepresentation","review":"After this long you would think they could at least release this show in its entirety and not play with us.

But when the complete series is released, I'm there."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed Fan","review":"First let me say that I, like most other 40+ fans, would really like to see The Alvin Show released in its entirety. Some sad news for us comes from a reputable animation historian who had access to the original films from 1961. He says they are in such bad shape that they may never be released!! It's the same problem with early episodes of Doctor Who - the original producers diddn't think that show would be such a hit and so many episodes pre-1971 are lost either to recycling or just plain poor storage. Having said that, I have told this historian that even in a poor state, the collection would sell and he agreed. Unfortunately, it's not his decision or mine - or even ours as collective fans apparently. But there may be a ray of hope. Last I heard they were not going to release ANY of the episodes. Maybe this one is a sign that they have decided to clean them up as best they can and release them. Who knows?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the First Season, the First Episode of the First Season","review":"Not the entire first season, just the first episode of the first season (one of twenty-six ever produced, in 1961). Very good film to DVD transfer, but at slightly under thirty minutes this is not very economical."},{"rating":"2","title":"If you are confused about the character of John Kerry","review":"I saw Going Upriver last night and it helped to clarify the seemingly inconsistent political positions of John Kerry that the Bush campaign is constantly repeating.It is possible to love your country and disagree with the government and standing up against a powerful government for what you believe is right and what is right for those without power may be the most patriotic action of any American.A vote for Kerry is not just a vote against Bush. It is a vote for ordinary citizens to take back our country. See the film and encourage everyone you know to do the same and make up their own minds."},{"rating":"2","title":"It annihilates the lies.","review":"If you came of age during the Vietnam era, you'll resonate with \\"Going Upriver: The Long War of John Kerry.\\" I was deeply moved by the impact and clarity of this pragmatic documentary. If you didn't come of age during Nam, you owe yourself the clear grasp of then and now that director George Butler offers. Going Upriver silences any doubt that Kerry really is \\"the right man in the right place at the right time.\\" See this one for yourself. It annihilates the lies. Trace the swift boat veterans for \\"truth,\\" and you find origins in Nixon's scheming and dirty tricks. Fascinating. 5 stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Misguided Mind","review":"The anti-war rhetoric that Kerry spewed was fed to our P.O.W.s as they suffered at the hands of their captors. They used his words and others like him (Hanoi Jane) to try to propagandize our heroes that the country was against all they had suffered for. Hate Bush, if that's your thing, but don't give this disgrace to patriotism any kudos for causing further damage to what was a terrible tragedy. There's a reason that there's a veterans against Kerry group. It's better to remain silent and be thought stupid, than to talk and remove all doubt. A lesson he will obviously never learn."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible, Horrible, Horrible","review":"First off, I went to see this film hoping to see an honest depiction of John Kerry. Instead I was subjected to another \\"Michael Moore\\" type of garbage.This is a disgusting plea for the 2004 Presidency election. The timing is horrendous and the message about this fraud is a joke as to his Vietnam \\"heroics\\". Read the true Vietnam exploits by all but 3 members of his crew.Horrible, Horrible film. Avoid."},{"rating":"1","title":"Interesting to see how any behavior can be justified","review":"Clearly, Kerry sees himself as heroic in any endeavor. This DVD while interesting shows the extent that someone with limited, perhaps no moral substance, can be promoted into something more than they are via editing. A large portion of the global audience suffers from the lack of critical thinking, and assumes anything in print or in media must be true. Kerry may be the greatest shame ever pulled on the American public by the media. More than anything it shows the power of visual persuasion, and challenges that America will continue to face as we gain our entire understanding of life through sound bites on TV."},{"rating":"2","title":"A true leader - John Kerry","review":"Wow! This DVD gave me a glimpse of what lies at John Kerry's core - his commitment to something more important than himself - our country. The movie clearly communicates a credible development of John Kerry as a leader and a patriot and how his time before and after his stay in Vietnam was the vehicle for this personal transformation. Shame on Republicans & media for discrediting his leadership and patriotism. If people saw this movie they would understand how shameful this misinformation is. This DVD highlights John Kerry's resolve and commitment to bring this country to see the realities of Vietnam at the risk of his own political aspirations and brings out the true character of John Kerry. Great music too!"},{"rating":"2","title":"How could any Belly single get fewer than 5 stars?","review":"Feed the Tree may be Belly's 'big hit' (and the first Belly song i ever heard), but Dream on Me (also on this single) is also a great song. Cryptic and melodic, i had it stuck in my head for weeks. Sometimes i wonder why songs like Dream On Me didn't get onto the albums. Perhaps they weren't 'pop'ish enough for mass consumption, but they're lovely all the same."},{"rating":"2","title":"Two thumbs up for Detach","review":"This is definitely a must for fans of ambient and experimental noise.

I Want a Lot Now, Dancin' Shoes, 18 Wheels, Ready For More, Dear Hearts, Stars in Her Eyes. They're just flawless. Hard and unrelenting, but at the same time, really swaggery and epic-seeming. Maybe its the brutal organ tone, maybe its Spencer Moody's warthog-whose-intestines-are-on-fire howl, maybe its their steady slow tempo, but these songs just have so much presence and power. This record really invigorates both rock and punk by adding a swagger to both, and then twisting them in the Devils own way. This album is fantastic!"},{"rating":"2","title":"SO BEATS THE HEART OF ROCK AND ROLL","review":"From the moment I first heard the Devils, I knew I had found the rawest raunchyiest band the N.W.'s ever seen.

The music is original and so is the theme of the CD. The composer was inspired by Parkside, the San Francisco neighborhood he calls home. Parkside lacks the intensity of many S.F. districts, and therefore the music is quite relaxing. The CD goes great with cooking, eating, entertaining, working and studying.

I've read many historical & tactical accounts of Civil War battles, but these real-life letters brought the human aspect of the war to life for me. You can't help but get involved in their everyday drama . . . the endless marching, the waiting, the daily sacrifices, the mud and the blood. This book takes the war from the abstract to the real.

The area of criminal profiling is populated by no shortage of Walter Mittys with no empirical grounding, so is it refreshing to find a text that cements the theories of this complex and fascinating area with empirical analysis of real cases. The text is well written and opens up a new area of criminal behaviour analysis to students and police officers alike. This book will undoubtedly become a key text in the field of criminal profiling and a welcome replacement to the long list of dull criminal psychology books that do not tell you anything useful, because the ivory tower authors have no practical experience."},{"rating":"1","title":"Croton Watch","review":"I'm not sure if I got a lemon watch or not, but we have replaced the battery at least 5 times and it still won't work for longer than 2 weeks.

The music is dry and energic only to the point of being contrived to sell."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Album Yet, Not The Real Dope","review":"Don't get me wrong, Dope is a great band; on all their other CD's. This one is like Dope gone limp. If you think Dope is a little hard, get this album, it may be perfect. By far their best album is American Apathy, which kicks ass. This album has one good song, which is Burn, but you can get a better version on American Apathy. Hopefully Dope doesn't produce another album like this one, this one is almost like teenage punk rock which goes against their earlier CDs and doesn't match their music style. I have all their CDs, then decided to purchase this one, I was let down to say the least. Their softest album yet."},{"rating":"1","title":"Back to antics","review":"I love Dope's music. Their music, I like. The lyrics, everyone knows, needs a lot of working on. It's often repetitive-and more so than Static-X (which I am a huge fan of), which even though some of their songs are a few lines spread it out and make it bareable for a few listens.This album has some things going for it, however. It's some-what cohesive. \\"Group Therapy\\"-the lyrics representitve here are that of madness becoming. None of the songs feel out of place, either. So I really don't see anything wrong with this album except for the repetitious and mind numbingly simple lyrics.But unfortuantely that's enough to kill it's ability to become a staple among industrial metal fans. This album is definitely left for the hardcore Dope fan, or someone who likes industrial metal and has the ability to tune out the person singing. It's sad really, I think Edsel has one of the most unique voices out there today too."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"Although lagging behind, I was very much looking forward to this album as I thoroughly enjoyed Felons & Revolutionaries. This one, however, seems to lack the spark of their first. They appear to have retained the inadequacies, and dropped their funky side - making them a bit boring. This album is not a write off, but I would definitely advise giving it a few full listens before buying it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just embarassing....","review":"Only on exceptionally rare occasions do the actions of another person, especially a stranger, embarass me. Edsel Dope and his merry band of rejects have managed to put another notch on that pole of shame. Hearing this contrived, simplistic, sophomoric attempt at recovering from the even worse, even more ill-fated album, Life, actually made me cringe. This c.d. is terrible... an absolute failure. I'd feel sorry for anyone who expends time or, even more horrific, MONEY, on this worthless turd of an album. I wish there was a \\"No Star\\" rating...

Sure it's tight, but we don't get any solos or some mind crushing leads. Also the drums sound kinda weak on a couple of tracks which is weird since they sound great on all the others. Also the album is really, which in my mind is a bad thing. But as said above, this is a very solid record.If you liked Life, you will like this and if you liked Felons they will definately have an interest in checking it out."},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT!!!","review":"This album is amazing, by far the best dope has put out so far.

My little cousin, bought this cd and i heard it while i was at his house. Their 2 previous cd were just as horrible. They're lyrics are plain stupid and their image is childish.

Serious lyrics with a good rhythm, on issues that we can change. This song was part of the soundtrack for a mountain bike video and after watching the section 20 times I bought the CD and played that 30-50 times. For this song alone the price is worth it.Sweatshop Union is all about the lyrics. Very high quality with a constant rhythm. Serious messages. Non-aggravating voices. I prefer music that I can actually repeat the lyrics... this is it.Tracks like US, Truman Show, Dont Be Afraid are other standouts. The rest are pretty good. I dislike 'I got news' because it is more like gangsta rap (the anti sweatshop) than anything else.To top it off, these guys are locals to me...

This volume(1969)from authors Jessie Hutton and the venerable Gladys Cunningham, is a quality textbook for those who wish to learn sewing techniques for garment and home decoration projects.Coming from an era when home construction of clothing was still more economical than purchasing ready-to-wear garments, this volume goes into great depth explaining sophisticated construction details, tailoring and fitting techniques. Instructions are always thorough and clear, with simple two-color illustrations. From today's perspective, it is a valuable resource for fine handmade garments and home decor, and still a less-expensive option than custom work for hire.Some of the techniques within will today be considered outdated except for those who want to include traditional details in their projects or who continue to enjoy working on a vintage machine."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Soothing ~ Must Have","review":"Anyone who purchase this cd will truly enjoy it, as it has a jazz flavor mixed with old time gospel sound.

So, skip the high price of plagerism, and go to the source. The products are great, and so is the support.

The author seems to mimick the same examples as clickteam (as far as TGF is concerned). The manual created by clickteam is better.

I've visited the UK twice and picked up the habit while there, so when I spotted this book at the library I thought it looked very interesting. The author actually worked in Africa for 13 years, and has personal experience as a British manager of a tea plantation. In the book he recounted a brief history of British tea trade with China, India, and Africa. The names of several types of tea were explained, since they come from geographic regions. From a slow start to a nationwide addiction, he followed the growth of tea drinking in Britain. The history of the four big British tea companies were explained, including a little bit about Twinings. The process of growing tea is over-viewed, including the good and bad of British colonial rule. Several maps were included which were very helpful, and the appendix on differentiating types of tea was interesting.

The batteries do run out quickly and the wheels are a little too smooth and therefore I cannot rely on it to help my baby walk.

When you have buttons with images of corn, an apple, and a pumpkin, and they're colored yellow, red and orange, wouldn't you think the corn would be yellow, the apple red, and the pumpkin orange?

When I tried to play with him he just turned his head away and went to play with simple toys (loves pots, pans, measuring cups, bottles, cans etc).Also the walker has no stop option for standing babies trying to play, the walker has to be next to something sturdy like wall or coffee table. The product by itself it's good quality for me it's unnecessary.Baby loves to walk with it, but it can be too fast on the floor other than carpet. I return this walker and take my umbrella stroller.

At first this toy was sensory overload for her. She would actually look away. Around six months she began to enjoy playing with the toy and would sit playing with it as long as we let her. This was one of the first things she attempted to pull up on which she found out it is not good for. The toy has ended up on top of her more than once. She hasn't been hurt by it but she does seem frustrated by it. She is not walking yet so I can't comment on that aspect of the toy. But the wheels move very easily even on thick carpet so I think it may move too much for a new walker. At one point we did think the toy had broken because it kept freezing up, as other reviewers mention. This was easily fixed with new batteries. As a wrap up, at times this toy has been great for our daughter and at other times not so much."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great-Grandson Now Has Confidence","review":"I gave this to my great grandson for his first birthday. He was at the stage where he was pulling up and walking about holding on to everything, but had no confidence in himself about being able to walk on his own. Since he lives 200 miles from me all I can tell you is what his mother reported to me over the phone. She said at first he would walk pushing it backwards. But recently she said that he has started walking behind it. He also loves all the toys on the walker and plays with them all the time. He has always been fascinated by anything that lit up or made noise, so this walker was very attractive for him. Now that he has more confidence in himself about walking, he will be walking by himself pretty soon if he has not already started. That is the problem being a grandmother, living so far away, you miss out on those important events in your grandchildren and great-grandchildren's lives."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very fun toy","review":"My 8 month old loves this toy. Everything works great, as always amazon shipped it perfectly in a reasonable amount of time.The only drawback I have with the toy is there aren't locks on the wheels. That would be a great feature. I have to rest the toy next to his toy box or a couch so when he stands up to it, the toy doesn't roll away on him. The toy does fall back if he tries to climb. You defiantely need supervise.With all that said, the toy is alot of fun. Plays many different songs, different activities to keep him occupied, and holds moms interest as well!I would recommend it, just be aware of, yes it is a rolling toy, but if your child isn't walking great yet, you need to acomadate."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor quality.","review":"Never had any safety issues, I think parents just need to use better discretion on where to use this.

I originally did a lot of research because I wanted a learning walker capable of allowing my son to pull himself up and learn to stand and eventually walk. I was looking at this one and a MUCH CHEAPER Fisher Price one. I decided to get this one because many people said the wheels on the Fisher Price model roll too fast. Well so does the Vtech.

The corn is on the red, the apple is on the orange, the pumpkin is on the yellow. This is just idiotic! Also, the volume (as is true of most baby toys) is far too loud and sometimes the phone sound gets stuck and repeats until I turn it off. For all that my eight month old will go and push the buttons and seems interested in it for a few minutes, it just isn't educational. It looks fun, with lots of buttons and things to do, but there are some serious flaws you should consider before purchasing. Frustration free packaging is great!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth the Price","review":"My 7 month old granddaughter has been playing with this toy for 3 months. First, she played while we held her on our laps. Then she moved to playing while laying on her belly. Now she is sitting up and plays with it snapped together. She is starting to investigate pulling herself up on the handle and when we stand her up and help her, she is beginning to push it along. The toy is safe, interesting and really holds her interest. She goes right for it as soon as it's in her sight. Great purchase."},{"rating":"2","title":"My son loves it","review":"My son has been using this since before he learned to pull himself up with it. He's been using it to 'walk' around the apartment and loves it. It has plenty to keep him entertained and hasn't fallen when he uses it for leverage. The only thing I would change about it--the phone that comes with it, there is nothing to keep it attached to the walker and thus the phone is constantly getting lost or stuck under the sofa. the little triangles and squares have a short rope cord (much too short to be any kind of a hazard), that would've served well with the phone. I wish it was either attached or had come with a different feature. Otherwise, it's great. One of the funest walkers I've seen."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Toy!!","review":"We were excited to get this for our baby girl during the black friday sale for christmas. She loves playing with it, our baby girl is 7 months. She can't quite use the walking part yet without being assisted. She's taken a couple of steps but, with me holding her. The walker is very slippery so, need to keep an eye on her. Otherwise very happy with my purchase. The toy can be annoying sometimes with the repetitive sounds and music but, that's most v tech toys."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it!","review":"My son is 9 months old. He got this toy from my in-law's for Christmas and is just having a blast with it! The whole front activity part detaches so your child can just play with it on the floor too, and my son seems to be kept entertained for a while by this part, and he even pushes the whole thing around while walking around on his knees, so it is obviously assisting with teaching him basic motions for his soon to be real steps. The little purple phone is not attached by the way. That is my only complaint. It has become another one of those tiny uesless loose toys lying around the house. I keep digging it out from underneath the couch and trying to keep it with this toy for re-use value later, but other than that, this toy is just really great. I don't find the music or noises annoying, it's simple and cute at the same time, and my son really took to it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Little One Loves It!","review":"This is my daughter's favorite toy. It has really helped her learn to walk. She was walking at 10 months, and is now running at 11 months. I think this is a wonderful learning aid. The lights and music keep her entertained, which in turn makes my life easier!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Baby loved it at first sight!","review":"My baby is 11 months old tommorow. We bought this as a birthday gift but as soon as it arrived we gave it to her. It was easy to put together, even I could handle it and a few snaps later it was ready to roll. As soon as my baby saw it in the box and it started to make noise she threw her hands up and started smiling and dancing. She does not walk yet buy can stand. She did not hesitate at all to stand up with it and walk across the living room! I also love that you can take the face with all the toys off and set it on the floor to play if you want. It is VERY easy to take on and off. My only negative is that the phone has no string or chord to is so I have a feeling that is going to get lost. I get that it may be so there is no choking/strangling danger but the shapes have small curly chords so I wish the phone did too. We are looking forward to a lot more fun with this toy!"},{"rating":"1","title":"less than 1 month and broke!","review":"I got this toy for my niece who is one. It was great at first but in less than one month it broke. She also bought her 4 other v-tech toys for Christmas 50 dollars each they also have broke. BS."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not very Durable!","review":"My 9 month old loves this toy until it broke. He had nothing to do with how it broke. We only had it for 3 days when it stopped working right. The sounds no longer works. When you turn it on it just makes a funny noise and everything lights up. The toy is pretty much a joke and I dont recommend purchasing this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just another junky plastic toy!","review":"I ordered this after reading many good reviews on the product. However, when I received it I was really disappointed. It's just another junky plastic kids toy. It's not sturdy at all. My 8 month old tries to pull up on it to stand and it topples over on him. It's flimsy and wobbly. I don't recommend it unless you are on a severe budget. Invest in something better. I have since ordered the Haba wagon walker. It's made of wood and seems much more sturdy. In fact I've decided to do away with all these junky plastic made in china toys and start buying less toys, but better quality toys (old school wooden ones). I'm sick of all the crappy plastic. Not only does it look cheap, but it is cheap! Cheaply made. I guess you really do get what you pay for.I gave this toy 2 stars because the removable piece does entertain my son somewhat."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great toy, but poorly constructed","review":"My 10 month old son loves this toy, but the reason I only gave it one star is this: The portion of the toy that comes off--the part with all the activities and music does not stay securely on the walker. I can't tell you how many times he has tried to pull himself up and fallen backwards because the stupid panel pops off. I can't have the panel on the walker anymore because of this. One other gripe that probably would not bother most people, but...the woman's accent--she says, \\"Thanks for callin'.\\" when the phone is hung up or \\"Ring a ling the animals sing\\" is obnoxious. It is a thick Long Island accent. I'm sorry to all the Northeastern folks reading this review, but to a Southern Girl the accent is not very melodic and to be honest grates on my last nerve. Sorry!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Vtech toys contain BPA and PVC","review":"I am posting this around other Vtech toys because there are so many!!!: I just received a response from the company that to me is subpar given that these toys are in the mouths and hands of babies and children and contain BPA and PVC. I've read the research on both materials and conclude that I don't want my child to be exposed to either, especially on a daily basis. As these items are made in China and not rigorously tested, I am afraid to know what goes under the radar.

This is perfect. The front panel is removable so he can play with it while sitting on the floor. The phone rattles when you shake it, there are lots of buttons to push and wheels to turn, all with music, numbers, colors, or animal sounds.The best part (one I hadn't thought of): There are wheel locks on the back wheels. With these set, he can pull himself up with the handle, but the walker won't just runaway and make him fall down. However, they don't lock completely, so once he is up, he can still push along. Once he gets his balance, we'll disengage the wheel locks. I couldn't be happier with this!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great toy for beginning walkers","review":"My son really loved this thing.

I tried changing the batteries, thinking that would be it, but no. I am SO disappointed because they really loved it. I'm pretty upset because these toys are supposed to be durable enough to put up with baby use, which can sometimes be a little rough with the button pressing, but literally two weeks into use and it's just another old toy."},{"rating":"1","title":"looks cooler than it actually is...","review":"I got this as a walker for my infant. Didn't realize that it would be so slippery on hard wood floor, so it's actually more of a danger to my child. She's 10 months and I wanted her to practice walking. But then when I read the directions, you're not suppose to use it as an actual walker until age 1 anyways. Even then, I'm not sure if it would be safe because if they grab it to use to stand up or anything, it's very light and would flip and can make the baby fall. But anyways, Up until the age of 1, you're suppose to just play with all the buttons on the front. But my baby doesn't play with the buttons although she likes the detachable phone. That's pretty much the only thing she play with. Maybe it's because I have so many other toys that she can press and make sounds with that she's not interested in this one. Or maybe 10 months is still too young. But so far, my baby's not really interested. :("},{"rating":"1","title":"Stop Working After 5mos of Use","review":"I purchased this for my 5mos Old Son, because I wanted a toy that would be eye level when sitting and also could use when older.

You will have this song stuck in your head for ever with this toy but it brings so much happiness to my daughter. It's become an ongoing joke when it starts talking on its own...kinda possessed at times but fun none the less. The only thing I caution is that you don't have your child play with it mounted to the walker part until they're totally ready to walk as it doesn't have brakes and will slip, even on carpet. We have it up against a wall so she can stand next to it...next stop walking behind it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very fun","review":"Before my son could crawl, he would lay down and look at this and play with the buttons on it. When he was working on walking he would try to stand up and hold this, but it moves too fast for him. He didn't use it until he started walking. So as a fun, musical toy, it's great, but as an aid to learn to walk, which it's marketed for, it's not helpful."},{"rating":"1","title":"not work properly","review":"Product was damaged and had to be returned.

However, when I gave her this walker to try to \\"walk\\" and take steps forward, the walker moved way too quickly and she would have fallen right on her face if I hadn't grabbed the walker and stopped it. There is no way to make the wheels turn slower, and no way to \\"lock\\" the wheels so that the toy can stand stationary. So, I took the musical panel off the wheels and my niece LOVES playing with it. The best thing about the musical panel for my niece is that she doesn't have to have precise motor skills in order to make the toy \\"talk\\" - it plays music and says words with a very light, uncoordinated touch, which is perfect for a baby. I like this product and I look forward to trying it again as a walker once my niece is closer to a year old."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Toy","review":"My one year old has been playing with this toy for the last few months and hasn't bored of it yet.

This STUPID toy is not safe! It is too lightweight which causes it to tip over when baby pulls herself up (she is 9 months old). The wheels have no traction whatsoever, which makes the toy slide and baby fall on her face. Repetitive sounds will drive anyone crazy! Must of all, it is not safe! Bad bad design! NOT designed for baby learning to walk! I wish I could return it, but the packaging comes with so many tapes and wires that you have to tear the box in pieces to take the toy out and try it, probabily to make sure nobody returns it! One of the worst baby products I ever bought!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Dangerous","review":"The wheels roll way too fast both on hard surfaces AND on carpet.

We bought it for my grandson. Assembled it, put in required batteries. SILENCE. Changed batteries. SILENCE. Changed batteries. SILENCE. Can't learn much if it doesn't DO what it's supposed to do! Bought the doll stroller for his twin sister, so they would each have a toy to learn from AND help them walk. They both want her doll stroller! And returning things that don't work to Amazon is a pain AND expensive! If it was MY fault, I would accept responsibility, but when the fault lies with Amazon (or in this case, Vtech), why does the CUSTOMER get stuck with the problem? Other companies step up to the plate and send pre-paid mailers when the error is theirs. Why do Amazon &/or Vtech NOT? At times like this, it truly feels like a rip-off."},{"rating":"1","title":"doenent have breaks!!!!!","review":"I would give this sit to stand walker 5 stars IF it had breaks!!!!

It seems like a durable toy, and has lots of little activities to keep a growing mind learning. Only downside to the toy is that the sounds are not very good. They are semi-distorted sounding. Both my husband and I agree that for this day in age with such great technology that we expected more out of the toy, and feel that it fell short in the sounds. If they can make a little pull toy sound great that is only five to seven dollars, then they should REALLY be able to make this sound good, it being five times as much. All in all, our daughters like it which is what is most important, but we all find the sounds annoying after only a short period of time. I probably wouldn't recommend this toy unless you have listened to it in store, and know you don't mind the cheap quality in sounds."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shoddy","review":"My 9-month-old loves this toy. So why did I give it two stars? First, it is not the safest. He's fallen with it quite a few times because it slides more than it rolls. Second, it is not well-made.

It does have a lot of great interactive options on the front, and he loves pulling the phone off, flipping the gate open and shut, and playing with the shapes. It is a fun toy for him. But a few drawbacks of the toy - 1. the \\"low\\" volume is really not very low. 2. There is not really enough of an angle between the legs of the toy so it's hard for him to pull up on it. 3. When on \\"music\\" mode, each item you touch makes a sound, but if you touch something else, the first sound doesn't stop, and so on. It's hard to learn cause and effect if there are 5 things making noise at the same time and he doesn't know which is which."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for learning to stand & walk","review":"My daughter loves this toy.

The songs overlap so you can't make out a single word or focus on one thing and the face plate falls off easily. The walker is a good concept but the wheels are too fast.

This means that we are constantly losing the phone and it is never attached to the panel. 2) The panel easily falls off of the walker and does so all the time. It should be attached more securely. 3)The back \\"legs\\" look as though they fold down so the toy can be stored or transported, but they do not. If these three issues were fixed, this toy would be perfect. My son enjoys it, but it is a bit of a hassle to deal with these issues."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for Pre-Walkers","review":"I bought this toy based on the reviews about how great it was for pre-walkers and how the wheels didnt move as quickly as other walkers. I didn't find this to be the case. It was way to fast for my 10 month old who is not quite walking on his own. We even tried to rig it up to slow the wheels down and it was so light even without the wheels moving it was just sliding across our laminate flooring. The only place he was able to use it without me holding onto it was out in the grass. The music and lights on it are completely overwhelming for a baby. Each button plays a little song or music and hitting another button just interrupts that and starts a new song. And we wonder why so many kids have problems focusing and paying attention?! I ended up forking out the money for a wooden style one with an adjustable brake and a little seat and he loves that one!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor quality","review":"The play panel worked for the first ten minutes and now freezes every time we turn it on. It's also not very educational as it does not repeat the vocals when the buttons are pressed. Instead either it will make a random comment or music will play. And if it is not touched within a few seconds it will start playing music. There's no chance for kids to learn cause and effect. The only part my daughter likes is to take the phone off the hook."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheaply designed","review":"This toy is pretty great at first sight. My son loved all the flashing lights and opening the little door, turning the knobs, etc. Two weeks after we purchased it, is started to reset and eventuall freeze up.

Wish I could return it still."},{"rating":"2","title":"Buy one from Vtech direct","review":"I ordered this from Amazon January 9th and it was listed as in stock, As of today it is now out of stock and the next shipping date is the end of February. I went to the Vtech website, ordered it for the same price and paid $5.00 shipping and have it now - before our child is walking on her own!!It is lots of fun, well balanced so it does not tip, and entertaining. We are likely to lose the little phone that is not attached but we will try to keep it in place. It is a steady walker for her to push and it turns with ease. It has a lot of activities and music that she enjoys (and runs on just 2 AA batteries). If you want a quiet toy, this may not be it (although you can turn it off).

I love that the wheels have two speeds. Level 1 is for little ones getting comfortable with cruising and learning to walk and level 2 for little ones with a little more confidence. The learning games and music are amusing to my 11 month old son. One of the shapes at the top does not stay in place but that may just be a flaw in our particular walker. It would be nice if the little phone was connected with a short cord like the shapes at the top. It would be much easier to keep up with. All in all...a good buy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not safe","review":"I had to take this away from my son because it would tip over backwards.

Then 11pm, 12am, 1am... you get the idea. We have had the Vtech Sit-to-Stand Learning Walker for since Christmas. His interest is minimal for this toy. I would like to say it's educational but I'm in reality on the fence about that statement. It hardly keeps his attention, and the voice is hard to understand - so how can he really learn? All he cares to do is eat the phone and pull the shapes of the mounts. I thought it was a good toy from the description and design so I requested it as a Christmas present. I can say now after 3-months of use, I don't like it much and wish I had asked for something else."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome for little ones that are learning to walk!","review":"This toy was instrumental in helping my son to walk. He pushed this toy all over the house day and night. The toys on it light up and make noises. There's an educational mode and a music mode. My son's favorite part is the phone. He pretends like he's talking to daddy. This toy is very sturdy. My son has pulled himself up on it numerous times and it's never tipped over. I also noticed that it doesn't seem to go too fast. Other walkers I've seen take off and leave the baby to fall on his face. This one is perfect. I recommend it to everyone.

It quit working after only two months of use from my baby. I called Vtech and they said that they would ship out a new replacement. The only catch, is that I have to pay shipping to mail mine back and have them ship another!!! That is more than the product is worth!!!! REALLY!!???

The wheels are made so they would slip or move a little too fast for children learning to walk, causing them to fall and bust their faces on anything but thick carpet. I was very polite attempting to work out a return with the company - no such luck. I ended up having to deal with a Amazon.com a second time regarding this item, but eventually got a credit.

I figured that this would be a better solution than a wobbly box. He loves this thing and now at 11 months has started talking steps on his own here and there but still loves to whizz around the whole house with this. The activity board on the front keeps him entertained as well., he lovers pressing all the buttons and hearing the sounds and music. The only negative thing is that the activity board clips onto the front and is not very stable and tends to fall off pretty much well every time my son uses the walker. It's not really a big deal, just annoying. All in all, I would still recommend this product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun and Entertainment for Baby!","review":"This toy is great.

I assembled it as per instructions but was dismayed to find that the activity center does not attach at all securely to the main frame. In fact it actually fell off when my 9 month old daughter grabbed the handle on the top of it when standing up from behind the walker.The features seem fine and she was really taken with the bright colours and telephone handset, but the fact that the activity center falls off at the slightest provocation makes it, in my opinion, unsafe.I have sent it straight back and will not be ordering a replacement - looking at the design I can't see how another one will be any different from this one.Such a same when it promised so much more ....."},{"rating":"2","title":"Vtech learning walker","review":"Am I the only person wondering who at Vtech doesn't know corn is yellow, apples are red and pumkins are orange???

My daughters LOVE the toy that comes off the front and still use it every day after having it for over a month. However, the walker is dangerous. There is no resistance and my daughters were always fall as it goes too quickly for a pre-walker. Even on carpet, it's just too fast and my daughters can't handle it. We have tried helping them, but it's difficult bending over that far for that long to help the babies slow down and use the toy. I wish there was some resistance on the wheels so it wouldn't be so dangerous for the babies to use. We kept the front toy off and let the babies play with it, but after several instances of the girls getting hurt while trying to use this toy, I took it apart and packed it away."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Toy","review":"My nine month old loves this toy...hasn't really used it to help walk yet but she stands and plays all the time with it!Good BUY"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Product!","review":"This toy is great at keeping little one entertained!

She has enjoyed playing with it since she was just sitting up and could only play with the front panel.

Now, at a year, she still loves this toy and will even push it from the front. Best toy ever. Warning to parents sensitive to obnoxious toy music: this thing plays on and on and on... just when you think it stops, it will start singing again. There is your fair warning. BUT the kid loves it, so we put up with it. Her favorite is the little door that opens and closes on the front, and the phone.

I consider \\"Ageless, Venemous\\" to be a masterpiece, and I don't think this album tops it or equals it, however it is strong and reaffirms Krisiun as the new standard in death metal. They are paralyzing and have a unique approach to writing riffs; their songs envelope you in a psychotic whirlwind.I give only 4 stars though because the albums seems short, there is too much filler, and the song \\"Murderer\\" seems to me a complete re-hash of the song \\"Ageless Venemous\\"...come on guys, you don't have to repeat ideas so blatantly. Also the lyrics are pretty unoriginal.I am slightly disappointed that they didn't improve upon what they have accomplished thus far, but I still think this band is one of the best in death metal of the last few years.

In addition, One at a Time gives us hope by empowering individuals to facilitate change through simple acts of responsibity and kindness.If every petlover (who in the past purchased a dog or cat) read One at a Time, their next opportunity to obtain a pet would result in a visit to their local shelter. Everyone who has an interest in animals, including breeders, no-kill advoctes, and public officials, will gain a greater understanding of the life saving services shelters provide."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Must-Read for Animal Lovers","review":"Though various parts of this book were extremely emotional and difficult to read, it's a book that anybody who loves animals should read. Like any difficult subject, it would be impossible to write an honest account without including the sad parts. The people who dedicate their lives to saving animals should be commended for the emotionally taxing work that they do. Books like this will hopefully encourage people to think about how their actions either contribute to or help the issue of pet homelessness and neglect.Matilda Mae: The Dog Who Needed a Name"},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply the best performance","review":"In my humble opinion I think this probably is the best 'Four Seasons' recording from all time. Marcon, Carmignola and the Venice Baroque Orchestra handle the score in a magnificient way. Absolutely brilliant, outstanding performance."},{"rating":"2","title":"Refreshing, enlightening - a must have.","review":"These performances are not just passionate and exciting - they are informed by a deep understanding of stylistic performance practices. The performances are beyond flawless - they are thrilling in their enlightenment. There are moment to moment subtleties, and even a hail to the previous Renaissance era (the bird songs are magnificently rendered within Baroque style). If you think you know these works, you are in for an aural surprise!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Bargain priced, but no text. Very basic.","review":"First of all: this book is a bargain. At under ten bucks, you can get maps of world history to refer to. However, there are a few problems: (1) The book offers no text to explain history. So you really need to know the history yourself or have companion books to help; (2) the book emphasizes European state history, and shortchanges other nations, cultural changes, religious movements, migrations, slavery, technologies, etc. This is mostly a book of maps showing the changing territories of nations. //// I was hoping to assign this book to my college Geography students, but will not, nor do I have much use for it myself. I much prefer the other Hammond world historical atlas, even at the higher cost. Most of the new, larger world historical atlasses are superior, becuase they show that history is so much more than states. In sum, this book is a disappointment, useful to a very limited audience."},{"rating":"1","title":"yes, it doesn't sick on !!","review":"I bought it beside all the reviews that it said the same thing I am about to write.. it doesn't sick on enough.

It would otherwise be a great product if the adhesive would only stick! We have a white Graco Lauren crib, and it fit fine - just didn't stay put (not even overnight)! At least Amazon is awesome w/returns (we had even thrown away the packaging)- they emailed me a return label & I'm shipping it back! Gonna try a different crib rail protector - one without adhesive this time. And since she was able to chew under this one, the crib rail paint is all chipped, so I have to cover it up now, anyway! :( Fingers crossed that I find a nice one next time that actually stays in place & works!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Gummi Crib Rail Cover","review":"I have a convertable crib with an extra wide rail and this product fits perfectly.

You are probably better off with something that clips on."},{"rating":"1","title":"OK ONLY FOR CHEAP CRIBS","review":"I CERTAINLY WOULD NOT RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT TO ANYONE WITH A 3-1 CRIB.

I will never buy this product again, or recommend it to a friend."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a good buy for us","review":"This was not a good buy for us. It is totally worthless and I think it made the problem worse. One of our 9 month old twin as soon as it could stand, discovered that the crib rail is a perfect teething toy... After reviewing various products we selected the Kidkusion Gummi Crib Rail. We followed all the instructions for installation but the product does not work. Our kid can just fit his bottom teeth (he only has these 2) between the crib rail and the side of the cushion and continue to scrap the crib rail. And now that the top part of the rail is cushioned, I think he enjoys it even more... So this product does not protect our son from continuing to scrap the crib finish and ingest it. Back to the drawing board and a hunt for another product. I do not recommend this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"These work great, even though they are overpriced.","review":"Excellent product.

I bought the tie on cloth cover for the front rail of the crib, and decided to try to save some money on a cover for the side rails. It didn't even stay on for a day. Money down the drain, since I now have to replace it with a cloth cover."},{"rating":"1","title":"I returned this","review":"After I received this item, I read the box and it said something about how they cannot guarantee the item won't damage your crib finish. I paid a lot for our crib and it's one that will turn into a full size bed some day so I didn't want to risk ruining it. I would like this product if they could figure out an adhesive that won't ruin the finish. Plus, it's HUGE. Unless you want it to overhang the edge of the crib a lot, you should go with the regular sized one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of money","review":"My son was able to chew this product off of the crib railing.

My railing is ruined and now I have to buy an alternate product."},{"rating":"1","title":"ick","review":"Used this on our crib; lasted MAYBE 2 months. It yellowed, pulled off, and stripped the paint off the crib too. DO NOT waste your time or money with this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for All Cribs","review":"I had to give this product a two-star rating because of the false claim that it fits all cribs. We purchased this for our convertible crib, which has a higher back than front and curved, sloping head and footboards connecting them. The problem I ran into is that the Gummi Crib Rail only had a thin line of adhesive on each side of the strip. So far, it works great on the smooth, flat inside of the head and footboards, but it was not able to adhere well to the outside, which had a small lip right where the adhesive is on the gummi strip. After a good half hour of pressing the gummi strip into the crevice with the edge of a pair of scissors, it seemed to be securely attached - for about four days. No amount of heat seems to be enough to reactivate the adhesive. That said, this product may be perfect for cribs with perfectly flat sides. For anything else, you might want to look elsewhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Small, Came Off Right Away","review":"Our crib has a larger than standard, but still not huge, rail, and this product is a little too small for it. Also, within seconds of my son starting the bite the rail the guard came off. He was easily able to get his bottom teeth under it and pull it up, and it would not stick back on because he drooled all over the adhesive."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible Product!","review":"This product is terrible. We put it on our daughter's very expensive crib and it lifted the paint from the rail. Now I have to find a way to fix the crib's paint AND find another rail protector."},{"rating":"1","title":"Might as well glue a foam pool noodle to the crib rail","review":"You might as well glue a foam pool noodle to the crib rail, becuase this thing doesn't stick. Seeing that others have had problems with these not sticking, I figured that they couldn't be manufactured that poorly and that others were maybe not cleaning the rail well enough before applying. I was wrong. These don't stick without the help of your adhesive of choice."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not so good for me!","review":"I think this is a great idea, but I also have run across the problem of the glue not sticking well enough. It seemed OK at first - stuck no problem. Enter my son....who magically turned into a little beaver boy, dug his bottom teeth right under the gummi rail and pried it off - all the way along the inside of his crib. Perhaps even with the best glue in the world he would do this and end up prying the wood off instead. So, I give up and I'm moving onto a fabric cover that ties on instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ineffective","review":"Our 14 month-old had peeled up this rail guard in only a couple days, taking quite a bit of paint with it. Attempts to reattach it with a hair drier were futile. The decision now is weather or not to leave the semi-attached, unsightly cover on or take it off and let the little guy have complete access to the rail again. There must be a better solution."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Product Ever, will RUIN your crib!","review":"I bought this hoping to stop my baby boy from chewing on his side rails....little did I know that it wouldn't stick even though I let it cure for more than 12 hours! When it came off it took most of the paint off of the side rail with it!!!! So I tried it again with a new piece and this time let it set and cure for even longer with vices pressing it down in various places...it STILL didn't stay on and just took more paint with it!!! Seriously do not waste your time with this extremely sub-par product!-a VERY dissatisfied customer!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Product but too wide for my crib","review":"This really seems like it would have worked well had I ordered the right size for my crib. I had originally purchased a crib rail cover from a local store that just slides over the rail,but that was too narrow. I was really excited when I found this one, but when I went to put it on the crib, I found it was too wide. I didn't realize this in time to return it so I guess I'll pass it on to another mom. Even though I couldn't use it, I was pleased with the prompt delivery and the product seems like it is quality."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the best purchase","review":"This crib rail is fairly inflexible, with a poor design in my opinion. The adhesive strips are only on the very sides of the rubber strip. So if you fold the strips over and they don't meet up well with your crib, it does not adhere well. This was the case with our crib, and renders the product fairly useless. Of course, you may not really find this out (at least I did not) until you have cut the rail to size. Although I did not try, this makes it unlikely that a return is feasible.Not impressed."},{"rating":"1","title":"hate it!!!!!!!!!","review":"This looks like it would be nice but after I put it on and waited the time for it to fully stick to the crib it started peeling off the next day... So this product does not work!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I should of listened to other reviewers!","review":"We installed this perfectly as instructed and it came off within a day. I wanted it to work so bad I didn't listen to all the other reviewers...baaaaad!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible product","review":"The glue strips on these are not nearly strong enough to hold these in place. Within 8 hours of application they had all come loose from at least one side of the railing and my crib looked terrible. I ended up using crazy glue to hold them in place (I was desperate as I had a baby beaver gnawing through the crib rails) and that worked for a few months, but now even that is not holding. The product's design flaw (in addition to the useless glue strips) is that the plastic is flat sheet and it's always fighting against being wrapped around the crib rails. It's so stiff that it always wants to lay flat so it never works in the long run. I'm just sad that my $400 dollar crib was basically ruined thanks to these."},{"rating":"1","title":"Absolutely horrible!","review":"Followed directions, step by step and within a hour it fell off and took the paint varnish from the crib with it, Stay away!"},{"rating":"1","title":"would not stick!!","review":"I followed the directions completely and the product popped off the crib the next morning, after being on for only one day. I let the product sit untouched for 10 hours after I applied it, and tried to heat it with the blow dryer like the directions suggest and it would not stay put. Very disappointed!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"So relieved!!","review":"Ok, let me start off by saying I almost did not order at all after reading some of the reviews on this product. Let me just say how pleasantly surprised I was when I tried it out on the crib. It was fast, easy & NO it did not start to come off. When you follow the simple directions, like cleaning first with a little alcohol & making sure it dries down before you start adhering. Just pre cut if you need to, and do small sections at a time & your good to go!! So glad I tried it out for myself!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your time. This does not work.","review":"My daughter has a crib made by Davinci and this did not work at all. I was excited to receive it but my excitement disappeared when it would not adhere to her crib.

I ordered 2 for my standard sized crib. 1 for the long side, and cut the other one in half for the 2 short sides. My child did pull one side off after a month, but the other two sides are still going strong 8 months later."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Idea in Theory","review":"This works pretty well. My son was chewing chunks of wood out of the side rails of his crib, so we bought this. There's not enough to cover both side rails, but he seems to only like to chew one side anyways. He hasn't chewed any more chunks of wood since putting this on and he seems content to chew on this instead. The only negative about this product is that the adhesive is not holding one of the ends down. I let it set for over 8 hours, so that's not the problem. It's only in one section, though. Fortunately, it isn't making it so my son's pulling it all the way off, so I'm overall pleased with this purchase."},{"rating":"2","title":"Problem Solved for Fat Crib Rails","review":"I was not sure what to expect with the Gummi Rail, but I'm glad I gave this product a shot. The installation was a piece of cake and my daughter no longer has varnish in her teeth. Each rail is a roll of rubbery clear material with a peel off adhesive on each edge. (one side only) Our Gardine crib has a really fat rail that the normal plastic sleeves would never go over. We haven't had any problems with it staying on either. I cleaned the rails with rubbing alcohol and put them on right before bed, so they'd have time to set and adhere. I would 100% recommend this product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Product","review":"I ordered this item because my 9 month old son was chewing on the crib rail, causing the paint to chip away. I have been using the gummi crib rail cover for a couple months now and I love it. The adhesive is still intact and I have had no problems with him tearing it off, as of yet. I would recommend this product to anyone that wants to protect their crib from teething babies!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Great concept, poor execution","review":"Wanting to protect our baby's teeth (as well as the crib rail), we purchased this item hoping to solve both problems. One day after installation, the cover is already warping and separating from the crib rail. We tried re-heating the rail (with a hairdryer, as recommended), but it will not stay put. Unfortunately, this will likely end up in the garbage."},{"rating":"1","title":"WASTE OF MONEY","review":"I never wrote a review before...but do not buy this product...It is so not worth it...it will just be trash. Now I have to buy another crib protector. My son is 15 months and as soon as I put the product on...he just pulled it apart with his teeth. So...I redid it with the Lionheart corner kushion doubled sided stickers that very very studry...but he just pulled them apart instantly with teeth again. I think kids thesedays so smart that they will figure things out instantly. I am now considering to purchase the Leacho one.. I think that will be better. Also, this is suppose to be nontoxic...but isn't the sticky glue side toxic when the child pulls it with their teeth???? I'm pretty sure...If you have a child that catches on quickly, do not buy. just buy the fabric one that you can tie to the bed or velcro or whatever."},{"rating":"1","title":"did not stick well","review":"after 24 hours the adhesive still did not adhere to the crib. very disappointed.

Doesn't work at all...","review":"I bought these rails in spite of the fact that they had bad reviews. Lesson learned. I diligently cleaned the crib rails with rubbing alcohol before I applied the rails. I applied them and let them cure overnight. The next morning, the edges were already peeling up.

Well, before the I had even put him in the crib, the gummi was popping up in places. I used heat to try to get it to stick (as suggested). My son wasn'tin his crib for 5 minutes and the thing popped up, enticing him to pull it up even more. When I checked on him he had the \\"sticky\\" part in his mouth.

They stick well and the kids haven't been able to lift the edges. All in all, a good purchase.*update* I needed a third set and bought the thinner cover. I prefer the thinner ones. You don't need the wide ones since they babies are not going to be chewing on the outside of the crib rail, only the inside. They adhere well and my twins haven't been able to pull them off (yet).

It comes in a roll, so you can cut it to whatever size your crib is. I used it on one of the short sides and the front, which is where my baby stared to chew. I used the adhesive like the directions stated, and let it set before I let my baby near it. He used it for about a week before it was off completely. Maybe it's not typical, but he got his bottom teeth under the gummi rail. So finally I took the rest of it off, and with it came the paint off the crib.

It went on smoothly, and stayed on.. for two months. Then it came up at both ends (I'm sure my 15 month old assisted with this process!) and using a blow dryer, like the directions suggested, did not help. After looking around for something else, we went ahead and just bought another one of these about a month ago. It never stayed on, despite the fact that I had cleaned the crib rail pretty thoroughly before applying it. For a couple of weeks, I could get the Gummi rail to stick with the aid of the blow dryer. Now, however, nothing will work. What a waste of money, especially this second time! I am going to try the hard plastic rails next.."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not great","review":"This is very wide.

Mine has been working now and hasn't started to peel at all for at least 2 months now.Here is my advice for installing (which I got from another reviewer here I think), USE A HAIRDRYER WHEN YOU INSTALL!! I slowly and methodically got this thing REALLY hot as I was sticking it to the rail. Be sure to use a towel or glove to protect your hand from the heat.

Followed instructions by cleaning crib rail with rubbing alcohol prior to applying product and let it sit overnight with vice grips to ensure proper application. At first the protector did its job and our baby was happy to have something to chew on. The problem developed as our little one learned he could \\"pick at\\" the protector with his bottom teeth. Slowly but surely, he's managed to peel up the crib rail and the product has been rendered useless at this point. Surprised this hasn't happened with more people. Money down the drain. I wouldn't recommend this product unless you think your baby won't be so determined."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible product, save your money - Does not stick to crib","review":"Purchased this recently to install on my 8 month old daughter's crib. Followed the instructions perfectly and allowed more than ample time to 'set'(about 24 hours without a baby touching it.)I walked into my daughter's room the next morning after install and she had peeled 75% of the gummy crib rail teether off already. Attempts to re-stick it have failed. It's only purpose is entertainment for my daughter as it keeps her occupied trying to pull it off. This hunk of rubber is not worth your money, look elsewhere. Don't take my word for it, just read the other reviews (I should have)*Updated to say that I decided to throw this in the trashcan. When I tried to peel off the only remaining section where the gummy crib rail cover ACTUALLY stuck, it ripped the paint off my daughter's crib."},{"rating":"1","title":"PLEASE don't waste your money!!","review":"This item doesn't stick for more than a few days.

Because of the crib design, we were unable to use one of the cloth covers that strap on over the rail, so this was a nice alternative. Installation took a little time but a hair dryer helped to get those loose corners to stay stuck down. The protector held up nicely over time but approximately 8 months later, when our little girl was over her chewing phase, I started to remove the protector and it was stuck on really good. I worked it off slowly across the crib but as I moved along the protector adhesive also began removing the crib finish with it. Now I have a damaged crib rail and it looks probably no worse than if I had installed nothing and let our girl just chew on the crib. Im very unhappy, please do yourself a favor and do NOT buy this item.

It stuck on well enough, and fit well over the wood of the front of the crib too, but the plastic has a sticky feel to it (even the upright side that isn't supposed to stick to anything). I noticed when putting the baby in the crib, her blanket or clothes would sometimes stick to it. I ended up buying the cloth crib rail guards which look better and can be put in the washing machine. I'd recommend the cloth tie-on rail guards over this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"If you put it on correctly, it works great","review":"The instructions say to wipe down the surface with rubbing alcohol before adhering the gummi rail.

Supported by an \\"invisible\\" band consisting only of drummer and bassist, I missed the old days when he had at his sie people of the caliber of Ian Paice, Bob Daisley, Mo Foster, Neil Murray, Don Airey, etc...He left behind his blues reppertoire and tried to focus on his rocking days. But he used two covers (Shape of Things and Wishing Well), in the midle of a very short set list.All in all, this is not his best video release by a far margin.."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dissapoiting....","review":"Iwas dissapointed watching this DVD. I think the idea of just a basic rock band, with guitar, bass and drums was a good idea, but Gary's mates who are playing bass and drums simply don't care! They are playing like if they were not interested with the show, showing no guts, no energy, no vibe. Maybe they're reflecting the audience's lack of interest. I was shocked by this. They are playing alongside one of the most underrated guitarrists of all time, and apparently don't give a dim about that...Also, Gary's performance is very uneven, maybe because his carrer was always a little bit unfocused and irregular, so the set lilst is a shamble.Gary's physical apperance is also disturbing, but this is not the important thing. He is playing his white guitar apparently in unusual manner, like he, also, don't care about the gig. Very weird."},{"rating":"1","title":"Long Time Fan Dislikes This One","review":"Where to start, Well the playing is excellent but the vocals are horrible. Other than the new songs from his then current disc he forces all of the vocals on this. I was glad to see the older tunes on this release but could of done with out the harsh vocals. I was also not very happy with the length on this DVD. Oh well I'm waiting for the Gary Moore:Live at Montreux 1990 DVD I know that one will be better. Being a fan for over 25 years I can't say to the casual listener to buy this this is for hardcore fans only."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"Being a Gary Moore fan since the late 70's, I was really excited about this release. His playing is sloppy, singing ( or I should say shouting )and bends are out of key, and his rhythm tone sounds like proccessed, Nu-Metal. This dvd is pure rubbish. I don't know what he's been doing recently, but it certainly hasn't been keeping his chops up. I would suggest finding a used copy of the out of print, 1984 Emerald Isles or Live in Stockholm from 1987. This is terrible and it saddens me to write this review on one of my all time favorite guitarist. Don't waste your money.

This is the 3rd one I have read by her and was sooo disappointed that it did not compare with the other 2 mentioned here. It is a lot of boring dialogue in the beginning, seeming to lead to nowhere in the first 100+ pages and you want to scream \\"get going here with something\\" - I am not giving up on her however, as her later books were better and this was only her 2nd book. Maybe she was experimenting or something. I am reading Summer Light next and keeping my fingers crossed!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Blue Moon","review":"Being a dedicated LuAnne Rice reader, this was by far my least favorite of her work. (I own all but her 2 earliest books and have enjoyed each of them.) Blue Moon appears to me to be her attempt to attract a broader range of readers, including those who are looking for more sexual content in their books. Having nothing against sexuality in literature, I just wish Luanne would stick with what she does best and leave the erotica to those authors who are known for that type of work. The sexual scenes involving the 2 teenage girls as well as some of the language used to describe a few of the intimate moments between Cass and Billy were disappointing. I was not only disappointed with the borderline vulgarity, but also felt it distracted from what could have been one of her better stories. In her efforts to include the sexual content, a few of the characters who had so much potential with LuAnne's talent, were just left to die on the vine. I hope this is not an example of LuAnne's \\"New Look\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"I was very disappointed in this book.","review":"I loved Luanne Rice's book Home Fires. This was nothing like it.

I enjoyed this one enough, but it was not a favorite of mine. I felt that she jumped around between the charactors quite frequently, never spending enough time with her strongest lead charactor Cass.

What she didn't say, but was evident, was that he would provide her son with wealth. She calls off the engagement when he decides to send her beloved son to boarding school. When the heroine kissed the hero, she made the most disgusting face, as if she couldn't stomach him. Finally, she accepts the hero's proposal right after she breaks it off with the rich guy.

She turns down several guys because they are obviously not right for her and her son, but the one she finally chooses is the worst of all. It was a very forced story line. The writers could have made her decision make sense, but they chose not to do that. So, she was just left looking like an idiot. The son was cute, and I enjoyed the relationship between him and the next door neighbor. But the mom and the neighbor just didn't have enough chemistry. It was pretty cheesy in the end.

The Sensor 3 blades nick me up more, the Mach 3 again tends to nick me up more as well, and any of the store brand replacement heads for this Sensor just do not work out as well as the original sensor/sensor XL heads. The two blades seem to give me the closest shave without irritation, and after 12 years that alot of shaving.

The ideas do not flow, subject content is not explained very well, there are no summaries, word vocabulary, no chapter test questions, different font styles etc.Just a rubbish choice in another world of college royalties decision and who to make richer. $70 to their pocket when students are struggling and want to learn good knowledge instead of piecemeal and distorted topics.

So if it's crime saga which talks about being weary of the street. Or Red Hook Day thatshows a love for hip-hop and is more upbeat and cheerful.If you value the lyric over the beat or any other crap that some people use to pick there music. You will not be let down.Shabazz has such a passion that is contagious, and it would helpto have some level of literacy to fully enjoy this cd. I appreciate emcees who don't treat there audience like high school drop outs.

You do have to occasionally clean the brushes or it will not work as well. I have several cats so I have to clean the hair out regularly. It is so much easier than getting out a heavy full size sweeper for daily cleaning up. I love it! I have to warn you though, that it is not designed for heavy cleaning or plush carpeting.

Making a strong recovery after the disasterous Night and Day II, an album I still can't figure out but tried, Joe reunites one of the greatest back up bands in music history, and without question, the most talented, creative bass player ever, Graham Maby (yeah I know Bruce Thomas was great too) to put together an album of songs simple in design yet perfectly executed without excess over production.

Jason and many many other similar guitarists - Richie Kotzen, Paul Gilbert, Greg Howe etc etc were playing this kind of thing in the eighties. To say that this is original and a master piece of fret work is an incredibly daft statement especially with the amount of guitarists around during the same era. To be honest people who seriously belive this gut is a master of the guitar, really don't know anything about the genre.

He never played with feel !!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Stop living in the past","review":"I'm sorry but I have to agree with a previous review and say this is outdated. So many guitar players in the Eighties were playing this kind of thing back then, and in 2003 it has to be said that the shred scene is totally boring. Records like this are usually only available on the bootleg market and it should stay that way. I'm sure that if Jason were still playing now, his music would have moved on. Jason was never a guitar God like Vai or Satrioni, he was a duplicator of Van Halen, Vai, Malmsteen and his pal Marty Freedman. Jason was perhaps the last guitar player of his kind to emerge from an era, which any sensible and honest musician would say, is now dead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Get up to date you lot !","review":"This album is boring, uninspiring and well and truly outdated. Jason Becker's fretwork was good during an era that's passed.

For me personally, I would rather listen to something more original, so I understandably regret buying this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Outdated and scrappy.","review":"I find it disappointing that Jason Becker is now releasing these scrappy old recordings from the past. All this CD does for me is dampen the final articles released in their heyday. Perpetual Burn and the Calchophony albums were great albums. But to now release all these old outtakes over a decade later shows signs of desperation.Whether Jason is doing this to keep money coming in, I don't know. But somebody had better tell Jason sooner or later that it is 2003, and the music world has now moved on."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it.","review":"A great album, in many ways.

As far as I can tell this isn't true; my laptop 7-pin output works fine with this cable which is 4-pin to 4-pin.

I shall list the reasons why: it is very soft against the skin like down, it is heavy enough to keep me warm but because it is all natural cotton it allows my body to breathe during the night so I don't get to hot. It is durable and the colors are very rich in hue. I would say the colors shown are true to life but if you like the picture you'll like the blanket more because of the beauty it holds. Must important the size is large enough that you need not worry about srinkage, you'll still beable to tuck it in. My queen size is 90 by 90. I hope this helps you make your decision.

It's as if the people hired to play parts are reading their lines off cue cards.

Many of the actions taken in the film make no rational sense.

This step stool is OK. I was disappointed in two things: the finish, which seems like a cheap looking sprayed on finish (instead of a nice stainless steel) and the \\"feet\\" on the bottom, which are made of a hard plastic instead of soft rubber. I would not want to use them on a wood floor as I think they would scratch...and they don't seem to have the same holding power (i.e. they're more slippery) than the rubber feet you find on most stools and small ladders.Will I return it? No, it's here, I can use it, I'm not going to the trouble.

I like to rotary cut, and machine piece and quilt my projects. I want things done quickly! I also prefer traditional quilts to the more modern style. If your quilting style is similar to mine - or if you're just getting started in the quilting world and looking for a style - you'll enjoy this book. Nancy J. Martin is my favorite writer on quilting. The quilts are beautiful, the instructions are clear and concise, AND there are color pictures of each quilt (that's my favorite part). The quilts are rated according to difficulty (but none are really THAT hard to make). The beginning of the book has a nice \\"basics\\" section and the book ends with a short section on finishing methods. I've got so many new ideas for quilts now - i'm off to the fabric store! Great book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I LOVE THIS BOOK!!!","review":"Why love this book??? COLOR photographs of EVERY quilt. Each pattern is even rated for difficulty.

This is their first album since leaving Chicago and moving to the Southwest. The change is noticeable in the fact that they seemed to have gone back to simpler melodies and arrangements.Subject mater is still vitage stuff from this brilliant duo. Overall, it seems like an old fashioned Handsome Family album. Gets better with every listen. My current favorite is the haunting, \\"A Shadow Underneath.\\" If you are already a fan, you won't be let down."},{"rating":"2","title":"Jane Eyre-The Musical","review":"This is an excellent musical! Having seen it on Broadway twice (before it's abrupt end), I would rate it in the same category as Les Miserables! The lyric and theme are inspirational and uplifting in spite of the dark themes of the story. Every song is a \\"hit\\" in my estimation. However, the cream of the crop is \\"Brave Enough for Love.\\" By the way, the original Broadway cast, which are featured on this CD, were excellent ... especially Jane, Mr. Rochester and the character played my Mary Stout (she was the housekeeper - sorry, can't remember her name)."},{"rating":"1","title":"no passion","review":"well recorded, but all over rather flat. James Barbour (mr Rochester) who has a powerful wonderful and deep rich voice, but use's it with no passion or colour, I have seen him recording \\"secret soul\\" on you tube, and this shows that while he sings with this demanding song with ease, his face shows no emotion or involvment with the song , and this evident across this recording. Marla Schaffel (Jane Eyre) gives a fine performance , but can sound a little strained in the higher notes,all in all if you collect musical shows then it is ok, but over all I don't really recommend it. spend your money on the 2006 recording of \\"Company\\" with Raul Esparza. a master class in how to do it."},{"rating":"1","title":"I wanted so much to like this...","review":"I wanted to like 'Jane Eyre', because it was the epitome of the Little Musical That Could, in that we'd been hearing that it would come for years, and then it was the underdog in the box office its entire run. However, I just do not like it. I think that the problem with 'Jane Eyre' is the same problem with 'Martin Guerre' and most of Frank Wildhorn's music- they're trying to be 'Les Miz' or 'Phantom' (not a lofty goal), and falling just short, and instead the lyrics and score just seem very lost and jumbled, not sure where its going.However, something does have to be said for Marla Schaffel's performance- she does a good job as Jane, and her voice is beautiful. Still, it's not enough to save the show."},{"rating":"1","title":"This Jane Eyre--- errs.","review":"This is a fabulously lush orchestrated and sung piece of bubblegum. I think Charlotte Bronte, the cast, and the audience deserve a much more lyrical piece. This hodge-podge of contemporary styles has been packaged well--- however it is not cohesive, and therefore it is a HUGE disappointment. Great voices, great orchestrations, great musical direction--- really poor score. I can understand WHY it's having trouble--- and after years of finetuning, it is still fatally flawed and unlike Rochester, this musical can not be redeemed even by such a fabulous Jane Eyre. This Jane Eyre--- errs, and I am left with why?"},{"rating":"1","title":"not so hot","review":"One might expect from such an epic story a beautiful and imagionative score... I know I did. But I feel that the show was a quick shot at a hit (a shot that failed). I do make it a point that when ever I purchase a new cast recording to sit and listen to the entire album, reading along with the libretto, as to better understand the plot. And though I tried to \\"get into it,\\" I find the score to be simplistic and repetative, though there are a few songs that are catching. The lyrics are not at all comparitive in quality or sophistocation to the classic novel, as one could only hope for in the musical adaptation. In fact, the lyrics are quite childish-I've heard better music in badly-scripted children's theatre plays. I would not discourage you from buying the recording; I am still glad that I have added it to my collection, it's just not my favorite. Not at all."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awe-struck.","review":"Totally Amazing. Marla's and James's voices fit their parts exactly. There are several parts left out of the cd,including the break up of the wedding. Sirens, wow, what a song! This whole cd, the composition, the lyrics...and definitely the voices are very well done! There may be some gaps in the cd, but when you read a newspaper, you look at the black, not the white. It's amazing! Especially for Eyreheads...but sophisticated, study-the-book-Janeians will love it too. I can find nothing wrong with it musically, except possibly the absence of some points. But if those points were included it would be too overwhelmingly good! Buy it, it will be the best [money] you'll EVER spend!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful, Teriffic, Fabulous, Incredible.. need I say more?","review":"After reading \\"Jane Eyre\\" this year in 8th grade, I became completely obsessed with every aspect of the story. The novel itself captured the hopeless romantic part of me, as did the videos(which also satisfied my typical lazy-movie-watching-teenager side, might I add...) However, the music lover in me wanted in on the excitement as well. That's where this CD comes into play. I borrowed my teacher's copy, slipped it into my CD player, hit \\"play\\" and was completely swept away. All the songs are beautiful, and fit the story nearly to perfection. The booklett, with all the lyrics and whatnot was great, too, despite the fact that the costume sketches on the inside, great as they were, scared me a bit at first... I recommend this CD very highly to anyone!!!PS: I'd like to personally kick the person(who will remain unnamed) who said \\"Painting Her Portrait? Isn't that the song where what's-her-name gasps like a half-spent fish?\\" You are SO WRONG!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Ho-humming on Broadway","review":"There's some nice voices, but not a fresh idea, in this Broadway CD. What's good is echoes of better shows (although the live musical is a solid \\"B,\\" it's not because of the score), what's immemorable is most of it. How can shows like \\"Wild Party' or \\"Passion,\\" with genuinely gorgeous, push-the-envelope songs, close swiftly, while this dour show, with a lot of plaintive songs that don't sound half-bad but do all sound a lot alike, gets a big theatre? It's just not interesting work, here. Jane Eyre: as a CD, it's a great book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yawn......","review":"Jane Eyre is a very pretentious show. It masquerades as a deeply, emotional, brilliant show but under the over exaggerated orchestrations, gaudy costumes and sets there all that remains is a show that wishes it was more like Les Miserables but does not suceed. The melodies are repeated over and over so that the songs just blend into each other (with the exception of the excellent \\"Painting my Portrait\\") The portrayals are very stagnant with the exception of Marla Schaffel. Everyone but her portray their roles in ways that have been done before. Jane Eyre is not a piece of art. It is a disgrace to the broadway musical."},{"rating":"1","title":"worst score ever , well maybe one of them","review":"there is so much competition for this honor . dreary , slow , laden ,saccrine , mind-numbing , ernest ,sophomoric ,predictable ,and everything else the theater is NOT supposed to be .this poor replica of sondheim , with a big brit musical overlay is anathema to american musicals . the legions of eyerheads need to go back ,to say, sondheims 'assassins' or la chuisas 'wild party'to see what the current theater is going ."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not every love story should be made into a musical","review":"Jane Eyre is a fine novel , but it should have never been musicalized.

Just thought I'd warn you!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Lush, beautiful musical","review":"The Original Broadway Cast recording of Jane Eyre is a beautiful score.Paul Gordon's music is lush and epical in the way that the Bronte novel is. \\"Forgiveness\\" is beautiful song that conveys an essential theme to this work. \\"In the Light of the Virgin Morning\\" sung by Elizabeth DeGrazia and Maria Schaffel convery two different points of view that contrast well. And Mrs. Fairfax' \\"Perfectly Nice\\" is amusing and lively. I can't wait until the show goes on tour."},{"rating":"2","title":"WONDERFUL MUSICAL CD!","review":"After seeing the commercial for the Broadway musical on tv, I went out and bought this CD.It is one of the best musicals I have ever heard! I love Broadway musicals and this one definitely tops my list! Marla Schaffel and James Barbour have such amazing voices as well as the rest of the cast. I am fortunate to live in NYC and I have seen the Broadway show twice already and seeing it live on stage is even better! They both are so convincing as Jane and Rochester! (My sister and I were even lucky enough to meet the handsome James Borbour!). If you are in the city, please see the show! I can't say enough about the CD but it is one you'll be listening to for years to come. If you love the story of Jane and Rochester, you'll feel the love between them in this CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lovely score, faithful to the novel","review":"I purposely did not buy this CD until after I had seen the show on the matinee of November 18th in New York. I wanted a fresh perspective on the musical, because I have loved the book by Charlotte Bronte since childhood, and have re-read it many times. The show and Paul Gordon's musical score are lushly beautiful, and the lyrics are faithful to the emotions of the characters in the novel, which appealed to me greatly. I especially loved the fact that the composer was brave enough to include Jane Eyre's Christian faith in the songs (i.e. \\"Forgiveness\\"). I also was wowed by the song \\"Painting My Portrait\\" which Marla delivered so magnificently it almost brought the house down! I encourage all romantics to see this show, and to buy the CD. Broadway needs more gorgeous, warm, and wholesome musicals like Jane Eyre."},{"rating":"2","title":"Should Have Ran Longer, Excellent!!!","review":"Jane Eyre is a case in which audiences let the show down. This was a terrific musical, true to the book, covers all of it well, the music is lovely and doesn't slow the plot down, but enhances it. The performances are magnificent, particularly Barbour and Schaffel as Rochester and Jane, respectively, and the show was dazzling visually. The critics gave it favorable reviews, it was nominated for several Tony awards. The only thing it lacked was an audience. It simply never took off at the box office. I guess it didn't have enough Disney effects or pop music to draw the crowds. A real shame when a wonderful adaptation of one of the greatest works of literature in the English language is not successful.The CD is a must have for theater buffs, it really is a marvelous score, highly enjoyable."},{"rating":"1","title":"where is my cable?","review":"I have not received my order.

The quality was great and nothing like what some of the other reviews said, I was a bit nervous thinking I was going to end up with a snowy coaxial quality picture or something. This cable however, was just as clean and crisp as any s-video cable I've used. I'm not going to doubt some of the less pleased reviewers though. A lot of companies in all industries have certain inconsistencies with their products. Some cables come out great fine, another batch is terrible...fine. This mentality sucks and I certainly hope that's not the case here, if so make sure to let the company know to send you another cable from a \\"good\\" batch and don't let them inconvenience you with shipping the old cable back if you can."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good price and good deal","review":"This is an amazing price for this length of S-Video.

I am a bit of a werewolf nut and thought this book would be an interesting read even though the monster was not a werewolf. Boy was I wrong. Mr. Huggins has no concept of what character development is. He fills this gaping hole in his writing ability by subjecting us to superfluous drivel on both the hero's and the villian's superhuman abilities. The book was also chock full of typographical errors, incomplete sentences, and contradictions. Mr. Huggins has taken an interesting concept and rendered it almost unreadable. This was my first read by Mr. Huggins and I can assure you it will be my last!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Looking for action? Look no further...","review":"After reading Cain -- my first book by this author, I was anxious to read another. Hunter is a pretty good book, but not as good as Cain, but then Cain would be hard to top. Hunter has plenty of action, a good story, and a drop of romance. I even enjoyed Hunter's pet, the wolf. If you can suspend belief for a short while, take a look at this book. You won't be disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"'can't put it down' non-stop action!","review":"This is an outstanding thriller which grabs you from the first page and never lets you go! The characters are especially well-drawn and you immediately care about them all. Of course, my favorite was Ghost, the wolf! Hunter is an extraordinary hero and the ending is very fitting and a real allegory. Great read. Recommend it highly!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Outstanding","review":"The action, suspense and human interest was great. I loved the twists and turns. With books that is soo hardhitting and action packed I am not a fan of throwing in a romantic spin with a strong woman character.It wasn't a BIG romantic spin and did not take away from the adrenaline filled story but I was like \\"Oh come on, quit it.\\"Even though I'm a female I did not want to read that. Also hated that he did not have his wolf by his side anymore. Hated it very much. I seriously would have rather seen him giving up his romance than his wolf,seriously.Anyway all in all an excellent book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great quick heart pounding read","review":"If you like action, military fiction, firearms, wilderness survival and a diverse group of characters hunting (or perhaps being hunted by?) a monster not matched by anything else in the animal kingdom you need to read this book.Yes the corrupt governmental group is clichéd, yes it's fairly simple good vs. evil plot but the unique combat, inclusion of tracking and interesting backstory combine with the things I mentioned above to create a nice thrilling quick novel you can read over and over again to get your action fix."},{"rating":"2","title":"non stop action","review":"I loved this book and hope a sequel will follow. The characters seemed real. Well almost real. The concept of a creature taken on all that firepower kept me reading and reading.If you like a story where men are men and women are women and monsters are monsters this book is for you. The only problem I had with this story was that after many of the characters incurred serious injuries they were still able to continue the fight as if they did not have the injury. In other words what ever action they wanted to take they were able to do it throughout the story.The bottom line read this book you will love it."},{"rating":"1","title":"OK but not the best","review":"I admit I liked the book enough to finish it but I did have some complaints on the way. The dialog is so lame and the way Hunter is charactorized is just a bit over the top to believe. And the plot is a mix of Dean R Koontz's Watchers and Predator. This book is good for a distraction but definatly not the kick--- book others say it is."},{"rating":"1","title":"A bit of a cartoon - Incredible Hulk maybe?","review":"No other villan I have read about has absorbed as much lead and lived. Some of the minor charactors are enjoyable and Huggins prose is easy to read - it was just tiresome to read about somthing taking 30+ hits from a Barrett sniper rifle and asking for more. I also found myself saying \\"Shoot the thing in the head.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Exciting action adventure, but needs technical help","review":"This is one of the most exciting stories I've read all year. A great yarn about an incredible hunter tracking a deadly creature created in a molecular biology lab. I wish the author hadn't tried to through in some technical jargon he really didn't understand(like the basics of evolution and, at times, confusing what electron microscropy and electrophoresis can do-a pretty serious error for those of us who have worked in molecular biology). However, if you ignore these clumsy excursions into science, it's just plain and simply a great yarn."},{"rating":"1","title":"Evolutionary materialism from a Christian author?","review":"There is no doubt, Huggins is an exciting author. As a Christian, I have enjoyed Nightbriger and Sorceror as fantasy thrillers and Rora as historical fiction. I am disappointed that Huggins has written a book so deeply imbued with evolutionary materialism. It seems quite inconsistent with his other books and I hope this doesn't mean he is losing his talent to 'the dark side.' If this is an attempt to appeal to a wider audience, it probably works but Christians beware. . . this book does no glory to God."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed after waiting months for book's release.","review":"I was so disappointed with this book. Why Mr. Huggins thought he had to stoop to profanity and sex to sell his books I don't know. I've bought and read all of this author's other books (The Wolf Story, Leviathan, The Reckoning, and Cain) and couldn't put them down. But Hunter was different. I did like Hunter the man and his wolf. The story plot was good. But the profanity totally threw me off. I don't like or enjoy hearing profanity, nor do I like reading it. Please Mr. Huggins, write the kind of books we've come to trust you for! Get rid of whoever's telling you that you have to add moral decay to a story to sell it. Thank you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Goodguy vs. Monster","review":"Very entertaining. I have read it twice so far and loved it.

This was a very enjoyable read. I love a book with action and this one had plenty. The story was compelling enough to keep you turning the pages. Recommend."},{"rating":"2","title":"Huggins' moral compromise is a serious dissapointment...","review":"I am very disappointed with Huggins work on this novel. His other books worked perfectly fine without resorting to profanity and illicit sex that served no purpose in the storyline. While Hunter is a very entertaining book it is far inferior to his previous work. If you are a fan of Huggins work it is probably worth reading, but most of his Christian fans should be prepared to be offended. \\"Leviathan\\" was a far superior book. Now it seems like Mr. Huggins is trying way too hard to impress his newfound Hollywood pals. Shame on him!"},{"rating":"2","title":"One great read!!","review":"I just finished reading this book and it was awesome, compelling and suspenseful with just the right amount of non-stop action. The characters were well drawn out and you start to care for them to the point where it was so disappointing when they were killed. What can you say about Hunter...I liked him and his wolf. I'd love for Mr Huggins to bring him back again in another novel. This was the firt time I read this author so now I'm going to go back and read his others. I recommend this book to any action fan. I really don't think you'll be disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"ACTION, ACTION, AND MORE ACTION!","review":"Hunter is the first novel I have read by author James Byron Huggins. It was a fast read that jumps off the page like a movie more than anything I have read since Michael Crichton's Jurassic Park (which made it to a movie) or Robert McCammon's The Wolf's Hour (which like Hunter cries out to be developed by Hollywood).The characters in Hunter are solid. The settings are well done. The pace is like a roller coaster. And the monster is well...a monster!The only real problems that this novel has are that 565 pages is a bit much for a simple action novel. And yes, sometimes there is such a thing as TOO much action (which is why we went from 5 stars to 4).Still, if you're a fan of action and horror and prefer to stick to a more \\"pop\\" style of writing then HUNTER is a great place to start."},{"rating":"1","title":"Truly Terrible Writing","review":"The story is extremely derivative - monster on the loose, military can't handle it, mysterious loner battles against all odds, government conspiracy. The whole thing comes across like 'Aliens' transposed to the Alaskan wilderness. But it's not so much the lazy plotting that offends me, it's the truly terrible writing. The prose is not only packed full of unnecessary adjectives and adverbs, but uses the same handful over and over and over again. EVERY character is repeatedly described as muscular. EVERY confrontation between wolf and beast is described with the improbable phrase 'fang to fang'. Time and again, words are used with only the faintest understanding of their meaning. The experience of reading this book is one that passes from boredom to frustration very quickly. The only reason that I don't give it just 1-star is that it's infinitely better written than crap by the likes of Edward Lee and David Wellington."},{"rating":"1","title":"How did he get it published?","review":"The author has obviously researched the art of tracking. The details are facinating and informative. It appears however, that he did not research anything else, except perhaps to watch the worst Hollywood trash in search of cliche characters to go with his wildly improbable plot and laughably inaccurate scenes. Altogether this is the most completely contrived piece of.... I have run across in years."},{"rating":"1","title":"a waste of paper.","review":"bad writing, ludicrous and pretentious plot, suspect ideology... This book has it all.

Character development is minimal to non-existent. Plot development is linear, shallow, repetitious, uninspired and often disjointed. The author continuously falls back on one tired cliché after another to support the plot. This book was actually painful to read most of the time. If it had not been for some long flights, long layovers, and only one book in my briefcase, this would have hit the trash after a few chapters. I actually did make it to the conclusion of this work, and the only positive comment I have is that the author was consistent. The best thing about this book is the hope it offers to aspiring authors. If this can get published . . . . My advice, pass this one over and move to the next book in your list."},{"rating":"2","title":"RANKS UP THERE WITH LEVIATHON","review":"THIS BOOK COULD NOT BE PUT DOWN.

Even if it is black & white you will feel like you are there. The action is good paced with a group of paratroopers going from a quick in and out destroy a radio station mission to a drawn out survival mission walking back to friendly territory. The DVD includes a short movie on Tailgunners with Burgess Meredith and Ronald Reagan and another about Tanks with Paul Tobias.

Most of the big hits are here, but they're kind of diluted by some forgettable and newer stuff. Sorry, guys, your heyday was the 80s and early 90s. Also, the order in which the songs were put on the disc somehow doesn't seem quite right. This is a good disc for 80s heavy metal fans, but it won't blow you away. The 4 star rating is mainly thanks to the quality of the individual good songs. After all, it can't be denied that the Crue were leaders of 80s metal and put out some of the most monster hits of that time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic Band, Not Bad Compilation","review":"Although it could be better, Motley Crue's second compilation contains most of their best songs, and biggest hits. Although it should have included more from Too Fast for Love and at least one song from Motley Crue '94, it still provides a great listening experience. The two new songs, Bitter Pill and Enslaved are both catchy, grunge-ish rockers. It contains FIVE (yes, five songs) from the #1 1989 album Dr Feelgood, including the Top Ten hits Without You and Dr Feelgood. Although it could have been better, this compilation includes some of the best songs from hair metal's finest."},{"rating":"1","title":"Re-Mastered in 1998 or 2003?

So, which is correct and how did this get two different release dates??? The 1998 release I received was in excellent condition and arrived as described (punch hole in the bar code back cover art). The audio quality for this RE-MASTER is horrific!!! It's close to sub par analog quality. I paid almost $20.00 for a USED cd, because these cd's are out of print. Yes, the songs are awesome but the quality of sound for a Re-Master is non-existent. I assume this is why it was forced to shut down at the manufacturing plant.

Released in 1998, Motley Crue's greatest hits is a great compilation album for any die-hard Crue fan. On the album you'll find hits such as: Kickstart My Heart, Dr. Feelgood, and Smokin' In The Boys Room. If your into the heavier Crue stuff, you'll find hits such as Too Fast For Love, Looks That Kill, and Shout At The Devil! If your looking for a good variety of Motley Crue songs on a single album, then Motley Crue: Greatest Hits is the album for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Many Hits","review":"Motley Crue, like many of their contemporaries, such as Poison and Scorpions, seemingly had only a few \\"hits.\\" This greatest hits collection has only a handful of recognizable tracks.

I know so many friends who are such huge fans of this band and I can't figure out why anybody would want to listen to these guys because their music is so dull. Motley Crue is the kind of band where you can just take their record and just throw it in the garbage. The only reason why these guys got back together is because they needed the quick cash to pay off their debts. To their credit, at least they still have some fans left who will pay top dollar to see them perform live."},{"rating":"1","title":"People who buys this album probally should get permanent brain damage......","review":"I could honestly say, that the time this band was concieved, I did not like them at all, that was grade school people. But dumbfounded me decided back in I think it was 87 or 88, whatever it was bought Girls, Girls, Girls, boy what a let down that was I must say. I had a friend that idoled them, and I could not handle it, I had to put him out of his misery, just kidding, but I sure let him have it many times over. I just can't get into Vince Neil, nor the walking disease Tommy Lee, they both nausaete me too death with their perversions. And as far as the music goes, just pure garbage, fresh from the pile of leftovers from the cruddy hair band 80's.

But if not, and your a new fan looking for a greatest hits collection, please! go for Red White and Crue, it has way more songs only for a little more. Besides this disc is missing some of the most essential tracks from the crue like Live Wire and All in the name of..., Anarchy In the U.K., Piece of your action, Too Young to fall in love, and without you. Besides Red White and Crue has all of the missing tracks of this disc, and 90 percent of the good new songs of this cd."},{"rating":"1","title":"a big let down","review":"Ok I bought this cd because Shout At The Devil was sold out. I thought all of Motley Crue's music sounded like the songs on Shout At The Devil. Man was I wrong! I guess the problem is that I'm not a fan of thier music after the first two albums. Out of 17 songs the only song that stands out in my mind is \\"Looks That Kill\\". The worst songs on this cd, I think, are: Enslaved; Girls, Girls, Girls; Same Ol' Situation; Afraid; Don't Go Away Mad (Just Gow Away); Smokin' In The Boys Room; Too Fast For Love; Shout At The Devil '97; and Without You. Another thing I didn;t like was the fact that there wasn't many songs that featured Mick Mars, but i like guitar solos....

Thirdly, the axe is so sharp (I keep it sharp with the Fiskars sharpener tool) it cuts great and I dont need to hit the wood soooooo many times.I have been very pleased with this little beauty, and have to say that others have looked on and expressed desire to own, or even just have a go with it, kinda like I expect the reactions would be if I owned a Ferrari.In fact I think that just about sums up my review, this axe is the Ferrari of axes, but much more cost efficient!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This AXE is Awesome","review":"I have limited axe experience but I can tell you that chopping away at limbs and wood is generally better to do with a chainsaw well that is until I ran into this. This axe cuts like nothing else and so long as you cut in a \\"V\\" pattern its a lot less like work and almost like fun as this axe cuts deeply and easily. Now yes I still recommend a chainsaw for the major cuts but this axes is almost as efficient for limb removing and cuts through 6 inch wood in 6-8 blows (basswood), no he-man strength required.This axe requires safey to be in mind to use but seems to hit the same place over and over with little effort and than handle left no blisters on my hands after chopping away for a sold two hours helping some ditressed friends.I liked this axe so much Im going to buy a second one just to have around. I cant imagin any way to improve how this axe works, just remember to not bash the sharp blade into dirt or rock and it will simply work."},{"rating":"1","title":"The blade is easily damaged","review":"It has a very sharp blade and easily split my wood.

I previously had one of these axes and it lasted for years; until it mistakenly got thrown in the camp fire with the log it was wedged into.

It cuts thru an oak tree like it's made of balsa wood and you never have to worry about the handle splintering."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not like any other I've used","review":"I can't speak to longevity at this point, but this is by far the most pleasant axe I have ever used. You cannot believe that an axe that feels as light as this would cut as well as it does. You would also think that a hollow \\"plastic\\" handled axe would have a lot of reverberation in the handle and it does not. It feels light in the swing and solid in the hit. To me that makes it feel safer as well.I've loved my Stihl chainsaw but felling a tree by muscle is certainly gratifying. I'll be using the axe more frequently. If it lasts, I'll bump my rating up to a 5."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's no Estwing","review":"The bottom Line is, the handle is fabulous, The head Suxs...It's far to thick for any serious chopping and it just doesn't hold an edge well.

This is a great collection overall but I wish Universal Music could have added more tracks to the CD since most tracks from the 50s are usually under 3 minutes.

The plot worked; typical Fowler. The characters, however, have begun to grate. I searched in vain for a non-disfunctional personality in the book. Gabe and Elvia came the closest, but Gabe is playing the same role in each book now, like a sitcom. Elvia at least was allowed to move forward, but this isn't Elvia's series. Benni bounced around with the usual mix of stubborn/stupid/doormat/smartmouth--it's getting old. And I felt preached at. The heroine is a Baptist, fine. But, I don't buy these books because I want to read Christian fiction, and Arkansas Traveler moved in that direction. Bottom Line: I started skimming a third of the way through, and ended by only reading the pages that contained Emory's name. Emory and Elvia have taken over, are the most interesting, and our hero and heroine no longer appeal.

The engaging, affectionate descriptions of local color were more than outweighed by the preachy, moralizing sections that read like a poor movie of the week. Not only the characters of the ministers in this book offered sermons; the book read as if the author filled in set characters to prop up the message. Subtlety has never been Fowler's forte, but this book belabors the obvious repeatedly. How Benni uncovers the clue that leads to the solution of the mystery rings false, although in general the plot works. Her continuing characters saved this book from being tossed aside less than half way through."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worthwhile though not exhaustive","review":"Someone who wanted a strong and exhaustive overview of ofshibori told me that he was disappointed by this book, as it is fairlylimited in scope.

None of this makes any sense so far.Finally, we get two girls together in an alley, rubbing ice on eachother and then making out. I'm thinking that maybe it's finally getting interesting. WRONG. Next, we've got a couple of girls in fur coats drinking and making out. I'm thinking that Stuart Canterbury must have been drinking when he \\"wrote\\" this.The last scene shows a tattooed girl dancing in fron of a mirror. She removes her clothing while she's dancing. It sounds more exciting than it actually is. Don't waste your money on this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent","review":"Love these sponges. They're are extremely soft and feel good on my face. Haven't washed any yet but I love the fact that you can throw them in the washing machine. Well worth the money.Update 4/15/07Have washed 2 sponges in washing machine and am pleased that they came out just fine. No difference in texture. One sponge was stained with my makeup but since I only use them for putting on my tinted moisturizer it doesn't bother me. Washed sponges with regular load of clothes so I don't know if that makes a difference or not. The other sponge I washed came out almost totally pink all over but to be fair I hadn't used that sponge as long as the first one. The important thing is that they were definitely clean."},{"rating":"2","title":"Laura Mercier Sponges","review":"I like these much better than the little sponge that comes in the compact.

However, I ALWAYS return to these regardless of how many other other sponge options may be floating around my make-up area. There seems to be something magical [ok that may be a bit over the top] about the way these little guys blend foundation, mineral [AKA powder] foundations, concealer, BB cream, even sunscreen. I use them for each phase of my morning routine in order to create a consistent finish and to smooth or buff out and unevenness in coverage. No matter how sloppy my initial application, these sponges are effective in resolving my mistakes. They can be used moist or dry. BONUS, if you are gentle in means of washing and drying they will last quite a while."},{"rating":"2","title":"Inspiring","review":"Those not familiar to Seraphim Rose will discover in this book a modern ascetic monk who shone with the ancient tradition of Orthodoxy.

Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"lecture transcript","review":"This is a short book, but very poignant for our time. It records a guest lecture given at UC Santa Cruz about 20 years ago.

Then this is the book for you. Although printed for 2nd edition AD&D, this book is still your best source for more modern adventuring. The book does need to be converted for d20, but any good DM should be able to do that. Furthermore, if you wanted to adventure in the 1800's, this is the closest publication yet to that time frame. Simply update the firearms, and much of the work is done.Still, the problem with the historical sourcebooks of AD&D is that they like to hinder your characters with kits that HURT your PC, with no compensation. Furthermore, they do not open avenues for more fantasical elements. STill, this is a good book."},{"rating":"2","title":"A \\"MUST HAVE\\" BLUES GUITAR ALBUM!!","review":"This is a \\"must have\\" album for blues guitar fans or anyone who loves really great music - the guitar work is just spectacular! As an added bonus, Billy's songwriting is advanced and quite compelling, well beyond the typical 1 - 4 - 5 chord changes. This also requires a lot more of a vocalist and Thompson is up to that challenge as well. It all comes back to the guitar playing though, and every song is an opportunity for Thompson to display his considerable talent and marvelous tone. Frankly, I would have preferred a hotter, more compressed mix on the drums and the mastering doesn't measure up to the songwriting, singing and guitar work, but i still give it five stars without any hesitation!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Well...","review":"It gets the job done, but it's prickly on the face.

I've seen it referred to as \\"the hypochondriac's bible\\" before, I suppose because you can find so many symptoms and diseases inside. While it is true that you can search the manual online at no cost, reading from the screen gets pretty tiring and I believe it is well worthwhile to own a hardcopy. More comprehensive than the home edition, the crinkly ultra-thin pages of this book are packed with useful medical information (it really is a lot more than simply a catalog of symptoms and diseases). The Merck Manual has a longstanding tradition as a tremendously valuable resource, and it is an excellent bargain. I believe the 18th edition is due to come out in April 2006."},{"rating":"2","title":"Huge Help!","review":"This book has been wonderful!

It is a great resource for information that is difficult to find in other general medical text. A word of warning, this edition is written for the medical professional. If you are a layperson, the text is written using medical terminology and you will need a few resources, including a great medical dictionary to understand many of the sections, especially etiology, pathophysiology, etc. There is a layperson's version of this manual called \\"The Merck Manual of Medical Information.\\"Physicians, nurses and pharmacist will appreciate the thoroughness of the subjects addressed.

The first time I heard this I listened to it every night thereafter. Amiel touches on some folk, bossanova, 60's. The album is dreamy. Track 6 \\"change of heart\\" puts me in the best uplifting mood. Track 9 \\"Simply Suited\\", has a great story line. The way Amiel puts the music to match the lyrics is wonderful, the lyrics are.. yes... \\"suited\\".Bring this cd to the park, sit back relax, contemplate...cause that's what i'll make you do, takes you away to another cloud.

It can be that this approach will work, though not with the students who have the real problems, but it does NOT TEACH students how to control their behavior. It does not teach students anything except how to receive rewards and how to avoid punishments. Better to read some research on classroom management, Alfie Kohn, or Love and Logic. I believe what we need to do is help our students make better choices. I don't think this approach does that. Read lots of things and decide for yourself."},{"rating":"1","title":"I disliked this book.","review":"The authors encourage the reader to utilize methods which \\"control\\" the child rather than prepare children for thinking critically and developing their own sense of self-reliance and responsibility. Methods such as this one only prepare children to be great followers rather than critical thinkers and problem solvers. By following the guidelines that these authors suggest, parents will raise children who are very skilled at predicting the wishes of others and obtaining extrinsic rewards. The child will never have the chance to develop his/her own sense of self.

Only a serious student of the subject would desire more details, but the aim of the book is to interest and entertain the casual reader, while presenting an accurate un-tangling of the complicated causes and course of this old story. The Wars of the Roses is sure to be a favorite nonfiction title of any fan of historical fiction. Not since the release of \\"Through a Distant Mirror\\" has a popular nonfiction title succesfully presented the peculiar politics, pageantry and magnificence of the end of the medieval era. A must-read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful Book","review":"Loved this book, if you love history, you will love this well-researched and thorough book.

She did a good job portraying events in English history that I've always found quite interesting. Thanks to her book, I've learned a lot of truth about a period in history that's filled with the stuff of legend. In my high school class we read either Shakespeare's \\"Richard II\\" or \\"Richard III.\\" I went on to read all the \\"Henry\\" plays on my own before I stumbled upon a true nonfictional, historical account of what was going on in those plays. Anyone who's read the history plays by Shakespeare should consider taking Alison Weir's book home to develop a better understanding of the great playwright's work."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Telling of a Dreary Story","review":"Many of Weir's books read as though she has cobbled together unused index cards from previous histories. \\"Wars of the Roses\\" is better---it is a cogent and fairly lively account of a confusing, low point in English history. A good general history of the \\"wars\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"A fascinating story","review":"Alison Weir writes history from the point of view of the participants. The characters are real people making fallible decisions that affect the very course of western history. Their personality traits, strengths, and weaknesses make for a fascinating and riveting tale of honor, corruption, greed, and loyalty. The fact that what she writes is historical fact becomes the icing on the cake.Ms Weir has an extraordinary talent for bringing history to life. So much so that this book will be enjoyed simply as a story, regardless of the history lesson it so richly serves up.I highly recommend this book for anyone who is even slightly interested in the history of the western world."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Official History","review":"Weir's book is pretty much the the conventional accepted history. The kind of thing you would have learned in the UK 30 yrs ago for \\"O\\" and \\"A\\" Levels in School. The characters are conventional sterotypes, there is little reference to recent more interesting scholarship, and a lack of undertsnding of just how different pre-modern dynastic families saw the world. It does do a good job on sorting out the event but there is so much more that could have been said that could really have brought this to life. To get a feel for the period try the (admittedly partisan) \\"Bosworth: The Psychology of a Battle\\" by Micheal Jones."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very entertaining!","review":"I was tied to it. Read it very quick and will read it a second time. Good writing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Other places to start","review":"As a general outline of the period, the book is tolerable (not even Ms. Weir can get dates wrong). Ms. Weir's noted biases and haphazard use of \\"facts\\" would cause me to look elsewhere for a book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor History","review":"Alison Weir continues to spout the Tudor propaganda, even in the face of evidence that it was the Tudors who kept this war going, and that it was the Tudors that killed the Princes (even after evidence that their mother wrote to her cousin telling her of a visit to see the boys AFTER Richard III was dead). Some people believe what they want, but Historians should seek out the answers, not simply regurgitate what others have writen before them. She constantly ignores evidence that shows the good side of the Yorkists, and the rather brutish side of the Tudors.Not recomended to anyone wishing to learn the truth. Two thumbs way down. Heck, read Daughter of Time for a less fictional tale."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yet another stinker by Mr. Stinky","review":"Sorry Bone fans. I'm a fan. Got the Bone stuff, the Bizzy stuff, the Krayzie, and unfortunately, the Layzie stuff. This album along with Bone Brothers really puts Layzie in a bad light as a rapper. This album is completely wack. I don't know, it's like when Layzie is not with the rest of the group, he has too many verses to fill and he just stinks the place up. I do not recommend this to any one including die hard Bone fans. If you want to hear Layzie, just listen to a Bone album. You may end up disliking Layzie if you listen to this album for too long. He's good, just not solo."},{"rating":"2","title":"Layzie Bone/L-Burna B**ch","review":"This album is very good and i cant believe some people r giving album below 4 stars which is f**ked up cause they probably listen to pop which is sad.

Go out and buy this or buy it from here at amazon.com u wont be disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Get it","review":"Of all the Bone side projects, this one is probably the best; it's not as pussified as any Bizzy or Flesh discs, and not as experimental as Krayzie's, but all of the songs are decent. It's pretty hard music, and some of the beats are a little crowded, but they're all decent, and none of the songs are too soft to stand. It's a little monotonous (most songs have the same general vibe) but it works."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I thought.....","review":"Now dont get me wrong, I love Bone Thugs n Harmony but this album is not what I thought it would be. It,s good for poeple who like those different types of beats. But for hardcore BONE fans (like me) this CD will let you down. The Bizzy Bone CD is better than this. It also has a better rating.

L-Burna, no hard feelings, but TRY AGAIN."},{"rating":"2","title":"Layzie Bone Is The Greatest","review":"This cd is worth the money um u cant go wrong buying this highly recommended.He is not the best member of bone thugs but he holds his own on this one.

I like Bizzy Bone, but his voice kinda sounds like someone scraping a chalkboard with their fingernails. He seems to whine too much in his songs. But he is still good. Layzie Bone album is hot. It was not promoted or advertised in the way that it should, and that's why this kinda got slept on by many people. It's one great album."},{"rating":"1","title":"2 to 2.5 stars","review":"I bought this album knowing that it would be Layzie Bone. The second best bone member, and all the other bone cd's where tight so i thought this one would be good too. Even though he didnt work with bone on it. I was so wrong with this. At the very most there were 2 good songs on the whole cd. The lyrics werent anything what i thought they would be and just the over all tracks really made me made. I have listened to this cd a few times since i have purchased it, but thats about all.

Im not really a fan of bizzy bone, hes ok but doesnt compare to krayzie and layzie. Layzie here gives us some of the Bone Thug sound we'd expect but also throws in things you would not hear on a bone thug cd, and does a good job. Tracks like Make My Day and Connectin' The Plots with tha underrated WC i think are really ill. He also throws at us things which we COULD hear on a bone thugs cd like As The Rain which is another hot track and Still The Greatest. Basically every song on this cd you can say its between ok and real good, no song leaves you saying..what is this?? and thats good. This cd is above average, one thing i would have liked to seen was an appearance by krayzie bone but what are ya gonna do?"},{"rating":"1","title":"L-Burna...Who The Hell Is That!!!!!!!!!!","review":"First of all his name is Lazy Bone, not L-Burna, why do all the rappers these days change there names, no one will even know who they are any more, Lazy was good in bone thugs, he is good in this to, but if he would just keep the name lazy bone it would be even betterL-Burna?

To tell you the truth he got 4 songs that could beat some of these weak artists whole album now thats sick. Ball is one of the realist mc in the game."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply the best","review":"Lost is another landmark album that Eightball has dropped. With his southern drawl, perfect lyrics, and graphic storytelling, this album is definitely a classic. Eightball has been putting it town for years with his equally talented partner MJG. To Amazon.com, for your statement about Eightball being upstaged by his featured guests, I definitely think you should listen again. And another thing, Eightball's rhyming skills are anything but average. Eightball has enjoyed praise by critics like The Source Magazine who have featured his lyrics as one of their famed hip hop quotables. He's simply the best."},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic of Hip-Hop","review":"This is the greatest rap album I've ever heard and I strongly believe it. And yes I realize those are strong words, but believe me I know what I'm sayin'. Be sure to pick this one up, I guarantee you'll be Lost on Eightball's smooth and visionary story telling.

I mean let's face it, this is a soft semi-rugged bag, which means it was made for keeping in your posession. You can't check it or it would be destroyed, so if you can't check it and you can't carry it on, what are you supposed to do with it?If it wasn't for this fact, the bag seems OK. But it's such a critical flaw that I can't recommend it to anyone, and Amazon is getting mine back."},{"rating":"2","title":"wondering","review":"i dont know if this is the band that i heard when i was a kid, or not if you would put the song list on here, you would probably sell one or 2. post the song list!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I was glad to find it","review":"we bought this because it was the very first movie that my 92 yr old mother ever saw. It was really fun to watch it together.CD came in good time and plays just fine."},{"rating":"2","title":"great block, great value!","review":"We purchased two of these (yeah, between the husband and I, we've got a few knives) and couldn't be happier. This is a sturdy and well-made knife block, esthetically pleasing as well. Our knives seat well in the slots without a lot of wiggle room but they're also easy to remove. Dear Husband has a touch of arthritis, but even on a bad day has no trouble getting fingers around the handles of paring knives in the top level - plenty of room there. A neat feature - the slot for the steel is open-ended to accomodate one that's longer than the block (as most steels would be). I like this block every bit as much as any of the more expensive models I've seen and would recommend it highly as a fabulous vaule!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very high quality and efficient knife block","review":"This block was a gift for my daughter. She needed one and loved it, all of her many kitchen knives and steak knives had their own drawer. It is well made and good quality wood. I would have given it 5 stars, except that it is a little expensive. On the other hand, I paid half as much for a different type and would rather have spent more on this model. It is excellent."},{"rating":"2","title":"Solid as a rock","review":"This drawer insert is very solid and fits the drawer nicely. I really like the fact that my knives are handy, but out of the way."},{"rating":"2","title":"versatile","review":"I wasn't even aware when I purchased the shears that they adjusted to clipping directions. Happy surprise- work well! Only issue I've discovered has to do with the nut that keeps the tension correct. Came off & was lost early on. Replaced it with another, but now that one requires watching. Don't like that in tools, but for the price & versatility, I can handle it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely wonderful!","review":"For a small yard, it is wonderful. The company, hired by my complex, misses a lot of spots which I have to cut and trim myself. I'm elderly and unable to bend well so this clippers does the job for me very well with a minimum of work. Many thanks!"},{"rating":"1","title":"fine but broke after a few months of light use","review":"I was pretty satisfied with it for a few months, trimming grass every other week in a small yard. Then recently I noticed that the nut cap holding the entire assembly kept coming loose, rendering the whole shears unusable. I tried to tightened as much as I could, but it would continue to fall off until it disappeared all together. Seems like this is due to some design flaw, as I have not had this problem with other shears in the past."},{"rating":"2","title":"Shocking and heartbreaking","review":"This is a shocking, heartbreaking account of how one of our 'sacred cows'- the prescription drug industry- is really a corrupt breeding ground for low-end criminals and petty corruption. But at its core, and what makes the book such a great read, are the human stories- the stories of the victimized, and the stories of the five investigators who fight at all costs to expose what is happening. Well researched and highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Research","review":"This is a well researched book (really well) and uses easy to understand language. It was a bit confusing to me in the beginning since he used some flashback type story telling. I was hoping to pull some powerful statistics out of this book, but was only to get some weak ones. This a a great book to have if you like having evidence that the U.S. Government is no saviour."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Rip Off Ever.","review":"First let me say that the merchant gave excellent service and answered my inquiry as to the figures.As to the product, this is one of the worst rip off's ever. 54 figures means that you get the same group of figures three times. I wouldn't spend more than a dollar or two on the item. What do you need three Lenin's or three Stalin's for ? If you are thinking of buying, contact me and I can sell you one of the three duplicates I have."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bruce","review":"Works great.recommended by person who refinished our floors. Looks like new every time we clean. Sometimes it's a bit slippery"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best product we know of","review":"We have a tried a number of products to clean and polish our hardwood floors, but Bruce is easily the best. It gets up most grime and leaves a nice finish. This half gallon refill is a terrific bargain, at least when selling at half off as it was in May 2012."},{"rating":"1","title":"Toxic, better to make your own!","review":"I looked up the ingredients in this after using it and feeling weird and light-headed afterward. The MSDS warned against breathing the vapors and recommended wearing \\"Suitable protective equipment\\". It contains 2-butoxyethanol which is a carcinogena and damages the adrenals.For MUCH LESS money you can make your own floor cleaner using equal parts of rubbing alcohol, vinegar, and water. It works JUST AS WELL. Add some essential oil if you want it scented."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great product, bad price","review":"The product is actually wonderful; I use it all the time, but one of the previous reviewers is right. It is twice as expensive as Lowe's. I gave it one star on its price, but I would give it five stars on its quality."},{"rating":"1","title":"rip off","review":"LOVE the product. HATE that it's double the price than would you could get at Home Depot or Lowes. Total rip off."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bringing back that old school hip-hop","review":"Granted this album isn't as good as Mad Blunted or Dj Kicks, but I love it nonetheless. It certainly doesn't deserve the dogging other reviewers gave it, unless you despise hip-hop for some sick reason. Only reason it doesn't get 5 stars is because not all the tracks are strong...best joints are by far \\"I Love Hip-Hop,\\" and \\"Success.\\" Cam is, unlike some djs, tasteful with his scratches, and knows when they're best used. It has that old hip-party party flavor; put it on when you're out or having some friends over and want to get hyped."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cam can do better","review":"I bought this CD after i purchased cam's mad blunted jazz. needless to say i am very dissappointed. Cam doesn't show his full potential in this album, and it is a very lack luster cd compared to his others. cam's a genious and all, but this album doesn't show it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing effort from a hip-hop genius","review":"Having already purchased the previous two DJ Cam albums \\"Substances\\" and \\"Underground Vibes\\" my expectations for this album were high.However when I finally got to hear it,it was largely a dissapointing and frustrating experience,Cam gives us glimpses of his talents on tracks like \\"I Love Hip-Hop\\" and the collaboration with Channel Live \\"Broadcasting Live\\",but for the rest of the album he loses sight of what it is he does best which is making top class hip-hop.Most of his experimenting on this LP falls short of his usually high standards,his forray into speed-garage being a prime example.Overall I am sorry to say that this album comes over as a stale and lacklustre effort from a man with real talent.If you want to check out the true Cam sound I suggest you check out \\"Substances\\" or \\"Undergerground Vibes\\" both true Cam classics.

Its terrible just regular rap hip hop with only one or two songs recieving the cam touch! very dissapionted with this cd!"},{"rating":"1","title":"This Is a Rap Album: BLAH","review":"Having been spoiled by first hearing DJ Cam's awesome \\"Mad Blunted Jazz,\\" album this CD was complete disappointment. Although you can hear traces of DJ Cam's skill in the background, horrible rap vocals destroy the whole mood. This CD is a loser."},{"rating":"1","title":"A sad excuse for a POH","review":"This would be an alright book for a person who's never seen the plane to get familiar with it, but that's about it. There is no tech info, no performance data. It attempts to cover about 30 years of piper cherokee/warrior performance and updates while being as vague as possible. Its sold at many FBO's as a replacement for the POH-sad, because it lacks any of the tech info that you'll need to complete even a short VFR flight plan. If you want a couple nice pictures, and a description of how to do a preflight of a generic \\"cherokee\\" this is your book. If you are looking for a personal POH, keep looking."}]`),O={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:D},data(){return{visibleCount:6,poemsData:C,isLoading:!1}},computed:{visiblePoems(){return this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(o=>setTimeout(o,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=6,this.isLoading=!1}}},x={class:"card-container"},M=["disabled"],N={key:0},B={key:1};function H(o,e,n,u,r,s){const c=w("PoemCard");return a(),i("section",null,[e[1]||(e[1]=t("div",{class:"top-banner"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🎉 Your SNAP 🥳")])],-1)),t("div",x,[(a(!0),i(y,null,f(s.visiblePoems,(h,g)=>(a(),p(c,{key:g,poem:h},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),s.hasMorePoems?(a(),i("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",disabled:r.isLoading,onClick:e[0]||(e[0]=(...h)=>s.loadMore&&s.loadMore(...h))},[r.isLoading?(a(),i("span",B,"Loading...")):(a(),i("span",N,"See more"))],8,M)):b("",!0)])}const W=d(O,[["render",H],["__scopeId","data-v-c5041a2a"]]),L=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"sponsor/42.md","filePath":"sponsor/42.md"}'),R={name:"sponsor/42.md"},G=Object.assign(R,{setup(o){return(e,n)=>(a(),i("div",null,[v(W)]))}});export{L as __pageData,G as default};
