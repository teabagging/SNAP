In this year of appalling, highly-publicized child abductions, the lesson couldn't be any clearer: children should be instructed to view street people as dangerous until proven otherwise.

Expect frequent plugs for the AOS (American Orchid Society). This book has the same \\"pretty picture and overly general advice\\" formula that you can get in every other book for beginning orchid owners (or better yet, for free, on the web). I prefer Cullina's book in general, and something like Botanica's orchids as a reference for more species-specific care guidelines. In the end, I think its pretty unreasonable to make sweeping care recommendations about orchid genera, which often have 1,000+ species from a wide variety of habitats. But, I suppose this book is just as good as any other beginner guide- though others may be cheaper, and the web is cheaper (and better) still."},{"rating":"2","title":"Complete Guide to Orchids","review":"The product arrived as avertised.

When they make a highlights cd, they usually take a double cd, or in this case triple, and make a single cd containing the best songs. However when their are so many different albums of les miz to choose from; why would they pick the one with the worst cast? I do not understand. This cd is not good at all for several reasons: the cast is bad, there are not many songs at all (only 17 out of zillions of other cool songs from les mis), and finally this cd gives you no idea of what les mis is about. Buy this cd for one reason: you are poor and cannot afford a double or triple cd version."},{"rating":"1","title":"(Hestitation...)","review":"This is the second album I heard on Les Mis, after hearing the Broadway Cast Recording.

This is to avoid any bias it may cause.) I haven't noticed that all the remarks I made at the time correspones so much to the real world's critics until I started reading literatures on Les Mis.

The book is a random compilation of marketing ideas and tidbits that will work for some financial advisors but most of these ideas are basic common sense (marketing and sales 101).From an organizational standpoint this book is poorly written with no real main point or theme.If you are an advisor learning to grow your practice there are several other books more worthwhile; put this one at the bottom of the list."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Holster","review":"Bought this for a Smith model 19 with 4\\" barrel.

I had used a roof rake when I lived in Minneapolis but could not find one at the nearest hardware store in Maryland. I tried to order one from another vendor but he would have to back order until mid march - the snow would \\"hopefully\\" be gone by then. Amazon was able to ship it within a few days. The order was delayed because of a 2nd snow storm that hit the region but we had the rake before the weekend.My husband and I took turns pulling the snow down from the roof. The snow was extremely heavy due to the depth and melt/refreeze that had occurred. The extended handles were a bit flimsy but the rake was light enough to allow the repeated lifts and pulls needed to get the snow down. Eventually, we got the lowest roof segment cleared and could see water running from an upper roof. The handle was too short to reach the higher roof but we were still happy with the results."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice to have on hand","review":"If you only use it once, when needed, this one does the job.

Spending $50 is a lot cheaper than worrying about ice dams."},{"rating":"2","title":"Durable and dependable roof rake","review":"Bought this all aluminum roof rake back in 2008. I can see this lasting several years if not a lifetime. Now if you use the rake as a hammer to chip off the ice on the roof, that's another story. Anyway there is nothing to crack or get brittle like a plastic rake so I leave this outside all winter long. I'm not sure if there is anything lighter than this rake when fully extended at 16' but I believe its a good combination of weight and strength."},{"rating":"2","title":"We love the Jumpitz!","review":"This is an awesome singing/acting group from San Diego.

I guess I will be waiting for awhile."},{"rating":"1","title":"Life's too short for this book.","review":"Ian Frazier is a good writer--let's get that straight. The downfall of this book is not how he writes but what he writes about. I wasn't bored out of my mind reading this book, but it just didn't do anything for me. I like to read books that move me and this book had a cruising speed of 0-1 mph. This book is a generational playback/story about his family. I often thought how amazing it was that the author could write in a way to sound like he was speaking to the reader and to keep me (just barely) reading on to the next page. This was sllooowwww reading and I thought, \\"with all the books out there, I am just wasting my time reading about something I really couldn't care less about. There was nothing too fascinating about his family story. (At least to the point where I finally quit---about 1/2 way) I would never ever recommend this book. I would recommend sitting comatose in front of the tv watching really bad sitcoms over reading this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"My favorite, my absolute favorite","review":"I've been thinking about this, and I've decided this is my favorite book, at least my favorite that I have read in the past 5 or 10 years.It's pretty hard to say why, but let me give it a shot: the way his writing conveys his affection for his near family and his ancestors without losing his sense of humour about them. (Ian Frazier started out as a humor writer.) His beautiful descriptions of the countryside he travels through, country you might otherwise think was much worth looking at. His wonderful details about his family history make you feel like everyone's family is important.Since I first read this book, I have developed a true genealogy fixation, trying to recapture the feeling Frazier invokes in this wonderful book. I wish he would write more."},{"rating":"2","title":"Family, History, Love, God, Emotions...................","review":"Frazier is surely one of the greatest writers of nonfiction in America today. How wonderfully he clothes the skeleton of the family tree. How wonderful his originality and his lack of trite expressions.But how unprepared I was for Chapter 18! The intensity of family involvement and grief and joy and disappointment and the ultimate confrontation with our relationship to God or not - this chapter fills in the emotions for the ancestral skeleton and the general mystery of life that has existed throughout history. It is the history of us all. Thanks, Ian."},{"rating":"2","title":"The \\"Bible\\" of Clinical Pharmacy","review":"I can understand how this reference book may seem overwhelming for a pharmacy student. It has a lot of information! But believe me now that I am a practicing pharmacist this book is my #1 source of clincal information. I have the DiPiro book but did not like the layout as much. When you are in a hospital setting, most of your questions from residents, fellows or attendings will be case-based related. And the Koda-Kimble reference is outlined as such. It's a great reference, just wish it comes in a more practical size so I can take it to work with me :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great souce for pharmacy students!!!","review":"I got the Koda-Kimble book in January and I have used it so much already. It makes looking for information on projects and assignments so easy. Plus, its just helpful in cases when you can't remember something and want to look it up quickly. I highly recommend purchasing this book for any pharmacy student, especially if you're about to go on rotations. Much of the information comes from guidelines."},{"rating":"2","title":"4.5 stars for poor portability","review":"I rate it 4.5 stars only because this book is way too big to carry to class--it's like putting a baby in your backpack. On top of the syllabi you have to lug around, the weight is ridiculous. In terms of the actual content, it's an excellent desktop resource. All drugs are organized by disease state. Literally, the drug Bible (tissue paper pages and all). I recommend it for at home/pharmacy use only, otherwise you might need a forklift."},{"rating":"2","title":"Applied Therapeutics - Koda-Kimble","review":"Excellent book!

It's too heavy for Gabby to carry comfortably in her little mouth and hard for her to grip.Of course, you could say this is the buyer's fault for buying too large of a toy. True. However, we did have a smaller version that worked much better, but was eventually destroyed by Gabby and her two cousins.

I have to say that my dog loved the ball right out of the box. But within a mere 10 minutes he was able to chew large pieces off of it. How disappointing.

If you want Warner Brothers to release the older and funniest looney tunes (red riding hood etc) then buy the golden collection. I have background sources on this folks.

The Looney Tunes Golden Collection 4-disc DVD set is also a \\"grab bag,\\" containing the shorts here and 28 more. The difference is that the Golden DVD has hours of special features and bonus cartoons.

But there probably aren't enough Christmas songs by actual New Wave performers to fill a CD, so they had to stretch the definition a bit. Regardless of all that, this is an enjoyable Christmas CD. Any CD that features the great \\"Fairytale of New York\\" (my sister's favorite Christmas song) is worth purchasing. There are also great contributions by XTC, the Pretenders, Captain Sensible, They Might Be Giants and others. But not everything is great, alas. \\"Xmas at K-Mart\\" is pretty bad, in my opinion.

In this tragic story of aborted childhoods and destroyed dreams, your heart will break for the family of seven-year-old victim Roxanne Doll, and also for that of her killer, Richard Clark, who's own sense of self and human bonding was forever stilled at an early age. Broken Doll is undoubtedly Barer's best true crime book to date, and the best of the genre this year. I strongly urge every reader of true crime to order BROKEN DOLL."},{"rating":"2","title":"Broken Doll is a heartbreaker.","review":"This powerful story will break your heart...not only for the little victim and her family, but for everyone involved in this tragic story. This is another \\"must read\\" from Burl Barer, America's master of investigative true crime journalism. I suggest every fan of true crime read this book, and everyone who wondered how criminals such as Richard Clark are raised, not born. Burl Barer consistently takes us behind the headlines to reveal more than what we would learn from newspapers or television, plus he always gives us his analysis of the case in his \\"final remarks.\\" Barer is my favorite non-fiction author, and this is one reason why."},{"rating":"2","title":"book review","review":"I knew this sweet little girl, such a sad story and it is depicted very well.

They work as you would expect, but the inside usable dimensions are: 14mm wide x 40mm long. That isn't a lot of space if you have numerous cords to bind together, or if the cords are particularly thick. I needed to use three of them to organize the cables behind my computer desk.

I bought it with the hopes that it would have more information than it does about sustainabilty, seed-saving, and practicle tips for gardening in different climates. Well, it falls short on those points. There is some useful info, here, but the lack of a table of contents or index of any kind is a little bit annoying. Also, the veggies that are included and those that are not never fail to surprise me. For example, 'cowpea' and 'tomatillo' are missing, along with all kinds of common peppers, but 'chicory' and 'dandelion' are included. So, I rate this one as useful and surprising, but not user-friendly or reliable."},{"rating":"2","title":"To honor a great artist..","review":"This DVD is a good document gathering several materials related to the great artist Jacqueline Du Pré. It succeeds on transmitting what this remarcable cellist and great person meant to everybody on her time, and how she should be followed today as a reference on how to face life and its tragedies with joy, despite the enormous difficulties one can suffer... On the second chapter, we can see how an affected Jacqueline could give a fresh, honest answer to a very harsh (very english) questionaire with remarcable dignity...

Instead of real character study, we get bits and pieces. there is no thread to really connect these women except that they were all rich and/or famous. the author did not attempt to really get at the heart of her characters so we are left with magazine articles. This book is a complete waste of time. We learn little and what there is to learn about these intelligent and independent women is fluff. Very disappointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"History Lesson falls short","review":"This book sounded great but I am sad to say I found it to read like a history book.

Many of the women I did not know and it was often 2 or three pages before Brenner directly stated what the women's claim to fame was - the previous text discussed how they manipulated men, went shopping, were coy or cute, etc. The only chapter that actually focuses on the woman's accomplishment (versus her prowess with man, fashion, or dining) is chapter 2 (Motley) and early on Brenner laments the fact that Motely would only focus on her career accomplishments. Brenner did manage to slip in the sentence that before a big court appearance Motely did get a fashionable outfit at Lord and Taylor. The whole tone of the book was degrading to women and did nothing to elevate these women through their accomplishments."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Dames grates on nerves","review":"I couldn't wait to read about these famous and semi-famous women. Ms. Brenner's choice of personalities is strange. Most of them were dames, all right, but hardly great. The study of these women has absolutely no depth. Most of the women's quotations are mundane phrases, useless in learning more about them. The writing is high-school level...I wondered throughout where the editor was."},{"rating":"1","title":"A disappointment","review":"I am still struggling with this book because I whole-heartedly agree with 'A Reader' in US about how they 'distinguished themselves by their dishonesty,willingness to sleep their way to the top, ability to take other women's husbands and extraordinary self-centeredness.' While I enjoyed Kitty Carlisle Hart and Constance Baker Motley, I shake my head as I read about the others. Please don't excuse their behavior because 'it was a different time'. Integrity is integrity and while some of these women accomplished some wonderful things, their journeys are not to be celebrated. Rather, here is how NOT to be a great dame."},{"rating":"1","title":"Interesting...not great","review":"Great Dames profiles the lives of ten prominant women who emerged during a time when women were not thought to have much influence. With the exception of Constance Baker Motley ,Kitty Carlisle Hart and her own mother, these women seem to excelled in marrying well, sleeping with the right person and being born into socially or politically connected families.

Pages that wouldn't lie flat were a definite frustration for our grandson.

Thanksabsolutely a masterpiece Reviewer: A music fan from New York October 4, 1999 Stephin Merritt has once again proven himself perhaps the greatest (and most consistent and prolific) pop songwriter of the decade. There are just too many great songs between the three albums to list, suffice to say that out of 69 songs, at least 2 dozen are destined to become classic. As always, his songs are almost impossibly clever, cruel & catchy as hell. 69LS is a consolidation of all of SM's songwriting strengths; over the course of nearly three(!) hours of music he varies the moods, styles, tempos & instrumentation without sacrificing coherence. Even the throwaways (and there are far fewer than you might think) grow on you...

The fact that it is so darn good is beyond words. I first heard of this c.d. from a friend who loves synthy pop stuff, not my cup of tea.

How could I do that to myself for so long.This is seriously one of my favorite records and I do not say that often (read my other reiviews).

Unlike the delightfully amusing story books, Click, Clack Quackity-Quack is a basic concept book comprised of a sturdy board book and an attached \\"keyboard.\\" Kids can push the letters on the keyboard, and each one creates a unique sound that (usually) ties in with the matching page in the book. The book contains a simple story that leads children through the alphabet.I think this book is fantastic for toddlers or young preschoolers who are just learning the alphabet or who are obsessed with letters, like my 2-year-old is. The story is basic and is centered more around letters and their sounds than around any major plot, but that's okay with the little ones.

What makes the songs so good is, although she doesn't get credit for it that much, she has a great singing voice.The songs on Something to Remember are classics! Unlike The Immaculate Collection, these songs are more ballads than rock. Songs like, \\"I'll Remember\\" and the title track, \\"Something to Remember\\" are some of the most beautiful songs!

Well, dare I say it, that's the POINT ... that's exactly what hard SciFi devotees have been starved of for decades, stories with a solid scientific base, which explore fringe possibilities, serving to expand the mind and inspire creative thought! To me, Baxter is like a modern-day Jules Verne or H.G. Wells, and his writing is a welcome return to foundational Science Fiction as it should be written.

Since he is always on the go and often forgets to take care of his own needs, this pill organizer could literally be a life-saver for him.On Sunday evening, he looks at his meds list and sets them all up.

In just the \\"Morning\\" section, it can easily hold a large calcium tab, a large fish oil capsule, an extra large potassium tablet, as well as three other pills. Everything fits, yet the item is so compact it doesn't take up a lot of space. The only (minor) complaint is that the first time I opened the plastic tops they were a little hard to open. But once I got them all open, the hinges loosened and they all open and shut easily now. This is really a convenient product!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Just what I wanted.","review":"I had looked everywhere for this set of pill boxes and so pleased when I found the set on Amazon.

I have 30 days to decide if I should return this harp, and I must spend that time trying to find someone nearby who can fix the sharpening levers at a reasonable price.

I'm in the process of replacing dozens of them that were originally installed on my kitchen and bath cabinets. The problem is that the closing spring pressure is applied via a plastic part that tends to break, and then your cabinet doors stand open instead of closing.The 38N / 39C models are much more robust, with a metal spring, and they are a direct replacement - no drilling new holes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not one of Blum's better products","review":"There is only one small piece on this hinge that is plastic, but unfortunately it will eventually break. The cabinet may continue to work (more or less), but until the defective hinge is replaced the cabinet will make snapping and popping noises each time it is opened or closed.

I felt the ending was too quick and forced to really build the suspense necessary to make the book as fascinating as it could have been. Some of the characters were developed partially, but not as far as needed because I wasn't truly concerned about the fate of any of the population. I was actually almost offended by the suggestion that this could hold any sort of light next to King's or Koontz's work. It's a nice brain candy read, but nothing more.

It not that Strnad's Risen is a poor book, it is because it emulates and honours too closely the works of King and Koontz who have saturated shelves with such outings.

Many anecdotal stories are offered as evidence as well as several studies in the book. The writing style is easy to follow and held my attention. Rigorous testing of this will be as interesting to follow.The one negative note I had was the footnoting used. There is no specific footnoting per se but rather a generalized system for each chapter at the back of the book. In the chapters you won't find alphanumeric footnote marks to correlate the passages to the references. I did search the internet for the references and found many of the ones available online but it was a lot of work to make the correlations myself."},{"rating":"1","title":"I dont get it...","review":"If games and movies make kids violent then why is it only areall problem in the America? Here in holland its (almost, taps a woodblock...) impossible for a kid to start a shooting in a school, why? We got gun control, getting a gun for a kid is pretty hard. We got a diffrent attitude then the americans, im not how to explain this but if it wasnt then we would have the same problems as in the states.And wasnt playing \\"cowboy and indian\\" in your youth violent as well? Or was that \\"diffrent\\" and if it was \\"diffrent\\" why would it be \\"diffrent\\"? Both are based on killing other poeple, both arent reall, both are done by kids.So please poeple stop blaming videogames, movies and god knows what else."},{"rating":"1","title":"save us from stupid people","review":"It is scary how quickly bad parents embrace the latest \\"craze\\" as a scapegoat for their parenting mistakes. You pay your kids no attention, keep guns in the house (unlocked, and easily accessable) and promote the \\"traditional\\" values of God, war and racism, and when your kids revlolt and start shooting you say \\"oh, it must be the video games. it must be the films.\\" The bible has caused more death, hatred and racism than all the film, videosgames and televisions combined ever will, but do you want to ban it? No, you embrace its hipocrisy, and pass the buck."},{"rating":"2","title":"Media Violence Cause and Effect","review":"As a military veteran and police officer of over 25 years tenure I understand and have seen what a lasting and terrible effect violence has on individual people's lives. The cost of violence to society as a whole is huge. Lt. Col. Grossman and Gloria DeGaetano came to the forefront with this book. They warned us of the root cause for some of the most destructive and least explainable actions of our times. The book shows precise reasoning and has plenty of foundation studies backing its findings. Now we just have to get the violence peddling video industry and \\"legal pundits\\" to see it and help in stopping it. The rock-solid proof of the author's theory about rampage killing is literally no further away than this week's headlines. In short...Stop Teaching Our Kids To Kill..."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Persuasive Book for Parents","review":"This is a superb and sobering book. It presents the case that so-called first person shooter computer games can serve as sniper training for youth in the general population. As a psychologist and professor of pediatric psychology, I was fully convinced. Of course, not every child hooked on video games of this kind will commit a crime, but that some are made more likely to do so, I have no doubt at all. Read it if you have kids or would just like to have a sane society in which to live."},{"rating":"2","title":"Move Out and Draw Fire","review":"Dave Grossman and Gloria DeGaetano are sure to draw fire from the video and media industries for their analytical look at the impact that violent media has on our kids. This is a must read book for anyone that is serious about being a parent. They are not afraid to tell it like it is when they point how the exposure to violent media can have a harmful impact on our youth. They are not against the first amendment, but they are strong advocates for the responsible application of standards to the sale of violent videos. What is more important, industry profits or the safety of our children?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wake up call","review":"This book is a startling wake up call for parents. I found my mouth dropping open on more than one occasion when I read about the accuracy and proficiency with which our young people can shoot to kill. Anyone who works or lives with chidren witnesses the agressive behavior described in this book on a daily basis. Despite what the TV, movie, and video game makers assert, the evidence given here is compelling, carefully researched and well documented. The authors quote many other studies and provide complete notes for anyone who wishes to look further. The chapter titled \\"Where to Voice Your Concerns\\" is also very useful. This book is a must read for parents, teachers, and anyone else who is in a position to influence the daily activities of children."},{"rating":"2","title":"Stop Teaching Our Kids to Kill: A Call to Action Against TV","review":"There is more common sense in one page of this book than 10 pages of the Congressional Record! As a concerned parent and grandparent I can recommend this book wholeheartedly."},{"rating":"1","title":"Of course! This is the answer... or is it?","review":"Why didn't we see this earlier? This must be the answer! Why didn't we see it before? Why couldn't we figure out that John Wilkes Booth shot Lincoln because he had been playing so much Quake? Or that Cain got the idea of killing Abel after logging so many hours playing Doom? And of course Hitler decided to kill so many people after playing Soldier of Fourtune too much.Now, those of you reading this review may be wondering, \\"What the heck is this guy talking about? Those games didn't come out until after those killings!\\" (of course, the rest of you already know where I'm going with this). My point is that violence has been around since soon after the creation of Mankind (see Cain and Abel). Several people have said already that violence has actually been declining since these games have come out, even further disproving the theories set forth in this book..."},{"rating":"2","title":"awesome","review":"I was always one that was in denial about media violence effects on young people. Then I read this book. Needless to say I will be monitoring what my son is watching, reading and playing as he grows up."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wreckless hyperbole.","review":"Dave Grossman and Gloria Degaetano have unfortunately written a book based on poor research and false public perception on violent media. I have no doubt they mean well, but using violent media as a scapegoat ignores the issues that lead to youth violence, such as poor upbringing and domestic violence. Youth violence has been on a severe decline since 1993 according to the department of justice, despite the skyrocketing sales of violent media since then.If you want a more objective look at violent media, I recommend \\"Grand Theft Childhood: The Surprising Truth about Violent Video Games and What Parents Can Do\\" by by Lawrence Kutner and Cheryl Olson."},{"rating":"2","title":"This book is right.","review":"I'm a 24 year veteran police officer. For many years I'vewondered at the rage and violence I've seen in kids who supposedly\\"had everything.\\" I found a valid reason for the problem in Stop Teaching Our Kids to Kill. The authors put together research which brings new focus to the problem of violent video and games. In my opinion, this research and preventive measures could save lives. Stop Teaching Our Kids to Kill should be must reading for any parent!"},{"rating":"2","title":"An excellent book","review":"The authors did a wonderful job of citing research that proves violent video games (and violent media in general) makes people violent. I recommend this book to anyone. People, do yourself a favor and read this book. It's shameful how that violent video game manufacturers encourage players to love violence and killing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Insanity","review":"I could write a long drawn out response to this nonsense, but what would be the point? According to people like the author of this book, American youths are at risk for violent behavior because they enjoy watching violent movies and playing video games. Hey, I've been playing games and watching movies all of my life. Now I'm trained for hunting everything from mutant space aliens to helpless people. Maybe I should exercise all I've learned from the media, then I could rationalize all of your delusions. Of course, I wouldn't do something like that...for one simple reason: I'm not insane.Do yourself a favor and don't waste your time or your money on this trash. Stop looking for a scapegoat, the media is not to blame. Place fault where fault is due: poor parenting."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just another way to find scapegoats for societies problems","review":"All this book does is try to blame all of today's problems on video games, and other media. Studies have recently shown that the kids who are most likely to play violent video games are LESS likely by far to commit real violence. They are able to let out their frustration in a fantasy setting, rather then on their peers. There is very little plausible evidence in this book, and more clinical studies should have been done before releasing a book such as this."},{"rating":"1","title":"THIS GUY IS A RACIST","review":"HOW MANY BOOKS IS THIS GUY GOING TO WRITE ABOUT SAME SUBJECT with a different title?

Yes, that is what causes overweight, but it's not about food, it's about helping people realize why food is a problem and to change behavior and thinking. That is what he is trying to get at where the diet industry fails. Yes, a lot of it is common sense, but let's face it, for those who feel that it's all common sense then why is obesity such a huge problem in this country? I think people are expecting this to be a magical solution, but it's not. It's not a structured diet plan, it's a behaviorial life plan. It takes time and it takes work.

(Football players have narrow waists). That he can be in so much denial about his own body is very troubling and makes me wonder how well his theories on weight loss can work when they obviously don't work for him.

Unfortunately, this packaging includes McGraw making insulting comments on nearly every page. Comments like getting \\"your fat behind\\" to the gym and other remarks are insulting to people who struggle with a not-simple-to-solve problem.

I have lost 70 pounds over the last two-and-a half years, and in doing so I have learnt that re-educating yourself about food and changing your tastes is a long, slow process. (For example I used to LOVE chocolate and cheese and now I'm not remotely interested.) People who rely on meal replacement products don't learn to choose the \\"right\\" foods, and don't re-educate their palates. (What happens when you stop buying the meal replacement products?) So it's very disappointing that an \\"expert\\" on weight loss is peddling a quick-fix approach. It's also intriguing that very few people find the negative reviews posted here to be helpful.

I should have known better, after all Dr. Phil is not in that good of shape himself. In short, I purchased this book because he is a celebrity and unfortunately, it lacks in depth and credibility.

As I was reading, I found myself hopeful, because I think he's right-on in terms of many of the underlying reasons that we overeat. Unfortunately, however, he never actually provides the tools to do what he's asking people to do. Rather, he sticks to relying on people changing simply because now they \\"know\\" why they overeat, rather than providing the tools and support structure to really change those deep-down, core expectations of inadequacy that cause so many of us to overeat.Because of this shortcoming, I will continue to recommend \\"The Pathway\\", by Laurel Mellin, to my weight-loss clients who need more than just \\"knowing\\" what to do to change their fundamental beliefs about themselves in order to lose weight."},{"rating":"1","title":"Helpful?

I have now identified many of the mental blocks that I had to maintaining a good way of eating. For example: I used food as a reward and a punishment. After work if I was hungry and didn't want to wait to eat until I got home I would mentally tell myself that it had been a crappy day and I deserved a big mac. If it had been a really good day at work and I was pleased with something I had done I would mentally tell myself that I was really good and deserved a big mac. No wonder I weighed 191 pounds!

You can tell Kirstie is making, not only fun of Hollywood, but of herself and I have been laughing hysterically at all the episodes.

I found the Advanced workout to be excellent for burning fat, shaping the legs and butt like nothing else. Being that I am in good shape already, I was able to get through the whole workout, but toward the end I really had to push hard. The tape was everything it was promoted to be. The only negative was the price because the bonus video is only a few minutes long.

But when the advanced workout came out, I decided to give it a try. At first, I was skeptical, especially since I was barely sweating, though the (Very FIT) exercise models looked like they'd just gone swimming. But by the time the (INTENSE) floorwork finished, I had created my very own pool, right in the center of the living room. I am used to intense workouts, but this obviously worked muscles I never even knew about, because the next day, only my eyebrows weren't sore.

It is an excellent addition to my treadmill and weights regimen. Billy Blanks is highly motivating. The movements do go a little too fast in the high speed repetition portions but I just slow it down to a pace that I feel is safe for me.

I've dropped pounds and inches, but the progress in slow, and you have to do the tapes at least five times a week to get maximum results. The warm-up in the advanced tape is too short, and a lot of the kicks favor one side or the other, but overall the workout is fun and super effective. Even when you're dead tired and working out is the last thing you want to do, turn on this tape and you instantly become motivated! I'm definitely going to order more of the \\"Live\\" series (they come in advanced or basic) and plan on doing Tae-Bo for life!

Do not start out with this video! Be sure that you first start with the instructional. Make sure you can do the moves correctly and then move on to basic. Once you feel comftrable there and can do the video with ease, then and only then its time to move on to the advanced. This will help prevent injuries that can happen when moves are done wrong. Its not a quick fix and you won't wake up one morning and suddenly have a toned body, but if you work hard, you can get the results you want! Just stick with it! You will be so happy you did in the end!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Please, Please, Please create another video.","review":"I think some of the others were a little harsh.

Join in, learn from the master and you won't believe how quick it happens for you!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent video and workout--but pricey","review":"Excellent video and work out. Lots of energy and great motivation from Blanks. Best I seen. However, tapes are priced just a little high for the average consumer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Blanks needs to produce \\"intermediate\\" workout","review":"I've been doing the basic Tae-Bo workout for about 3 months and realized that it had become too easy. I decided to order the Advanced and \\"Sneak Preview\\" workout tapes. Billy needs to produce an \\"intermediate\\" workout. The advanced tape is a very big jump from the basic and I can't make it through the 55 minutes of repetitiveness. It is a good workout though if you stick with it as long as possible (about 40 minutes for me so far). The \\"sneak preview\\" tape is nothing new and kind of a waste."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tough but worth the effort","review":"I hate aerobics, but I love this workout! After doing the basic tape for six weeks, I decided to try the advanced one. I laughed through it the first time, because it was so ridiculously hard, but after a few more workouts, I was keeping up really well. Yes, the camera work is totally cheesy, but it makes the whole workout a lot more light-hearted. Part of the fun is watching for the editing errors. Also, I LOVE the fact that the people who made the basic tape look so easy are really suffering through it. Some folks stop for air and water, all except the psychotically fit woman in the front in the blue outfit who claps and whoops after every exercise set. She is AWESOME! I have only lost a few pounds, but I have a totally new body. This is one workout that is well worth the effort, and the tapes are worth every penny."},{"rating":"2","title":"What a workout !","review":"It might take you awhile to work up to the advanced video - but once you get there you won't want to stop. You have to do this video in steps but once you are able to complete the whole thing you will get one of the best workouts ever released on video. You'll sweat, burn and yes sometimes even let out a yell ! But you will know that you made good use of your workout time and you will feel stronger and more fit. Billy Blanks is great !"},{"rating":"2","title":"Advanced Taebo","review":"After doing martial arts for close to 30 years ,I found this video to bring back oomfidence into training once more! I had major surgery on both knees & have artheritis in both knees which slowed my training,which caused a weight increase of 40 kg or 100 pounds . Since doing the advanced taebo video I have lost 25 kg or 60 pounds,this is due to the narration,music & motivation on the video."},{"rating":"2","title":"best cardio workout on video","review":"The Advanced Workout is the best cardio workout video I have found. It still is not quite as intense as Billy Blanks' live workouts, but you'll get a much better workout from this than any other video on the market (plus you can adjust the volume to suit yourself). It is a great investment, and I would highly recommend it to anyone who really wants to work. I would *not* recommend this if you have trouble completing other videos you might have, by other fitness \\"greats.\\" And don't forget to leave time for a shower afterwards, because it's a mandatory complete hair-washing event. Forget other cardio videos if you're serious (my friends and I pass them around to share, and so I've tried quite a few--this is by far the most difficult). It's also good for the arms. It's 57 minutes long."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fast toning, high cardio value! Excellent!","review":"I have to admit I cheated, starting with the advanced workout. I've been hiking and jogging for many years. I thought I was in shape! Geez! Billy Blanks proved me wrong! This video actually improved my cardio level over jogging. I also loved the controlled martial arts movements. My coordination is improving and my stomach is becoming very supple. However, the injury potential is high and some of the moves are way too fast in double-time to hold correct form. Modify the moves to keep your correct form."},{"rating":"2","title":"Definitely a workout that gets results","review":"I've been doing the Advanced workout for 3 weeks now and can't get enough. For the first few workouts, I thought no way. But Billy Blank's has a way of motivating you to want to keep coming back until you get it. I finally made it through and can't wait until it's time to do it again. I love the diversity of people in the video. Some make it look like it's no problem, while others make me feel right at home. The results have been truly astounding for me. I've lost 20lbs.(also eating a healthy diet), and have noticeable all over body toning. All in a 6 week period.(which includes the basic video). I can't give enough positive praise."},{"rating":"2","title":"very motivating","review":"this tape is excellent i've just started it but i can tell it works i'm new at tae bo and thiis is my first tape i haven't found it hard it just takes motivation also as many people have said \\"you must master the first to tapes or you'll be lost\\" well i just have one comment i'm not and i'm having a blast"},{"rating":"2","title":"FUN!! Makes you get off the couch & kick some serious butt!!","review":"Unfortunately for me, exercise videos have always bored me senseless and then I'd turn it off and go back to the couch long before I should. But with the Tae-Bo tapes, I WANT to exercise, and I do, I go through both tapes in one \\"session\\" and I still want MORE [after I catch my breath ;)]!!!! Before these tapes, I absolutely HATED to exercise, but now...I LOVE IT!!! Every word that I've written is 110% true, if you don't believe me, HONESTLY try it for a week- You WILL change you mind! Take it from an EX-couch potato (who could have gone pro ;P)...TRY IT!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good exercise tape, especially for your lower body","review":"I mainly run outside for my workouts, but Tae Bo is great for rainy days when I can't leave the house, or days when I'm lacking motivation to exercise and I think to myself, \\"I'll just pop this tape in for a little while and do it as long as I feel like.\\" I always end up doing the entire tape! The time goes by so fast during this workout. Billy Blanks doesn't spend too long on any one exercise, so you don't get bored, but you definitely are breathing hard and \\"feeling the burn.\\" It is especially toning for your legs. Often, after a run, I just fast forward to the latter part of the tape to do the leg toning exercises to round out my workout. I will go through them once, rewind, then do another set. My butt is looking rounder and firmer these days. I recommend this tape for a good sweat and for great tone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Addicting Workout!!","review":"If you can lose 15 pounds in 2 1/2 weeks, then money is no object. Buy the tape, it works"},{"rating":"2","title":"A workout for martial artists","review":"As a martial artist for 5 years, I have high recommendations for this video. The key is to adjust it to your own capabilities. Some of the moves are VERY high impact (for example, the jumping front kick) and will wreck your knees or ankles if you do them repeatedly. In addition, some of the moves are so fast they don't allow you to focus on the muscles you're working out. As long as you take this video at your own pace, it's great!For self-defense, though, this video isn't worth much. If you're looking for martial arts skills, sign up for a martial arts class. If you like Tae Bo, you'll LOVE martial arts, and you'll learn self defense techniques to boot!"},{"rating":"1","title":"It will make you sweat but thats not good enough.","review":"Tae Bo is a good workout, but lacking in many respects. The warmup is inadequate which would not be a problem if he told you to warmup on your own.Billy does a horrible job with his cues. He should being using his right for our left and vice-versa but he doesn't. He miss counts several times also.While this workout does make you sweat it is lacking in terms of his ability to teach an exercise class. And some of the moves in the warmup are unsafe. I.E. neck roll.For a great workout try Intense Moves by Reebok a step workout taught by Gin Miller that will quick your butt. It is also taught very well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Workout Tape I have","review":"I love this workout. I have had the original tape since 1999 and had worn it out, so I was thrilled to get a new one. This is a good solid workout that you can burn a lot of calories and build muscle with the aerobic part and has a good floor exercise section too. It is an hour long tape so it is challenging but a lot of fun. I am small so it takes a lot of exercise to burn any calories during a workout, much less break a sweat and this tape does both. I do this tape at least twice a week between going to the gym or when I can't go to the gym and it works for me. I have many other workout tapes but too many of them give me really bad, bad leg and shin cramps after I am done. This routine does not as it is a controlled aerobic, not a lot of bouncing etc. I highly recommend."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fun workout - TOO MUCH $$ for the poor production quality.","review":"These tapes are really a lot of fun, but I cannot believe that I paid >all this $$ for this! I've seen $7 tapes with the same quality production. The Firm videos are works of art and you get much quicker results. (Not to mention being ten times safer!) As the TaeBo tapes progress, you cannot hear Billy talking - the music gets louder while his voice gets softer and you find yourself trying to read lips while you're sweating and breathing heavily! Don't they watch the videos after they're done editing?! Tons of fun for $10 - not tons of fun for this price."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pumping Music","review":"Love the music in this latest series of Tae=bo workouts! Feel like \\"Rocky\\" when Im pumping. Keep them coming, Billy. They're getting better and better- I'm managing to keep up and feel like a million.."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unhappy with purchase","review":"I think Billy Blanks is highly overrated. I bought his videos and they are a joke. I thought that his videos would be different from all the other workout videos. I can tell you they were not. The guy seriuosly needs to get real. They are not worth the money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't get fooled by Billy Blanks","review":"Billy Blanks is a joke. He never was a world kickboxing champion, he may have been in tournaments but he never was a champion. His workout may make you lose weight and make you feel great, but the thing is that he is trying to think of a new way of fighting that people would be stupid enough to go to his classes or buy his stupid video. Billy Blanks is a joke don't get fooled by his video. Working out urself at home is better than his video, all your going to do is waste your money and make Billy happy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Advanced Fun and a Great Workout, Preview little to offer","review":"This is a great workout! It's challenging at first, but if you stick with it it becomes very effective and fun. The preview tape has no workout material on it, just clips from more videos they are trying to sell (I threw it away :-) ). The Advanced workout is 57 minutes long, and there are several parts to it so you don't get bored. It was well worth the money!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic!","review":"This is my second review - it's more of a comment towards other reviews. Sure just like any video, you have to learn the moves or you will get hurt. I myself bought the four video package and I started out with the Basic and learned the moves before going on further. That's the only sensible thing to do. I have been doing this now for nine months without one injury sustained from this exercise program. I have hurt myself doing a structured step aerobics class at a gym - so a good trainer as Billy Blanks is, tells you to learn the Basics first, then proceed. When's the next video come out?"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Advanced Workout is INCREDIBLE!!","review":"I've been doing the Basic video for several months now, and I just got the Advanced. This is the ultimate workout! Making every muscle burn has never been so much fun. Its uncanny the way Billy knows exactly when you're about to quit, and motivates you to come back and keep going. Each time I think I can't make it to the end, and then he starts talking and I get motivated and stick it through to the end. Billy is right, I WILL reach my goals, and so will anybody else who tries their hardest. Who cares if the music isn't the best and the camera angles aren't great. What is important is the end result. You WILL see results, your body will respond even after the first workout. You will feel SO aggressive and ready to take on the world when you finish this workout, its unbeatable!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I don't like this movie","review":"Me parece una película con muy bajo contenido, pésima producción y ni que decir de los actores, directores no la recomiendo"},{"rating":"1","title":"For B-movie action lovers","review":"I rented this because i liked the description on the box (based in part on a true story that happened to the director). It's an ok little actioner with religious overtones, that could have benefited from being a little shorter. It's got nice stunts, the woodland setting is atmospheric and the actors do their jobs. On the downside, it begins to feel muddled and flat toward the end."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Book","review":"Use the text to assist my son in this kata training.

I saw this video for the first time in Nov 2008, during LDS chruch services at Lackland AFB. It is a moving, thoughtful, and meaningful message from senior church leaders, including President Gordon B. Hinckley, President Boyd K. Packer, Elder Robert C. Oakes, and Elder Lance B. Wickman. It touched the hearts of myself (a 36-year veteran), my wife, and my son - who had just completed Air Force basic training.This would be a wonderful gift for any LDS military member."},{"rating":"2","title":"Totally Awesome!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","review":"I really enjoyed this book a whole lot.It was very suspenseful and action packed.I encourage everyone to read this book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent!","review":"I was assigned this book for an MLIS class earlier this year. We were assigned three chapters to read and I ended up reading the rest of the book on my own because I enjoyed it that much. Cart's book is absolutely wonderful and incredibly informative.

I highly recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A favorite","review":"I purchased this book a few weeks ago when looking for recipes for Cinco de Mayo. It is now one of my favorites out of my many Mexican and Latino cookbooks - the recipes are simple and turn out well. They may not be the most low fat recipes, but the editor stayed well enough away from ChiChi's fare. Mexican cooking appears to require much oil - blend the recipes from here with those in 'Latina Lite' for better health."},{"rating":"2","title":"Signs of Passing","review":"Occasionally there is an album that seemingly recreates itself each time it is spun. 'Signs of Passing' is such an album. Bonner's rhythms and drive create a spectrum of surreal and real moods; soulfully crafted lyrics animate these moods. Humor, satire, desire, introspection, contemplation. All are effortlessly found here. 'Signs of Passing' is a listener's cerebral refuge - may it also be a sign of things to come for Matt Bonner and his band."},{"rating":"2","title":"Herbert poetry","review":"Superb edition of the complete English poetry of George Herbert.

I can't really \`\`disagree'' with it--yeah sure, ok, love is good, uh-huh--but that doesn't stop me from wishing Merton were a lot more explicit and rigorous in his prescriptions.

The pianist in question just didn't manage the technical difficulties. Knowing Fazil Say is a virtuoso I wanted to hear a new and technically perfect version. For sure that's what I got. Fazil plays everything in the speed of light and is technically brilliant but I find the result absolutely terrible. I can't stand it, after two of the sonatas I had to stop. I'll miss his version of \\"The Tempest\\" since I won't ever be able to put this record on again. I can't understand what he's doing. It's like he wants to win a contest of playing \\"Appassionata\\" and \\"Waldstain\\" as fast as possible.

The setting is a lovely island off the coast of Oregon which offers striking scenery as well as a sense of remoteness that enhances the plight of the islanders and guests who have come to attend a wedding. The multitude of characters are well developed in most cases allowing the viewer to relate to their history and the imminent danger they face.As the series progresses the islanders as well as the wedding guests begin to disappear causing the survivors to begin suspecting one another. The conclusion is unpredictable and startling.Once I began watching Harper's Island I viewed the entire series over the course of about a week during which I was recovering from a severe shoulder injury and confined to the house reading and watching movies.

I was stunned, and mesmerized by the quality of the 'kills', I couldn't believe that this show was on TV and not the movies! I can understand why some would give it poor ratings, but we must keep in mind it is fiction! The plot was good and a little weak in places, but the body count is what got me!

Lawrence uniquely merges these three areas."},{"rating":"2","title":"Before Tolkien","review":"Before \\"The Fellowship of the Ring\\" there was \\"The Fellowship of the Silver Stallion\\"; the consequences for those who allied themselves in arms with Dom Manuel (The Reedemer), progenitor of generations (mortal and otherwise) and founder of myth."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is addictive stuff","review":"I bought this album on cassette when it came out in 1993. Later I bought it from amazon.com on CD. Chuck really was a genius. I wish that he was still alive. This is one of those bands that I wish I had seen live. I think I'll always be angry enough to listen to this CD. This is great anger management. Especially since this is an election year and there's a controversial war going on. You'll clearly hear Chuck say \\"What would you do without your pathethic narrow minded approach to life that reflects your lack of abilities.\\" He just speaks his angry mind. Also I think Chuck looks like Jesus. If you have actually read the Bible you know that Jesus was sometimes an angry guy always calling his critics hypocrites. People always pretend that Jesus was a nice guy. Chuck is like an angry Jesus, turning over tables and calling people hypocrites. Buy it to manage your anger."},{"rating":"2","title":"Everything!","review":"This album is one of the best metal albums EVER.Great guitars.I think Andy is the best guitar partner for Chuck.Shannon is also good but Andy..........(fill the gap!)

This book uses very recent US Department of Justice and FBI statistics to illustrate why gun control laws fail to curb crime. An extremely well written book, the author compares the gun laws and crime rates of many different countries. Also examined are several instances in history where an armed populace could have adverted massacre and slaughter, as well as instances where an armed society HAS dissuaded invasion and bloodshed. This book exposes the news media lie that the United States is \\"violent\\" by comparing murder/crime rate to other countries with stricter gun control. Gun Control is a violation your civil rights. This is book that cannot be ignored."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Must Read","review":"This book is a must read by all who have a conceal carry permit.

You would be surprised by reading this book who is trying to take your right to own and carry a gun."},{"rating":"2","title":"No changing anyones mind","review":"This is an excellent book and the author brings out some very good points. The opening is a riveting news item that of course did not make the papers because THE PRESS is neither objective or complete in covering BOTH view points.I don't think it will change the average person's views on gun control. Until you are faced in a situation where you know a gun may have saved a loved ones life, you will never understand."},{"rating":"1","title":"Use your head","review":"We should support rational gun regulations. If we just oppose any law with the word \\"gun\\" in it, we just hurt our cause. Books like this don't have any grasp of real life. I didn't disagree with everything Poe said, but Poe clearly is more interested what he wishes was true and less interested in what is true. He has the same warped mentality as those who just want to ban any gun.\\"It's just plain common sense that there be a waiting period to allow local law enforcement officials to conduct background checks on those who wish to buy a handgun.\\"- Ronald Reagan *endorsing* the Brady handgun control bill, at a March 1991 event commemorating 10th anniversary of the assassination attempt."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unfortunately most of it is not true","review":"Most of his arguments are very superficial. It is for example a fact, that in countries like Germany, France, Japan or even Canada, the homicide rates carried out by guns are 10 times, yes, 10 times lower than in the US. In all of this countries it is almost impossible to get a gun. He writes for example about the Swiss militia. This Winter a gunmen entered the Swiss parliament killing over a dozen people, never happend in Germany, never happend in Japan. Wake up! All his arguments are lame excuses for carrying a gun.He's right about the criminals, though. If you want to kill someone, you gonna kill him anyway, but how much easier is it to kill if you have a gun instead of knife!?This book is defintely a shot in the wrong direction."},{"rating":"1","title":"The author does not address how effective gun control works","review":"I have been in awe as I read of two separate school incidents in Japan, where a toughest gun control law have been in its books for years, involved only use of knives instead of guns. These incidents disprove the book's false contention about gun control. Rightwingers like Richard Poe ought to understand that we need a law like Japan's. That way we won't read any more news reports about school SHOOTINGS. I don't buy their argument \\"Not just guns, it is just the criminals\\" Try to picture-as an example only- a otherwise stable citizen going amok with his gun collection-so many reports occur with such people with otherwise clean criminal records involved in workplace and school shootings. Enough of the rightwing nonsense!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Thoughtful","review":"This book makes you think. Which in itself is worth at least a three star rating.

However, being intrigued simply by the cover, I had to check it out. Yes, the c.d. is only 22 minutes long (with 12 tracks, each track is, on average, 1.8 minutes long). However, each track seems *longer* than it actually is. I listened to this odd hodgepodge of punk, screaming, fighting, poetry, etc. by a group called huggy bear and felt as if I had just listened to a longer album. It has an entrancing effect. I had feared I would get no information on this unique band, but here I am. This record will blow you away.

They just don't do punk rock like this anymore. If you're looking for a great noise album or something slightly less self absorbed than CRASS, this is your pick over their final effort, Weaponry Listens to Love. If you want more songs and substance, pick WLtL over TtRw/tS; you'll miss out, however, on all the really anthemic riot-grrrl moments."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best grrrl stuff","review":"Of all the riot grrrl stuff this band is my favorite. I have lots of love and respect for the Olympia/D.C grrrls, but none of them can compete with Huggy Bear. This is punk rock at its finest..bratty, smart & angry. I love the boy/girl British accented vocals which reminds one of the late 70's when punk exploded in England. It's perfect. I wish I could have seen them before they broke up!! I discovered Huggy Bear in 1992 when I was 14 and they remain one my favorite bands of all time. I was too young to go to shows back then, but this record is a great piece of history that documents riot grrrl at its best."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not Like The Movie","review":"If you saw the Johnny Depp movie a few years ago, you might think you know this story line. And in a sense, you sort of do. But the book fills in so many gaps about the main character.

It has a wonderful whimsical setting, full of beautiful imagery and allusions. It contains a touch of mystery, a dash of magic, some charming characters, a sharp wit, and the proverbial \\"good vs. evil\\" theme. You'll end up rooting for Vianne, the protoganist, and wish you had her for a friend.

After the first few pages I noticed some major differences between the book and the movie so I was unsure if I'd like it but I have to say it has been great to read it and to see the differences.

Vianne quickly establishes a small chocolate shop in town, which creates more excitement than the village has seen in years. While many residents welcome the new establishment, the local reverend, Père Reynaud, sees Vianne's chocolate shop as a slap in the face to the church and to morality in general. When Vianne plans to hold an elaborate chocolate festival in conjunction with Easter Sunday, the reverend becomes enraged and vows that she must be stopped at all costs.This is a fun little novel that includes elements of magic and sorcery. It's a quirky book with memorable characters, and although it does drag a bit in places, it was an enjoyable read that I would recommend."},{"rating":"2","title":"Chocolat","review":"Great movie and great bookLoved itAbsolutely the greatest book everlol what else can i say it was great"},{"rating":"2","title":"Can Chocolate Change the People in a Village?","review":"This book has been on my reading list for some time and I read it with a pleasure that matched my anticipation.

Located across from the church, she can see the local priest always watching. She thinks of him as the man in black who has haunted her dreams her since childhood.Vivianne wears bright colors and identifies closely with anyone who comes into her shop, even the \\"river people\\" when they park their houseboats on the banks of the local river. Vivianne is carefree, happy and giving to all she meets. Is she a witch as the priest believes or just a sensitive person who strives to help others?

I had a chocolate craving when I bought this, but I never thought I could be addicted to a book. I re-read this several times being drawn in by the strong characters that Joanne Harris presented. I have bought this book several times as gifts already and will continue to do so until Joanne Harris writes again! (Thanks for the title Ms. Harris...)"},{"rating":"2","title":"A fairy tale in the tradition of Mary Poppins","review":"Chocolat is a fairy tale, and Vianne a second Mary Poppins.

Trust me, you will crave!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing, superficial characters and plot lines","review":"I read this for a book club, and as a chocolate fiend, was excited. While it was a quick read, how many cups of hot chocolate can you hear described? The characters were poorly developed and therefore, one dimensional; I was never able to picture any of them. The narrator Vianne, was not likeable, but rather, self righteous and unnessarily provocative of the mores of the town. Although I am not a Catholic, I found the church-bashing outmoded and hard to take. All in all, a mediocre novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's been done, and it's been done better","review":"I'm not sure what all the hoopla and fanfare was about--Chocolat was not a good book. I'm not faulting its magical realism genre of \\"Delectable Food Induces Amorous Affairs.\\" It just wasn't written very well. While reading this book, not a moment passed where I didn't get hit with de ja vu. Even the ending was foreseeable--and the reason definitely is not b/c I've got this great prophet-like power--it's simply that the author does absolutely nothing new with this concept. This terrain has been mapped far better in other works. Think Isabelle Allende's \\"Like Water for Chocolate\\" or the wonderful movies, \\"Tampopo\\" and \\"Eat Drink Man Woman.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Makes you mouth water...","review":"Great book. I loved the notion that Vianne and Anouk were like a couple of 'white witches' who blow into town on a good wind, do good, improve peoples lives and blow back out again. I particularly liked the character of Amande and I wished I could of gone to her final birthday party: it sounded fantastic! I must admit I was little disappointed with what finally happened to Father Reynaud, he'd been build up as such a sinster character and I thought he was going to do something truly terrible, so the ending seemed a bit of an anti-climax. But, overall, I thoroughly enjoyed this deliously different, quirky little tale."},{"rating":"2","title":"Two Favorites -- France and Chocolates","review":"Please indulge yourself and read this book. You'll be glad you did"},{"rating":"2","title":"I gained 10 pounds devouring this book.","review":"OK, maybe it just felt like I did -- the wonderful descriptions of the confections created by Vianne in her chocolaterie were that evocative. I read this book on vacation, and it proved to be the perfect escape. Fanciful and suspenseful by turns, it held my interest from start to finish. In fact, it was sufficiently transporting that I almost forgot I was on a packed jet and in a drab airport. Lock up the Godiva and indulge in this treat!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Plodded along","review":"For me, the movie told a better story; some pieces in the book were not resolved. I wouldn't recommend the book, but I'm glad I read the original source for the movie I enjoy so much. Maybe it was the dramatic discrepancies between movie and book that disappointed me."},{"rating":"2","title":"A different take from the movie.","review":"I saw the movie first a couple of years ago and really enjoyed it. The characters are changed somewhat in the book, but you get a much better idea of how the characters are thinking. I'm looking forward to seeing the movie again so I can compare the two more thoroughly."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unimpressive.","review":"This book did not inspire me at all. I have to admit to being totally shocked when I discovered that it had been made into a film!! In my opinion it is simply not an engaging enough tale to warrant the attention of the film industry. I have to admit that I did not feel much sympathy for the characters and this obviously left me somewhat unimpressed by this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"mouth-watering but disappointing","review":"At first I thought I had found a jewel of a novel. The reading seemed pure pleasure. Gradually, however, I began to see how shallow the idea behind the book is. The goodness of the positive characters makes you sick after a while just as too much chocolate does. The poor fiend of a priest for a change makes you feel sorry. If you are looking for heavy, naive symbolism and a black-and-white world here's a book for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Did not live up to the hype","review":"I was disappointed with this book. It was too slow going in the scenes with the priest and I was easily bored for most of it. Also, I feel that Ms. Harris's attemps to be secretive only backfire - I was not dying to unravel any mysteries, I truly wanted to just finish so I could start a better book.I love the concept, but it could have been better executed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Chocolat","review":"This book was amazing to read...and I am so glad that it came in the kindle version...the story is quite a bit different than the movie and yet it is not. The movie is set back in the 50's and the book is 90's but it's a great read. I would really recommend purchasing this book and I may get the next book as well."},{"rating":"1","title":"She should trust her readers","review":"While the book showed some promise at the beginning, I grew tired of the simply-drawn characters. If a writer can't trust her readers to understand that a character is evil without comparing that character to a Nazi, the author needs to work a little longer on her story. The author just didn't trust her readers to understand earlier actions, words and descriptions of her characters, so the book became repetitive, and the characters more one-dimensional.This wouldn't necessarily keep me from reading future books by this author. The dialog, her characters, and her descriptions, at the beginning of the book, were interesting. As time passes, I trust that the author will develop, as will her characters."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unmemorable","review":"Chocolat is an ambitious novel that attempts to set up a classic good versus evil duel set against the backdrop of a closed-minded little town. Harris's writing is appealing, but the story is predictable and the characters are cookie-cutter sterotypes.I gave Chocolat two stars instead of one because the parts of the novel that tell the story of Vianne's migrations with her mother and with her daughter are compelling, as are the vignettes in which she interweaves cooking and magic. Harris obviously has a lively imagination and has led a fascinating life, but the plot takes an early turn for the obvious and follows through to the end in like fashion."},{"rating":"1","title":"Skip this book and go to the Movie","review":"This is one situation that I can assume the movie is better than the book. With all the hype I expected more magic. I felt the book was slow moving and grated on my last nerve. The only saving grace was the elderly woman. I wante to know what her future held for her and what was to come of her interaction with the many lives she encountered. Other than that I felt the book was EXTREMELY hard to get through and I was happy that it finally ended."},{"rating":"2","title":"What an huge difference we all can make......","review":"This beautifully written book shows that however ordinary our lives may seem, we all make an huge difference in those around us.

This is a definate \\"must read\\" and \\"read again\\"!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Funny and one-dimensional","review":"Uptight guy versus bringer of joy and light. Fun food against staid religion. Haven't I seen this before? Oh yes, it was a Disney Film. I like the recipes, but the story is so hackneyed it had to be made into a movie. Death is even personified in this book; what an original idea! I read to the end because I love chocolate, but otherwise, this tedious heap of cliche is exactly what's wrong with \\"literature\\" today and doesn't merit recommendation."},{"rating":"1","title":"Chocolat","review":"The book is always better than the movie? Not in this case. This was the most boring, empty book Ive ever read. It was like reading the same chapter over and over. You would be hard pressed to find any substance in this book.

The movie was so uplifting and fun. The book was so depressing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Chocolat -- A delicious book!","review":"I must admit, I picked up this book with a few reservations. The book, however, turned out to be one of the best books I've read in a long itme!! Vianne Roche (IS she a witch?) breezes into town one day on the tails of carnival and sets up shop across from the local church, to the dismay of the local priest. This book has just the right amount of tension between \\"good\\" and \\"evil\\". Seldom has a book evoked such emotion. At times laughing out loud and unashamedly crying, I could not put the book down until the very last page. The characters are wonderfully portrayed, the plot is well-thought out and the book itself is beautifully written. A delight to read! If the movie follows the book, it should be a box office hit. I highly recommend this book to anyone! Delicious!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"a delicious little book","review":"I read this book based on a recommendation from a good friend. The girl has good taste in books. It was a wonderfully relaxing read all the while being full of interesting twists and turns. (how can I love it when the priest is not a priest but a mayor?! That just changes everything...)I love the dichotomy between the \\"witch\\" (she'll never admit to it) and the priest (he'll never admit to anything) at Lent, no less. It just doesn't get any better than this.Harris's style of switching between the two points of view and how it reveals certain bits and pieces at certain times creates wonderful pacing for the novel.I highly recommend it to anyone looking for something to read that is both enjoyably relaxing (and not taxing on the brain) and still has a wonderful plot full of interesting twists and turns and tidbits."},{"rating":"2","title":"delicious","review":"Wow- this was a quick read. Considering I'm a mother with two young children and never get a chance to see a movie. So low and behold I pick up the novel and boy was I happy. I began reading the book on Ash Wednesday and was completed on on the first Friday lent. Also coming from a very strict religious family during lent and its odd sacrifices that we must endure through this book really made me smile through out. A must read for all who need a realistic novel that any one who went to church can relate too."},{"rating":"2","title":"Literary and culinary enchantment: a rare treat!","review":"Amid the myriad novels one can read, there are a rare few which are truly a boisterous and grand celebration of life. This is one of those. Written in a sublime and tasty prose, full of sensual detail and delight, this is an extreme pleasure to read from first word to last delicious morsel. There's also just a hint of magic here that again never fails to enchant. Harris's characters are huge and memorable from the valiantly wicked while dying Armande to the romantic mystery Roux to the charmingly vile priest Reynaude. Subtle, but lovingly playful, there is everything to recommend this novel. Admirers of the prose of Isabel Allende, Alice Hoffman, Laura Esquivel, Jorge Amado, and many of the other magical realists will also enjoy Harris, but this book is for anyone who loves a good story, richly told."},{"rating":"1","title":".......and they cut down a tree for this?","review":"I truly regret wasting time reading this ...coz spare time is something I don't have much off. I've read picture books designed for toddlers...that have more of a plot than this book did."},{"rating":"1","title":"Chocolat leaves a bad aftertaste","review":"I was prepared to like this book, but from the very start, it practically bludgeons you over the head with its message that, \\"if it feels good, do it.\\" The book pits the free-spirited, attractive, heroine against an uptight, cruel, and (eventually) psychotic village priest in a bizarre battle over a chocolate shop. Inevitably, all the sympathetic characters immediately side with the beautiful newcomer who revitalizes the town, while the gossips and wife-beaters side with the priest. The author clearly has something against organized religion in general, Catholicism in particular, and goes to great lengths to convince the reader to share her feelings. The ending is absolutely ridiculous, and left me deeply annoyed at the fact that I had actually wasted my time on this drivel."},{"rating":"1","title":"One of the most disappointing books I've read in a long time","review":"I especially wanted to read this book because of where it allegedly took place and because the subject sounded so enticing.

We're supposed to believe that the opening of a chocolat shop in a FRENCH town causes a furore and the enmity of the local priest. Ridiculous. France is bursting with chocolat shops, they're everywhere you go, and I don't believe any priest would give a damn. If the woman had opened a brothel or an opium den or soemthing then I could undeerstand the priest getting upset, but a chocolat shop? It's too silly for words. The priest is an absurd caricatur baddie, he might as well be wearing a hat with 'villain' on it.The book is full of heavy-handed church bashing, we are constantly having it rammed home how free-spirited and liberated the heroine is in contrast to the nasty, oppresive priest. This is an extremely silly book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not impressed","review":"I realize this book is a fairy tale and the standards have to be a little different. I am obviously not the audience that this book was intended for and the audience that was captivated by it. I did not believe the plot or the setting. If there had been a little more magic, I might have bought it. It seemed to me to be a collection of cliches from other stories. As the author had actually lived in France, I hoped for a little more realism. I've read about the anti-Catholic bias in film and books and generally dismissed it as over reaction, but I thought this book had an offesively clear anti-Catholic bias. The men don't come out very well either."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't bother if you have a brain","review":"I read this book one Christmas holiday and have rarely felt so utterly cheated out of a few hours. The priest was a cheap target (I say this as an atheist!), a straw man, and the romance empty and shallow. I kept waiting for some depth, something that would redeem the book, some kind of moral or intellectual center, perhaps, and there was none. There are loads of great books out there -- don't waste your time on this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Heartwarming like a good cup of hot chocolate","review":"What a beautiful book. This is a new author to me whom I stumbled across at my bookclub. The characters are real, the warmth and passion of the village reverberates throughout the book. Without be being a soap saga, the books covers day to day realities such as death, chocolate, love for humans and animals, marital problems and personal conflict - all with a soft touch of the author which never hides the complexities of living.I wait in anticipation for the new book out in July."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Waste Your Time","review":"I was quite disappointed by the characters in this book. If people really see \\"church-goers\\" as hateful and snobbish as the author portrays then they're hanging out with the wrong Christians. So I entitled my review \\"Don't Waste Your Time\\". The priest gorges himself on chocolate, the \\"heroine\\" is impregnated by the local gypsy, and everyone lives happily ever after."},{"rating":"1","title":"Thank you one star reviewers...","review":"I'm halfway through and was wondering whether or not to continue. The book's back cover reviews by NY Times, USA Today, etc. describe it as enchanting and other fine praisewords but thusfar I'm far from enchanted.

Thanks to Amazon reviews here I won't waste any more time on this and will move on to more interesting reading."},{"rating":"2","title":"As delightful as a good piece of chocolate...","review":"Savor the development of the characters in the book and then enjoy the magic of the movie.

I decided to read this book because I saw a trailor for the movie and figured that I would prefer to try the book for depth instead. This was a story of a vibrant, strong woman, and I greatly appreciated that.The main character, Vianne Rocher, moves into this small town in France and decides to open a chocolate shop. She's a colorful woman who stands out in this gray, drab town but is determined to fit in without compromising her ideals. I find the way she confonts opposition to be inspiring. This was a highly moving book. I actually believe I felt myself becoming a rebel as I turned the pages."},{"rating":"2","title":"Imagine the taste !","review":"Characters were interesting and I would have liked to meet them at a party or in my neighborhood. The transformative power of one person was clearly told by the twists and turns of the story.

These \\"slaves\\" are dressed in pefectly clean clothing, do no field work and dance and sing, marry and hug and smile, all in a day's \\"work.\\" While live re-enactments have their place at historical sites, here they are not surrounded by any context that explains the truth behind these images.The text may be helpful to children writing reports but I would not recommend this as a resource.

I never thought I had huge wrist but it wouldn't go around even to the first hole. The watch band is also plastic knowing that i still ordered since you can't really tell on the picture.

The face is easy to read, has a sweep second hand, it has classic styling (and it is all black & white - no gold or silver or other metallic color), and it was inexpensive. I have smallish wrists, so sometimes I have trouble buying watches because the bands are so large and often end up being loose or the band has to wrap around pretty far. But this fits me perfectly. So if you are looking for a basic watch and you have small wrists, this might just be what you need."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Cure for Insomnia","review":"This book is the cure for insomnia.

One a memoir of Leila Ahmed growing up in Cairo and how she finally settled in the USA. It is a fascinating story, involving and informative about life in Egypt, much more diverse and interesting than I had ever realized.The second theme of the book is an analysis of the concepts of Arab identity and the experiences of Arab women.

One reason our professor had selected it was the use of graphics and such- it looked to be far more engaging than most similar texts. And I will admit, it was more engaging, the stories it added were good and the design of the pages was very well done. However, it was clearly written by a psychologist, not a linguist, there were quite a few mistakes, as well as many waaaay over simplifications. Anyone who has taken at least than an introduction to linguistics could pick out bunches of mistakes, and I'm quite sure my professor was making a list to send to the publisher. There were numerous typos and grammar mistakes, too. I use it from time to time to get an example of a point or check something quickly, but overall it was quite a disappointment."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fascinating look at autism AND gorillas","review":"I thought the title was a metaphor, but it was actually quite literal.

This book could be enjoyed for either reason. One of the best patient autobiographies I have read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Insight into an autistic mind","review":"I can't imagine how frustrating it would be to have autism and not have been diagnosed until late in life. Once she's diagnosed and realizes \\"idiosyncrasies\\" of those around her are more than they seem, I found that interesting.Anything having to do with animals will hold my attention.

Reading this book shows you what it is like to live with autism, Asperger's Syndrome in particular, and tells the story of how Dawn learned to cope, and even be happy, by observing a family of gorillas. If you are interested in the way the human brain works, and in the relationships between humans and animals, and about love and how it can save us all, you will truly love this book. To top it all off, Prince Hughes writes like a poet, and the immediacy of her prose makes reading this book a truly unique and special experience. Can't recommend this highly enough."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautifully crafted story with authentic voice","review":"If you want to read a piece of fiction by someone who doesn't have Asperger's Syndrome, by all means, read \\"The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-time.\\" But if you want to learn how a person travels from earliest memories of being different to the coping skills gleaned from a lifetime of educating yourself, you must read Prince-Hughes' book. Dawn's journey is at once painful and joyous, with vignettes that even people who are not on the autism spectrum can relate to. The fact that Dawn's best teacher was a gorilla man named Congo goes to show that if you don't make judgments about other beings, your eyes will witness a world beyond your limited human prejudices. Through the lessons from Congo and his gorilla family, Dawn has created and nurtured her own human family. Not an easy feat for any of us, but even more impressive for a woman who was \\"socialized\\" by gorillas. If I could rate this higher than 5 stars, I would. An absolute gem!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Three books","review":"There are three books that you must read if you're interested in Asperger, DID, or any of the host of other syndromes affecting children (and adults). These are: FREAKS, GEEKS, AND THE ASPERGER SYNDROME, Jackson McCrae's THE BARK OF THE DOGWOOD, and SONGS OF THE GORILLA NATION. Of the three, \\"SONGS\\" is by far the best, it being a disturbing and ultimately uplifting story. Not to take anything away from the other two books, both of which are great reads, but \\"Songs\\" moved me to tears, literally. Don't feel that you have to know someone who's \\"different\\" to read this book--you don't. It stands on its own for what it is--a great read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Danny boy!","review":"If you are a fan of the alkaline trio and are a fan of dan andriano's songs in alkaline trio then this cd will be just what your looking for. To be honest only a few songs sound Trio like mainly, \\"Goodbyes Have Been Said\\",\\"Please Come Home\\", and \\" Another disco party\\". I think this album leans more towards emo/punk even more so than alkaline trio because the imagery in his lyrics is quite as dark as it had become with Matt Skiba's influence. Danny's voice is a lot more similar to \\"Goddammit\\" and his two songs on \\"self-titled\\". Like i said if you like Dan Andriano you will probably like this but it doesn't sound exactly like Alkaline trio. I think it is probably better than most of the crap thats on the radio so you can't go wrong.

I was a little nervous when I first purchased it, because I was just starting to enjoy emo and indie rock, and I was affraid my opinion of these three guys (which was pretty big considering they were in Slapstick) would be seriously lowered. It wasn't. I don't think it can increase anymore it's so far up there. I'm still upset that they broke up. I didn't get a chance to see them live.

As I assume most fire extinguishers do, it uses a grenade style mechanism where you pull out a large red pin and then simply squeeze. Extinguished the fire immediately. Usage was completely natural despite having never used a fire extinguisher before. It did leave quite a mess, but it wipes up pretty easily with a wet cloth.I've read the other reviews so I am a bit concerned that my replacement will arrive discharged, but that isn't an issue with the product itself which works great.Update: Just thought I should mention that I received my replacement and it was full, as expected."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome","review":"great product to have in the some. every home should have one.

While Jensen may well be original enough to belong in this list, he failed with the first volume of \\"Endgame.\\"Basically this first volume covers the same ground as \\"Columbus and Other Cannibals.\\" It just takes Jensen a lot longer. He is exorcising his anger, I imagine. Understandable. But as a reader, not what I hoped for from from this book.The book is self-indulgent, rambling, and unfocused.

I was a bit taken aback when he started asking me how to make explosives. Still, I got the book and read it, however painful it was. After I finished I decided I must convince my friend he needed to see the danger and fallacy of this book. I used a number of highlighters to mark the most egregious passages. Blue for a non sequitur argument. Red for a logical fallacy. Yellow for unsubstantiated \`fact'. Etc. After 2 chapters I saw that almost the entire book was highlighted.

Everyplace I stopped that was on the list did indeed accept pets (some charged extra, some didn't).

Otherwise, we enjoyed where we ended up and were grateful for the book. This book is a great resource guide but you will have to do your homework. And as a consumer, you have to be responsible for yourself. The book does not give details on the hotels it lists so take it upon yourself to call and inquire. With so many listings it would be hard to also stock it with pictures and details. Even if the book listed details you would need to followup on your own.

So I was looking forward to getting my hands on The Puppet-Masters, and I certainly wasn't disappointed. I knew that it was going to be an important book with everything that's happening in the game world, and I thought it successfully tied up a few loose-ends while leaving a few open for later books.

The book's main message seems to be to promote science and rationalism against superstition and sociobabble.

U Toronto was in the process of opening its own Department of Transgressive Discourseat last!so it was only natural that we both applied for positions.\\"Unfortunately, the book severely undermines that message with a weak ending that essentially asks the reader conditioned to rationalism to take a denouement full of biobabble on faith.While I wouldn't hesitate to highly recommend any other novel by Egan, I cannot recommend this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Easy to open yet gives tight closure.","review":"I have never had a OXO product, and liked the picture of this clip because I needed a heavy duty one for the ten pound sugar bag in our cupboard.

I am disappointed, but that's what happens one reads customer reviews written by zealous fans. I also find it hard to grasp the use of the adjectives \\"compelling\\" and \\"masterpiece\\" by the professional reviewers. I describe their vocals as disjointed, campfire-like, enough to make the lyrics difficult to understand; the songs are mostly plodding, the arrangements simple and sloppy; I really did not hear any relationship between this music and any country or bluegrass traditions, except that the two female singers sing with a twang, and one of them sounds a little like Emmylou Harris' younger, but tone-deaf sister. When these two women sing together, it's just two unrehearsed and off key voices trying to stay on the same line. If I'm wrong about Freakwater, then I'm just used to hearing more professional performers."},{"rating":"1","title":"A ruined production","review":"I've listened to their other CD's, and saw them in concert, but I think this record is an example of not knowing what to do next.

But after getting the book and removing the shrink-wrap, it is nearly impossible to read. The layout is similar to ESPN's Magazine, with small colored print on top of colored background, pictures without captions, etc. This was supposed to be for my Dad, but at his age he won't be able to read this.

Although the pictures range from very good to spectacular, the book reads like it was written by committee. This is a sugar-coated history of the team, and not a very accurate one at that. You would have thought that a team that prides itself on being the greatest franchise in sports would have paid more attention to their own story and paid more respect to their fans, but the words here are strictly to fill up the pages.

This book is deeply flawed -- the climactic scene revolves, not around wits or daring, but a public display of affection -- but it's one of the few high points in the series. Phryne is charming, brilliant and amoral, and would be almost likable if the narrative wasn't continually telling us how special and remarkable she is. It's hard to generate tension around a character for whom the normal rules of society don't apply. However, the Jazz Age Australia setting is well-realised, and this is an entertaining start to a series best enjoyed as part of a drinking game."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Movie","review":"Okay, I lied about having seen the DVD, but I've seen it in the theater and I thought someone should get the ball rolling with a few thoughts about the movie itself.Hugo Weaving you will either remember from \\"Pricilla, Queen of the Desert\\" or \\"The Matrix\\" depending upon whether great cinematography and acting (in the first case) or expensive special effects and editing (in the second) opens your wallet at the local cineplex. Weaving gives an amazing, better-than-Oscar quality performance in this recent take on the police interrogation movie. In the opening scene his apartment is raided by some very aggressive police... gosh, if I tell you about it, it will lose all of its impact. Better not to tell.Suffice it to say that if you liked \\"Glengary GlenRoss\\", \\"The Trial\\", \\"Under Suspicion\\" and/or \\"The Usual Suspects\\", if you like to see an actor wrap himself around a role, and if you like a nice plot twist or two, buy this film.

The publisher did a clumsy search and replace to add the accent so words like \\"neck\\", \\"never\\", and \\"necessary\\" have french accent over the \\"e\\". Also when they did this for some reason it runs together with the previous word. So \\"his neck\\" becomes \\"hisneck\\"Despite all this, the Kindle dictionary is a cool factor here.

But Attanasio isn't content to stay in the grimy city, where things are interesting. She wants to lift Sumner to Godhood, so we must follow Kagan into the wilderness and through his many changes.

There are no corn bread or grits recipes. I have to disagree with the person who said the chicken pot pie crust was not in the book. it is on page 279. This mix is for several recipes. I made it for the hamburger pie - which is great. My son loved it! I have not made a lot of recipes in this book ,but glad I have it and plan to try more.

An example is its answer to \\"what is the most common hernia in females\\", it states the answer is \\"femoral\\", which is incorrect. Femoral is more common in females, but inguinal hernias remain the most common in both sexes. At this time, this text will cause confusion in a diligent student.

It is also seriously riddled with incorrect information when compared to many medical textbooks such as Current's Medical Diagnosis & Treatment and Harrison's. The combination of these deficiencies will erroneously lead the aspiring PA into confusion and error on the exam. Even using the USMLE books will not be enough of a guide so I suggest that all subjects in the blueprint be reviewed individually with other sources and corrections made by the student into this book before attempting the exam.Hopefully a new book edition that is edited more thoroughly using more accurate sources will become available soon since this one is already three years out of date."},{"rating":"2","title":"priceless study guide","review":"Use this guide along with Current Medical Diagnosis and Treatment, Current Surgical Diagnosis and Treatment, plus a comprehensive board review course and you'll pass everytime.

Yes there is some incorrect info as stated by other reviewers but overall it serves as a good guide.

Overall, it had some good information, however, there were far too many mistakes in the book to be acceptable. I wonder if this book was ever reviewed or edited prior to publishing! There were so many mistakes that I became uncertain of whether information I was studying was accurate or not. The mistakes ranged from simple typographical errors to contradictory answers in different parts of the book. There were so many errors in the psychiatry section that I simply stopped reading that section all together.

This edition has some errors as stated in other reviews, which is a bit frustrating when you are panicked and trying to cram for the Boards. It contains a lot of zebras and goes more in depth than you'll be tested on in the PANRE, so it might be good for the PANCE. A better book that reflects the PANRE more accurately is the Zarbock book. Also, I couldn't open the practice test that is on the included CD, it may have been my computer acting up again, but since I was able to open other tests it makes me wonder if the writers of this CD have not made it user friendly (or dummy proof).

Well researched!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Like watching paint dry...","review":"I agree with some of the readers here. Although the concept of the story line had the capability of being a real page turner, it was spoiled with an extraordinary amount of detail that was not needed. With any true crime story, you must read everything in case some detail plays out with the rest of this story. But this one just took forever to get to a point. All you care about is the latest antics of the doctor and his family and it drones on and on about the district attorney and his family, one of the patient's and her husband and every single detail of their lives. Also, I agree with another reader in that it's very one sided. The doctor obviously mixed in society at some point, but he is made out to be a figure like \\"Michael\\" in the \\"Halloween\\" movies where he was just a killing machine. Not very believable! The Halloween series was better though at least it scared you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Painful to read","review":"I tried an Ann Rule book (this one) based on friends' recommendations - I enjoy books about true crime. This is possibly the worst book I've ever read. It was painfully dull, with Rule delving into unnecessary, boring details about minor characters' lives when she could have omitted these people entirely without affecting the story at all. As I read this (determined that it MUST at some point get better - it didn't), it seemed like Rule was merely drawing out the story in order to fill as many pages as she'd promised her publisher. The first story drones on and on for 300 pages, when the tale could have been told more effectively in about thirty. It was a relief when I finished the book and could throw it away.

She is a terrifc author who sucks you right in. This subject of this story is great, but I agree with some of the other posts here, it's just too long. Every time I got \\"into\\" the details of Anthony and Debbie, the author pulled my attention away to things that in my opinion had nothing to do with the story. The nitty gritty things she told about Frank Sedita and his wife for example. Who cares? And, also, of course you feel horrible about the patient Sara Smith, but the only info I really wanted at that point was about Debbie and Anthony. I was impatiently waiting for her to finish the rambling, and get back to the story SO many times while reading it. She is almost too involved with Debbie and her feelings.

Actually, instead of the Pignataro story being a small part of the book, I would have liked a single book just about them. And, I would like to hear more about their lives. I didn't like all the chatter about the DA's office. It just didn't matter in the end and took away from the story for me personally. In some places the book could have been longer and in some, shorter. I bought the book because the reviews on this site were very good but sadly I did not agree with those readers in the end.

However they lack that clear refined sound when running straight signal to them without tone adjustments, which higher end speakers exhibit with less effort. 4 Stars because of the price and the ability to tune them with a good sub.

When you go to more advanced books Q is replaced by other fields (P-adic, function fields, finite fields,..).Two: He assumes very little and writes very clearlyThree: You only needs to read his Galois theory book for the prerequisiteFour: His book is what is usually left for the reader to do as an excersize in more advanced books."},{"rating":"2","title":"tough problems => good for the student","review":"The motivation of explaining Fermat's Last Theorem is a nice device by which Stewart takes you on a tour of algebraic number theory. Things like rings of integers, Abelian groups, Minkowski's Theorem and Kummer's Theorem arise fluidly and naturally out of the presentation.The inclusion of problem sets in each chapter also enlivens its appeal to a student. Typically, the first problems in each set are easy. But later problems can be quite formidable, and really give a good mental workout of the salient issues just covered in the chapter."},{"rating":"1","title":"Director Deserves to be Shot","review":"I could not watch the entire video.

Needless to say, I wasn't let down. The cards are stale. The backs are boring, and even if they are going for a \\"traditional\\" look, the cards just don't have a \\"used\\" feel like real traditional cards do. The packs that I did purchase had cards in them with \\"production stains.\\" What I mean by that is the scraped look you get on certain cards, especially from the 80's and earlier. The sad thing is that I expect \\"production stains\\" on older cards, but not product made after 1990. Buy this set if you're hardcore or want every card of certain players.

That album sounds more like the real thing, though more dance floor oriented.This album, while enjoyable, just can't quite capture that \\"inexpressible\\" element that makes Shpongle Shpongle. The remixers do a very good job of interpreting the music, sometime changing it almost beyond recognition, but I found myself enjoying the most the tracks that stayed closest to the orginal versions. Given repeat listens on a quality sound system in a dark room, Remixes does reward however.Bottom line: This is a good trance remix album, but it is not a true Shpongle album. But for now, it will do...."},{"rating":"2","title":"Surprise--a good remix album!","review":"I was pleasantly surprised by the quality of this album, and the attention to detail given to these songs by the remixers.Normally I'm not a big fan of remix albums, as they tend to be hit-and-miss affairs. This one, however, is a remarkably cohesive listening experience overall. I suspect that the remixers approached the material with a certain amount of respect for the original songs, and while they each put their own stamp on the remixes, they strive to maintain a Shpongle-esque vibe throughout. By and large, they succeed, making this a very enjoyable disc for any Shpongle fan.Minus one star, however, for the only bad remix on the disc: the Brothomstates Remix of \\"Star Shpongled Banner\\" is a jarring, unlistenable mess that should never have been included on the album. I'm going to burn myself a copy omitting this track, and then all will be well in the Shpongleverse."},{"rating":"1","title":"Purists Will be Disappointed","review":"This disk, though it uses Shpongle material, isn't going to give you the Shpongle fix that other reviewers have suggested.

I cannot recommend this album for anything more than a collection completer."},{"rating":"2","title":"I Wish This Book Were Still in Print","review":"When I was 18 years old I spent a semester in England through a college study abroad program. This was the book that we used in our social studies class. When the class first began, I wasn't too knowledgeable (or even interested) in \\"Europe's linguistic minorities.\\" However, by the end of the class, I felt as if I had a deeper connection with the Irish, Welsh, Scotts, and Manx, if only in regards to their preservation and use of language. Each group had similarities in the ways in which they went about defending their culture, as well as different approaches consistent with their customs.This book was out of print even in 1983, when I had my copy and accidentally left it in England. I really regret losing the book. I only got to read through it once. I would like to be able to read it in 1999 and see if the information still holds up years later."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful Prose","review":"Simply one of the most beautifully written books I've ever read. Winterson seduces your imagination and then breaks its heart."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Read","review":"Not for everyone--it's a stretch on your concepts of time & space, but well worth the effort if you can make it. A very sensitive author."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gorgeous Prose","review":"One of the best books I've ever read. It's a fantasticalnarrative set in the time of Napoleon, but it's not at allan historical novel. There are two narrators: Henri, adwarf working for Napoleon in the waning years of his European campaigns; and Villanelle, a young, sensual woman living and gambling (literally and figuratively) in Italy. Eventually, the two narrators' stories overlap and connect. Ms. Winterson's prose, especially in her descriptions of love and lovers, is breathtaking."},{"rating":"2","title":"Arrogant lesbian trash!","review":"If only this were true. The disquieting thing is that she (J.W) has got under the skin of a small French man and can tell us all with such grace and profundity what it's like to be male, to be male and in love, to be betrayed, to be excited, to be lost. She has a portfolio of emotions awaiting you in this little book which will blow you away. Almost a hybrid of G.G.Marquez and Alan Bennett,it is the most beautiful book I think I've ever read, and the arrogant lesbian trash that claims her for themselves (they know who they are) will never know how much pleasure this can bring to boys and girls of all descriptions."},{"rating":"2","title":"Passion flowing into my eyes, and out into the world...","review":"The second best book ever written, the first being Winterson's Sexing the Cherry. There's simply no comparing Winterson's style with anything else in literature. The richess in those simple words that grab my passion and leave me, heart pounding, looking up from the pages and seeing miracles in the world. So, when I wrote a review for Sexing the Cherry and told you to throw away all other books, I was a little too hasty: keep The Passion, and alternate reading those two books for the rest of your life. Don't even think that you will ever have finished reading these endless sources of imagination, miraculous transformation, and, most of all, passion."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome!","review":"This is a work for which this often overworked word is truly appropriate. The talent of this writer is indeed overwhelming. There were times when reading this book when I just stopped, in awe of the beauty and the incitefulness of some paragraph or sentence or even phrase. This was not easy to do as the narrative, an intertwining of the stories of the chicken cook for Napoleon and a beautiful Venetian born with webbed feet, is a thoroughly engaging tale. There are few works of contemporary literature that can compare to this novel in its ability to really convey the essential elements of passionate love. This was my first exposure to Ms. Winterson's work but certainly will not be my last. If you are in awe as I am of those who create artistic masterpieces using words as their medium then rush to read this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Unresolved Passion of Doomed Romance in Napoleon Era","review":"In her second novel, Jeanette Winterson audaciously deals with one of the most significant giants in the history of Europe, Napoleon Bonaparte, along with lives of people he had screwed in various ways. In countryside of France and Russia, Paris, and unforgettably mystified Venice, the romance of two freakish-but-ordinary-just-like-you protagonists, French soldier Henri and Venetian card dealer Villanelle, gets heated, twisted, and doomed.For Winterson, the story is comparatively linear and straightforward, while as usual the thoughts around time, history, philosophy, happiness, freedom, love, and death, fill up between the incidents. Without a typical happy ending, the author seems to want the readers to carry on exploring Villanelle and Henri's unresolved passions."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the top 10 books I have ever read!!","review":"The passion is a fascinating and captivating book. It is worth reading alone in order to appreciate Winterson's mastery of the English language and her ability spin picture perfect descriptions through the use of original metaphors. Her insight into human relationships and her ability to create two completely different yet credible characters provide the reader with an additional treat. The Passion is realistic enough so that anyone can relate to its plot, yet true dreamers will be enchanted by its elements of fantasy. Winterson is without doubt a woman of rare intelligence and insight. Read this book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Read this book. Mysterious, sexy, tender. Read this book.","review":"This is my other favorite book (the first being _One Hundred Years of Solitude_). My husband introduced me to Jeanette Winterson before we got married. I still love both of them.I fell in love with Henri, the main character. I loved and hated everyone he loved and hated, though not at the same time. I watched him make judgments and questioned them, feeling that there were desperate consequences, but never a clear right or wrong.It's called _The Passion_ for a reason. What seem like bizarre details twist around each other transforming the strange into the mystical, the odd into the fascinating.It's fantastic. It's real life the way that it sometimes feels--inexplicable, impossible, and magnificent."},{"rating":"2","title":"A parable of myth, magic and love","review":"Winterson's writing is always unique--but there is a beautifully peculiar, Orlando-like surrealism to this novel... Set in a mythical, magical Venice where magic and deceipt are inseparable from reality and truth, this novel is deeply involving and startling almost every few pages (if not every page!).I don't want to spoil the plot for anyone... But suffice it is about (literally) giving one's heart. Sounds cliche'd, but it's not. Nothing of Winterson's can be. You will find yourself immersed in the dream-like intensity of this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Passion is hardly the word for it....","review":"being an italian-american, i have always held a certain place in my heart for all things italian. this book has certainly made its way there, not only because of where it took place, but the mellifluous and incredible language used to write it.

A MOST DAMNABLE INVENTION: DYNAMITE, NITRATES, AND THE MAKING OF THE MODERN WORLD surveys the many changes the discovery of dynamite brought to the world; from the environmental damage it caused to the wealth it brought to its inventor, whose remorseful conscience led him to leave his estate to the establishment of the prizes which bear his name today. Nitrates were next on the list of discoveries, fostered by German scientist Fritz Haber whose breakthrough prolonged the First World War and helped triple the population of the world.

I was a little disappointed because the plot is very slow and not that interesting, and the dialogue is not very deep or memorable. It lacks most of the lyrical qualities of \\"The Last Unicorn\\" in both plot and style. However, I don't think this a bad book!!! Its just different, that's all. I'm sure that Beagle had a different audience in mind. If I were 10 or 12 I would be raving about this book for sure! Call it a \\"Last Unicorn\\" for elementary school readers. \\"The Last Unicorn\\" is a difficult book after all, full of beautiful poetry, deep characters, and detailed descriptions. Perhaps this is a good stepping stone for younger readers to use... and eventually discover \\"The Last Unicorn!\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Just could not get into this book","review":"I usually love Beagle, but nothing in the book caught my attention. Beagle's typically poetic writing style was absent from this work. An absense felt all the more because Unicorn Sonata was cursed with a bad plot. Not that the concept was bad, it just moved too slow. In fact, the plot often came to a complete halt. Perhaps, this is because this book seems to have been written with a younger audience in mind than most of Beagle's books (I would say ages 8 and up). I just felt this book was missing the magic his books usually possess, or perhaps I am too old for the magic in this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Book full of wonder, beauty and the fantastical","review":"This book is one of the best I have ever read.

Very, very highly recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"There's no plot!","review":"I'm a big fan of Peter S. Beagle and I certainly don't deny that he can write wonderfully and create an appealing fantasy world. However, the main ingredient of story is conflict, and there is essentially none in the Unicorn Sonata. Sure, Indigo gets a bit sulky, but the major part of the book comprises Joey going to the unicorn world, having fun, and - that's all. If you are new to Beagle, start with \\"The Last Unicorn,\\" or \\"The Innkeeper's Song,\\" both of which are great books, with actual plots."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fall asleep and dream of this beautiful fantasy world","review":"I am a huge fan of the last unicorn and I've been collecting unicorns since I was a little girl (When The Last Unicorn movie came out in 1982).

I am still happy with the rest of the movie since it is a major improvement over the broadcasted version that I had recorded in VHS, but I don't understand why that one scene was removed from the DVD.

Great plot, good action, unexpected ending, with love thrown in."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Pacino Classic, if no Scarface","review":"Carlito's Way is a solid crime movie, with its share of action and drama. Sean Penn is in strong form as the supporting character of the sleazy lawyer that helps Pacino's character Carlito throughout the movie. I wont talk much about the plot, except that it comes full circle, much like scarface, yet is not as satisfying of a crime movie. However, in its own right, it is a great Pacino film and a must have among crime films like Casino and Goodfellas."},{"rating":"2","title":"My Favorite Movie!","review":"A true hollywood epic.The cast of this movie is a virtual who's who of great actors from the last twenty years.Each playing a compelling character in an irresistibly fascinating story.Love, Sex, Violence and tragedy.It's all here.Many extra features enable you to enjoy this movie more than ever before.A must have for fans of any of the stars of this movie"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Movie From the Middle to the End","review":"This movie gets a 4 because the middle to the end of the film was really good. That's where all the action and drama come up. The beginning of the movie was not all that interesting as the last part was,the way I see it. The end was filled with all the backstabbings, betrayals, really smart moves, and action! I was glad when Carlito's (pacino) lawyer got dealt with in the end because he was so shady and conniving that no one knew it. Seriously, you could call this a Scarface-remake movie since Pacino,the thug dons, and thug storylines are in it, only thing is he tries to be good, though it's not that easy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pacino/Penn/De Palma at their best.","review":"This film came to me highly recommended, and I pass it on highly recommended.

The opening scene is inspired...good stuff. Great personality development. Excellent plot and devices...typical racketeering gangsta flick stuff. The only thing I really disliked about the movie...but was a big part was the romantic element. I thought Penelope Ann Miller was a bore. They could have written out her character and the film would have been all the better for it. Sean Penn's acting was really good considering I was feeling pure disgust for him during the entire movie. Of course, I think his makeup and hair had a lot to do with this. Save your money on this one.

It's probably the first of Pacino's worst films (his streak is still going strong)! I love Pacino's early work, but ever since this one, he REALLY started to suck. He should never try to impersonate a latino EVER again... His effort was simply offensive, esp. with all of the great hispanic actors out there practically begging for work. Another example of Hollywood at it's worst (and most obvious)... Stop the Madness!!!And for those of you out there who think I'm so different from you, ya oughta' know that I even have a friend who's IN this movie, not to mention I love these TYPE of movies (i.e. The Godfather, Scarface, The Sopranos, Good Fellas, Traffic, etc.) AND most of all, I'm a HUGE Brian DePalma fan!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Previews ruin it!","review":"Great movie, F***ing terrible DVD.

Absolutely ridiculous!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Restrained DePalma","review":"The Bottom Line:Probably a better film that Scarface when you come right down to it (though certainly less iconic), Carlito's Way is an engaging drama about a criminal (Pacino in top form) trying to go straight that avoids the cliches you would expect, features a wonderfully scuzzy performance by Sean Penn as Pacino's lawyer, and has a couple of standout sequences (the pool hall scene is a truly great one); Carlito's Way is marred a little by its curious choice to show the ending first but it's really a fine film that's deserves a better reputation than it has.3.5/4"},{"rating":"2","title":"Pacino and DePalma Do It Again","review":"Pacino is the man.

Carlitos Way is a fast paced action/adventure film where the characters of the film are strongly developed. Carlito Bergante is a strong willed, reformed individual in New York City whos past keeps coming back to haunt him as he trys to walk the straight and narrow.

This is an excellent movie for anyone but a definite must see if you are an Al Pacino fan. Carlito slowly gets pulled back into the life he lead before because he is trying to help the people he cares about. I'm not gonna tell the whole story because I dont want to ruin it for those who havent seen it. But this is a great movie and I recommend it for everyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"I HAD TO CHECK MY DAY PLANNER...","review":"and make sure it wasn't 1975 and I was late for high school. DePalma's got the mood and atmosphere so exact I was certain I could still get Chrysler stock at $3.00 a share. CARLITOS WAY is another Pacino character development exercise that probably would be better remembered had it not come on the heels of his Oscar winning work in SCENT OF A WOMAN. What is unforgettable is Penelope Ann Miller's stage/pole dance sequence (I can't listen to Cheryl Lynn's \\"Got To Be Real\\" the same way again). A lot of familiar faces from other Pacino work and the usual great half dozen quotable lines. Sean Penn deserved a Best Supporting Actor nomination...the high perm alone should have nailed it for him."},{"rating":"2","title":"'Here come da pain!'","review":"In 1983,Brian DePalma and Al Pacino collaborated to make the greatest movie of all time,Scarface.Ten years later they re-united to make \\"Carlito's Way\\",it doesn't quite scale the heights of their previous masterpiece but it is still a terrific movie. Carlito Brigante is an ex-con just out of prison determined to go straight.But his past keeps coming back to haunt him. Carlito is like an older,wiser version of Tony Montana.Al is excellent as usual.He looks the essence of cool with his slick Puerto Rican accent and beard(reminiscent of \\"Serpico\\",perhaps?) Sean Penn is brilliant as Al's coked up lawyer David Kleinfeld, who has hair like Art Garfunkel and glasses like John Lennon. I hope DePalma and Pacino will make another film together again in 2003."},{"rating":"2","title":"Carlito's Way","review":"I was absolutely hooked from begining to end. Carlito's Way has always been one of the most under rated Mob flicks ever released.

I love Luis Guzman in this movie and Al Pacino of course. I also thought that Penelope Ann Miller did a pretty good job with her part. This movie is up with Scarface and A Bronx Tale in my opinion b/c it focuses on more than one point throughout the movie. I was never bored during the whole movie and the climax was tremendous. The whole scene at the Grand Central Station was exhilirating and even though you already knew what was going to happen you couldn't wait to see how it happened. At the same time I didn't want to see what would happen. I love Al Pacino and gangster films 4-life, go rent it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Movie I have ever seen","review":"I don't know what is wrong with you people. This is the worst Brian DePalma film, Al Pacino's worst film, and quite frankly the worst movie I have ever seen.

The novel, which is short by today's standards, 128 pages, is weak. The plot consists of an interesting trip through space to meet some interesting aliens, but also some boring diplomacy which Blish tries to make more interesting by piling on lots of silly melodramatic moments, including what amounts to a courtroom scene in which the star witness climbs out of his sickbed to provide crucial testimony. Worst of all the first half of the book consists of stereotypical cardboard characters sitting around yakking away.You might like this if you are interested in pacifistic SF in which aliens have to keep us violent humans in line, or were wondering about James Blish's theories on education, popular music and censorship, but otherwise I have to advise that you steer clear."},{"rating":"1","title":"One of James Blish's few none Star Trek novels.","review":"If you are a fan of the novelizations of Star Trek episodes done by James Blish, then this is a novel you will want to eventually get.The Star Dwellers is a simple story of earthlings and alien \\"angels\\".

My problem is that the book seemed to be a series of short stories, and the author says in the introduction that parts of the book have appeared in previous publications. My only interest was in the main character Rachel and her mother, and there just wasn't enough of that plot for me. Even though Glatt used different ways to tie in the stories of the other women, I did not think of the book as a novel.

I was very disappointed!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Beautiful Novel About Being a Woman","review":"Lisa Glatt's novel, A Girl Becomes a Comma Like That is a wonderfully written novel concerned with essentially what it is to be female in contemporary American society. Rachel, the protagonist, is dealing with relationship failures and successes, her mother's bouts with breast cancer, abortion, birth control, friendship, weight gain and many other issues women confront. The novel will make you think about all of these issues, but it will also make you laugh and make you smile. Rachel is not a perfect protagonist. She'll annoy you sometimes with the choices she makes, but in the end that is what makes this book so compellingly readable: Rachel's humanity.

This book shows so little understanding, and the characters in it are so weak, that reads like a book a man had written about women. (Though, it also reminded me somehwat of Anais Nin autobiography - self-absorbed, self-searching, without being self-aware.) The only character that seems the slightest bit realistic is Georgia, the teenager, whose flatness and overractions can perhaps be attributed to adolesence."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of my Time!","review":"In my opinion, this book lacked plot and an interesting storyline.

Francis Bacon's works, and words, are presented in a profoundly moving volume,with exquisite reproductions and intelligent essays by curators and friends.Bacon's haunting, provocative creatures writhe with intense agony. They reflect an inborn fatality and atheism, and are relentless in their unflinching starkness of vision.

Basically, he teaches no divorce and no remarriage for any reason. He ended up here because he believes in the 'perspiscuity of Scripture' which means that what the Bible says is clear to a reader. These divorce verses are anything but clear as we have lost the 1st century context. He does do a good job of identifying some of the puzzles, but solves them like a Gentile, not a Hebrew. (Hint: The writers of the NT (except for Luke) were Hebrews.)

Instead of focusing on the camp instructors, this novel concentrates on a group of campers that come together and bond over the course of the camp. We meet each one and learn why they came and some of their life's story. As they bond, they decide to work on sections of a quilt for when they meet again in a year. Over that time, we see how their lives change and how they meet the unexpected challenges that come their way. I liked that the focus of this book was on the quilt camp participants and how they bonded together to not only work on their quilt, but to each work on the major issue in her life.

An excellent easy reading for a new Mulsim convert such as myself.However the second half of the book gets into topics such as racism, black history, ideals of Malcom X and Louis Farrakhan and the idea of white people being the devil. The author does't present these topics as something members of the Nation of Islam would have to put up with since these ideas are all not of the Quran.

Adults who experienced abuse as children are usually well aware of that abuse. This book deals with uncovering the abuse, and then takes, in my opinion, controversial steps at therapy. Those steps include a \\"reconstruction of the past\\" in essence fabricating lies and letting those lies replace the truths of the abuse. I, for one, was looking for a way to defeat the anger I feel, not reconstruct my past into some idyllic existence. For me, living a lie where I remember parents who never existed would only be compounding the problem.So, I cannot recommend this book as part of an affective regimen of therapy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too much self-advertising","review":"I've enjoyed Graden's previous books much more.

He created science out of nothing and hit the target many times. I bought this and The Airlords of Han for my new Kindle because I thought a \\"Buck Rogers device\\" needed to have Buck Rogers on it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Delightful!","review":"I want to be Phryne when I grow up. She's smart, resourceful, talented and independent. She is wealthy, but remembers what it was like to be poor. She cares about people and can distinguish between the criminal and the misguided. This is a quick short, quick read that is well plotted, has wonderful supporting characters that kept me involved from the first page. Although this entry isn't quite as strong as others in the series, it is still a delight to read. I'm delighted Poisoned Pen Press is publishing this series for the U.S. audience."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very BIG, but very useful","review":"My only beef with these mugs is that they're so big. I own the smaller Fiestaware mugs too, and I complained about those being too small, but seriously - I wish there were a middle ground. Though I'd take 'too big' over too small any day. You can have a big cuppa tea or coffee or soup with these things. An excellent multitasker, I've even used mine to store cups of broth in the freezer. These definitely need some sort of tight-fitting lid developed for them for better storage in the fridge or freezer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect fit under a Senseo Coffeemaker","review":"I like a big mug of coffee, and the Senseo coffee maker just does not have that much room under the spout.

Great mugs, I love them!"},{"rating":"2","title":"perfect but just a bit too big","review":"brilliant nicely shaped monster mugs. look great, but we still keep reaching for the old regular-style non-fiestaware mugs cause the jumbo ones are often just too much (and we live in texas, where oversized is always better). definitely agree with previous reviewer who wishes there were an in-between size from fiestaware. those little mugs with the pretty but useless ring handles don't work, and the wonderful jumbo mug is overkill for normal use. i'd vote for keeping the design, just scaling it down a bit."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Bag ...needs some design changes","review":"I like this bag alot. Sturdy, functional, great capacity. So far the only draw back I observed is that the shoulder staps are to close together.I am 6'5\\" 270lbs with a 19 1/2\\" neck. The straps adust enough to allow the bag to ride right( although the padding could have been 5\\" longer. doesnt affect my rating) the biggest issue I have is that the straps squeeze my neck a little to much. I do realize that I am slightly out of the range of normal or avarage size and that I think the bag should be perfect for most individuals that buy this bag I highly recomend the bag and am thinking about buying a secound if I can find the woodland camo pattern bag availble.Buy the bag I don't think you will regret it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Huge bag!","review":"This bag is huge!

I always hated that the duffle is top loading. This one has a long zipper that give you access to the entire bag lengthwise. Has a shoulder strap too, but not really useful if you are using to it haul gear in the Army.It is accepted by the Army rules \\"not to exceed 62 linear inches.\\" It also has no wheels which is also standard.The ONLY issue I have with this bag is that it has 4 \\"pegs\\" on the bottom of the duffle. While nice to have, when your bag gets thrown from Army trailers to commercial air, to C17, to C130, to Blackhawks, it takes a beating. Those 4 little pegs gets ripped away very easily. i had to pull it all out and duct tape the bottom. So...it doesn't last.I hope the manufacturer will get rid of those pegs. Otherwise a great bag, reasonable price, but probably will only be used for 1 deployment to get my stuff into and out of theater."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awkward top opening plus late delivery equals return","review":"I'm retired military & the bag is engineered awkwardly. The top zipper which leads to the large storage compartment stops short on each end making it not open fully. Yeah you can store a lot but getting it in and out would be restrictive especially with all the straps. It reminded me a lot of my old Army duffel and flight bag. You can put a lot in it but try to find something easily or get it out not so much fun. Just not what I thought it would be and it arrived late anyway so I am returning it. I could also see what people meant about the bottom feet. They could easily snap off. I will say it does have quality material & zippers but its design wasn't as great as some of the reviews here. I bought a $20 bag that I could store just as much stuff locally that gave me complete access to the storage compartment to take on my trip."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice acoustic folk album","review":"NOTE: Before I give my brief review, I want to point out that the only other review of this download (at the time of this posting) was NOT actually for this album. That 2-star review, dated May 26, 2007, was for a different album by the same artist.With that clarification in place, this has easily become one of my favorite Christmas albums. Steve and Joy Guiles share vocal duties, both of them alternating between the melody and pleasant, somewhat folksy harmonies. The gentle acoustic guitar work perfectly complements the vocals. In addition to the unique renditions of Christmas classics here, there are also two very good original songs on the recording. Best of all, the overall tone of the album is devotional and Christ-centered, as a good Christ-mas album should be."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very nice pair of shoes at a very reasonable price.","review":"I bought these shoes because they were so inexpensive thinking that if I didn't like them, I would just toss 'em.

My iRiver H320 does fit snugly into the case. Contrary to what another reviewer wrote, there are two leather holders attached to the bottom plate that you have to fold into place. By folding those holders into place, the H320 is supported from the top and bottom so that it won't slide out of the case! (Helps to read the directions as I found out) The case also comes with a detachable belt clip so that I can attach it to my belt whenever I'm outside or at the gym. If you're not satisfied with the original case that came with the H320, then perhaps you should look into this one.

I used to not be able to put the Myth books down; now I almost have to force myself to finish them. This time it's credit cards and identify theft - once again, they aren't part of the story like Asprin used to write, they are the entire purpose of the story. Now with gratuitous violence and a formulaic protracted cliffhanger ending in the form of a big fight scene between Aahz and the Skeeve imposter - totally out of character and NOT what I read Myth books for. I've bought one or two more after this one, but I see there's a new one out (Myth-Chief) and I don't think I'll bother."},{"rating":"2","title":"My first Myth novel and I loved it!","review":"This is the first Robert Asprin book I've read, and I wasn't disappointed. I had heard that he was a genius of the comic fantasy genre, and after reading this tale I couldn't agree more. For the shopaholic in me, this novel was a delight. I loved the spin they put on the Master Card and also the parody with certain parts of Lord of the Rings, in particular:One Card to rule The Mall, One Card to Charge It, One Card to cruise The Mall, and in the darkness Lodge It\\".Such a great story of the kind of fun you can have at a shopping mall, when it is multi-dimensional.

The first twelve or so books were pretty good, and quite fun. This one...was not.Where to start? First, like the later Xanth novels, this suffered mightily from the desire to be funny, but lacked the cred. Introducing a distant location and filling it with zany jokes and madcap is a good sign that something is terribly wrong. Having the characters run around without any kind of character development, at all, is another good sign.Let me say, though, that I disagree with so many that the problem is Jody Lynn Nye. I think that it is really, really hard to maintain the funny forever. I guess perhaps eventually Robert Aspirin lost it. <Shrug>.Harkius"},{"rating":"1","title":"Useless","review":"You get what you pay for.

I guarantee the target age group will enjoy it even more. Western culture seems bent on dumbing down. Here is a story about Asian culture that treats its intended readership with respect. And it's not just a gripping mystery story: tough, adult, concepts are introduced, but finely adjusted to maturing sensibilities. The samurai ethic is key to this story but the reader is left to make his or her own evaluation of that ethic. And then, there is the wealth of Japanese culture that is interwoven in the adventure story in a most alluring way: swords, the tea ceremony, the Edo era division of society into rigid social groupings, the Tokaido Road and its checkpoints, kabuki drama...and... who was it said \\"The play's the thing!\\"? A highly satisfying, thoroughly intelligent book for the young of all ages."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is a book even your mother could love!!","review":"The Ghost in the Tokaido Inn is a richly woven tapestry of fact and fiction set in 14th century Japan. It is not a King kind of scary for which I was grateful.The plot and characters were believable. I learned some things I didn't know about Japanese culture of that era and liked the factual underpinnings. The morals of the story are just as true today as in that century.I think this book has a broader appeal than the 9-12year old audience it targets.

It's a book even mothers can love."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Middle School Read","review":"My son read this book for school.

The opposite of a soundtrack, \\"Decasia\\" is a collection of images taken from archaic, decaying film reels that are used to accompany a musical composition.

I was excited to see that a new full length video had been released, but I was very disappointed in what I saw. The animation is not done very well and it seems like it was just slapped together to make sure it was released before the Christmas season. Annoying things to me include the fact that Rabbit is green, and I remember him being yellow in the original and the fact that it looks like the characters don't blend in with their backgrounds - in other words it wasn't done very well. The original is far superior to this one.My son still looks at it as he is only 2 years old, but as an adult it is a disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"A very disappointing rerun of Disney's daily t.v. cartoon","review":"This video has some new animation introducing reruns of two of their morning cartoon shows.

The book reads like a collection of articles on the subject. Corporate reputation-building is, of course, a very important subject these days. So one would benefit from some original thinking and deep analysis on the subject. Not much of that here, however. You could get the level of treatment the book offers from a perusal of newspaper and magazine articles over the past couple of years.What's amazing is that none of Alsop's sources are disclosed. There is no bibliography, no footnotes disclosing where often highly specific results of corporate rankings and opinion polls should be backed up with authorities. What about the question of the reputation of an author, and his publisher, for solid research and scholarship?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Good layout of a problem, but few solutions.","review":"This book is worth reading just to get a sense of the way the American public views business today. The stories of businesses told in this book are one-sided and even irrational, but without a doubt, they reflect the way American business is seen by the public right now.The problem with the book is that it offers very few ideas on how a business can successfully navigate today's minefield of public perception. As a reader hoping to come away with ideas on how to nurture the public's perception of my business, I instead finished the book feeling that businesses are largely at the mercy of dumb luck and circumstance when it comes to perception. Further, the author admits that businesses are in a \\"damned if you do, damned if you don't\\" situation when attempting to let the public know about any acts of goodwill.This book is well-timed to take advantage of today's anti-business climate, but not of much help for those seeking to find their way through it."},{"rating":"1","title":"delayed","review":"delayed for like 4 months...decided i didnt want to wait and that ruined my 10 dollar off deal."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy it","review":"unless you want to replace it every 30 days.

Mac Mall is an extremly gifted rapper. He is one of those artists whojust tells what he sees, feels and thinks. Some of the best producers worked on that album - Mike Mosley, Ric Roc, Khayree, Ant Banks, Cold 187um and others. Mac Mall raps about mainly about life on the streets and his own way to success. Just one track features other rappers. It's one of the albums best tracks - \\"Pimp or Die\\" and there Ray Luv and Young Lay just tear it up. This is a very good album, it has perfect music to it and Mac Mall (a.k.a. Baby Capone) proves that he is one of the most talented young rappers out there in the industry. He is real, and he ain't no wanna-be hustler. He just tells it how it is.

I liked the alternating tales of the eleven year old Pocahontas, and the woeful John Smith, who was somewhat of an egomaniac if one is to believe the author, who took the story from Smith's own diaries.It, of course, dispells all the romantic fantasies of Pocahontas saving Smith's life. In fact, she married John Rolfe, not Smith.For all his complaining about being mistreated for his lack of family connections, John Smith probably was the hero he portrays himself to be. Otherwise it seems Jamestown would have failed miserably.Some of the most interesting details involve the infighting, which at times turns deadly, the treason, selfishness, and other human faults and frailties revealed in Smith's accounts.Readers will also enjoy the story of the eleven year old Pocahontas, and the \\"royal\\" lifestyle she enjoys as her father's favorite daughter."},{"rating":"1","title":"Difficult Read","review":"I do not recommend this for 12 yr old. Hard to read, to say the least. Written from John Smith's point of view. This book tells the story as if John Smith were talking in the 1600's, which makes it very hard to relate to and to understand."},{"rating":"2","title":"5th Graders Review","review":"I REALLY LIKED THIS BOOK BECAUSE IT GOES BACK IN TIME WHEN THIS ACTUALLY HAPPENED.

I ALSO LIKED THE PART WHERE THE CHIEF (POCAHONTAS' DAD) AND SOME OF HIS MEN GO TO TRY TO MAKE PEACE WITH THE COATMEN. MY FAVORITE PART WAS WHEN POCAHONTAS GOES WITH HER DAD TO SEE THE COATMEN AND TRY TO TALK WITH THEM. I ALSO LIKED THIS BOOK BECAUSE IT IS LIKE HISTORY IN A FUN KIND OF WAY.

That amazing, man made universe, with infinite gateways to other worlds and universes. This book takes a shocking turn from incredibly advanced technology, to a world of steamboats and plant life on the verge of sentience. But don't get me wrong. If you can set aside the future shock of Eon and Eternity, I know you'll love this book. Legacy stands on its own as another of Bear's imaginative and masterfully written stories. I am greatly looking forward to reading his latest addition to the Eon universe, Lamarckia. I don't believe it's released yet, but I recommend you search Amazon.com for it, just in case it has since the posting of this review."},{"rating":"1","title":"Misleading","review":"I am a huge Bear fan-but this book reminds me of Orson Scott Card milking his Enders Game success ad nauseaum.The most charitable explanation I can think of is that Bear didn't even write this book-perhaps it is ghost written. The connection to EON and ETERNITY is laughable.If you are in the mood for an Edgar Rice Burroughs style Tarzan novel from the 30's -you might find this interesting.I wouldn't have minded this too much if Bear had been honest about this book and not tried to connect it to EON/ETERNITY. It might have worked as a stand alone fantasy adventure. Hardcore science fiction-this is not. Its going rate of 40 cents on the used list is a good gauge of the value of this book. If I could get my money back-I would."},{"rating":"2","title":"Legacy not quite up to standards of EON and ETERNITY","review":"I have read almost all of Greg Bear's books and loved EON and ETERNITY as well as THE FORGE OF GOD and ANVIL OF STARS. I found LEGACY a little disappointing compared to EON and ETERNITY, which preceded them. The narrative spends a lot of time on the human interactions of the characters, and not much time on the technological concepts of the flaw and gate openers, which I missed. I did finish this book and at times was quite spellbound by it. Not Mr. Bear's best work, but a must-read if you have read EON and ETERNITY."},{"rating":"1","title":"More Political and Nightmarish Styled Sc. Fiction","review":"Not a typical Syfy book.

When a story is told in first person you expect to get into the character's head a little bit and understand their motivations. This never really happens with this book.

It wasn't from the library, I didn't buy it a rummage sale, didn't get it a the book trader, nobody gave it to me and I certainitly wouldn't have bought it. I have no idea how I got it but I was so glad to get rid of it.I'm glad the author knew a thing or two about horses.

Upon opening it and plugging it in, the lighbulbs shorted out in one of the projectors after being on for about five minutes. We took it back to the Discovery Channel store where we exchanged it (they were very apologetic about it, and had no problem exchanging it even though we bought it on amazon). We had the new one a little less than a week and it started malfunctioning. It wouldn't shut off at times, the motor seemed to make a grinding noise at others. The computer wouldn't let you navigate off the welcome screen, so getting to the command to light the projector wasn't even possible. Ultimately we decided to exchange it for a full refund and just get him something else. He was really bummed though, because while it did work it was pretty awesome.

That service I rate high, but now the second one has had the same issue and is also not working. It is EXTREMELY sensitive and has a short life.I wish it worked and lasted longer than a few months.

After that, a bulb burned out and it stopped rotating altogether - and would only project the stars at the north pole.It has the most information, the best features, and the most thorough (northern and southern hemisphere) coverage. However, you can't use any of that once it stops working.My 10 year old daughter treated this as if it were fragile glass and went to sleep to the starscape every night. She LOVED it!When it suddenly stopped working, we called the technical support - willing to buy parts, bulbs, etc. But, they informed us that they don't really sell the bulbs - even though that's what it says in the manual - and they haven't got any support suggestions. So, they were useless. No refund, no return, no exchange - out of warranty and out of luck.Unfortunately, there is nothing out there that compares to this in terms of features and price. So, we will simply do without."},{"rating":"1","title":"Inaccurate!","review":"We bought one of these, but had to return it because the stars were rising in the west and setting in the east.

Its one of the few planetariums that actually project white stars instead of the inverse. Unfortunately, it was plagued by defects related to low quality. At first, a wire became disconnected from the planet projector light bulb. I soldered it back on and it worked. But ultimately what did it in was the failure of a position sensor on the main projector mechanism. The projector would keep turning and turning even after hitting the mechanical stop.

Although it doesn't really impress me on the lyrical tip, I can't get enough of their production. They have the most unique east coast flavor since DJ Premier. I personally think that they could do better lyrically, but that was never their strong point anyway. Their lyrics aren't garbage, they just tend to have limited subject matter (thug rhymes).

My other complaint is although it was well-packaged, by the time I had cut the tape and removed the tissue from each teardrop, I had a tangled mess. I was nearly ready to throw it away before I got it untangled. Anyway, now it is hanging on my front porch and makes a nice decoration. The colors are vibrant and the it seems well-made. Surprisingly, it does not tangle, even when the wind blows it. I do wish it had clear line or thin wire instead of the black nylon cords holding the teardrops, but that's not a big deal.

We're living in an emo-saturated world whether we like it or not! The Transit War will fit nicely in the DJ's playlist, right between Taking Back Sunday and Jimmy Eat World: why they aren't already getting a ton of play seems odd to me. There're a ton of kids who'll eat this up (in a good way!) once they hear it. Now, don't misunderstand: these guys aren't breaking any new musical territory. Although I don't detect any direct influence, I definitely image The Transit War appealing to fans of Rival Schools, Retisonic, Errortype: 11, and Texas Is The Reason. The strength of this band lies in the fact that they're doing what others are doing SO much better. Sorta like the Stone Temple Pilots of emo, I guess.

Or rather there are better choices. One other significant disadvantage of this book is that it is traditional, and lacks new ideas or approaches such as put forth by Deming, Scholtes and Coens.Of course the manager who likes to read on these topics will also gain.

Brauer's book entitled \\"Handbook of Pyrotechnics\\" should not be titled this at all. It is not a handbook by any stretch of the imagination as handbooks are how to make and how to do books and this is neither. It has,at least,20 year old out dated,too general information on pyrotechnic devices mostly used in the Aerospace Industry in it's infancy. It wouldn't raise the eyebrow of an Aerospace Engineer of today nor of anyone else I suspect. It is much too general in it's coverage, but the technical data it does have falls into the catagory of useless information. It doesn't even have the basic formulas for black gunpowder or flash powder, two mainstays of the pyrotechnic world. If you are looking for a handbook on pyrotechnics, this is not it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Embarrassing quasi-porn","review":"This book is an old-fashioned, \\"shock the middle-class\\" novel, circa 1962, but actually written in the mid-1990's.

Instead, I found myself very disappointed with this novel. While some credit his use of characters of moral ambiguity, I found his characters rather unbelievable, unlikable, and therefore uninteresting. The main character, Mickey Sabbath, might be complicated and, some might argue, \\"deep,\\" but his bizarre and crude antics make it difficult to care when so you have to struggle painfully through hundreds of pages of convoluted back story supposedly explaining why he has slipped so far. I found the numerous and sometimes gruesome sex scenes distasteful, despite the fact that I am usually neutral or even glad to have such content. Overall, I found this novel boring, disgusting, tedious, and forgettable. All in all a pointless read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beautiful Prose But No Redeeming Value","review":"I truly enjoy dark characters, but this book provided no entertainment what so ever. However well-written, I could not appreciate the \\"hero's\\" horrible treatment of wives, friends and lovers. Although nearly every page is about sexual exploits, they were not remotely erotic. Of course, erotism was not the point of the book. But maybe it could have made the read more bearable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another National Book Award Flop","review":"Apparently there's something special about Philip Roth and his writing that escapes me. This novel was a complete waste of my time. I struggled to the middle then simply dumped it. The story is about a self-loathing, conflicted, sexually addicted misogynist who has lost all connection to anything humane. The writing style is dull and after 200 pages I didn't find a single character likable. The story is laced with the main character's sexual escapades but after a while even that loses it shock value and becomes numbing. It's good to see that I am not alone in my assessment of this novel. From the reviews posted you either really enjoy it or not. For me . . . NOT! Can't recommend this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tiresome and tedious","review":"For a novel that garnished such high praise, I expected better. I had to work and force myself to finish.

I have not read anything else by Phillip Roth, so I cannot attest that this is how all of his books were, but I think I just did not like his style. Basically, every page had some sort of vulagrity on it, and to me it served no purpose. The characters were, in general, not likable. They were not the type of people I would like to know, and thus don't enjoy reading about them. This book could be enjoyable if you can identify with sabbath in some way, but since I couldn't, I did not enjoy it. (It was awfully long to not enjoy, too)"},{"rating":"2","title":"one of the decade's finest novels","review":"It pains me to see so many reviewers either entirely miss, or disregard, the key note of this book. That is, quite ironically, loss; the story uses an unconventional, intentionally confrontational approach to depict a sad struggle with spiritual and physical decay. Sabbath's lifelong inability to empathize with anyone (incuding himself) is his downfall and is NOT something Roth celebrates. Disgust with the scatology of this book comes from a reductionist reading; we can harbor some disgust only while taking up the challenge of feeling pity for the repulsive puppeteer, particularly in the masterful and heartbreaking encounters with Uncle Fish, his parents' graves, and all things past. An inspiring book, written in Roth's trademark lyric American vernacular, to be read and re-read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Obsessive and boring sexology","review":"Having read Roth since \\"Goodbye Columbus\\" I can honestly say that, in spite of his brilliant narrative skills and scintillating dialogue this book's content,the repetitive use of sexual scatology, the obsession with sexual deviance was first shocking and ultimately boring. Compared to \\" The Counter Life \\" it rates a 3 at best. As I struggled through the book I wondered what possessed Phillip to write it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lust personified&#65533;is an ugly thing.","review":"Mickey Sabbath's life is one pathetic misadventure after another. An arthritic street performer, who once used his fingers as his puppets, he lives for his next sexual adventure. Any other ties to humanity, love, trust, honesty, (although he claims this value, he only uses it when it suits him) are lost amidst his pursuit of sexual gratification. Roth has deliberately created a character with no redeeming qualities, and while I admire his skill at developing such a reprehensible human being, I didn't enjoy reading about Mickey Sabbath or the lives he destroyed. No matter how many disastrous situations Roth creates for Sabbath I found myself wanting this to end; the book became a chore to read. Sabbath is a pathetic antihero, not an epic one, and hardly worth Roth's efforts on his behalf."},{"rating":"1","title":"The concept just didn't work for me","review":"This book is fairly well written (although not compared to Bellow or Nabakov or Self). However, there is an unforgivable flaw. Who can possibly write a meaningful novel about a lech of a man (a sailor who has had sex with how many prostitiues?) when the man has NEVER contracted an STD? Just blew the credibility of the whole thing for me. If this were more of an attempt at magical realism I guess I could have swallowed it, but this novel really struck me as trying to paint a somewhat realistic portrait...of trying to convince me (of something?). But prostitutes, unprotected sex, and tens of other partners without physical consequences (I suppose there seem to be spiritual consequences)? Sorry, Roth, I just couldn't believe it."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Very Great Dissapointment!!!","review":"Having read other of Philip Roth's novels, quite excellent indeed, I went out and bought Sabbath's Theater.

Christina Ricci only had a small role but it was memorable as the American gal who cheerleads and tries to seduce Jared Leto.

This movie deals with Frankies problems with his mother (Katherine O'Hara) who only wants him to date a certain religion , his father (Gabriel Byrne) who is always away acting, getting enough courage to talk to these two girls who he's obsessed with, and of course planning a huge beach party at the end of the summer.

I never got into the Puffy craze a couple of years ago. I saw him as a joke. The more that I looked at him from an outsider's view, the more I realized his ego was too big for his body. He makes a complete fool out of himself every time he appears on MTV, which for some reason, he thinks he owns. He uses it to make young, impressionable minds think that his music is cool, when in fact it shows a lack of inspiration and is missing any forms of dignity. I gave this cd a fair chance. I listened to it three times through. After the third time I gave it back to my friend and told him to keep it, and I prayed that he would come to his senses. I have never heard such a bad cd in the last few years. When is Puffy going to realize that you cannot base a career on Guest performers? Probably never.

I don't mind the occasional sample correctly implemented into rap, i.e. (Too Short, 2pac, almost every rapper, etc.)but what I do mind is blatently stealing entire songs and just replacing lyrics. Puff Daddy is a no talent producer, not a hard core rapper. I mean, Puffy actually disgraces rap with overused beats and songs that someone else already made. There is so much good rap out there, (Wu-tang, Gravediggaz, Outkast, 2pac, Gang Starr, Phareoh Monch, Saukrates, Snoop, Canibus, etc.) I just can't stand seeing people giving this CD heavily laced with guest appearences, and egotistical crap, 5 stars.

If you are a Puffy fan, this CD is a good buy. If you like rap, make your own decision based on your liking. Writing on here and bashing makes no sense though."},{"rating":"2","title":"hes still ok","review":"Well I CANT give him credit for copying my favorite song I got 5 on it!but I can give him credit for trying to do his best and for being fine!"},{"rating":"1","title":"HORRIBLE","review":"sean combs has not a talented bone in his body...he cannot rap, he cannot produce(look at the credits for life after death-you'll notice that not one song is produced solely by puff daddy...they are all produced by puff daddy and someone else)"},{"rating":"1","title":"SAD AND A DISGRACE TO HIP-HOP !","review":"THIS GUY IS SAD, IM BIG HIP-HOP FAN BUT PUFF IS A DISGRACE.

On his latest stupefied recording, he prays to God, has a benighted conversation with Jesus Christ and basically tries to amalgamate unrestrained hedonistic behavior in the face of trying to act pious!??! If that weren't enough, he sadly reiterates the overproduced nature of the first album (minus plagiarisms). His lyrics, this time around, still have absolutely nothing empathetic to say about anyone who's not living a rapacious lifestyle (unless, or course, you happen to be Puff Daddy himself). Puff and his \\"posse,\\" are still spitting out the same deliberately degenerate, misogynist and profusely illiterate dreck.

Bad, Bad Boy","review":"Being the East Coast fanatic that I am. (Hey, even 2Pac was from Brooklyn. Give it up.) And the serious Bad Boy lover that i am, i had to buy this LP the day it was released. I wish i hadn't. There were some really good tracks, such as Reverse, which blended the raw talent of the now incarcerated Shyne and the Dangerous Neck Breakah Busta Rhymes, with the added bonus of Cee-Lo and G-Dep, Sauce Money and others, and the somewhat acclaimed single P.E. 2000, and of course, the Gangsta...track which contained excerpts from Scarface. But the rest of the album was all filler and no thriller. Puffy just couldn't live up to the expectations he'd set for himself after the pretty much all raw talent we saw on No Way Out. The sophmore jitters claim yet another MC. Sorry Puff. The Verdict's In: This LP should've never seen the light of day."},{"rating":"1","title":"I didn't know this was the BLUFF DADDY!","review":"Come on Puff!! We already know you have a lot of money. So why do you keep wasting it on stupid sampling machines? I think just about every song I heard on this LP used some sampled old school beat. You aint foolin nobody man. Stick to producing, not rapping. I mean, you got some great artists on Bad Boy. 112 is hot, Black Rob is hot, Shyne is gonna be hot. You're doin enough already.

But, the #1 rule of sampling is to sample something with GOOD beats. I mean, some (as in 3 or 4) of the songs on this CD have good beats. The lyrics are pretty poor, and the way the CD was done, it seems like this CD was horribly rushed. Puff Daddy is not the same rapper, this CD is a sick combonation of Weak Rap, R&B, and Pop. Puffy, we expected more hardcore. But, I guess we can't kill him, every rapper has one CD that they wish never happened. This CD only sells off Puff's popularity. Even someone REMOTELY interested in rap would find this CD bad. This is like a God dedication album. Very gospel type beats and lyrics. Let me sum it up, this Album SUX, it has slow beats, bad lyrics, and the Guest Stars don't do too much to help the album.

Most of his tracks, if not all, has other recording artist(s)singing with, or for him. If it weren't for them, he certainly would be nothing. In fact, there is not one major hit that he came up with, all on his own, to prove that he has some sort of singing talent. Majority of them are old school remix, that the younger generation never heard of, and thinks that he was the original singer..

Come on! I mean this guy is rapping with the attitude like he's Ra, Slick Rick or KRS. What makes this project so bad is that he's still relying on samples to carry him. Yes, yes, yes, we know everyone samples but there's a big difference when say a DJ Premier samples something and crafts it into a work of art as opposed to Puffy being Mr Jackin for Beats.Now, Puffy lovers out there I'll ask a question like I said with his first realease.

After a long wait for the new Puff Daddy album, us fans were taken aback at the lack of quality shown in this album.

Guest stars featured might add a touch of inspiration to the album, but overall, this album is a flop and a disapointment. Public Enemy number 1? I don't think so.

You, you were on the cleanup crew monday night quarterbacking. Sadly the heroic actions of ALL those involved, from the beginning to the end of the operation, have been marginalized or cast in doubt. There was plenty of blame to go around. For veteran soldiers as Delta Force to belittle those they fought along side shows a lack of grace (and memory).

Estoy de acuerdo con la crítica publicada aquí en Amazon que dice que Esquivel escribió sólo un buen libro (Como agua para chocolate). Esperaba muchísimo más de este libro, y a pesar de lo decepcionante que es leer algo que está mal escrito, continué con el afán de aprender algo sobre el mito de la Malinche. Al acabar el libro me quedé con las ganas, porque no aprendí nada. Así que le doy a este libro 1 estrella y creo que soy demasiado benevolente. No lo recomiendo."},{"rating":"2","title":"Un nuevo perfil","review":"Para todos aquellos que siempre tenemos una ligera inquietud y un poco de antojo por saber mas.. Este libro es un manjar sobre un lado humano de la mal querida Malinche.Una nina que al nacer pronto pierde al padre, la abandona su mama, la cria la abuela y al morir esta su madre la regala-intercambia. Al crecer un poco y debido a su facilidad para aprender lenguajes unos \\"extranjeros\\" la utilizan. Se enamora, desilusiona, se vuele a enamorar... actua con miedo...Es una gran variedad de sentimientos que esta mujer experimenta y por supuesto uno tambien gracias a la gran facilidad de expresion que caracteriza a la autora.Algo mas que no debemos pasar por alto... \\"Como Agua para Chocolate\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Inappropriate choice of materials for a book aimed at age two+","review":"The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends that children under the age of four not be given nuts, popcorn, or raisins, due to the risk of choking. Therefore, it seems rather inappropriate to include these ingredients in recipes and craft activities in a book aimed at children \\"age two years and up.\\" Here are just a few examples of activities from this book that use such ingredients:- Grandma's Granola (Activity 171) contains both nuts and raisins- Popcorn Packaging (Activity 74) contains popcorn- Cereal Balls (Activity 51) contain raisins."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unimpressed. Nothing too novel","review":"I was looking forward to this book after purchasing a simiar one. The vast majority of the suggestings are well... uncreative. Examples: Get popcorn, a blanket, and watch a movie. Make a pillow fort in the living room. Plant seeds in a garden.A much better option IMO is \\"The Preschooler's Busy Book\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"For the Extremely Dull and Uncreative Parents Out There","review":"One of the ideas for creative play the authors offer is to find a hill and roll down it.

The mosaic of perspectives across the Arab world is as differentiated as in the United States. Samar interviews many Christian Arabs too. However, what I found most interesting were the similarities between the cultures.This book seeks to accomplish what politicians of both cultures either refuse to do or think themselves incapable of doing: Creating an authentic dialogue to bridge the understanding of these cultures. The uncensored perspectives refresh, alarm, and bring hope that such a thing as peace can exist if we open our minds and hearts to the voices of others as human beings within our own cultural context.I highly recommend this book to all. Please take a few moments to read some of the sample pages. The Arabs have questions for us Americans too. I wonder if there will be a sequel: American Voices speak to Arab Hearts."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic book","review":"A must-read. This book is very important for every American to read. I truly wish there was a follow-up book written since the last elections. This is a thoughtful and enlightening book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Jarrah delivers a fresh perspective to the Arab","review":"In reading this book, I was delighted to receive the perspective of the Arab. Generalizations cannot work any longer when it comes to the Arab. They are as diverse as Americans and we have to understand the negative ones we have been seeing on tv, reading about in the newspaper , and listening to commentaries of on the radio do not represent the majority Arab. Arabs have a culture different from ours, but that culture is not criminal in nature. Their culture apears to be deeply rooted in religion - be it Christianity or Islam. The criminality we have experienced on 9/11 is the result of the actions of a few Arabs who do not represent their Arab culture. Jarrah helps brings us this understanding and I hope she doesn't stop here. This way, we may learn to not persecute the whole lot of people who are/look Arab."},{"rating":"2","title":"What a great idea!","review":"I've bought this book a few weeks ago and I was facscinated by the facts that I read from ordinary Arab citizens. As an American it made me change the way I view Arabs (Muslims and Christians) in the Middle East and it also made me understand more about our foreign policy and Middle East politics."},{"rating":"1","title":"Universal PDA mount w/ Power Adapter","review":"The cradle for the PDA works just fine as it should being a rather generic and simple design. However, being that the mount is simply plugged into the lighter socket makes it a rather poor design because the mounting arm is long and not stable. It is an accident waiting to happen in terms of knocking the mount over or damaging the lighter socket. Forget this mount and get something more practical and durable; suction cup, vent, or dash mount."},{"rating":"1","title":"arrived with dead battery","review":"Cheap, but arrived with a dead battery and as I was leaving the country and the next day did not return to Amazon.

This watch has been reliable and good."},{"rating":"1","title":"Painting in the primitive style","review":"The book was not as stated. The over was faded and some of the pages were scribbed on.

It's a shame."},{"rating":"1","title":"Genuine transgressive TV--or not?","review":"I really wanted to like this series, I really did, but found a lot of it about as revolutionary or paradigm-shattering as a Berkeley potluck.There's a few good bits--Robert Anton Wilson, Kenneth Anger, Orridge--but CIA-programmed sex slaves, spotty teenage satanists, LA fetish balls...sigh. The kids in LA must really be bored, is all I can say.I'm not underestimating the effort it takes to create a TV series, but the potential for this series was huge. All they had to do was re-create their books, which are pretty good.I've seen more revolutionary stuff on SBS in Australia!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Mixed Bag","review":"I was very disapointed with this DVD set. I'd never seen the show, but I'd bought the companion book of interviews over a year ago and really enjoyed it. Sadly, I found most of the episodes of the TV series to be silly and boring - a deadly combination. I do have to say that the Robot Sex sculpture/animation segment was brilliant though, and almost worth renting the whole set. If not for the second disk with videotape from the Disinfocon speakers, this whole set would be a waste. Even these are a mixed bag, but there are some cool pieces in there. Especially Grant Morrison's speach on Chaos Magic. My advice would be to rent it if you must see it or, I'll sell you my copy..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Big disappointment","review":"I loved reading all the Disinformation books; assumed the TV program would be similar.

It is funny and weird all at the same time. An all around must have movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT What I expected","review":"If you are familiar with the DisInfo series of books then you may misjudge what this DVD is about. It is basically a series of 1/2 hour shows that only played in Britain, then was canceled even there. The cancellation had nothing to do with banning provocative content. There is no provocative content. Instead we are treated to a freakshow-like parade of unfortunates from off the street and elsewhere. This DVD is horrible."},{"rating":"1","title":"low budget, quackery, on par with Weekly World News","review":"I was expecting something truly counter-culture. I hoped to see outrageous people and things. Something funky and cool. Here is what you get:--Low budget--Poor production--Dull, unoriginal content--Unstable, ungroomed social outcasts being interviewed who swear there that time travel is possible and that they did it or they were abducted by aliens, or that they drew blood from Jesus on the cross blah blah blah--Farcical pseudo-science--Loser teenages who call themselves satanists (yawn)--Pathetic conspiracy theories that are not even original or thought-provokingCOMPLETE WASTE OF MONEY!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Terribly Disappointing...","review":"After reading the Disinformation book series, I was anticipating this release and purchased it immediately. Unfortunately, this was one of the most disappointing purchases I've made in some time. Perhaps my perceptions are skewed from the books, but I expected informative and original content on par with those releases. Instead, this DVD is half Jackass-esque comedy, half congratulatory \\"you're not part of the mainstream\\" speeches, and a whole host of is-it-or-isn't-it satire/documentaries. This is a DVD you'll want to skip, or at least rent before purchasing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Completely original and fascinating","review":"A fascinating series of mini-documentaries on major and minor characters in underground culture and thought.

If you've ever seen \\"Real Sex\\" on HBO, then imagine the same format and intent, but retitled \\"Real Weird\\". This is a TV show that shows us how weird we really are underneath those uniforms we wear every day. I have to say that the lecture by Grant Morrison should be required viewing by everyone, and then, as he says: Go Out And DO IT! Since I had no previous exposure to P-Orridge, Morrison, Metzger et al, I'll say, as an outsider, I'm hooked. Watch this DVD!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Notes from the underground...","review":"Having grown up in a family highly influenced by Crowley, Leary and Robert Anton Wilson this was welcome evidence that 'alternative' philosophy and culture is alive and kicking. The shows themselves are fantastic (although I could do without the Brother Theodore stuff), somewhat like a more 'out-there' Daily Show or Insomniac, but the lectures on the second disc are even better at kicking up some intellectual dirt."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great!!! ....at first","review":"At first it started to work great and I could see clearly on the screen but after a month or two, the screen started getting darker and darker and now I can't see anything on it.

When I got news of her death, I was devastated, but immediately sought to find the perfect fairy dress for her. After a whole day of searching, I found this dream dress. I ordered it in white. The price was right and they shipped it right to the funeral home, which was in another state. So, they were easy to work with and very understanding. My niece was beautiful in life, but she never looked more beautiful than when she wore this dress. She truly looked like a fairy princess. It sparkled and was so soft and light.

The centerpiece of the collection is Oppen's wonderful book-length poem-- Of Being Numerous. This Pulitzer-prize-winning poem is concerned with the dilemma of seeing the world through the eyes of solitude versus seeing the world through the eyes of what it is to be of the numerous. Throughout the poem's forty sections the reader is introduced to the meaning of what it is to be \\"of being numerous,\\" warned about the shipwreck of isolation, thrust into the madness of war with all of its atrocities, reminded of the limits of language, introduced to clarity, and finally called upon to realize the necessity for compassion.

Fortunately, my children love to read, and reading has never been an issue for us. But for those of you for whom it is an issue, you can be assured that most of your children will enjoy these books, and they won't grow up to be socio-paths (contrary to what some may say).

Pilkey, trying to be cute, has the kids constantly misspelling words in their comic books. My son, just learning to read and who loves these books, has a hard time understanding why someone would purposely misspell words. A number of times while practicing for spelling tests he has had words on his list that have been in the books and has asked if it's okay to spell his words the same way they do in the captain underpants books.It's nice that Pilkey can create a lucrative business based on potty humor and his inability to draw above a 3rd grade level but for those children learning how to read and write these books can be detrimental."},{"rating":"2","title":"My son is reading!","review":"My 6-year-old son is a good reader, but had no interest in reading. Until he discovered Captain Underpants!!! He can't put the books down! He used to stall when it was bedtime, but now he knows the faster he gets to bed, the more chapters of Captain Underpants he gets to listen to (we are now re-reading and re-reading and re-reading the series so he picks his favorite chpaters for me to read to him).

I am not going to buy another one of this for him. There are a lot of people who cannot write correctly and this is one of the reasons why.

Also, I would not recommend these for children learning to read and write as they are filled with misspellings (picher for picture and shurely for surely). I don't quite get why this is supposed to be funny, but it's confusing and ultimately detrimental for my 8 year old.Finally, parents take note: Pilkey has created a lucrative business based on potty humor and his inability to draw above a 3rd grade level. This is the junk food of the children's book industry. Many young children will find these books funny, but just as we don't allow our kids to eat candy and chips all day, these books should be limited."},{"rating":"2","title":"Capt.

There is no redeeming quality to these books b/c bad behavior has no bad consequence, they are rallied as heroes at the end.

I am not a feminist but I was very interested in the rights of Afghani women in post-Taliban Afghanistan. I found that this book was not the book for me. The author quoted a favorite author of mine (Ahmed Rashid) quite a bit but she seemed to almost be \\"misquoting\\" him. That was sad. He is an excellent source. Read \\"Taliban\\" if you would like a good history of the Taliban up 2000 AD. But beyond this, the author's bias was so incredibly thick, it was hard to wade through this book. What could have been picked out of this text as informational was drug down by her bias."},{"rating":"1","title":"Choking on the Lies","review":"This book is so full of bias and bigotry that I couldn't decide whether to laugh or vomit. The author has an obvious anti-American, anti-male, and anti-aid organization bias that transcends any attempt made to provide accurate information.I am currently living and working in the same areas as the author mentioned, in fact I eat in the same cafeteria. I've yet to see an Afghan get treated with anything but respect by soldiers, guards, and contractors. The author might be so educated that she simply cannot grasp the basics of the current situation in Afghanistan.If she wants to pass on her \\"pie in the sky\\" ideals, then maybe she should consider getting grounded in the facts rather than twist and contort every situation to conform to her worldview.If you like reading venomous words full of lies, then you'll love this book. Otherwise, take it off your wish list."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring Rantings of a Bigoted Woman","review":"In the interest of disclosure, I only read the first 100 pages before my stomach couldn't take anymore. This book should probably be placed in the fiction section.

Back in the mid-70s, though, a version was cobbled together from members of the 'Liege and Lief'-era band plus Sandy Denny's Fotheringay. While they may not have added as much to Fairport's catalog of original songs as other incarnations had, they were a terrific 'live' band and made Fairport lots of lifelong fans (including this one). I played the surface off my copy of this LP and was glad to find this available. Sound is good, bonus tracks are nice, no complaints.

His coming of age is intertwined with literal re-tellings and metaphors of how both he and surfing influenced each other. Of the short stories, many do a wonderful job of capturing the mood and atmosphere that can still be found on the beach at dawn. It was these parts that really captures the reader. An easy read, and a must for anybody who is curious about the surfing community or who just wants to be a little more stoked on surfing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great read","review":"The feeling behind the stories is very real. The writer was able to draw you in and place you in the middle of the events and experiences that were shared. As a surfer the scenes felt familiar and very close to home.

This trio defies classification, I wouldn't necessarily call what they play the blues. I could almost swear I hear licks by Clapton, Hendrix, slide by Joe Walsh, old Lynyrd Skynyrd, even some Al Stewart or Justin Hayward acoustic, and of course echoes of Duane and Dickie -- no surprise that the Allman Bros picked Warren to play guitar for them -- but it's all one virtuoso of a guy. I didn't have to look at the liner notes to hear the harp-player from Blues Traveler (Mule). Some pretty raw stuff here -- I've been the title character of Temporary Saint and it was almost agonizing to listen to. But this is what good music is supposed to do, like good art: move you to experience pain or pleasure.

It is important for the careful student to be aware of the historical context of the Church's teaching and not be limited to only one side of the question.

While these people were in New York City and involved with a professional life that in no way resembles our own, there were many instances which were remarkably similar to the experiences we have had. Regardless of the environment in which we live, the human element remains the same for all of us and the difficulties and rejection we all learned to experience and cope with are as painful and damaging for the more ordinary of us as for Bruhs and Gean.

The problem gets progressively worse and worse. For a while I was using the back of a pencil to dial, but it results in mis-dials 90% of the time.

I have loved my CHI and it has done a great job for several years now. But when I received the FHI Platform I was very disappointed in the lack of quality. It was so bad that I sent it back immediately, which I rarely, if ever do. It wouldn't even get as hot as my CHI that was cutting on and off. It was advertised as getting to 450 degrees and the CHI only to 410. But it didn't nearly get as hot as the CHI. I would estimate that it was maybe 350 at its hottest. That's not hot enough to flat iron curly hair.

I was so angry, that even though I have used chi irons my entire life, I did not want to purchase another. I tried this flat iron instead of the CHI. I brought it back the very next day. Although it is in the same price range, there is no comparison to a CHI. My hair texture is very thick and wavy, I have used flat irons ever since I was very young to tame my hair. It is nearly to my back so very long as well. This flat iron was complete junk to me! First of all, it took 5-10 minutes to get hot enough to style with it. It does not curl well like you can with a CHI flat iron. It barely could straighten my hair. I won't stray from a CHI again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Only ok!!!","review":"So I was super excited to get this flat iron, but ended up very disappointed after the first use!! This flat iron curls beautifully but for some reason if I use it on my mixed/curly hair to straighten, it does not do the job good at all!!! My cheap Jilbere (the light grey one with red plates) straightens my hair much better leaving it soft, silky and bouncy. The FHI iron leaves my hair dull and dry and gives it a horrible texture when straightening... But like I said earlier, it curls very very very nicely so i use the Jilbere to straighten and the FHI to curl...lol"},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing product!","review":"I always loved how my stylist straightened my hair, but I could never replicate it at home. I researched the FHI online and found out that she was using this flat iron so I bought it. I absolutely love it. So many perks: it literally took me half the time as before to straighten my hair, my hair stayed pin straight all day and I didn't need to touch it up at all the next day, and it heats up fast. I was amazed at the results, honestly. I have semi thick, course, curly/wavy hair that I really hate most of the time. Straightening would take forever and by the afternoon it would be so full and wavy that I would have to pull it back. With the FHI, I was able to leave it down all day and no touch ups needed.

I inspected the flat iron and compared it to my other fhi irons and noticed the product is not authentic. The base portion of the cord where it swivels is not the same as the other four irons I have (in various sizes), and the heating element seems to only work in the middle of the plate instead of evenly across among other inconsistencies.

I am a strong believer of good products but I have never bought a flat iron so expensive. First off, I qualified for Amazon Prime which meant my delivery would take 2 days and it was free. The day my FHI heat 1 inch Platform came, I spent 3 hours straightening, curling, flipping and having a great time. I'm thrilled. I have naturally curly hair and it is straight and shiny thanks to FHI. I am going to the FHI Hot Sauce because I cant wait to see the results of the two combined together.

Well long story short the end of 2010 my flat iron just completely stopped working. I did some research and decided to get another FHI Heat Platform iron. I bought it from an authorized dealer an the differences were astonishing:(1) where there should be a registered trademark sign, there is just a degree sign, (2)There is no company information as far as contact information on the box of the non-authentic iron, (3) the iron itself looks different. Whoever makes this fake actually makes a pretty decent iron, but I am sure you can get a flat iron for the same quality for cheaper.

I'm actually a little worried about getting electrocuted lately because you can hear it popping, so I've retired my one year old $90 straightener and am currently seeking another. This is my second FHI straightener and I have course frizzy hair and while it does do the job, my hair submits to heat and humidity very easily and straightening has little effect on subduing that.

She had one lame excuse after another. In my opinion they have no intention of honoring their warranty and provide their staff with a laundry list of excuses.

Do NOT purchase an FHI product."},{"rating":"1","title":"FHI Heat is an awful company","review":"They claim that this straightener does not burn your hair because it heats your hair from the \\"inside out.\\" Also because it produces steam not smoke. Let me just make it clear that if it is making your hair steam, it is drying it out and damaging your hair. I have been very disappointed in this company's products and they will lie all over their marketing to make them seem better than they really are.

IT COMPLETELY BURN OUT MY HAIR!!!!!!!!!! before i knew, my hair basically melted, and was just completely messed up and it was falling off my head. unless u want DAMAGED, BURNT, AN UNHEALTHY HAIR, do not get this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"defective","review":"My daughter as bought this product before and it lasted 2 yrs .

In fairness, I should preface that this is the first new flat iron I've had in 10 years, but I'm incredibly impressed. I have wavy to curly hair - it's wavy/puffy most of the time, but if I use products I can get a curl to come out. Basically, it's near impossible to get it straight, even with my old flat iron. With this one, though, the flat iron heats up fast, straightens my hair fast, and leaves my hair looking healthy - none of that flat iron dead looking frizz. It's also really easy to add a little curl to your hair. Finally I can have magazine hair without spending tons of time or money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not good quality","review":"I've ordered FHI Irons before but for some reason this one was not as good as the previous one I owned. I had to set this iron almost to its highest temperature for it to perform like my other one. Plus I think this one is an older version so it probably explains why it doesn't work properly. Also, the encircled logo where it says FHI has popped off which I found a little odd. I'm basically disappointed and not sure if I should trust the buyer or not because the picture was misleading too (it looks nothing like the iron I received). In short FHI works really well so I am returning this for a better one probably from another buyer as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Too early to give a good review","review":"This was purchased for my teen daughter.

However, I consider it a MAJOR flaw on Amazon's part that they are not presently disclosing in the listing for this item that Amazon is not an authorized reseller and that the manufacturer will therefore not honor any warranty on this item. By not disclosing that Amazon is not authorized and that there is no warranty: 1) Amazon is legally responsibility for fulfilling the terms of the warranty. 2) Much worse, not disclosing that there is no warranty on THIS item puts the warranty on every other item sold by Amazon in doubt.

YOU will not be disappointed with this purchase. .. It heats up to 450 degrees!! I have spent lots of $$ in the past for purchases on hair products and this by far has been the best money spent.

They encapsulate the exhilaration of being so young and so alive. Moreover, in this instance it was a charming idea to ask Harnoncourt's grandchildren and the conductor himself to recite various letters written by the Mozarts during the course of their Grand Tour.But the charm ends there.If you want to hear these miraculous works being conducted by the Wild Man of Borneo, look no further: this offering is for you. Harnoncourt is at his gruffest. He leeches all the grace from these works. Nor has Harnoncourt mellowed over the years: his trademarks as a conductor - the willful tempos and explosive accents - have yet to abate even as the clock winds down.Both Mackerras on TeldecMozart The Symphoniesand indeed Bohm on DGMozart: The Symphoniesare better attuned to the youthful elation of these works."},{"rating":"2","title":"On Str8 Hit!!","review":"Dayton Family's 2nd album \\"F.B.I. is nothing short of being a gangsta classic. They are from Flint, Michigan, and are not very well known, unfortunately. They mesh various styles of rap, often on the same track. They flow somewhat like a mix of Midwest and East Coast rappers over a medley of Midwest beats (fast beats, similar to Bone Thugs at times) and West Coast G-Funk. The song \\"Hand That Rocks The Cradle\\" is an example. It has a complex lyrical content with a mobbish Midwest foreground beat paired with a West Coast classic background beat: a whistly, whiny keyboard synth. They consistently use this method of meshing styles throughout the album, and that makes this one refreshing. They are very hard core, and are very clever lyrically."},{"rating":"2","title":"TDF puts it DOWN!","review":"Im a huge Three Six Mafia fan and I never heard of The Dayton Family until they were featured on a track with 3-6.

It's boring, dry, unimaginative stuff. Not something you'd expect when dealing with a program that has a firm foundation in art, and creativity.The thing reads similar to my Lightwave 6.5/7.0 college text book only with a worse format.So if you're an intermediate, or professional flash user this is might be what you're looking for, but if you're an amatuer or total beginner don't touch this book unless you want bore yourself away from Flash MX before you even get your feet wet."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Support Site!","review":"I have been using Flash for a few years and have bought several books in the past as guides to my work.

It wasn't even written by the artists. It's a running commentary on paintings. The average number of \\"intermediate\\" steps per painting is about 4-5. Each \\"step\\" is actually a different painting started from scratch, so there's no way to compare what changed between steps cause it all did. So much was skipped between enormous amounts of work they felt guilty and tried to make up for it with such sage advice as \\"Mr. Jones prefers to thin his paint with 1/3 damar, 1/3 turpentine, 1/3 linseed oil\\". Or \\"when sketching during sharp-focused-realism be precise\\". Or \\"shadows made it look 3 dimensional\\" I'm exaggerating but I think you get the point."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disappointed","review":"I was rather disappointed with this book and do not recommend it. The only techniques in this book was useless bits of information like a simple color chart, how to hold a paintbrush, and what you should have in your paint-box. There were no techniques on how to oil paint. The book consisted of paintings by different artists being critiqued. The book should be titled something like, \\"Let's try to talk up eleven artists, ten if we subtract the writer\\". With the exception of a few pieces by Ken Davies, the art work in the book is very amateur looking itself. I guess that is why they put them into a book and tried to talk them up. It really deserves minus 2 stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not much help for me","review":"I have not painted in over 30 years, and hoped that this would bring me up to speed. It didn't.

It didn't help me in the least."},{"rating":"2","title":"not THAT bad...","review":"I'm pretty much a complete novice in any form of art, so this book was quite helpful to me. There are several parts I found useful-- how to hold and handle the brush to achieve different effects, comparisons of student paintings to similar professional works, separating 'value' from 'intensity,' etc. I can imagine this book being a waste of time for people who've been in relatively good art classes or who've done enough painting to have learned all of this already, but if you consider yourself an amateur, this is a good place to start."},{"rating":"2","title":"quite useful book","review":"Although may not be properly named as \\"Oil painting techniques\\", it is actually quite useful art book. I specifically like the section of artist Foster Caddell's work. Through his landscape oil paintings, Foster clearly explains to readers how a professional work better than an amateur's painting by comparing both works side by side. He also discusses color contrast and light effects in oil painting which are more important for creating a good art piece in those easy-to-read sections. In addition, this book also lists some other good artists (i.e.Jane Corsellis and Charles Pfahl). To be fair, this book deserve better rating than one star and better value than $1.50 for an used one. For anyone looking for technique instruction of brush work and color mixing, go for another book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic reference book!","review":"I love this book! I was just beginning to learn to paint when I bought it, and it is packed with very helpful information in an easy to read format, with tons of color photos, tips, tricks, everything you need to know to get started if you are a beginner and more.

I highly recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not so good first novel","review":"This book is a pointless waste of your time. You may get through it because the characters start out with promise. But, alas, Ms. Dunlap's skills gave out on her before she could complete the story. You will be unhappy that you wasted your time on this book. However, Ms. Dunlap's, second novel, Liszt's Kiss, is much better and you are most likely to enjoy reading it. It is very well written, tells a good story, and the historical fiction highlights certain French figures we don't often read much about. I really liked it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stick Pins in My Eyes","review":"As a huge fan of historical fiction, I looked forward to reading this novel on a twelve hour train trip. Sadly, only the fact that I was stuck on the train kept me reading it. The plot is wildly contrived. Characters are one dimensional and flip-flop on the same page between good and evil. The idioms spoken by the minor characters are laughable.Details are included that make no sense. Émilie, the main character, counts to six hundred forty-seven thousand and sixty-three seconds one day waiting for the maid and her husband to come home. What??? My twelve year old was reading over my shoulder and asked how this could be a real book. I had no answer for her."},{"rating":"1","title":"shallow and contrived","review":"I am surprised to find so many positive reviews of this book. The writing style is pleasant, but the plot is unbelievable, illogical, and forced. The intrigue that Dunlap tries so hard to create is just downright silly. As one reviewer commented, the characters are \\"ill-defined\\" and do things that \\"defy logic.\\" I couldn't agree more. For instance, a maid becomes single-mindedly bent on destroying Emilie because of a pair of lost slippers. Perhaps scenarios like this could be made believable in the hands of some authors, but Dunlap can't pull it off. One thing I do credit the author for, however, is leaving out gratuitous and detailed sexual themes and descriptions.There is nothing more unsatisfying in a novel than one-dimensional characters, and this book was a chore to complete. Even lousy plots can often be forgiven if only the characters have depth; this book delivers neither. Given Dunlap's education, I expected a lot more from \\"Emilie's Voice.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Take a trip to France!","review":"With Emilie's Voice, Dunlap takes us back in time to the corrupt opulence of Louis XIV's Versailles.

And the shocking end will take your breath away!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A wonderful read.","review":"Susanne Dunlap holds the reader captive through the last page with one of the more intriguing ending I have read in a long time.

I ended up being very dissapointed, and had to force myself to finish it. The plot is ridiculous and doesn't really flow well throughout the book. The characters aren't developed well, and seem to do things which technically go against their character, for example (**SPOILERS**), Emilie, in the beginning of the book, manipulates Charpentier to get her way, but yet her whole time at court maintains her 'innocence' (wouldn't someone with a manipulative streak use that to her advantage?). The maid's every move is motivated by revenge for most of the book, but she suddenly changes her mind?? and the placement of the disfigured servant at the end is a little too obvious (**END SPOILERS**). I've read 'bodice-rippers' disguised as historical fiction with better character development and plotlines. If you really want to read it, I suggest getting it from the library."},{"rating":"2","title":"Emilie's Voice","review":"Emilie's Voice is an intelligent and compelling piece of historical fiction. It contains a perfect blend: well rounded characters, an interesting moment in history, intrigue, love and sacrifice.Susanne Dunlap's portrayal of 17th century France is full of rich and authentic details. The politics surrounding an artist's success or failure during the reign of Louis XI is conveyed with a deft hand.In Emilie, the reader will discover a nave and engaging girl of humble origins, who possesses a glorious talent. As she is used and abused for both personal and political gain, her voice-- both as an artist and an individual-develops, reaching maturity that left me gasping at the startling conclusion of the story."},{"rating":"1","title":"A disappointment","review":"I have enjoyed Laurie Colwin for years, and I was deeply saddened by her death. However, this particular book was a disappointment for me. The story is very repetitive, repeating events and thoroughly re-describing events that were thoroughly described in earlier chapters.

The Rewards of Deceit, Double-Crossing","review":"Mob stories like Tuohy are a fascinating study in psychology of criminal deception. While criminal enterprises require a measure of loyalty. The question is always, loyalty to what, to whom, and for how long? Tuohy really understands the incredible gullibility to those who want to believe in surface appearances, while he keeps his eye on his own main chance. Unquestionable it takes the kind nerves of steel that only a sociopath has to be able to betray those around him to the extent that Tuohy (the con)does.Author John William Tuohy's startling account of Ken Lelek and StarNet is even more incredible. It must have required amazing personal courage - few people would have the guts it to do it and expect to get away with it.The \\"mob\\" world is not for the faint of heart, though. The moral of the Tuohy yarn is that in the end the ferryman expects his due."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great story, great read","review":"A complex tale of gangsters, political kickback, mob wars and corrupt politicians told with wit and humor at a good pace.

This episode, broadcast as an April Fool's joke during the \\"Who is Cartman's Father?\\" cliffhanger, single-handedly destroyed South Park's following among my circle of friends -- we all felt we had been cheated.Upon reflection after the disaster, we concluded that it was probably a pet project of Parker & Stone; something the creators (and no one else) found hilariously funny."},{"rating":"1","title":"Is this some kind of joke?","review":"I think I've missed the point here, somehow. Two poorly drawn characters with no storyline and a lot of farting. It just goes to show that you can fool some of the people at least once (look at some of the other reviews for confirmation).

He is an English Teacher at Providence College, a Catholic institution. His retelling of the Divine Comedy is reasonably accurate and quite readable. The problem comes with his notes. They range from the scandalously inadequate to the downright offensive. Esolen has written a number of anti-gay articles for religious publications . This is reflected in his notes where he refers to homosexuality as something like \\"that most heinous of sins\\". This is not only offensive in a contemporary publication, but is totally out of tune with Dante himself, who took a much more sympathetic and nuanced approach c.1300 AD.

It was suppose to ship from Auburn, WA on June 4th to a business in Tacoma, WA. I never received the book. I had to wait until June 25th, before they would do anything for me, since they did not use a tracking number and kept insisting it might still be in transit. I was very disappointed and hated that they couldn't help me until the 21 days mark. Luckily, I was able to use a friends book in the mean time. I was able to get my money back with no hassle. It took about 5 days to show up in my account."},{"rating":"2","title":"Milwaukee Panel Mid-Way Fence","review":"This a great addition to your Milwaukee Panel Saw. When cutting small panels for shelves, etc., you will thank yourself for purchasing the mid-way fence. A word of caution, the directions that come with the mid-way fence aren't very good.

I've used it for two months so far, every day."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as great as the hype","review":"I'm fighting dark circles, bags and crows feet around my eyes and I couldn't wait to try this product. I bought this cream, confident it would be a huge help and it wasn't. My eyes watered, which made them evem puffier, and in the morning I had to wash it off and use something else. I might try it again (for the price of the product I feel I have to) but my initial reaction is that it's not as good as it's cracked up to be...at least not for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"reduced the appearance of a deep line","review":"I had a very deep single line by my right eye. After using this cream, within a day or two I saw the line fade into much shallower line. It seems that the progress is much slower after the initial big leap, though. It's been a month since I started using this cream, and the shallow line hasn't yet disappeared. The line seems getting thinner, though. I also have bags under my eyes, and the cream seems to be helping to reduce the bags too. So I'm happy with this product overall."},{"rating":"1","title":"It does not work for lines","review":"I started to have lines under my eyes two years ago when I turned 26. It was about 0.5 inch long under each eye. I was totally freaked out and wanted to do something about it. I started to fight these lines two years ago with Clinique's Advanced Stop Sign. After 2 jars and no result, I had to call it a quit.Since then, I've tried StriVectin-SD Eye Cream, Kinerase, and Creme de La Mer, which also didn't work for lines. I have to say StriVectin-SD is the worst from the bunch. It is greasy and doesn't make my skin any firmer. On a bad day, I would break out. Kinerase is a little better in that it's not greasy. La Mer was really good for firming and making my skin look dewy and soft, though it may not improve lines.I have tried using Estee Lauder Perfectionist and Advanced night repair and they both seem to improve the lines pretty well. I think I'm gonna continue to use Estee's products until I find anything better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Have sensitive skin?

It says to use morning and night, but it does not absorb well, so you cant wear it under makeup. It may work better for someone that doesnt wear makeup and can use it twice daily. I dont think it is worth the price though."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing Results","review":"First I must say I am writing this review for all of my girl friends. I have been used Strivectin eye cream for 3 years, since age 39. You can get a sample at Sephora, just ask and they will make one for you. This is how I first tried it. As for being expensive - Bull- you get OVER an 1 ounce of product for 59.00, almost ALL eye creams are for .50, half an ounce! This cream is amazing, I put it on my friends, just one eye and not the other and their jaws drop! It takes care of puffiness, dark circles, fine lines and wrinkles. Now, if you have abused your skin and you have MAJOR wrinkles, I don't know if anything on the market can help, be realistic....I only use mine in the morning when I really need it, lasts all day and one tube usually lasts me over a year. The only place I use it, is under and around my eyes not my whloe face. I have not tried the other products, but I am sure they are just as amazing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Quality Black and White Only","review":"I have no problem whatsoever with the disc.

Seems simple enough, but it must be difficult. Erik Hildebrandt makes it look easy and does it over and over again, producing a book full of breathtaking views of old and new airplanes in formation just a few feet from the door. The appeal to the photographers and their kin is obvious. The book will also wow airplane fans, lovers of vintage warbirds and airshow groupies. Do you remember Apollo 8 with Anders, Lovell and Borman? They are still at work flying and having fun in their own personal airplanes next to the latest F-18's."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good, but...","review":"This was a good book, but I don't agree with some of the things the author has to say regarding style of the letter. It has good information about what needs to be included and is helpful with terminology, but as far as writing style, there is a lot to be desired. The author does tell us over and over again to be yourself in your letter, which I totally agree with. I didn't care for the letter the author wrote for his situation, but the birth mother of his child did, and that is what really counts."},{"rating":"1","title":"There is something very wrong with the title","review":"When I was looking at books on the topic of adoption, this one caught my eye. There is a big mistake, and it's in the title. The parents that prospective adoptive parents write this letter to are NOT birthparents. In fact, they may never be. They are people who are considering an adoption plan. They may choose to parent. Additionally, the father may be quite involved in this process. To ignore him completely by writing a dear birthMOTHER letter seems a little insenstive at best. However, my biggest complaint is with the assumption that the pregnant mom is already a birthmother. For anyone involved in adoption (birthparents, adoptive parents, counselors, attorneys, facilitators) to fail to recognize this important fact leads me to, quite honestly, question their understanding of this process. She is a mother, plain and simple, until the papers are signed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book for ideas","review":"This was a great book for ideas about your dear birthmother letter. The only negative I found was that all the sample letters were seemingly written by very rich families, making adoption seem more out of the grasp of reality for regular families. But the info and advice that the author gave was extremely helpful!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Mary Bryant's Story","review":"I found the book to be very dsconnected. Definitely full of history but lacking in continunity. Mike Walker had so many sources to use and think he used them all, but many times he lost focus of Mary Bryant and tended to give a history lecture. Very interesting and informative, just didn't care for the structure of the book and presentation of the story."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simple Zen","review":"A wonderful book for someone who is confused about Zen and all it's hard to decipher mysterious meanings. Robert Linssen's unequivocal undertanding of Zen is well articulated in this book in an easy to digest format that is clear enough for any regular Joe to appreciate."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT THE BEST","review":"What can i say? I've read better books. Also, this book does not compare with Bram Stoker's Dracula. One of the reviewers for that book said this book is one of the first books written in a similar gothis style such as Frankenstein and Dracula. I didn't read Frankenstein but I did read Dracula and Murcheston can not compare. I found the narrative dull and predictable. I didn't feel sorry for any of the characters. There werewolf scenes are not noteworthy or refreshing. I was very disappointed. I read The Passion by Donna Boyd and even though I didn't love the book, The Passion has a much better story to tell than this one. The idea of the werewolf was at least a little more refreshing. anyways, if you do insist on purchasing this book, get the paperback - it's cheaper."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh Puhleeeze","review":"This book is the worst. The main character is so vapid and boring it's not even funny. This is a novel that is clearly 378 pages too long. The characters are poorly developed; the subplots are dull and this transformation the Duke takes on is hardly original. The Duke is a self absorbed child. At one point the Duke was run over by a carriage....I was hoping the book would over and down with but then I realized that I had over 300 pages yet to read. Dont' waste your money or time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Assasssinate the Director of this Movie","review":"This is a very disappointingly boring movie, lethargically acted in slow motion (despite the stellar cast), with a poor script and no insight into the historical era or the psychology of the potentially fascinating character(s) involved."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Study in Psyhopathology, Marred by Burton's Showy Performance","review":"Very much minor Losey, this film, based on actual events, looks at the events leading up to the assassination of Trotsky in Mexico in 1940. Alain Delon is very good in the film, while Losey, true to form, has a particular ability to create suspense through minimalist techniques - remember THE SERVANT as another example. However the film is spoiled for me by Richard Burton's mannered performance in the central role. While he could be a great actor in certain films - even CLEOPATRA is watchable, in a macabre kind of way - he also made some terrible films. If he wasn't kept under a firm directorial hand, he could end up being terribly hammy. This film offers a prime example."},{"rating":"1","title":"TROTSKY WAS A MIGHTY WARRIOR","review":"When this movie was shown in Sweden back in 1972, a small and somewhat cranky group of Trotskyists became very upset.This group, known as Posadists, picketed one of the cinemas showing the movie, and passed out a leaflet. The leaflet said: \\"Trotsky was a mighty warrior. His pencil was his sword and his eyeglasses were his shield\\".And no, I don't know if this is a true story, but I heard it second hand from several sources. The Posadists also believed in UFOs and wanted Brezhnev to nuke America. Or so the grapevine says. The truth may be very different, but since nobody seems to take this movie seriously, I guess I could report this funny rumour...As for the movie itself, I've only seen it once. And no, it wasn't very good. Trotsky, after all, was a MIGHTY WARRIOR.

I think this cover is a must to protect a high quality gauge."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good product--with one small catch","review":"The gauge and the gauge cover seem to be of good quality. There's only one glitch: getting the cover onto the gauge presents something of a conundrum. It seems you have to take the gauge apart in order to get the cover onto it. Being reluctant to take vice grips and brute force to the connectors on the gauge, I opted instead to split the gauge cover so as to maneuver it around the stem on the gauge.

There is so much depth in his eyes. There are a few things in the show that seem a little over the top, but it doesn't matter. It's entertaining."},{"rating":"2","title":"On my list for must see tv fall 2007","review":"This is a keeper. I liked the pilot and that kept me interested to tune in again. I loved this in boxed for I was able to view before it aired. It allowed me to watch Dirty Sexy Money which to me is a rip off of arrested development. I really like Damien Lewis is a great actor that kept me very interested. He's very quirky and plays this role so low keyed. His facial expression kind of tells it all. He commands the screen. I have no idea who he is or what I may have seen him in, but I will remember him Damain Lewis now. Looking forward to week three and the rest of the season."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Show!","review":"Used to watch this show when it came out and loved it.

But everything else I've seen him in since, has failed to win me over including this new show which I wanted to like. His character (who gets out of prison for a murder he didn't do after 12 years,)is a cop who is quirky and spouts zen phiolosophy to his gorgeous partner all day. Either you like the main characters 'quirky' personality and will get into the show; or you won't which is what I experienced.In addition the flash back storytelling style grew tiresome quickly; Robin Weigert as his Captain and San Francisco Mayor Gavin Newsome's Wife (Jennifer Siebold)both good actors, play very unlikable characters. In fact only Adam Arkin as Damien's ex-con financial advisor, is 'normal' and enjoyable to watch here. A big disappointment as a summer replacement show; get \\"Burn Notice\\" instead--it's great!l"},{"rating":"2","title":"Was Great Series","review":"This was a great series, Great Acting and and a very good Script.

I dont want to say anymore because its one of those things where just watching it is a pleasure, and I dont want to reveal any plot. please watch it you wont regret it."},{"rating":"2","title":"It just keeps getting better","review":"The show started off a little shaky, seeming not to know what its balance between procedural and character drama should be. But, considering the characters have all been fantastic from the start, the more recent turn in that direction is very smart. Damian Lewis has always been a talented actor, but this is one of his most riveting performances ever. I've never seen a character like Charlie Crews, and now I'm dying to see more of him. As he gets deeper into the conspiracy to frame him, all the little layers are getting pulled back. I sincerely hope NBC realizes what a gem they have here and starts giving it better promotions."},{"rating":"1","title":"The show is great, but it's the wrong music !!","review":"I LOVE this show, it was the best new series of the season, and I fell in love with everything it is. It looks at first like another cop drama with a twist, but that description couldn't be more further from the truth.LIFE is great, funny, light, intelligent, serious, dark, it's got it all, the writing is awesome, so many terrific lines/one-liner that are just brilliant, directing, acting, music selection, it's a masterpiece of art!BUT : I have not and will not buy the DVDs, and I recommend against it, because NBC screw things up and IT IS NOT THE ORIGINAL MUSIC !!!The replaced the music everywhere by some other songs, and it's far from being anywhere near as good as it originally was!![...]No way I buy DVDs like that, that's not the show I watched, love, and want to watch over & over again, not like that. NBC, you just lost a customer."},{"rating":"2","title":"That's Zentertainment !","review":"If you don't march-step to one of the religions of the people of the book, yet still would like a dash of spirituality with your entertainment, Charlie Crews is the man to watch. Shows like this - and I can think of only two, Kung Fu and Joan of Arcadia - come along only once in a blue moon. Crews' quirky character - Sherlock Holmes with a dash of Asperger syndrome - can be a hoot one moment, and then move on to something sublime, like the scene where he cradled the dying guy's head and whispered \\"go back to sleep, it's just a bad dream.\\" I hope to get a few chuckles from this show. But should the Nielsen God frown, and some network toady cancel the series, I'm prepared to laugh then too at the joke - like Crews in the final scene of the pilot."},{"rating":"2","title":"Life First Season","review":"I really enjoyed Life.

Characters are interesting, and though it follows a fairly typical procedural drama format, it's wildly original in terms of characters."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best tv series on NBC ever","review":"I bought this based on the fact that it had Damian Lewis in it, and his past performances in the Forsyte Saga and Band of Brothers. By the end of the second episode, I was completely enthralled. The dry humor and the excellent characterization in this show are its key features. However, the chemistry between Detective Crews and Detective Reese are excellent as well. It was refreshing to find a crime series that contained both humor and a mystery that I could not immediately solve.

I never bought the VHS set, but after reading a wonderful new biography about Irving Thalberg decided to get When the Lion Roars on DVD. However, I was disappointed to find out that some footage was cut from the second part. The first part ends with the death of Irving Thalberg in 1936, and originally the second part starts \\"the day after\\" Thalberg's funeral. But the DVD's second part starts with The Wizard of Oz and Judy Garland. This wouldn't be so bad, except that Jean Harlow's death has been eliminated. I'm sure that other parts were cut as well, it's just I don't remember them like I remember Harlow's demise. Jean was a huge star and she is still a fan favorite almost 80 years after her death.

For a historical set in Regency times it was just wrong. The heroine shoots at the hero for offering her \\"carte blanche\\" (therefore insulting her honor) on page fifty but willingly beds this same man in a public inn by page sixty? While a battle with French forces is literally a town away? UGH.The whole story is a bit to \\"convenient\\" to quickly throwing the hero and heroine together, seemingly, so they can bed each other. On top of all this both the hero and heroine are very unlikeable characters, and very one dimensional. Add to this the annoying habit of the hero to give the heroine a pet name, here \\"Lynx\\", and call her this several dozen times in the first 100 pages:( So cliche it's laughable.

Yes, there are some strong performances (I actually liked Brando and Kilmer in their roles), but the lead actors were rather weak and the story was drastically changed in the up-dating. Unfortunately, I don't think there is a more decent movie version of the novel, so if you are planning to show this as a tie-in to the book (I work as a teacher), you might use it as a counterpoint to the novel (eg, Why were things changed from Wells' original?)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Still A great Movie","review":"I have not watched this since the late 80's and I must say I am still impressed.

It sounds like a 'must-buy' - if only as a conversation piece.I have now seen this.I have re-rated to 1 star - that's for the opening credits.David Thewlis must have been extremely desperate to appear in this.Marlon?... must be having a laugh."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good story!","review":"A flight of fancy on Hollywood's part, this story is a modern rendition of Dr. Moreau's Island. It imparts modern science into the science fiction, creating a more scientifically plausible story. Unforgettable performance by David Thewlis. Also incorporated is a beautiful screen actress, Fairuza Balk, as well as many other unique characters. If you want accuracy to the book, watch the great older classic. If you want novelty, this is the movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Laughably bad","review":"I must have been naive in my younger days, because there was I time I was anxious to watch this film. It looked intriguing, with a lot of potential to be a classic sci-fi thriller. Ha, not even a director of such talent as John Frankenheimer could save this mess. Considering the fact it stars the lifeless Val Kilmer and the overacting of Marlon Brando, acting isn't much in this film. As a matter of fact, David Thewlis and Fairuza Balk deliver far better performances."},{"rating":"1","title":"WHAT IS WRONG WITH YOU PEOPLE!","review":"You're serious. You like it. Ohmigod, you LIKE this movie? Maybe Moreau wasn't just working on that one island...This is a very very very very very very bad movie. The world is not big enough to contain very's this movie deserves. (8 trillion times infinity at the very least)Tasteless, unfunny (though I did like the little piano guy) and generally bad. The guy below hit the nail on the head. You don't actually LIKE any of these people! The hero, Prendick is a wimp. The cat girl is just dumb. Montegomery is um, strange. (What was the POINT of his Brando impression?)Close your eyes, overcome the vivesection and repeat after me. I will read the book, I will read the book, I will read the book...Join my campaign to destroy the master copy of this movie. Or better, have them dump every single on Congress, they wouldn't know the difference between that and one of their daily sessions."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just when I thought that the 1st one couldn't get worse..","review":"..I sat down and watched this. I couldn't believe all the critics hated it and it was rated in the top 10 worst films of that year by all of them. Saddly, I found out that they were right. This is amazingly bad. I just don't know how you can go from pre-production to post and still produced vomit like this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic action thriller with suspense, murder, and detective work thrown in","review":"I, too, missed the Swedish chick in this book after reading \\"Crimson Hit\\", which was the stellar first episode that had me enthralled from beginning to end.I liked how fast the story moved, it kept me spellbound in both episodes. Shannon is almost like James Bond instead of what I think of when I think 'bounty hunter'. Very entertaining read, full of action and travel outside the US, and it seemed like wherever Burton puts his character, the descriptions are so accurate it's like you're really there."},{"rating":"2","title":"I Enjoyed It A Lot","review":"The action is top notch in this fast paced and well done novel. I read through it quicker than I thought I would and once I started I didn't want to stop. It wasn't just well done, it is also quite well written, with good lively descriptions that bring the story together and make for a great read that anyone with a hankering for action, plot heavy stories I think can really enjoy. Bob Burton is an interesting character, one who I'm definitely going to be following."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lots of Action","review":"Another great book by Bob Burton. Dev Shannon is high priced bounty hounter. He is the best of the best. He loves his job and loves to put the bad guys away. When his own friend is murdered, that is when Dev seeks revenge and no one will get in his way. A real page turner and lots of action."},{"rating":"1","title":"OK Action, needs a plot doctor.","review":"I picked up this one for the price and it did sound interesting. If it wasn't for the fact that I was without a TV, no internet, and the radio was background music only, I wouldn't have finished it. Plot was contrived. At the very least when someone is trying to kill you, you focus on that, not our protagonist. Goes downhill from there."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Addition","review":"The K&N FIPK Gen2 Air intake Kit has been a great addition to my 2004 Ford Excursion V10. I tow a 37' travel trailer and the difference before and after installation has been incredible. There is a noticeable increase in HP which make lane merging easier when towing. Installation was fairly straight forward and took about 2 hours. The instructions, with pictures, were very good. The construction of the filter and components is top quality and it's obvious K&N did their research on the vehicle specific application. When I got towards the end of the installation I didn't think the filter was going to fit but it did."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a load of...","review":"I saw Blood Brothers in London on December 6th and thought It was amazing so I brought the soundtrack the next day.

This album may satisfy a Shaun Cassidy fan because he has sooooo little material available. But if you are a david cassidy fan, I would look else where. I think David is great and he was great in the show, but the soundtrack is nothing great. Maybe I am looking at it from the wrong point of few but still, i really dont dig it. If u were a fan of the show itself dont listen to me, because I am an idiot, but other than that it is basically worth the two stars I gave it. Maybe 2.5 stars, but I cant do that. :) David is cool though, no matter what."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wouldn't recommend this book","review":"This book covers databases in a very perfunctory manner and doesn't seem to mention the packaging and deployment wizard.

This book is bad. The author takes you by the hand and does everything for you. There aren't any exercises or review questions at the end of chapters. People don't learn that way.

Kevin Ayers gets about 22 minutes of music (for vinyl buffs, this is Side 2). John Cale, who was just about to release his first album for Island, FEAR, stuns the audience with his version of Elvis' \\"Heartbreak Hotel\\". Eno opens the show with \\"Driving Me Backwards\\", and follows it up with \\"Baby's on Fire\\" (both tracks are from his debut album HERE COME THE WARM JETS).

Moreso than the great American and European writers of film music, he seemed to adapt style/instrumentation to suit movie content, though his perspective was always distinctive and personal. His appraoch may have derived from commitment to the cinemactic art form; he would immerse himself in the films for which he composed even during production so he himself was part of the creative process. Takemitsu's personality -- which apparently was calm, focused, serious, simple, honest -- emerges. The images which appear in the video are impressive. But they would be lessened without the memorable underscoring of Takemitsu's art. END"},{"rating":"2","title":"I would give it ten stars if I could.","review":"This Kit is a MUST for all kids.

It's a sound system, and presented at a level that kids can understand (although maybe a little too condescending; my six-year-old was mildly insulted). However, while you're teaching your kids to manage money, you're willing to pay $20 for a plastic bank, some stickers, and a 10-minute cassette tape? I'm not.

The cat RK (roadkill) was amusing, but this book had little substance. Novel padded by extra scenes telling the reader exactly what the bad guys are doing, and why they are bad (suspense-killer). If you are in love with Acorna's character, go for it. If you want good plotting or interesting challenges, look elsewhere.For the Scarborough-McCaffery team writing well, tryPowers That Be (Petaybee, Book 1). Do not recommend this novel or series."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not their best work...","review":"Unlike previous McCaffrey works, including the other two Acorna books, this book was not worth the time it took to read it. It is incredibly slow moving, with no definite plot pattern. For most of the book the reader waits and waits for something of interest to happen, until about the ten last pages, where the plot abruptly folds in on itself in a very quick and unsatisfing ending. It is almost as if the authors just got sick of writing. In addition to being boring, the action is confusing and difficult to follow. I can only hope that the next book in the series can make up for this poor excuse for entertaining literature."},{"rating":"1","title":"it is the worst book","review":"this book is utter nonsense.it has no plot and is just a fantasy story.it is very boring to read and is very monotonous.hence i rate this book very poorly and advice you the buyers not to buy this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Raw, Crusty & In Your Face!!","review":"Now this is good, solid old-school punk, man. Vocals just barked at you in a angry yet intelligible way. You can almost feel the spittle hitting your skin, yet you don't mind. Savage drum pounding throughout, unpolished and completely effective. Bass is bubbling and gurgling away as it should, and percolates to the surface occasianally, showcasing the talent summoning the sounds. The guitars are what's interesting here, not just the basic two or three chords you usually hear (not a slam, just a fact). Almost borders on grind in a few areas, just ferocious and very interesting. T.N. were and are a special breed of not just band, but individuals as well. Brings to mind some of the old guard, like GBH, Exploited, DRI, Poison Idea, Circle Jerks, Raw Power, Minor Threat.......very impressive stuff here.

The relay failed after a few weeks of use.Other observations, the case is built cheaply and doesn't seal at all. If the relay is mounted by the tab, the wires alone will cause the clip-in bottom component to wiggle with more play than I would normally be comfortable with.

He wears whatever outrageous costume, wig or makeup which is necessary for his role too. The only thing that is a shame is that all those years ago when he was starting out that he didn't immediately go to comedy instead of to drama.

It galvanized my interest in pan-American indigenous-white relations. Now that I am a university professor myself, I teach this book regularly. It's fascinating to most undergraduates -- often mentioned as one of their favorite books of the semester -- without losing any of the intricacy and delicacy of argument necessary to treating the subject of cultural contact and conflict in the Americas. I highly recommend it for any reader; I've given it to people travelling to Peru on vacation and it has greatly deepened their understanding of the land they are visiting and history of their own presence in the Sacred Valley.

In a straightforward and uncomplicated way, Silverblatt lays out the material using a basic \`before and after' approach. She spends the first half describing pre-conquest Andean life, concentrating on women and their roles in society. Then she shows how life changed for the Andeans after the arrival of the Spanish. Again, she focuses on how those changes affected women, arguing that not only were women affected by the Spanish conquest but that they suffered far greater loss of position than their male counterparts."},{"rating":"1","title":"Blaa Blaa Blaa Blatt Blatt Blatt","review":"This book is a extreamly verbous book that discusses the political and economic rights of andean women through out history."},{"rating":"2","title":"No software!","review":"Don't expect to plug this in and have it work.

If you were foolish enough to take the books advice and to buy a stereo over there, you would have to bring it to a Bang and Olufson store in New York City, and have them rebuild it to make it compatible, and the cost for that would be about the same price as what you paid for the stero it's self.

You have to understand the concept behind this item. Strong water pressure from your garden hose is necessary for the unit to work properly. It basically uses water pressure to start the suction. It slowly lifts sludge off the bottom of the pond without overly disturbing the debris around it. Take your time and your pond will become crystal clear. Of course the water will cloud during the cleaning but after 12 hours, my pond is clean as a whistle for a month or so. I couldn't maintain my pond without it.

There are NO tracks out of place and the album ends always before I would like to, in spite of not being definitely short: 12 tracks (15 in the brasilian edition), about fifty-five minutes long, satisfaction is guaranteed. My favourite among Paradise Lost's and it will never be overcome."},{"rating":"2","title":"Paradise Lost Classic","review":"This is one of the best albums Paradise Lost has put out. Over the years, PL has changed their style from album to album, sometimes more goth sounding, sometimes heavier rock, and their newer albums have a dark electronica mixed in. However, Draconian Times is a masterpiece of hard rock, mixed with the same dark vibe of all PL albums. Nick Holmes' vocals are hard and heavy like earlier PL albums, but there are still times when his deep \\"One Second era\\" voice is heard. This is a great album, and hard to find. You can't go wrong with this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome","review":"Just colossal. Huge waves of riff and texture wash over. Inexplicably ancient and cutting-edge at the same time.

There are many bands today who attempt dark metal and with mostly embarassing results. This album is an exception. Nick Holmes drives every word straight to the heart in a Hetfield like roar but at times he uses a low gothic voice. Guitarists Aaron Aedie and Greg Mackintosh play very powerfull simple riffs that dominate the album and the general atmosphere is very moody. Everything here is solid from start to end. Unfortunaltely Paradise Lost are not well known outside of Europe and this album did not get the exposure it deserves.

The book just seems to superficial to me.Don't get me wrong - the message about love was good, and I agreed with most of what the book says. I do believe that love is powerful and we need more love and forgiveness. I just wish it was as easy to have it as this book lets on.I felt too much information was given from \\"A Course in Miracles\\" rather than from the author herself (most every page had a reference to \\"A Course in Miracles\\"); that's why I couldn't give the book more than 2 stars.

The author has written of her own personal lifes experiences: At a young age she was into a wild life-style which is not uncommon for young adults. She stated that because of her life-style, she never felt very happy or fulfilled in many ways. Then...voila! She decided to find god....something 'greater than herself' to help her out. The entire book, in my opinion, is nothing but prosyletizing.... It's certainly not a book I would even suggest to any one I know---believers or not.

From what I can gather from the book, it sounds as if the folks who concocted A Course in Miracles studied the Science and Health, rewrote the Victorian language so that it was contemporary and appealing, and left out all the hard, controversial stuff -- like relying solely on God for physical healing.Hmm.

I would say that 95% of the references are either distorted or completely wrong.

Happily enough I got the Cd.Well, Canned Heat certainly knew how to boogie, I reckon; although we are missing the Blind Owl, the Bear was still there fronting the proceedings. The whole set is great but I prefer the boogie ones with the Chamber Brothers supplying backing vocals and The Hook himself, what can it be said, just that's too sad he just sang on three tunes. Vintage blues and boogie. Don't think twice it's alright! buy it the now."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dissapointing","review":"I have to say first that I'm not a huge Canned Heat fan as I see them as quite mediocre compared to a group like Butterfield Blues Band. I am however a huge John lee Hooker fan and was extremely disappointed he is only on 3 of the 10 songs. The title of the album is pretty misleading and I feel a bit cheated. If you are like me and love John Lee but find Canned Heat to be so-so skip this one and get the original Hooker 'N Heat 2 CD set and you'll be much happier. AS I recall Hooker is on almost every song on it. It isn't live but is more like a jam session and has some interesting chit chat between John lee and the band. I give that one 4 stars out of 5."},{"rating":"1","title":"No Hooker or Heat","review":"Don't be fooled like I was- John Lee Hooker only plays on the last few songs of the album. I got the album hoping to hear the following Hooker & Heat collaborationHooker 'n Heatbut it ended up being an uninspired concert put on by Canned Heat. I like Canned heat, but the album shouldn't have been titled Hooker 'n Heat if Hooker only briefly showed up. Don't buy this one expecting to hear much of the Hook."},{"rating":"1","title":"Insight guides Northern Italy (Insight Guides)","review":"I have bought this book around 10 days ago and must say that I am very disappointed about its content. I bought it because of the superb star rating it had. It is undoubtedly not ideal at all for someone who will be fending for himself whilst in Italy as all it has is superb photography and a good description of the various locations, but no info on tourist info offices, how to get to the various locations, emergency numbers etc. I sincerely can only suggest it to somebody who will be guided by somebody who is very familiar with the territory. I must say it is not written for the budget traveller and the few hotels and restaurants which are suggested at the back of the book are too expensive to even be considered by a budget traveller. Unfortunately I had received a large number excellent brochures from the various tourist offices in Italy which I obtained from Let's go Italy and I must say I have found this book a pure waste of good money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Takes Me Back","review":"Although I am not into this type of rap anymore (I'm 30).

The text is interesting, but bare-bones support for the amazing images of infants and children from around the world. Babies from Mongolia, Tibet, China, Australia, the Arctic circle etc. are featured, being held, carried, rocked, bathed and nursed. Their faces are hauntingly beautiful. So are their clothing and toys. Such exotic accoutrements as strips of fur, twisted grass, glass and amber beads, feathers, leather and cloth are featured.

Melanie Fuller is a particularly creepy character. Too bad this book has not caught on more. It's incredible."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Writing; Terrible Story","review":"I adored The Terror by Dan Simmons. Despite a few unbelievable scenes in The Terror, I was intrigued enough by it to cast my luck with another novel by Dan. Carrion Comfort by the back sounded like just the story. What I got was great writing and a disappointing story. The most interesting character was Melanie because she truly was psychopathic and horrible to those whom she Used. All the other characters, which are beautifully drawn, are completely unbelievable. The plotting is crazy; pacing irregular. The situations are preposterous and unreal and kept jarring me out of the reader's trance. I was thoroughly disgusted by this book, so much so that I haven't even finished the last 100 pages. As for people complaining the book is too long, I agree. Not because there are too many pages to turn, but because there are too many pages of a disappointing story."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mind Blowing Horror","review":"With so many reviews on the book, I don't want to recap what everyone has said. Sure, this is a long novel but is it worth reading? You bet. Dan Simmons again proves what a dynamic and versatile writer he is. His characterization is top-notch and the ideas are nothing short of brilliant. The intensity of this novel makes the length a non-issue. Overall, this is a stellar effort from a talented author."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as good as everyone was saying","review":"This book was very dissappointing....reading the reveiws i was hoping it would be a good book. This is my first time reading this authour. The book was a hard read, I had to try really hard to make myself read it. There were alot of dragged out parts in book and was very boring. The book could have easily been 400 pages. Read at your own risk."},{"rating":"1","title":"If this is what horror fiction is then I pass","review":"I read Simmons other work of Horror \\"Song of Kali\\" and thought that it was ok. So I tried another one of his works. Carrion Comfort was supposed to be a magnum opus and at over 800 pages it was certainly an opus. Unfortunately the book, while having a great premise devolves into predictable and repeated acts involving knives, guns, and body parts to the point of nausia. The first use of each of these devices is clever and interesting however repeated use dulls the effect and drags the story out too long. This would have been a superior 300 page book if only the author and the editor could control themselves. While not the Heavens Gate of books, a very weak, predictable ending and too much racist overtones -- yes racist -- makes this book one to pass on.I am finished reading Simmons, now and for a long time. If this is what passes for the genre, then you can keep it. Sorry to be harsh but I would not waste your time here."},{"rating":"1","title":"Well written but a disapointing story.","review":"Okay, the biggest problem I had with this novel has nothing to do with Dan Simmons and everything to do with the person who decided to include the SF Chronicle blurb on the front which says \\"in the tradition of King's \\"The Stand.\\" That is why I bought the book. Turned out that it wasn't ANYTHING like \\"The Stand,\\" not even close. I think Simmons is a great writer, but I was terribly disapointed with this book. Maybe if I hadn't known anything about I might not have had expectations I might have enjoyed it more. Or perhaps if someone had edited out about 100 pages I might have enjoyed it more. That said, I am still quite impressed with Simmons' writing and will continue to read other novels he has written.

Can you say Dean Koontz with an even bigger ego and smaller imagination? This was recommended to me highly. I wonder why. I am only reading it because I am waiting for labor to begin and have time on my hands. This is a path-of-least-resistance, lowest-common-denominator book with a mildly interesting premise. Flat characters, some are even charicatures, and the violence is so pervasive that one becomes immune to it very quickly. Like a Stallone film. High cheese factor, too. Maybe I'll pick up Pride and Prejudice again. Or read the side of a cereal box."},{"rating":"1","title":"What's the point?","review":"A reviewer below stated that in all other books before Carrion Comfort the characters \\"seemed so flat.\\" Well I guess that's what happens when you move your reading level up a notch from the Sweet Valley High series.

So, after seeing the size, and hearing so many kudos for Carrion Comfort, I snatched it right up and couldn't WAIT to begin reading. Ugh. I tried 3 times to get past the 100 page point, and couldn't do it. Slow. Dull. Boring. I've heard this book called an epic. I disagree vehemently. An epic should illicit strong emotions from the reader. An epic should be an incredible testimony of some sort, whether it be GOOD versus EVIL, or whatever. You want to read an epic in the horror genre? King's \\"The Stand.\\" A masterpiece. It's incredibly readable. The characters are fascinating. It's exciting. It's ACCESSIBLE. Same goes for McCammon's \\"Swan Song.\\" THOSE are epics. In my opinion, this doesn't come anywhere close. Epic BOREDOM, more like it. Maybe I'll pick it up some day and try again.

Highly enjoyed by all that I have recomended it to."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I expected","review":"I bought this book based up glowing reviews and the fact that it had won the Bram Stoker award.The author introduces far too many characters at once and too quickly at that. No development or backstroy is given due to this. The description are overly detailed regarding the most mundane and pointless thingsThe characters are dull flat, and boring. They speak as if they were high class sophisticated nobles and because of this I was unable to relate to or even care about any of them. He tries so hard with cliches and sobstories to make us care about them but it's too easy to see through it.The plot was much too predictable and only now do I see why it was about 900 pages. Simmons goes on and on without getting to the point or even having one in the first place. It could have been done in half the length and been better off for it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Horror Is Hard To Find","review":"This book is mostly excellent, a fun twist on the vampire myth. The evil \`creatures' are quite believable, quite interesting and well drawn. Indeed, the villains are far more interesting than the heroes, and their little internal battles are far more absorbing than the hero's clumsy plots. It's a fast read, despite its huge size, although you may be annoyed by the last third. The ending is awful, relying as it does on characters being stupid, but then nothing is perfect, eh? I recommend it to horror fans."},{"rating":"1","title":"You can probably skip this one...","review":"'Summer of Night' was one of the best horror stories I had read in a long time. You can imagine my disappointment, then, when I tried to tackle 'Carrion Comfort.' And I really do mean tried. I slugged through about half of this autrocity, but then realized that I really could care less if everyone in the entire world died in the end, and humans vanished from existence. Very, very boring."},{"rating":"1","title":"Did I miss something?","review":"I read this book due to the numerous great things I have heard about it. What a waste this book was.

If you are looking for an epic novel of horror, look elsewhere!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A personal favourite","review":"Loved this book and introduced me to this author. The book grabbed me from the start and I felt drawn right into the story. I shared the emotions of the characters and was relieved for the happy ending. It does strike a bit of fear inside you and comes across as extremely realistic. Thank god it's not possible! It is a long book but definitely a novel I will be revisiting again down the track."},{"rating":"1","title":"A completely disappointing novlel by one of my favorite authors","review":"I bought this book for my Kindle based both on my previous experience with Mr.Simmons' work which I thoroughly enjoyed and on a review by Stephen King in which he called it \\"one of the three best horror books of the 20th century.\\" I am so glad this wasn't the first Simmons' book I read because I would have never read another and might have missed out on the pleasure his previous books have given me.The book started off well enough and I anticipated a good scary tale. It quickly became, however, an endless, boring hodgepodge of shifting scenes and confusing characters. I forced myself to finish it hoping for something redeeming. Alas this was not to be.Shame on Stephen King. I seriously doubt that he read this book and that his review was his honest opinion of it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Long and Dry","review":"I picked up this book based on a shining recommendation from a friend. Because I downloaded it, I didn't realise it was as lengthy as it was until I spotted it in a bookstore, although length doesn't typically bother me, especially when I'm hauling all the pages around on an e-reader. I made it two and a half chapters in before I had to set it aside and chalk it up as a lost cause. I simply can't get past the unnecessary details and the overall dryness with which it's written. I found (and, when I go back to try again, still find) myself zoning out while I'm still reading, acknowledging words but not stringing them together into meaningful sentences, and I don't know that any of the characters are have enough character to make it worth continuing. I hear Dan Simmons has better books; I'm not sure this hasn't put me off him entirely, but this was a poor introduction to his storytelling and has made me wary of any of his other novels."},{"rating":"2","title":"Vampires with a twist..","review":"This is a fantastic book. It has great characters, and a secret society conspiracy type plot that keeps it exciting without making it cliche. There are times that you can feel the helplessness, as well as the insanity of the large array of interesting characters. The graphic scenes of violence are expertly crafted, and just horrific enough to make you wrinkle your nose while enjoying them. This was my first book by Dan Simmons. I will definitely read more of his work."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book!","review":"Why I think it's a great book? The author gives an explanation for people who can do more than ordinary people and what they do with them. Just by manipulating them with their minds they make history for the ordinary people. It gives an explanation how people like Hitler in the past could control so many people. Besides it's a fascinating story with a breathtaking ending. Normally I hate to read books for the second or third time, but this is a book you can read many times to understand all the happenings. I can recommend it to anyone who likes complicated stories with humor and a lot of action ! I sure hope there will be a sequel one day (I hope you read this, Dan).From a Dutch admirer."},{"rating":"2","title":"An outstanding epic of terror!","review":"With Carrion Comfort, Dan Simmons has provenhimself to be one of the most versatile masters ofstory-telling.

Makes me wonder what happened to them.........."},{"rating":"2","title":"british folk rock","review":"This album ranges through all kinds of feeling, from upbeat to quite harrowing. It's up there with Martyn's best late sixties/early seventies work, and his then-wife Bev's voice is just wonderful - lilting and sensitive, tending to be more expressive than Martyn's more laid back singing. \\"Auntie Aviator\\" is right up there with Nick Drake's best - like \\"At the Chime of a City Clock,\\" for instance - brooding, haunting, and intense. The album overall is more upbeat, however. If you like Nick Drake, the Pentangle, Fred Neil, early Fairport Convention, etc. you should definitely pick this up."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect folk rock harmony","review":"John's guitar alternates between a pleasant finger picked style and hints of a more \\"acidic\\" lead guitar.

I'm a big fan of kaskade's past albums but he has really stepped it up a notch with this one. For an artist album to have so many standout numbers is completely unprecedented, and I can't wait to hear some of these songs at a club. \\"Be Still\\" and \\"Sorry\\" knocked my socks off. This is genre bending material that shows Kaskade has reached the next level, without forgetting where his roots are"},{"rating":"2","title":"Kaskade - Love Mysterious","review":"I've been a really big fan of Kaskade's previous few albums, so I was very eager to give \\"Love Mysterious\\" a listen. I would say, for the most part, I was not disappointed.Kaskade is a master of creating a \\"mood\\" with his music. It's very sexy and dance-able. Good R&B;/house feel to it without ever feeling cheesey or corny. He always knows how to mix up the vocals - balancing out girl vocals vs. boy vocals. This album keeps his consistent track record going, except that it's maybe a little louder/more upbeat than his previous albums.I can't give this a 5-star rating because a couple of the songs sounded just a little out of place to me. I couldn't get into them - the beats were a little more Electro and a little harder on my ears than the rest of the album.Overall though, this is another solid good release from Kaskade. I highly recommend any of Kaskade's music to people - \\"Love Mysterious\\" included.

It starts out a little slow in the first few episodes but gains a lot of ground quickly with peeks at the backstories of each character, some of which have historical significance. \\"Moonlight\\" also has the cajones to break with the Buffy-verse by creating it's own vamp rules and focusing on characters that are slightly older than high school/college age. Even if the show isn't picked up by any other network after CBS' thickheaded decision to cancel it, I'm sure it will live on for many years in fanficdom.

The pilot had a few corny moments, which I was happy to put up with since the first episode of anything is always rocky. However, as the series went on, it just got better and better. The fight scenes, particularly the one that took place on a roller coaster, were truly amazing, and the show also had an incredible soundtrack. The longer it went on, the better it got. I still sulk every Friday night, or every time CBS introduces the latest bit of reality tv crap that will never take Moonlight's place. It may have only lasted one season, but this will always be one of my favorite shows and I'll never give up hope that someone will bring it back from the grave.

The on-screen chemistry between Mick and Beth is one of the very best I've seen and the story line is tragically sweet. This show put a fresh coat of paint on the vampire genre, and became quickly addictive.It really is too bad that this was only on for 1 season. I didn't even know about it until it was on SciFi channel in reruns. Now I can't get enough of it.

All said, though, the show is, sadly, better than most TV seen these days."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not good.","review":"This one is strictly for the Twilight crowd.If you like something with an edge and more grown up, stick to True Blood or even Buffy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad accents, cheap fx, worse acting...","review":"I gave this show a shot and made it through 4 episodes before I had to throw in the towel. Horribly, horribly written. The acting was atrocious. And the plotlines were essentially bad procedurals. Mick and Beth had no chemistry whatsoever and are one of the more dull onscreen romances I've ever watched."},{"rating":"1","title":"I like this show better...","review":"when it was 'Angel' or better yet 'Forever Knight'. I am also amused/disturbed that there are calling this a new wave of \\"vampires\\". Pray tell when has the vampire vanished from the media? Of all the things that go bump in the night, the vampire reigns supreme. This show aims high and falls flat. The allusions to Louis, Angel and even the vampires from 'Forever Knight' and 'Dark Shadows' leaves a lot to be desired."},{"rating":"1","title":"moonlight uncomplete","review":"Moonlight - The Complete SeriesI didn't get the No. 1 instead I got two No 2's .

Although I've never been a sci-fi fan, I've always liked good detective fiction and film noir. And this show has that and more---well crafted, interesting plot lines and a very compelling couple---Mick and Beth! (Beth is soooo hot!---she now occupies the \\"wallpaper backgound\\" on my computer!) While I am hopeful that another network will pick up the show after CBS foolishly cancelled it--I am looking forward to the first season DVD release.

Similar to other vampire shows? Well maybe a few things are similar, but many more things are different! Interesting twists on things, like souls, how they eat, how they live, how they can die. Not the same old same old. The writing is shakey in a few spots, but Alex O'Loughlin is such a brilliant actor, that the less than great writing doesnt even matter. Actually all of the actors in this series are top notch, they are serious about their roles, and it translates wonderfully to the screen."},{"rating":"2","title":"Moonlight DVDs","review":"This series is awesome! It is so ridiculous that the series was canceled. The set, the story the music..all are so entertaining! Alex McLoughlin is sexy,and such agood actor in this series. The whole cast is beautiful and really entertaining to watch. We loved it! We want more!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Moonlight TV series on DVD","review":"I really enjoyed this show when it was on TV. I was very dissapointed it was canceled. I believe if not for the writers strike, it may have been renewed. They didn't have enough shows to tell their whole story.I found it gave a new twist to the Vampire lore. And the first episode, where Mick was dreaming of being on a radio talk show. Telling the truths and myths about Vampires. This show was a refreshing change from all of the same old plots of other shows. It's the best new show since 'Supernatural' premired.I was very pleased when I found it on DVD. For anyone who enjoys Vampire shows and a good romance story. I think you will enjoy 'Moonlight'!The chemistry between Mick and Beth was amazing. There are some very talented actors here. Hope anyone who orders, enjoys it as much as I do."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it!","review":"For a fantasy show it has a very realistic feel. I love that about it. That makes the characters all the more appealing, you can really identify with them. I really love that it's both modern and classy too. And the cast has great chemistry, all of them. I love how slowly the romantic story develops, and the tension between the kind of issues that the characters have to face in the present, and the really unique back story that they have together."},{"rating":"2","title":"lets get moonlight back on screen.","review":"Moonlight is the first vampire series that should have been repeated again and even made into a film. The sexual chemistry between the two main actors playing MicK St. John and Beth was just amazing. What a love story.Why it ended where it did still bugs me even today. There should be another series where it finished off and the film should show how love conquers all for the two lovers, one human and one vampire. Lovely lovely series and so pleased it came out on DVD. I am 100% Mick St. John mad. When you are watching a series on TV you always miss something but being able to get it on DVD always means you can find something you missed or didnt hear the first time around. Fab.!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Eagle 1","review":"This was a really good series never understood why the network took it off the air. They really didn't give it a chance from this viewer stand point anyway! I got it for the wife because she also fell in love with the series also.

I wish we were able to have a full season. After this Friday it will be a long wait for more episodes. We have to keep up the fight.The story telling is brilliant in the series. The chemistry between Mick and Beth is awesome. I was never into the vampire genre until this show. Once you watch the first couple of episodes if you are not hooked, I would be surprised. There is a little something for everyone. Action, romance, drama, etc."},{"rating":"2","title":"Writers Suck!","review":"Moonlight was a worthy successor to \\"Forever Knight\\" and \\"Angel.\\" Sadly, this excellent series was killed by the G-Dammed writers strike! I loved this show, and can't understand why it was canceled, especially after the People's Choice award. All I know is that at the end of the greedy writers unjustified strike, it was announced that \\"Moonlight\\" and \\"The Bionic Woman,\\" both excellent shows that I TiVo-ed every week and will miss terribly, would not be continued. If that torques your jaws as much as it does mine, COMPLAIN!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Congratulations PCA Best new drama!","review":"Week after week I am amazed by the exceptionally high level of writing and acting on this show.

Maybe they will even have enough sense to bring it back!"},{"rating":"2","title":"LOVED THIS SHOW!","review":"Hated it when CBS evil eye canceled this show, despite the fact that it had 8 million followers and won the People's Choice award. Own the DVDs and was disappointed that there were NO EXTRAS!! Still, I get to watch Mick over, and over, and over, and over again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nearly Perfect Series","review":"I have no idea if this could have sustained itself, but the first and only season was wonderful. Every time I talked someone into watching, they would get completely hooked and start planning their viewing around it, so why it was cancelled I will never understand. Many shows are renewed that have far less promise and far less audience enthusiasm, so it must have been something going on behind the scenes. Mick St. John was the perfect vampire hero - attractive, instantly likeable, decent yet dangerous, and amazingly sexy, and the supporting case worked well with him. They will have a hard time coming up with a better role for Alex O'Loughlin, which is what makes this show's cancellation the more frustrating."},{"rating":"2","title":"if you like vampires, you'll love Moonlight","review":"I started watching Moonlight when it ran on the SciFi Channel. As soon a s I realized they were only showing the 12 episodes that ran on the network I ordered the dvd. It's an excellent take on the genre, well written and the cast is excellent. The interaction between the main characters, Mick and Beth, is small screen acting at its best. The discovery of common events between them, and the slow build up of their relationship is remarkably well done. The last 4 episodes not seen on TV are worth buying the set, as Mick admits to himself his feelings for Beth he steps into the role of the dominant hero, and sparks fly. It's too bad the series didn't make it, even sadder that one of the cable channels didn't have the courage to pick it up. Although, Mick St John would probably appreciate the mortality of it all. If you like vampires or were a Buffy fan, you won't be disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow!","review":"I had never watched Moonlight when it was on TV (except the very last episode...) I heard such rave reviews about how wonderful it is so I waited for the DVDs. OMG. I love it. How is it that THIS show gets canceled after barely a season and other junk all over TV keeps getting renewed!?! I love the characters. I love the story. I love that it's a bit cheesy! I wonder if the fans make a bit enough stink if there can be a movie made (ala Firefly = Serenity). I hope I hope I hope!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Moonlight DVD set","review":"Buy this dvd series!

I loved the series but am disappointed that it did not get a second season to explore the relationship between Beth and Mick. Maybe someday while Alex is on break from Hawaii 5-0, he can do a movie reuniting the characters and wrapping up the storyline?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Some good points, but ...","review":"I finally broke down and watched the entire 16 episodes. Mr. O'Loughlin was fine as Mick St. John, but the actress playing his leading lady did not impress me all that much.

No wonder people are increasingly no longer interested in watching television, nothing is interesting anymore.Good luck to the people who do find themselves a captivating show and get past atleast the third season. It's good to step out of reality sometimes."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"Moonlighting/Forever Knight","review":"The series was good. It WAS a bit of a rip-off of \\"Forever Knight\\", but it did have enough independant subject matter to stand alone. The last episode, which I suspect was just intended to be a \\"season finally\\" wasn't too bad as a \\"throw-in\\" series ending.

I miss my Mick St. John :["},{"rating":"2","title":"Not Just Another Vampire - An Enduring Love Story","review":"Moonlight is not just for fans of the supernatural or vampire genre. It's as much about the starcrossed love of a man (who happens to be a vampire) and a woman. Mick St.John (brought to life by the exceptional Austrailian actor, Alex O'Loughlin) is the sweetest, sexiest, and most endearing man on television. His love for Beth (played by Sophia Myles) is what kept 8,000,000 viewers home on Friday nights to watch Season One. Jason Dohring's character, Josef, had the best one liners since his role of Logan in \\"Veronica Mars.\\"For anyone who did not catch Moonlight for the first episodes, I recommend downloading the first episode from Amazon Unbox.

The show really picks up and I really fell in love with the characters of Beth and Mick. I like the way they portray vampires and the fact that they can walk around in the day without exploding but they still don't like the light.

Money talks in the tv world. I would like them to see what a foolish mistake they made.

There were so many twists and open angles left for this series, I honestly wish it had been picked up for a second season. The relationship between Beth and Mick had a great deal of promise and the eventual - \\"Turn me\\" question would have surfaced. Would Beth have gotten to that point and would Mick have made her like him? I also like the development of Joseph who, at first, came off pompous and yet was there to back Mick when needed. He had a heart, as one episode showed, and that softened his character. And what did eventually happen to Coraline? This series is much better than 'Twilight'. But then, Ron Koslow was part of the production team. He was also involved with 'Roar' and I believe 'Beauty and the Beast' (TV series), both which I also recommend."},{"rating":"2","title":"Friday Night Curse...Part 2","review":"This is a show that never was given a chance.

Relay pins 30 & 85 are tied together with a short jumper, and the remaining leads are for 86 and 87a. So, the way it works (e.g.) is that when 30 is hooked to your 12V DC, the jumper applies the trigger voltage to 85. If 86 is grounded, then you get *nothing* out of the 87a (NC) lead. You make this \\"work\\" by switching *open* the (86) lead to ground, allowing juice to flow out 87a. Why they don't just provide 5 connectors and 5 leads, especially including 87 (NO), I don't know.

Just put the pieces in the dishwasher and cleanup is a snap!The only thing I don't like is the large holes in the strainer let small pieces of meat, skin, etc. slip down into the broth.

I highly recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works perfectly - fat-free broth!","review":"I positively love my OXO fat separator! It holds a good amount of liquid, but not so much as to be difficult to pour. The lid helps strain out the solids, but if you want your broth to be absolutely clear, put a piece of cheesecloth over the lid.IMPORTANT - the little black stopper MUST be inserted in the pouring spout before you add liquids to the cup or the fat will simply rise up in the spout. The stopper creates a vacuum, forcing the fat into the main body of the cup. When you're ready to pour, remove the stopper and the fat will remain floating in the body of the cup.This cup is made out of high-quality plastic and washes up well in the dishwasher. It doesn't stain when you wash it with the tomato sauces! I've used mine for a couple of years and it's as good as new.

This was *almost* that perfect watch. ALMOST!Apparently, one must UNSCREW THE CROWN in order to set the time, and so far this has been impossible. A tiny crown unfit for human fingers. (Can someone suggest a *tool* that might work?) There should be an Amazon caveat in the description of this Casio. I fear disabling the setting stem entirely, so I have given up, put it on, and now must SUBTRACT two hours to determine the time. Later, i'll have to subtract only *one* hour. Golly! Even for twelve bux, one should get more than this. I'll have to find another, thus this was money wasted.

Its a casual looking watch, its SUPER thin, and seemingly weighs nothing. You wont even know it is there and the band does not pull on my arm hair.The battery also outlasted my other watches.Its a great watch and I would care less if It smashed into pieces, that's the beauty of it.

I myself have quite a few watches, Seikos and what not, all of which are so large on my wrist that I don't enjoy wearing them daily. This Casio watch is properly sized and fits very well on the wrist. The resin band feels sturdy for how thin it is and doesn't slide much around the wrist. Since it is adjustable there is no issue with fitting it to your wrist or removing links. The display is plain and clearly marks the time. This is a PERFECT standard watch, no frills, no unneeded gizmos. Casio provides this watch to serve the purpose of telling the time and it does just that stunningly well for a fantastic price. Cheap watch, looks wonderful, does its job."},{"rating":"1","title":"Died in 60 days with little use","review":"I bought this watch at the end of July, wore it once so it's received no abuse, now it's dead.

Agatha thought he was dead. Later Agatha pushes Jimmy into a ditch and he is found dead in the ditch. Agatha is suspected of murder. She and James Lacey start their usual round of questions and callin on people to try to find the killer. Other people start ending up dead after talking to Agatha and James. After another close call the killer is found. Will Agatha and James ever get together again. I guess we will have to read another book to find out.

Am looking forward to the next one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Murderous Marriage","review":"This is a great mystery - like the others and definitely is a 'cozy night in the storm' read. Beaton is similar to Christie in that she keeps the books short and to the point.

Saw these, read the description, looked at an example photo and thought they'd be perfect. When they came in, we followed all the instructions for hanging them, cleaning the area with rubbing alcohol, waiting until that was dry before putting them up and then waiting an hour to start hanging the lights. Within 30 minutes of putting them up, the whole top row fell down. Tried again, same deal. In the end, we cut slabs of packing tape, placed them over the hooks and cut through the tape where the hook is to put the light strand in and that held (for the most part).Maybe it's because we were using these on windows, but the directions never said it wasn't for use on windows so I didn't imagine it wouldn't work.

After following the directions...cleaning the window thoroughly with alcohol, pressing on for 30 seconds and waiting 1 hour before putting on the lights...the lights stayed up for about 24 hours before the clips started falling off one by one. The lights were small and were not too heavy for the hooks to support and it was not so cold outside that my windows were freezing.

If you don't the adhesive gets baked from the heat of the sun and breaks when you try to remove it.

What I did find through work with my ND, my system doesn't like dairy and eggs. So, I use Vegan cookbooks to help me make meals with no dairy or eggs. This cookbook, is AMAZING! The biscuit recipe. I LOVE. I use it to make my biscuits and gravy. My son and partner absolutely love them. There is a au gratin recipe too that I am soo happy with. My dairy loving family loves it too. I use this cook book more then my \\"Better Homes New Cook Book\\" cook book. Which I have used for over 15 years. The recipes in this book are simple. Ingredients, easy to find. Directions- easy. The assortment of recipes covers many of my comfort food needs.

There are things in this book that are just vegan versions of very normal everyday food. So many books have fancy stuff that restaurants have and my \\"meat and potatoes\\" omnivore hubby and my \\"only eats mashed potatoes and buttered noodles\\" semi-vegan 4 year old like plain food that is good. This book fits that description. It's food like what I grew up with, but \\"vegan-ized.\\" Oh, his quick and easy home made pizza sauce and spaghetti sauces are both super yummy! We have been making pizza every Saturday using his sauce and crust recipe. Plus, I love that he has a lot of easy desserts. I kept checking this out from the library and they kept wanting it back, so I finally had to buy it. I'm glad I did.

There might be good recipes in it somewhere, but the bulk of the cookbook is dedicated to common sense \\"prep steps\\" as opposed to actual cooking. I do not feel I need a recipe to make \\"Popcorn with Nutritional Yeast,\\" \\"Roasted Vegetables,\\" or \\"Roasted Garlic.\\" This book boasts over 400 recipes, but many of them are not actually recipes at all... they're barely meal ideas.If you're young or have never cooked before, or if you're a brand new vegan who only ever made meat and mashed potatoes, this might be a good book for you. But I never even open it. It's a huge disappointment to someone who actually likes to cook and who can tell a carrot peeler from a wooden spoon."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cookbook review","review":"This cookbook does not have pictures and I am a big visual image person. Also they suggest using a lot of \\"meat\\" substitutes and for those people who truly want to be Vegan, meatless chorizo isn't exactly appetizing.

I suppose one must balance the realities of animal life and the innocence of childhood, but with all the shootings and slashing of humans in our city of late, not to mention the escalating incidence of bullying, I found this book to glorify the violent nature of the tyrannosaurus' lifestyle a wee too much. 'Ripping', 'slicing', 'slashing' 'tearing' and 'thieving' are all words I'm not sure I want my child to embrace just yet.

The playing is mostly amateur. The lead guitar has some ability but the other three are playing simply and without any flair or dexterity or professional agility whatsoever. The pieces are all slow and I cannot believe four guitars are actually playing as any TWO professional classical guitarists would be able to play these easy arrangements at sight. The four here must each be playing just one note at a time. Yes the songs sound gentle and relaxing but my first year students could have played three of these guitars as well as these guitarists. The one piece with some interest is the final track of the Arcangelo Corelli Christmas Concerto, which isn't even credited to Corelli on the CD which states \\"All songs traditional\\".

All hardware was in packaging and instructions were easy to follow."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just a little longer","review":"I welcome the additions. They work very well and were easily installed. Small Problem. I know there is a balance between length (to much floor space taken) or in my case to little. Cutting horizontal, when you put a 4x8 piece on the machine there exists the possibility that it will tilt up and back at the initial saw cut, and when the 8' is pushed thru there is the possibility that the end top of the cut piece flips up. Operator must guard against this eventuality. 3-4\\" more extension fore and aft would prevent problem because the balance would favor ends closest to the saw in each case (before and after)."},{"rating":"2","title":"LOVE this stuff","review":"Have been buying this product since it was sold under the BioMedic brand that you had to get from the plastic surgeon's office!

None did anything for my enlarged pores or lines. Finally, skeptically, I tried philosophy's hope in a jar. I LOVE IT! Your skin will be moisturized but not greasy. It did not irritate my extremely sensitive skin. My skin looks radiant and much less red. My fine lines are reduced and my enlarged pores look better.

We ended up purchasing a Medela after using it at the hospital. I HIGHLY recommend having a lactation consultant help you! Do not try to figure it out yourself.

After using it for 8 months it just stopped working. It just shuts off after 40secs sometimes it will run until the 2 minute mark and then it will stop. Having said that amazon did agree to refund my money since I was still within the return window. So I went out and bought another one from Target because I NEEDED to pump. The new one from target is MUCH louder and doesn't seem to exactly the same, the suction is so weak and nothing like the first one. I contacted their customer service and they dont really seem to care much. They told me to send in both pumps for a refund but it will weeks to process. and they will only give me $100 for the older one. What a load of rubbish. DO NOT BUY THIS BRAND!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great so far...","review":"So far it is working great. When I told people I was shopping for a pump - everyone told me to rent one which was very expensive or buy a Medela which costs around 300 dollars. Both would have cost 3 times what I paid for this pump. I've only had it for 1 month and use it 2-3 times a day. My hope is that it will stay working good & last me another 2-3 months just until I am back at work and am done breastfeeding... we'll have to wait and see on that one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for daily pumping at work, efficient, quiet","review":"I have used this pump every day at work for 2 months. I get 4oz three times during my 8 hour shift. It only takes about 15 minutes tops. I can't say enough about this pump. It is fantastic. I am sure that Medela pumps are just as good, but I am so glad that I didn't shell out $300 for a Medela when this one has all the same features, milk cannot go into the tubing, and it works wonderfully! Very quiet compared to my sister's Medela and the battery hand operated pump I used for a couple weeks. Great suction. I only have it turned up to about 40% and it is all that is needed to get the job done with speed. Oh, and it is pretty light weight compared to my sister's Medela too."},{"rating":"2","title":"2nd time Mom","review":"I knew I was going to breast feed while on maternity leave, and go as long as I could after returning to work. So I knew I was going to need a pump for work. With my first child, I rented the Hospital one, and lugged that beast to and fro work. I finally got sick of how big it was and quit nursing/pumping after a month. Since I knew this was my last child, I didn't want to spend out a lot of money for a $2-300 pump. After reading these reviews, I had to try this one for the $. I am sure glad I did. After my son was born, we had latching issues, so I decided to pump 100%, and bottle feed. This is my ninth week of using the pump, I pump 5-6 times a day for about 15 minutes each time, and it still works as good as the first day. It is a little louder, but for the price I can live with it. The caps are hard to snap off the flanges, but once again, for this price, it's worth the elbow grease."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Pump","review":"I only gave it 4 stars rather than 5 because The pump makes a constant beeping sound which will make pumping at school anything but descete. Other than that it's a great pump. It provides suction that is similare to my babies so the milk comes out quickly and painlessly. Plus it's one of the cheapest electric pumps on the market. I'm very happy we bought this one. If I changed anything it would be the annoying beeping so pumping can be more private."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great!","review":"This is a great pump. It's so easy to use amd it works! There are very few parts to clean and unlike the Medela, you don't have to clean the tubing because of the closed system.

The speed and suction are neither too great or too small. If I had a baby that was difficult to breastfeed I would feel comfortable using this pump to replace the breast feeding 100% of the time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love this pump!","review":"I love this breastpump! I had a single breastpump with my first son, and I just couldn't pump enough to keep up with him as a working mom. I researched and researched after baby #3, because I hated to spend $250+ on a pump that might not work. I finally bit the bullet and tried the Lansinoh, which I got (at the time) for $116 on Amazon. Truly love this pump! It's easy to clean, quiet, and does the job fast. My only complaint is that it's hard to get replacement parts...pretty much only through the manufacturer, and their shipping is a little pricey. But as long as you don't lose anything, this pump will work really well for you!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Pump at Half the Price","review":"I have the medela at home & this one at work & they both work the same. My only complaint is that it gets a little condensation at the top. Aside from that, it is a great pump for the price. It is light enough to carry back & forth if I needed to. I highly recommend this pump."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do NOT Buy This Pump!!","review":"I just bought this pump at Walmart because my Medela pump just quit on me. I wanted to buy another one but was in a pinch and settled for this one. I just spent 30 minutes trying to pump and I got nothing. The suction on this pump is HORRIBLE. There is no suction whatsoever....it's awful. When using my Medela pump, milk begins coming out instantly. With this, barely two drops came out after 20 minutes. I tired it on every setting there was and nothing. I agree with everyone else's reviews: spend the extra money and get a Medela. They are worth every penny!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible, Horrible, Horrible!!!!!!!","review":"I have never had an issue with Lansinoh products before...until now! I ordered this pump for a friend as a gift because she just delivered her baby. After five minutes of using the pump, the motor dies. So, she unplugged it and took the hoses off, and plugged it back in...it still DIDN'T work!! The timer numbers would show, but then they would disappear 30 seconds after turning it on. I am very sad after paying so much money for a product that doesn't work. I will be returning this item and expecting a refund. In the meantime, I will be looking to get her a pump elsewhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"They sent us a USED pump!!??","review":"Package arrived today with all the bags inside torn open, water spots, hair, and other debris around the pump area that touches your skin, and we're even missing some things that are on the \\"included\\" list. This item was purchased by a friend as a gift from our baby registry so I don't even know how to exchange this for a new one.I don't even know where to start other to say that someone better contact us soon about sending a replacement as there was no contact information on the receipt (actually there was no receipt at all - only a return slip) and I certainly don't want to have to explain this to our friend.Ridiculous."},{"rating":"1","title":"Get a Medela instead and save your breasts!!","review":"I bought the Lansinoh Affinity prior to having my first child. When I delivered, I had an emergency C section and had to stay in the hospital for 4 days. The hospital had Medela Symphony pumps in every mother/baby room and in the NICU where my daughter was too. I LOVED the Symphony. It really got the job done! I used the Lansinoh twice two days before my daughter was due to come home. I had been pumping at the hospital, but wanted to try at home. Needless to say, I DID NOT like the Lansinoh. It's loud, it hurt my nipples and had poor suction. I did not think the settings were very good at the finer adjustments and finesse needed for good pumping. I got less milk in 10 minutes from the Lansinoh than I did in 5 minutes using the Medela. I ended up going and buying a Medela Pump In Style. Ladies, do your breasts a favor- spend your money on a Medela!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst pump ever","review":"I bought this pump despite bad reviews and I regretted it from day one. The pump NEVER worked properly and nothing I did would make it work the way that it should. I was never able to get any milk out with this pump. I highly recommend a Medela Pump In Style Advanced pump. Don't waste your money on one of these to try to save some money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lansinoh Double Electric Breast Pump","review":"The breast pump was not powerful enough to adequately suction the milk regardless of the setting. I called the manufacture for assistance and they said they would swap parts but that a refund would not be provided. This was problematic because the parts were not broken; the product was just poor quality. I would suggest spending the extra money and getting a quality breast pump.It was also very difficult to contact the manufacturer because their business hours were not responsible for someone living in the western portion of the country. Even when I called during their business hours, I still got their answering machine."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not waste your money on this pump","review":"I do not usually write reviews, but I felt it was important to write this one.Please do not waste your money on this pump!!!! If you pump occasionaly this pump might work for you, but if you have to go back to work and pump on a regular basis, this pump is a total waste of your money. It does not have a good suction and it is very poorly designed. I had to request a replacement of my pump first week I started using it daily. The new pump they sent still does not work well and the suction is very bad. Just like everyone else I read the reviews and I could not afford a $300 Medela pump so I bought this one. After dealing with this terribile pump for 3 months, I now realize that it is so worth spending the money and purchasing either a Medela or Ameda pump that ALL lactation specialists recommend. Please do not make the same mistake! You will pay twice!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"a great pump","review":"This pump is great. The only reason I didn't give it the 5th star is because it doesn't come with a bag or give any suggesstions on how to carry it back and forth to work while keeping it clean and discrete. They don't seem to even sell a bag for it. But the pump works great, parts are easy to clean and it is a better value for the money than others such as Medela, etc."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of Money","review":"i bought this pump about 2 weeks ago and 2 days ago i was pumping when it turned off on its own. I thought it was the outlet that i was using but after trying a different outlet i realized it was the pump. Ever since that day its been turning off, not even 2 minutes after starting. Other than that its really loud when in use, i cant pump while my baby is sleeping in the same room. I would NOT recommend this pump at all even for its price, because i have to come back out of pocket to buy another pump"},{"rating":"1","title":"defective","review":"product did not work. defective. very disapointed since it got 4 stars. I was looking forward to receiving this item."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Happy","review":"I had a Medela with my first child but it didn't seem to have the same suction this time around. I had received it as a gift, so I never really had looked into different pumps. One thing I HATED about my Madela was that milk backed up into the tubes, which actually led to mold growth at one point. And once it got there, it was impossible to get out.So I was very excited about the design of this pump. I also looked at the Ameda, but this looked exactly the same, only cheaper.As soon as I got this pump, I immediately began having a better pumping experience. I had starting wondering how I had found it so easy last time :-) I've been using it 2-3 times per day for the last few weeks and have had no problems at all. I also love the size -I have the pump, a small cooler and extra bottles in a bag that is still smaller than my old Medela.I would highly recommend this pump - I just can't see paying over $200 more for a fancy bag."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't thorw your money to the trash can!!!","review":"I bought this pump as a replace of my first years double electric pump that is still working perfect but got off twice, it has now 6 months (it pumps three times daily), Lansinoh appers a good option to us, we ordered at amazon but from a third party that took to many days to ship it even with the two day shipping payment, now I got the pump, I can assure you the pump doesn't gets any milk at all (it doesn't matter the combination of cycle and suction you use) after that we used my first years again and we got about 8 onz."},{"rating":"1","title":"THE SUCTION STOPPED WORKING","review":"I bought this breast pump for my wife and for 4 and a half months it worked great. She used it everyday and was very pleased. But the suction started to decrease and what took 20 minuted started taking 45 minutes. So we decided to buy a different pump, well the walmart in our small town only had this pump. We decided to go ahead and buy it. It did work so well and she desperately needed relief. The second one stopped working after less than two weeks of use. We are extremely disappointed! We have contacted the manufacturur and am waiting for a call back. I wouldn't suggest anyone buy this pump. Its understandable for something to stop working or break every now and then but for both of them to stop working is ridicules. Now we have spent more than two hundred dollars and would have much rather spent that on a better pump!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Broke within first week of use..","review":"I'm giving this 2 stars because the only good thing about this product is the flanges are comfortable when pumping and that's basically it. The worst part is that it only comes with one size and you have to order them through lansinoh if you want a different size. Even the cheap single hand pumps will come with various size flanges. After using this breast pump for a week the motor started slowing down for no reason and eventually stopped working altogether. Waste of time and money. I was able to pump more milk out with a hand pump than with this thing anyway. Would not recommend."},{"rating":"1","title":"won't work with batteries","review":"After only a couple uses, this stopped working when trying use it with batteries.

I cannot send it back, and I cannot get a refund. This is so awful! Over a hundred dollars, DOWN THE DRAIN! I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS PUMP TO ANY MOTHER WHO IS NURSING!

So how I am out the gift card totally and a breast pump."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dump this pump!","review":"I bought this breast pump based on the reviews I read elsewhere thinking I made a good choice with all the other ones out there. The reviews were 50/50, but I decided to give it a try. Basically after the first month of pumping it started to squeak very loudly and I had to put a pillow over it to keep the noise to a minimal. Also when changing the setting from the mid point to the max point the pump did not pump any faster then the mid point which was very disappointing. I never did get a lot of yield from this pump. Trust me, you are better off with a different pump!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst pump, don't buy","review":"I went into early labor (6 weeks) so my husband went to the local Walmart & bought this pump. It worked for 91 days. The warranty is only good for 90 days. It is extremely loud, has a lot of parts, and I didn't like having to pump then pour the milk in a bottle. After this sorry pump died, I did rent a Medela. Lots of parts too but much quieter. I then bought an Avent single electric & realized what I'd been missing. Even though it was a single pump, I was able to pump more milk in less time (for both breasts) than either of the previous pumps. It's quiet & pumps straight to a bottle. Lansinoh nursing pads are good but the pump is absolutely terrible"},{"rating":"1","title":"Defective product","review":"I got this off my baby list and I used it 3 times when I went to use it again it would turn on and right back off then after pushing the on button many time I finally got it to turn on and work then it shut off after five minutes now it just turns on and off again sometimes you can hear it try to start like something is lose and I don't like the suction levels very poor suction although dose get the milk out but takes much longer"},{"rating":"1","title":"Short-Lived","review":"I bought this pump while I was pregnant because of the reviews and the trust I had in previous lansinoh products. After having my baby this pump was fantastic. I loved the settings and that it felt like a hospital grade product and gave me a great milk supply. 1 month into using it once a day and it has now stopped working regularly. I have tried everything, replacing parts, changing plugs, still nothing. It works for about 3 seconds on the let down phase and shuts off immediately, unless I quickly change the suction level. I called customer service and they are no longer manufacturing this pump so if you purchase it and something is faulty, they will not be able to replace it, only refund you. Just a quick FYI on my experience. I am disapointed, I wish I would have went with my original choice of the avent double pump instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dissappointing . . .","review":"This product looked good and came with storage bags and the lansinoh nipple cream samples. However, it's performance as a pump was quite disappointing. I had been using an avent manual pump daily for my son's supply for the creche/daycare center and typically got 12 oz per session from both breasts in 30 - 40 mins. With this pump, i got barely 3 oz from both breasts after 30 minutes of pumping!Also, it has more parts to fit together than i care for. I had read reviews and some found it great but sadly, that wasnt my experience."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good pump/good value","review":"I bought this pump before the birth of our daughter, thinking I'd use it occasionally as I'm stay-@-home mom. After the birth, our daughter had problems nursing/latching on. I've been using this pump daily, at least 8 times a day, ever since her birth almost 4 weeks ago. It's very easy to assemble and clean. I would agree w/ other reviews that it is a little louder than I would have liked. Otherwise, I've been impressed with how well it's worked with frequent use. I'd say a good value."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works great!","review":"I think this pump works great! It's easy to use and clean.

I am happy that I bought it, with in 15 minutes you can pump atleast 8 ounces and the best point is it is very light weight. But one thing is single pump is more effective than double pump. I would definitely recommend this.

As a Shakespeare scholar, I have always cringed when I hear students of the bard describe Hamlet as a \\"man who could not make up his mind.\\" Oliver tells us at the beginning of this film the very essence he sees in Hamlet. I have *no* problem with him interpreting in a way I do not agree with, but to say this is the \\"definitive work, period\\" is unfair to some other wonderful adaptations. For my money, Branagh's Hamlet is a more honest portrayal and the excellent dress rehearsal Dvd with Richard Burton is mind-blowing.I do not dislike Olivier, but Hamlet is hardly his best Shakespearean work. Richard III is much better and Henry V is perhaps better than Branagh's version."},{"rating":"2","title":"The very best!","review":"It is because of \\"Larry\\", I came to love and understand the great Bard, all through high school and college, I never could grasp and appreciate Shakespeare, until I came upon the master actor of possibly all time, I would say without fear of contradiction, his work will out live all others, as far as this set of disc's from Criterion, I am sure they just as good as the single one's I have in my collection, the price is a great savings from single purchase, I might add the having seen the great films, opening a book of Shakespeare was a wonderful \\"new' experience."},{"rating":"2","title":"perfect","review":"I bought a 37\\" TV and wanted to mount it.

In the field of information security, Mitnick is known to all of us as the king of social engineering. Let's be completely honest (even Mitnick and Littman exposed this in the book)... Kevin is not good at hacking but rather at exploiting the human factor. That is - humans are the weakest link in this whole information security thing - not the systems themselves. You want to design a secure system? - educate your users, administrators, managers and executives on how to be wise and vigilant and adhere to a sound security policy.Thank you to Mr. Littman for showing us the many sides of Mitnick's life.

If you're a hacker, there's lots of good information in The Fugitive Game.

Apparently the screenwriter and the director don't realize he got the answer exactly wrong.I'm all in favor of poetic license to make an entertainment film more interesting.

This is as much as the story has in common with facts. The movie succeeds to make an average movie out of an interesting story. Students were actually taught a winning strategy that was the work of a mathematician and used it to win in casinos. There was nothing brilliant at that. Maybe the innate self-confidence of MIT students made the realization of the project possible. It is typical for movie directors to rather stick with tried fiction templates than to tell a much more interesting real story. But I guess they must know what brings more money.

The script writers clearly did not understand the type of card-counting being done in Bringing Down the House, which is probably why they created this bogus back-story about a brainiac college student (very unconvincingly acted by Jim Sturgess) that had nothing to do with this kind of card-counting, which is done by teams and does not require one to be a brainiac, just detail-oriented and observant, and able to follow directions. In addition, the first sample presented in the movie of his mathematical prowess was that he knew how to break 100% up into 3 parts...which made his professor take a second look at his paper...at MIT no less...which is even more unconvincing than the acting. Overall result? Embarrassing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful","review":"Terribly disapointing movie.

It tends to bend down and in, kind of ducking underneath the truck. Another flaw is that the bolts interfere with each other, you're better off making your own brackets.

This brand (specifically this speed) worked fine. I tried other Memorex DVDs which had a higher speed and they all ended up as coasters. You may need to test several brands and speeds out to see which are compatible with your burner. Cd media is pretty much universally compatible, but DVD's and DVD+DL's are note yet i guess. For me, these work fine. YOU need to do your own testing for your particular burner. Most stores should have an exchange policy for these in case a certain type didn't work.

I promise you this, you will have a lot of problems with these disc.I have a Sony DVD recorder RDR-GX330 and it does not recognize any of these disc. Period. First 4 disc out of the box would not format. Threw the rest of the package of disc in the trash. And since these are DL disc, I cannot use them anywhere else unless I have another dual layer recorder.

Perhaps one disc in 10 gets a media error on write so that the copy doesn't even complete.I disconnect the PC from the network while copying and make sure that no other programs are running. Copies are made at a 1x speed on a 2.66 Gh Pentium 4 with a Sony DW-D26A writer.I never had these problems with Memorex single layer discs but the double layer discs seem to me to be very unreliable.

In my pack I am able to store a spare tube, tire levers, multi tool, ID + cash, keys, cell phone and ~3 hrs worth of snacks. It is pretty full with that gear in the pack + a full bladder. It has an expandable external pocket that I feel could be used for storing a clothing layer during the winter/rainy times.Would recommend for 2-4 hour rides or for the rider who is wanting a sleeker hydration pack."},{"rating":"2","title":"Biking backpack","review":"I really like this backpack. I have yet to use it for hiking, but it is great for bike rides, long and short. I don't have a waterbottle holder on one of my bikes, so this was a necessary purchase when my other pack fell apart. From the first use there was no plastic taste like there was in my previous (non-camelbak) pack. It has a great design and the ability to fill the bladder without taking it out of the bag is great. When you do need to take it out is is really easy though, had no troubles and putting it back in is easy too. I expect to get a lot of use out of this pack.There isn't as much room in the pack as there was in my last one, but it is still very good for long bike rides. I took it on a 4.5 hr bike ride last weekend and it help more then enough snacks and water, plus it has straps to attach a light/rain jacket if needed.I would recommend this pack (or any camelbak, really)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good for reference only not direct use w/ kids-no pictures!!","review":"Buy this book only if you can't come up with appropriate social stories for your child(ren) on your own.

The script is biting and at times hard to watch. The cinematography is dark and cheap looking, a nice contrast to the content.My personal favorite actor- Chris Eigeman. Together with KICKING AND SCREAMING, another overlooked classic, he became the representative to me at least of an entire generation of men who are smart yet deeply distanced from life.The Criterion DVD is one of the best around.

Is it an independent film sure, but is it a campy film? By no means. This is a very dialogue oriented film, but unlike Ivory Merchant films, the dialogue is witty and enjoyable. In reality, this film could easily be a play, and that is saying quite a lot. The plot has been explained earlier, so I won't waste your time. Is this movie good? Yes. Should you own it? If you like thought-provoking movies, that actually require you to listen to the dialogue.

But as much as I respect Whit Stillman for the efforts he went through to write and direct Metropolitan, I'm afraid I was utterly bored by his movie.

I cannot comprehend the acclaim that this movie has garnered. Terrible scriptwriting, terrible directing, terrible acting. It's boring, cliched, and it is impossible to feel the slightest connection to any of the 2-D characters. I winced through the whole thing.The writer/director went to Harvard, and I can't help feeling like this is a product of the \\"cult of Harvard\\" where people project all kinds of intelligence and wit onto the grads.

The director, who also did the yawnfest, Barcelona, has absolutely no sense of flow or wit. And yet critics seem to gravitate towards this nonsense. If this type of casual diatribe is what you dig, then try the Merchant-Ivory claptrap which at least contributes some costume design. Or better yet, see Campbell Scott and Jennifer Jason-Leigh in the Dorothy Parker film. At least you will laugh. Nothing funny here, and nothing interesting for that matter. All you are subjected to is soap-operish musings about class and a kindergarten philosophy that grows stale with 5 minutes of alertness. I really wanted to try to find something positive about this film. Even the self conscious rantings were stilted with apologies.

Today's students may wonder-- Just how far did the conservative backswing of the social pendulum travel once Reagan and Republican ideas gave it a shove? Pretty far, by the looks of this upstart, independent film production.

But, if you aren't afraid of extreme movies, check this one out."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pointless","review":"I watched this movie, having unfortunately bought into the hype. However, after 78 minutes I was left thinking what was the whole point. Yes, its a movie about revenge - but how jaded is that idea? The two protagtonists seemed to stumble from one scene to the next - the film didn't seemed to 'flow' well. It was as if the producers were trying to shock their audience with each scene. I was not horrified, as some people have been, by the anti-male udercurrent in the movie (all it portrayed was that some women hate men. Wow!). However, I would not view this as some masterpiece of arthouse cinema. The violence was not as graphic as Tarrantino has been (especially in Dusk Till Dawn, where he was particularly gratuitous) Similarly the violence was not as random as Natural Born Killers. The sex scenes were annoying and pointless (all they showed was that men are only thinking of sex.

My expectations were very low and the moment I saw the menu screen, I knew that I made a terrible choice. The movie feels like a home video (which is not bad), but zapping through the chapters (and it's only 77 minutes long), I couldn't find anything interesting about the film. Zero. The actors are ordinary, the dialogue is lame, I guess the only positive thing about this film is that I can hear how the French really \\"curse,\\" for a lack of anything nice to say about baise-moi.

It did not make me uncomfortable as a man or as a human being. I am all for watching hot naked chicks have sex and kill people. In theory, this should be a great movie. And yet... it is a snooze. Poorly written, poorly directed, poorly acted, shot on crappy-looking video, with bad special effects. It would be laughable if it wasn't wasting my life.It ain't art, people, and it sure as hell ain't any fun.P.S. If you really want to watch a disturbing French film, try Gaspar Noe's I Stand Alone (Seul Contre Tou).

However, Baise Moi seems to have rejected all attempts at a coherent/plausable storyline in favour of constant gross shock. Production is smooth, and the camera work is very good, but it does all seem a bit sensless, reeling from one abasement to another, without even lipservice to rationality.

Here's the plot, if you can call it that, two women drive across France killing innocent people in gruesome and sickening ways. Every once in awhile they have sex. That's it. On the technical side, this DVD has the worst picture of any DVD I've seen where the source material was post-1930. It's very grainy and looks like it was shot with a home-quality 8mm camcorder.

It was also quite boring, even with a short running time. Maybe the film would be at least partially enjoyed if it weren't promoted to be something it isn't. We're talking about nothing more than trashy B cinema here, and it should have been promoted as such. Instead it seemed like the joke was on the audience, having been lured into this movie by it's gag only to find out it was a cruddy Thelma and Louise wannabe. Baise-Moi isn't as original as it seems to think it is either. Remember the other attempt to bring hardcore sex to mainstream film, Caligula? Remember that failed as well? Before you storm the foreign section for this title, desperate to see what the big deal is, I'd suggest taking home Caligula instead.

The film strains so hard to be shocking and disturbing, but the only disturbing thing about it is that gullible people will be fooled into thinking it's a work of art.I can't stand movies that treat gender issues so simplistically. To reduce the complexity of human relations to a cut-and-dried,black-and-white worldview as this film does is truly criminal.

Yet during an early rape scene, the camera focuses on a shot exactly like you'd see in a porn film. Why? Was that necessary? But the again, these filmmakers didn't seem to be all that interested in making a film but just an unpleasant journey for the viewer and they succeeded.This film is no French \\"Thelma and Louise.\\" The latter film features one act of violence done in the heat of the moment. This film features premeditated violence, most of if pointless and sensationalistic. There's nothing noteworthy about this movie, not the performances or the cheap filming style. It's just a lousy excuse from lousy filmmakers."},{"rating":"1","title":"More hype than art","review":"After having heard so much about Baise-Moi, I was actually fairly disappointed. Yes, it may have broken some new ground with its graphic sex (the violence you've seen before, and done better, in 100 other films)and brutality, but certainly not enough to start a whole new genre. The problem is, the sex seems to be there only for its own sake; it follows no rhyme or reason. Nor, for that matter, does the violence. I know it was supposed to be random, but even that's kind of covoluted. It's really difficult to have sympathy for the 2 main characters, because they're victims of their own doing even before they go off. And the film is not only surprisingly short (77 minutes), but it just kind of ends, with no true resolution. Maybe worth seeing if you can get a copy cheap."},{"rating":"1","title":"A WASTE OF TIME, ENERGY, AND INTELLECT...","review":"hardly worth a star... basicly a \\"film\\" whos whole marketing and publicity strategy was based on its penetration scenes and violence.the story is a complete bore along with its characters.actually, the movie is worse than boring, its frustrating in the fact that it it is based on a concept that could have easily said something worthy and meaningful even with its trasparent use of violence and \\"hardcore\\" sex scenes, but instead takes the easy road of trying to \\"shock and awe\\" its audience.dont buy into the hype of the film, you'll only be left empty and wanting your money and time back that was so brutally wasted on this.your time, money, and intellect is much better spent on gaspar noes \\"IRREVERSIBLE\\".granted your love or hate of this film ,at least you'll walk away feeling something more substantial than what baise moi (dosen't) provides on every level."},{"rating":"1","title":"Plagiarism and exploitation, not art!","review":"This movie is only an unimaginative mix of Thelma and Louise and Natural Born Killers.

But in this movie pornographic clips are totally meaningless. The movie itself is very pathetic and extremelly boring. It is very much like amateur home-made movie. The only thing that is common with 'Thelma and Louise' is that both movies have two women running loose as main characters. I understand that creators and actors came from porno business. Maybe it was their attempt to move to mainstream. Well, their attempt failed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sordid and nasty rip-off of Messidor","review":"Found this sad little DVD in the 2-99 bargain bucket and thought I'd give it a go.What a mistake!Baise-Moi is a blatent rip-off of Alain Tanner's far superior \\"Messidor\\" but with a shed-load of gratuitous and explicit sex and violence tacked on.With two very unattractive women doing very unpleasant things to other unattractive people, this is utterly worthless and derivative art-house porn with nothing to redeem it.The sex is on a similarly graphic level to 9 Songs - full penetration, fellatio and the money shot, but here is accompanied with much extreme violence and I doubt if anyone would find it a turn-on.A low-point in French cinema.Avoid."},{"rating":"1","title":"one has to ask why?","review":"This is certainly a very rough-to-watch film. One is spared the blood spattering of the bullets entering bodies, but one is spared very little else. Obviously two very angry women. I would think that the graphic nature of their anger could have been presented in a more palitable manner. On the reviews shown on the DVD, both the positive and negative reviews were shown, and that is an honest plus. If a person wanted to view a film of two angry women then I would recommend Butterfly Kiss; two English women on a journey of destruction with better acting and far less graphic."},{"rating":"1","title":"wow...","review":"So this is the movie that is supposed to shock and awe me!? this movie has been hyped up to be one of the most violent and disturbing movies of all time, but i found it to be the most poorly made piece of crap i have ever seen. the acting is horrible (thats what you get from porn stars)the camera work and editing is chopy and hard to follow, and the special effects look amature at best.I love to push my limits when it comes to movies, thats why i was so excited when i found this on ebay for ten bucks. i watched this movie twice just to make sure i didnt miss anything,and i did...4 hours of my life.This is pretty much a low budget porn flick, not a good movie. so if your looking for some hardcore sex action, go get a good porn. if your looking for a movie that is shocking and violent, check out \\"irreversible.\\" but what ever you do, stay far away from this movie"},{"rating":"1","title":"France's Answer to Thelma and Louise?","review":"We've all heard the hype about how \\"graphic\\" and \\"real\\" this film is. In truth, this film is a low-budget, D-grade foreign film that steals an idea from an American film and gives it that supposed \\"edge.\\" Let's face it, the only reason this film got so much press was because you can actually see penetration in the rape scenes, something that was previously taboo in film. Even this is tainted by the unreal use of condoms by the rapists. They actually stop, put on their condoms, and then get to work. The actresses are two low-grade porn stars. Overall, this film is a cheap immitation that uses shock to get noticed. Don't waste your money!

She has done some large remodeling projects on our homes over the years and isn't exactly a novice on these types of things. I thought this would be a no brainer as far as scoring \\"hubby\\" points and bought her the book. Big mistake, while I didn't read it I was told by the wife that this was nothing more than worked over material from previous shows with a few tid bits thrown in to spice things up. She did say that there was a bit of interesting background on Candice but reading the book in general was a disappointment and waste of time to say the least. Bummer I say!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I like almost everything that Candice Olson does on her tv show. Traditional with a twist, or something to that effect is her motto. This book was published in 2006...not so long ago, right? Everything in ths book is pure, boring, traditional. There was not one picture that spoke to me AT ALL.

The guide is geared to high school students, and would provide good supplementary material to a unit on Jane Eyre. Buyers should know, however, that it is written from a Christian perspective, and therefore also includes questions based on particular biblical passages as they relate to the novel.

Reading it, I got the impression he was in the ring with me and shouting in my ear! Not that the tone is harassing, it's just that it never let's up from the beginning to the end. It's all about taking responsibility for where you are going in life and figuring out a way to get there. Gunter calls living life this way Maximum Velocity Performance.No fancy language and long, drawn out explanations. Just direct, common-sense advice about living up to your own potential. I was expecting more on physical training in the book because of Gunter's background, but this book is more of a pre-cursor to the workout. You can use it as a pep talk (on steroids) if you're already involved in a workout program. Gunter says he's coming out with a book in the future specifically focused on training."},{"rating":"1","title":"Think Twice Before Buying this Book","review":"I am one of those people that are always looking for books and literature to motivate me. I stumbled on this book, Focus on the Final Seconds by Almon Gunter, and I have to say, the book did not motivate me. I did like the fact that you could write your own thoughts in the book while reading it, but still, I did not get much out of the ideas and concepts he presented. His ideas were nothing new or earth shattering. His voice or tone of the book seemed preachy and a little self-serving, not giving me the impression that he was motivating me, but talking down to me. If you were looking for a book to motivate you, I would consider other options."},{"rating":"2","title":"Read This One Twice","review":"Read it once for the warm stories and read it again for the solid business advice. While I often thought to myself \\"Oh yeah, I knew that\\", I looked around and found I wasn't DOING it.

Think I'll carry some copies with me as I travel and give one to every airline rep, hotel clerk, restaurant manager and rental car associate who still doesn't understand the value of a long term customer.

Yes.","review":"Listening to the work is quite difficult to point out the exact number of all sources of sound which makes for rather good intellectual education. What you won't hear is something quick or lyric laden to the point of audial barrage. The quality of the music is appreciated as the closest one gets in popular music is Pink Flyod or Led Zeppelin without the storyline provided by the lyrics of either band. At the same time the inclusion of the devices outside the keyboard will resonate more with those inspired more by Marinetti than the top lists of music, as it should be, Not Like Most."},{"rating":"1","title":"What?!

However, midway through the book the plot just got horribly convoluted and made no sense whatsoever. Or maybe it wasn't the plot but the author's rather haphazard way of writing. It seems as though the author took his time the first third of the book, but the rest was just written with no thought as to explaining things so the reader could follow what was going on and why the characters were doing what they were doing.

I expected a readable, well-organized explanation of the rules of English grammar and punctuation that would also function as a reference. Instead, I found it to be rather poorly explained, hard to follow, and focused on issues I didn't care about. The book is basically descriptive grammar, which tries (as I understand it) to deduce the rules of the language rather than state them. I just want to know what I should or should not do, or when there's disagreement I want that stated. Complicated terminology was used and then later introduced. The sentence diagramming tended to confuse me rather than help.You're a lot better off with a good style guide. I recommend the New York Public Library Guide to Style and Usage.

Joe is forced to save his own life while being pursued by the evil Hank and the half-wit Emmett.The action and the situation captive the inexperienced reader and appeals to basic Romantic notions.

But unlike Man On Wire it doesn't tell a tale of grand dreams, but of simple introspection--dreams of a time bygone. The director calls it a \\"docu-fantasia\\" and uses a lot of creative gimmicks such as having his mother play herself in reenactments, shooting in black and white, narrating and cutting the entire documentary in a stream of consciousness arthouse film style. All of these stylistic notions are interesting in their concept yet ultimately fail to engage or entertain for the entire length of a film. Maddin's love for his hometown hockey teams and torn down structures that he felt defined his town is apparent. However he failed to make me empathize with that connection, which left for a mostly unengaging film experience."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waiting for Mah Jongg set to arrive...","review":"I'm sure this would be a 5 star game IF it EVER arrives but SERVICE is less than one star.

I enjoy making cakes for family and friends and am by no means a professional. After about 5 or 6 uses the mat developed a split in one side probably due to the weight of the mat itself. It is very heavy and unwieldy when trying to use it to help get the fondant on the cake. Washing and drying it are also a pain. I did have it stick to the fondant several times as well. Within the next two uses the split in the side spread to the middle of the mat, making it pretty much useless. Maybe I can cut it down and use it for smaller cakes or something but for the price I am very disappointed in the product."},{"rating":"2","title":"I hope I bought it sooner","review":"I'm glad I bought this mat.

Also, it is very heavy. I would be very nervous putting the weight of this on my cake when transferring the fondant.

I could only tolerate 5 days with this phone before I finally gave up and returned it.

Too bad that the phone has horrible sound and is completely useless for that reason. My wife and I both had to throw up our hands after a single day of use and use our cell phones in order to carry on calls with friends and co-employees. You cannot hear half of what other people are saying (everything is very weak and scratchy) and you cannot be heard clearly by anyone you call (ditto). It is just as bad on the built in speakerphone or using a headset. Motorola should be ashamed of this one, it's just awful.

Unfortunately the headset turns out to be uncomfortable and unwieldly to use, and more importantly the sound quality is appaling. It is frequently difficult to hear the other party at all: there is almost constant interference (the main reason for opting for a 5.8GHz phone is not to get interference -- note also that I've used this set in two separate locations with the same results), the volume is too low, and even on maximum the hands-free remains almost inaudible.Avoid."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst sound quality ever","review":"This phone is the coolest phone - it has all the bells and whistles you could possibly want. Polyphonic ring tones, speakerphone, 50 number storage phone book, expandable system up to 8 phones. I would have LOVED this phone had it not been for one crucial detail. The sound quality was horrible. There was constant static, and everyone's voices had an electronic \\"echo\\". Additionally, the phone seemed to cut off the last syllable of every other word or so, making it impossible to have an intelligent conversation. Everyone I talked to got sick of hearing me say, \\"Huh? What did you say?\\" and begged me to get another phone. I even exchanged the first one, thinking I had gotten a bad apple, but sure enough, the second time around was the same story. I returned this phone today.

But, static, crackle, and a very short range make this phone virtually unusable. I had bought a base and 2 extension phones. These phones were expensive and would have been worth it if they worked as advertised. But, sound quality is a joke. Thank goodness I kept the receipts. I used to think that the Motorola name meant quality when it came to communication equipment. Obviously, they're not above using their name to soak you on a half baked product now and then.

The author's intended critique of the Bush/Blair War on Terror is too obvious and clunking, especially when expressed through the metaphysical conceit of a toilet brush and a flea waltzing in a darkened motel room.Matters improve once the Archduke is introduced in chapter 79, until the exploding cat litter incident reveals him to be an unreliable narrator. This cruel trick completely undermines the reader's sympathy built up in the section, written entirely in iambic heptameter, where he learns of his half-brother's Sapphic tendencies.Finally, the over-zealous use of the number 9 spoils an otherwise perfectly serviceable dénouement."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mother Lode - DVD","review":"I bought this DVD thru Amazon.

Though the book was very short, more essay length really, much of that length was taken up rehashing commonly known facts about viruses. The small section of the book that was devoted to new ideas, the roles of viruses in the ocean, was presented in a superficial, skimpy way. It was shameful to call this a book, with its maybe five pages of interesting material, and I resent the money I spent on it."},{"rating":"2","title":"What about the abnormal deviates?","review":"Why don't you ever hear about them?

One is soonstruck by the author's prolixity and extremely minimal vocabulary. The plot is so fragmented and pointillistic that one begins to feel they could start anywhere and read in either direction or upside down and the novel would make as much or as little sense.The title of the appendix is an oxymoron and one is left to wonder if this was an attempt at humor, or simple ineptness.

The beginning was rather slow, but it began to pick up pace somewhere on page 7.

The best solution for this is to have this in a searchable digital form (likeA Million Random Digits THE SEQUEL: with Perfectly Uniform Distribution-- in Kindle! Though, sadly, this collection is admittedly pseudorandom).This book also needs translation into hexadecimal and binary (as mentioned by other reviewers). Finally, the 100,000 normal deviates, while considered deviates in 2001 when this was first published, are now referred to by enlightened mathematicians with more precise and less pejorative terms, and viewed simply as a part of the rich fabric of randomness in the infinity of number sets."},{"rating":"1","title":"Customer Reviews on this Book ... ???","review":"I've been reading a lot of comments on this book, and I'm completely dumbfounded.

After we discussed it for a while, the customer service rep told me that the payment went through and the items would be shipped. Since I was running out of time to get my order, I really needed him to be telling the truth. My credit card had plenty of funds, but the billing address was wrong. I changed it over the phone, so everything should have been ok, as the customer service rep expressed. The next day it still hadn't sent, so I had to spend a few hours on the phone with Amazon yet again. At this point, I have two days before I need the order and it won't ship until tomorrow.

In addition, there are references made by the main characters to the Frankenstein movie - jokes! I understand that this is fiction and requires the suspension of disbelief, but how can one get into a book about current plots by an insane Victor Frankenstein while the characters in the book refer to the Frankenstein movie?

I understand that some people may not be ready to face certain things about themselves. For those people, this book may make very little sense to them. Hopefully there will come a time for everyone when they are ready to look at their own insecurities and learn from them. Once that time comes, I recommend you read this book. It will be painful at first but it will also help you find a way to a better existence. Denial and repression allows you to stay somewhat comfortable but it also leaves you in a state of arrested development. There is no need to rush.

The author essentially reduces all human interactions into the giving and taking of energy, and, in the most evolved relationships, the mutual flow in which we effortlessly give and receive energy. Whether you view this as a metaphor or an empirical system, it expresses some very important concepts about how to achieve harmony in our relationships, deal compassionately with those who *steal* our energy, and create an environment in which we and those around us can evolve into more secure, giving, respectful, and loving individuals."},{"rating":"1","title":"wanted to like it...","review":"Yep, i bought it hoping for some self-discovery. I would have been more than satisfied with some simple take-home points to bring into everyday life. I wanted to like this book, and thought I would from the reviews on Amazon (generally fairly good, but they can be artificially inflated, as a NYT expose recently found). Not sure about what other people saw in this book. It was full of platitudes and other obvious and trite suggestions. Because I'm scientifically minded, I want to have a reason to believe the advice I'm being given, but the author's basic premises are unsubstantiated. Moreover, it was boring.

The content of this book is absolutely incredible... its makes things makes sense again and you really see the true reason why everyone is doing the things they do (and yes that includes yourself). Even though it helps you see the ugly truth about ourselves in some ways, it really introduces us to a very gentle, caring, forgiving, loving perspective of the world. This is why I love this book.

There are some horrible grammatical errors, which left me wondering if anyone proofread the text. Finally, there's just not anything new here. Not even a thoughtful synthesis of other ideas into a unifying theme. Most any Bhuddist or Taoist text would give one far more insight to the subject matter.

This was the first Emma Holly book I read, and I was glad to see a heroine that was independent and strong-willed throughout the book. Oftentimes the heroine starts out strong but ends up boo-hooing every page. Not so for Merry Vance and the book is the better for it.The writing and storyline were quite good and beyond that it has plenty of steamy sections, including a very tastefully done self-gratification scene that you can almost picture happening right in front of you! I like more than just the missionary-style, male/female relationships and this book has plenty of the frist and hints at the second - nice. I'm looking to order more Emma as we speak."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hot!","review":"I normally read the usual historical romances. But this one was recommended by a friend so I took her word and picked it up. I had no idea what I was getting into. The story was pretty good, a young woman is trying to avoid being forced into marriage by making herself a scandal. To do this, she poses nude for a famous stud of a painter. We get to see great character depth as our hero struggles with his past and present while our heroine tries to keep her secrets. The surrounding characters were also great, with just enough evil surrounding the whole plot so the goodness of the characters could shine through.But what I didn't expect was the sex scenes. Wow. Very graphic. Way past the heaving bosoms and throbbing shafts. While I don't think this is going to encourage me to move to this type of novel on a regular basis, for a holiday read, it was great. This is the prototype for the trashy novel and was excellent to read at the beach or tanning at poolside."},{"rating":"2","title":"Solid Strong Female Character - what a nice change....","review":"Merry does want to marry and wants some freedom that she has never had as a Duke's daughter.

Or whatever. I hate books with throbbing manhoods and molten cores in them and luckily this wasn't one of them. You have to appreciate a writer who doesn't talk down to her audience, who should be mature enough to handle the terms for acts they've very likely performed themselves a time or two.This was a nice book with believeable characterization, a good plot, good writing, and sex scenes that were actually sexy.

The plot is unbelievable and while there's sex, there is no chemistry.

But I was disappointed in Beyond Seduction. I thought the plot was kind of dragging along, held together only by love scenes and I hate a romance novel like that. I didn't find Merry or Nic appealing at all, as characters. Conversations that took place between them and all the book's other characters sounded fake or false. A romance novel has to have admirable characters and be held together by a good plot. This one was kind of all over the place, plot-wise and character-wise. Frankly I wonder if this was kind of rushed into print as a semi-sequel to Beyond Innocence, as Merry was a subcharacter in that novel? But in any case, the story did not appeal to me and it's a subpar effort from Emma Holly."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I bought this book on the strength of the reviews written here. Unfortunately, I was disappointed. I thought the characters were stiff and the plot did not capture my interest.

Truth be told, I haven't even finished the book. I put it down several weeks ago and haven't bothered to pick it back up again.

Craven reminded me of Lisa Kleypas' Dreaming of You, The Duke of Monmouth made me think of Suzanne Enoch's Reforming a Rake and Althorp reminded me of the estate where Princess Diana was buried. Despite all these flashbacks and needs to re-read other books least the plot was orginal and written in good taste."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hated it to End!","review":"I loved this story. Merry Vance was smart and independent and Nicolas Craven was very sexy and tender. It was interesting from the start, not a slow, tedious beginning until you get to the good stuff. It was a delight all the way through. The love scenes are generally passionate but not too erotic for this period (although it does get a little explicit in some places). I tried to read Menage but it was too much mindless sex for me. This book has heart, it has romance, it has good dialogue. It's a great read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beyond Seduction","review":"A young innoscent defies her family and her staid upbrinning to escape a marriage she doesn't want. Her escape turns into more than she expected when she poses nude for a famous painter with his body set on seduction. Our hero pushes the boundries of her body and her mind causing her to reevaluate her sexual limits as well as her sexual tastes. She learnes what she truly likes, not what she thinks she is supposed to like. Emma Holly gives us hot and steamy sex in a very realistic manner. All of her sex scenes are not only erotic, but also very believable and intriguing enough to try! I read this book based on its reviews, and I am very glad I did. I will be reading a lot more of Emma Holly from now on!"},{"rating":"2","title":"My new favorite romance author","review":"Everything about this novel was great, from the characters to the descriptive settings (I could see Venice!) to the intense romance and erotica - this is exactly the kind of romance novel I've been looking for, for decades.

I was a little stunned initially at the price (20# ball), but one has to remember -- this is an investment in your exercise equipment inventory, and therefore an investment in your health (provided you actually -use- it, of course!).The handles provide a way to get a nice solid grip on the ball, which is especially important with the heavier ball. (Who wants their workout to come to an abrupt halt after accidentally dropping a weighted ball on their foot?) I'm a female with a medium frame and hands, and the handles work very well for me.The only drawback I experienced with this product was that it smelled VERY strongly of rubber when it first arrived. I had to banish it to outdoors for a few weeks until the smell disappated. But the smell did subside, and the core ball now resides indoors along with the rest of my workout equipment.Recommended!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad bad product","review":"This ball has three major problems:1. Poor and cheap design: it is a regular medicine ball covered by a jacket with handles.2. The ball has an oddly-shaped space between the ball and handles which makes it difficult to grab and/or hold, even for a woman's hand, but especially difficult for a man. Also this poor design makes the ball too large in proportion to it's weight - difficult to work with, especially while using one hand.3.

It comes with all the hardware for virtually any unit you put up and the build seems very solid. In reality I would give this a 4.5 out of 5 due to the only issue being the plastic pieces that line the brackets. They just kept falling off before I could put it in place so I SuperGlued them on. They really should have designed that different but other than that this mount is hard to beat. As a plus the center is open so you can place it around an electrical outlet or a plug panel for your components which is what I did. Better than the ones in Wal-Mart for the same price!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Just grainy lip gloss","review":"This product didn't do anything for me, nothing more than average lip gloss, that is. The texture is grainy and coarse, I'm assuming that's from glitter, because it's very glittery. And it does give an warm burning feeling but it doesn't do any plumping whatsoever. The texture of the gloss will make you want to co Lnstantly rub your lips together, which may make them look fuller but that only lasts for a couple minutes. It also leaves a yucky residu on your lips after the gloss has worn off. It's like glue. The smell is alright, it's a cinnamon, spice type smell. Color is pretty but you may want to wear a sheer gloss over top bc it's not very smooth"},{"rating":"2","title":"Not bad at all !","review":"It's nice that someone designed a folding footrest to be able to carry in a purse, etc. My only criticism is that it sometimes collapses if you move it around too much.

'Golden Age of the Sith' had some streong points, like a decent plot and beautiful art. Alas, the art quality drops a bit here and the story goes into a nosedive. There's almost no plot, save for a big battle. Granted, it can be pretty visually complex and interesting, drawing back to an old style of combat, but overall its quite lacking.I've gotten out a fine-toothed comb, but cannot find any cohesive story, unfortunately.

She is likeable most of the time, but Taylor doesn't make her perfect, which is a real strength of the book.The plot is quite clever. Taylor shows some of her influences rather clearly (Possession by A.S. Byatt comes to mind), but never copies them, instead creating an original and enjoyable mystery.There are too many characters that don't get enough attention, and it took me some time to sort out exactly who everyone was, but this was a minor failing, as her main characters were very well fleshed out.If you enjoy mysteries with an intellectual bent, give it a try."},{"rating":"1","title":"Amazon let me down","review":"I really cannot write a review on this product as it was ordered along with the Hitachi 500 Camcorder on March 23rd.

Arriving on Earth he is in search of the dark soul of a warrior which has been hidden inside a little girl, but Gabriel doesn't count on a fight from a novice priest turned cop and the child's school teacher.

I'm not the kind of person who needs explosions and special effects to be entertained, but there really is not much going on. The plot isn't deep and it's stretched over an hour and a half.I wonder how that movie got three or four sequels. I heard the quality got worse every time...

A film about an Angel angry with God for favouring Humans over Angels, sounds great. But unfortunately, it fails to deliver. The movie places too much emphasis on Christianity, Church and Jesus.

Seems pretty week to me. How is one human soul going to help them in their great battle anyway? Is this war going to somehow change God's mind? Can these evil angels who are obviously acting against the the will of God, aka sinning really expecting to have things return back to the way they once were? What is the purpose of an angel, and even more important, What is the purpose and meaning of life for humans in this movie. What motive is there to be a good angel? There has to be some kind of reward. Why do we only get the perspective from the devil and evil angels? Where is the word of God during the movie, and what of his worshipers?

He once wrote a learned treatise on angels, so when a physiologically abnormal individual is found murdered and a copy of Dagget's study discovered on the crime scene, he's assigned to investigate. What he uncovers is a literal war of angels. These supernatural creatures, led by the vicious Gabriel, are a tormented, murderous lot, warped by God's rejection in favor of \\"talking monkeys\\" called the human race. The best interpretation of the fallen angel himself without being over the top Viggo's potrayal of the devil is seductive, magnetic, commanding and unique. A very unique and impressive movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of my favorites","review":"I have the trilogy on VHS of this and just today decided to upgrade and bought the individual DVDs of this series.The three movies are great entertainment (the first being my favorite - Viggo Mortensen as Lucifer is just totally creepy and to go from Lucifer to the King of Middle Earth is quite a feat). Christopher Walken is wonderful in his role as Garbiel. I personally was a fan of a book called \\"To Rein in Hell\\" a great Fantasy novel but is very similar to this movie in its content of how some angels are just unhappy with their situation in heaven. This movie and its sequels do capture the overall frustration of the angels and the helplessness of the humans in their wake. If you only see one of the three I do recommend at least seeing the first one to get the true flavor."},{"rating":"2","title":"he may learn to like us","review":"When is Walken less thn excellent?In this I expected little,but Walkens' character ,if that's the right word,makes this worth staying the way through.It's not good as the video he danced in(5),but I say try this ind call me when this unholy terror is settled."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rises above the genre","review":"Okayyy... So as we know, the movie stars Christopher Walken, who (given a serviceable script) can turn any B-film into something approaching high art. By having Gregory Widen (of \\"Highlander\\" fame) direct it, that possibility is removed instantly, but we're still left with a strangely addictive movie.It's got (as my co-worker put it) the Canadian Robert DeNiro--Elias Koteas, Viggo Mortenson (underused, but still great to see in action), and Eric Stoltz, all showing more than enough conviction to pull the film out of mediocrity.Never mind the low-budget; it's alternately campy and (don't laugh) thought-provoking, and of course, Chris Walken walks away with the film's best lines. It's worth owning just for his performance alone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Walken at his best!","review":"As Archangel Gabriel Walken infuses a sense of humanity and humor to an otherwise rather dark film. The plot is rather convoluted but does bring up some interesting ideas but it's Walken that makes this movie work. The other actors do a good job but get overshadowed by Walken's performance.Be prepared, though. The Prophecy is rather dark and downright brutal at times. It definitely shows a lot of negative aspects of humanity but there is hope at the end.If you want to see Walken at his best see this!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Walken rocks the Horror World","review":"I may be no saint, but this movie questioned even my faith. I am by no means an active outdoorsman, I am the kind who likes movies and good movies.Walken, off the red-hot Pulp Fiction, was signed as the lead character, Gabriel, and did one helluva job.
