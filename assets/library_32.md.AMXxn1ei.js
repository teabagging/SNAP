And this album is a prime example. There is so much great music on the album that you can listen to it over and over again. As with many of his albums, there are songs that he has redone from one album and put it on another. The Hold Up is a prime example, same song different quality. Funny, great beats, virtuoso musicianship, and amazing production values are a mainstay on all his albums and Wanted Dead or Alive is no different. It sounds just as good to me today as when I bought the vinyl in 1975. There are very few true musical geniuses out there, and this is a chance to own an album of one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fabulous hand sanitizer","review":"My family has used this product for a couple years now.

The bumper is flimsy and doesn't have enough tie straps to keep it standing upright on the crib. I had to sew on additional tie-straps for installation.

Unfortunately, the lack of tie-straps is very disappointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"dont waste your money","review":"the Rectractable lights out vent shade does NOT retract very well nor does it keep the light out. the shade leaves a gap on the sides that lets light in. It works like a pull down window shade and since we have a thing called gravity here on earth, DUH. A piece of cardboard and a strip of velcro would work much better. On our last travel trailer, I velcro'd an old political sign (cut to size using scissors) and that worked just great. The product has to be screwed onto your existing vent so you will be stuck with extra holes once you throw it out, and you will very soon after installing it.I also bought the: Camco 45651 RV Insulated Dual Vent Cover, and it works very well. no extra screw hole required. Problem with it is that when you have the vent open, the wind vibrates the cover partially off. hope this review helps."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Must for any RV!","review":"A great way to keep the hot sun from boiling the inside of your trailer or coach.

To compare, I went back to my previous favourite -- the performance with Bartoli, Kuebler and Quilico. Both in their own way are quite wonderful.Then, I had another look and this performance. Words fail me as much as this humourless production fails the opera. The sets are over-extravagant and bear little relation to what is happening -- other than to give lots of items for unnecessary business and to show off the revolving stage. Kasarova has a wonderful and controlled voice, but she really likes showing off her chest and she continually overacts. Lanza (any relation to Mario?) has just stepped out of a spaghetti western and mostly sings as though he was in a Broadway musical. Macias plays Figaro as though he is a mafia hood. Chauson and Ghiaurov sing well, but are badly directed.My very strong advice would be steer clear of this and get both of the ones mentioned at the top."},{"rating":"2","title":"What can you say???","review":"This is Big Black.

They don't work very smoothly and constantly click and clack when clamping down."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Shoddy Piece of Junk!","review":"I returned this item THREE TIMES, and never got one that worked without a snag. They would consistently jam up, and not work as they should. IDL's quality control leaves a lot to be desired, and these so called self-adjusting pliers are clear evidence of this! My suggestion to Amazon is to no longer carry them. Don't waste your time and effort with these. You are better off with the time-proven non automatic vise-grip pliers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your money, buy something else.","review":"This plier simply will not work for me as it requires too much fooling around in order to get it to grip as needed, it either locks too soon and won't grip or closes too far and won't lock.

I highly recommend it. Don't worry about hurting yourself when using this tool I have never had a problem using it. Anybody can learn how to use this thing in a few seconds given that a person has more than 2 brain cells to be able to figure out you should first squeeze it with your index finger when grabbing things.UPDATE May 2012: All moving parts are still working great after adding little bit of oil to various places. The size of bolts the jaws can grab is amazing for such a compact tool. What a nice invention."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth the buy","review":"These pliers took some getting used to, but once you know how they work they are fantastic. They grip very well on the light clamping pressure setting; but if you turn the grip strength all the way up, then its almost scary trying to un-clamp them because of all pressure being released. These pliers are supper fast to grip anything that you want to which saves a lot of time. The first time i used them on the job, the spring mechanism that put tension on the selection switch that turned the locking pliers into non-locking pliers came loose. When i got home i tweaked the spring arm so that it sits better on the switch and now it works fine. These pliers were so good that it did not really bother me that the spring came loose. I would definitely recommend these and am planning on picking up the two other versions of this plier in the future."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Hardcore Comp.","review":"My guess is that Glenn Danzig didn't grant them permission to use his songs on the compilation.

The volume is titled \\"Science and Religion: Are They Compatible?\\" but a more honest title would be something like \\"Scientists' Views of Religion: How to Leave it Behind\\". Out of the 39 essays, I counted barely a handful that defended religious views. There is a place for such a collection, but editors should have been more honest about their bias. That said, the essays did provide insight into the 'science overcomes religion' perspective.

Overall this just looks a little cheap in my car as I have no silver paint in my interior, I guess it would be okay if your cars has silver in the interior.

Like almost all anthologies, some of the stories are stronger than others; personally, I wasn't much taken with \\"Girls Will Be Girls\\", by Patricia Shaw-Mathews, but even that story was entertaining and well-written; I just didn't feel that it treated the Comhi-Letzii with the respect they were due. It was an enjoyable piece of fluff, but a piece of fluff nonetheless, and seemed to me out of place. But any anthology which can claim that the worst story in it is well-written but possibly a bit out of character for the subject is doing pretty well.Of course, if you've read Darkover fiction before and didn't care for the stories of Free Amazons, you may want to give this one a pass, but I shouldn't need to tell you that; the title should be all the hint you need."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brings back memories...","review":"I found my old copy of this book at my parents house recently.

How many of these incidents can be fitted into an hour? I only watched Disk 1, I gave up. Like other reviews, there are lots of far better wartime stories, try Foyle's War if you need a suggestion. The Cazalets is a melodrama, maybe a little more disjointed and sordid due to hastily moving storyline arranged so every character can have a eye-popping crisis in each episode. Bad script, poor story development, to be avoided not because it's too adult but because it's too childish and superficial."},{"rating":"2","title":"cazalets","review":"This series was played out very well, it was true to life in a time when things were not well with the world.

Unrelenting misery is not my idea of a good time!Other reviewers have commented on the amount of sex - what I saw was tastefully done and generally hinted at the act more than showed it however, I stopped watching when Edward tried seducing his daughter whilst drunk so I cannot say how the series progresses from there."},{"rating":"1","title":"If you are looking for clean family viewing, this is not it!!!","review":"This movie was filthy within the first 5 minutes.

It was way over the top and the effects were rediculously amateurish. I know it was a low budget film, but come on. And why would the shotgun for sale in a pawn shop where the crime is sooooooo over the top out of control be fully loaded with shotgun shells. And where did the hobo replenish his ammo. The direction was poor and the writing was terrible. The acting was pretty good considering what the actors had to work with. Please do not waste your money on this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Low budget junk","review":"Rutger Hauer must be desperate because this movie was very low budget and was only about blood and guts. Don't rent or buy it and especially don't let kids watch it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rotten To The Core","review":"In a word...pure unadulterated trash. It's not a movie fit for human consumption. Whoever is responsible for this movie coming into being should be evaluated by professionals.Why Rutger Hauer would lower himself to such filth is sad to see. I hope he recovers.This movie has absolutely no redeeming qualities--none. There is no scene, or frame or dialogue in this putrid story that's worth mentioning.Please, do not entertain any thoughts of even contemplating the watching of this so-called movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sorriest Excuse for a \\"Movie\\"...","review":"This was the biggest, sorriest excuse for a movie I've ever seen. I would have rated it as less than one star but I couldn't go any lower. If this is what the world calls art, we're all going down the dark path to hell. I've seen Rutger do some pretty rough movies before; but I can't believe he would lend himself to this. This was supposed to be funny? There wasn't a single funny thing about this movie. In fact, there wasn't even one redeeming thing about this movie at all. It was just plain sic!"},{"rating":"1","title":"zero stars","review":"I haven't seen a movie this bad, low budget or cheezy since Laser Blaster around 1978. It makes me ill that the Canadian government gave a tax break for this production. Given Canadian involvement, I am not surprised by how trashy it is. It seems the Canadian film community, CBC and Government employees promoting the arts have all lost their marbles in the past few decades. Ever since paying 2.5 million for the Voice of Fire, all they can produce, or support is utter garbage - which they call art. Disgusting!! I am beginning to think the art community think something is art only if it offends. Well I am offended. Time to start promoting some values. I am only glad my kids didn't see it - you sick parasites of humanity."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible","review":"I watched this based on lots of 4 star reviews and having Rutgar Hauer, but it was so bad I had turn it off. My husband agreed. Don't waste your time with this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Negative Stars If Possible","review":"Poor taste, poor script, poor budget. The only good thing I can say about the film is that Rutger Hauer can be in the worst movie I have ever seen and still put in a good performance. This movie was painful to watch. The characters are just characters that are around merely to be killed off. The script and direction is gratuitously over the top, but instead of the movie being campy funny it is campy cringe. This rates up there with Salo and Cannibal Holocaust, but at least those movies had a plot. It WAS the worst movie I have ever seen."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Waste Your Time!","review":"This movie was absolutely repulsive, and the acting was terrible...even for being a B grade film. I know it was meant to look like a 70s flick or something, but it was terrible even for that. This movie could have been so much cooler than it was, even for a B grade movie. The gore was way overdone, and it was sadistic & morbid. At one point, the baddies in this movie even torch a school bus full of kids. WTF!? That's pretty messed up. Watch this if you really want to, but if you want my honest advice...steer clear! What was Rutger thinking? He's much better than this."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Hobo, A Hooker and Hoodlums","review":"I had been wanting to watch this since it came out and I finally got the chance, and I wasn't disappointed.The Hobo is just looking for a nice place to live and maybe start his own business. He hops of the train in the most crime ridden city around. He soon finds himself in trouble and befriends a prostitute that he wants to help have a better life. They soon find themselves trapped in a war with street thugs, dirty cops and every other lowlife possible. The Hobo decides it time to clean up the streets \\"One Shell at a time\\".This does have a grindhouse feel but it reminds me more of a Troma movie. The crime filled city, over the top violence, crazy thugs and colorful scenery look like a page out of the Toxic Avenger and that's ok. It works great for this movie. If you are a fan of trashy cinema, then you owe it to yourself to check this one out."},{"rating":"1","title":"1 star for the Technicolor","review":"Horrible plot, it's all so cheap. With the exception of the star in the movie, I've seen porn with better actors. I gave it one star for the Technicolor which impressed me.

These people need to have their mouths washed out. Foul languageis really bad. Worst i have ever seen in my life. I DO NOT RECOMMEND IT!!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Hobo on a Mission","review":"This movie as some have pointed out, is indeed garbage. The story is dumb and most of the actors can't act. I was really surprised that Rutger took on this part. Boy, this move made him look desperate for any acting job. Of course, he will usually give a good performance in his films. Killing children on that bus was so wrong. The first time I saw this scene about to happen, I refused to watch it, turned my head, and fast forwarded it. The parents of these children had to be desperate for money to allow them to play this scene.Talk about overkill, the death scene with the policeman was over the top. and totally unnecessary. The director apparently wanted some shock value with that scene. A lot of gore for sure and torture plagued this film. For me, this is not my type of film, but I can read from some of the post, this movie was an enjoyment for some."},{"rating":"1","title":"Movie for Sickos","review":"Probably the single worst and most disturbing movie I ever saw. The gratuitous violence was WAY OVER THE TOP! The scene on board the school bus was disgusting. You need professional help if you enjoyed this piece of garbage.Also. after the Newtown slaughter in Connecticut,anybody who finds any redeeming value in this disgusting trash needs to reconsider what it means to be a loving member of the human race."},{"rating":"1","title":"Garbage","review":"This film is poorly written, directed, and especially acted (excepting Rutger Hauer).

Hobo With a Shotgun takes the cake. It's trying to be a grind-house splatter film, and I fully expected to see something shockingly violent, but what I didn't expect was to see something so humorless in its approach. There's really nothing here but sick degradation. It's not the violence as much as the mean-spirited tone. Not even Rutger Hauer's crazed hobo could save this film from its vile attitude about life. This is a film in which the heroes are just as sick and twisted as the villains. What a disgusting worldview this film presents! That's really what makes Hobo With a Shotgun so unpleasant."},{"rating":"1","title":"So Bad","review":"It's so bad I had to watch to end to see if it stayed that way. My wife kept looking at me and wondering why I was still watching it.So it will prob become a classic."},{"rating":"1","title":"Carnage and gore in search of a plot","review":"I was pretty disappointed with what I thought was going to be a fun episode of Robert Rodriguez or Quinton Tarantino style retro-flick. I think that was the idea as this movie was hinted at in one of the \\"Grindhouse\\" trailers. While it's nice to see Rutger Hauer again especially with the in-your-face title in hand, the film never gets past the raw carnage and bloody gore of the premise. Hauer is a railcar hopping hobo who stumbles upon a nasty town that for some reason nobody leaves. The population stays in spite of the fact that the police and politicians are controlled by the evil Drake and his 2 equally evil sons. They stay in spite of the fact that it's acceptable to board a school bus and kill all the kiddies with a flame thrower...and of course, for no reason. I found the movie pretty stupid without much to recommend."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"I used to be like you...\\"","review":"Really liked this movie. Yes it's violent and over the top, but hey, this is grindhouse. The characters are wonderful and almost every one is iconic in their own right. The movie makers created a gritty world with strange and twisted people mostly committing vile acts. Kind of like if Troma had made Robocop. This was less of an homage to grindhouse movies of the 70's and 80's and more like an actual grindhouse movie. The film had bright bleeding colors and harsh contrast that helped to give this film a very uniquely gritty look. There were lots of scenes of murder, mutilation and torture, but there were also scenes in this movie that elevate it to something more than a \\"B\\" horror movie. The hobos talk to the newborns, a certain death scene, the Plague, and even the wickedness of the main bad guy. This was definitely a grindhouse flick and more. Looking forward to seeing more from this director and crew."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Epic and Violent Grindhouse Film!!!","review":"I've been wanting to see this movie for a long time, and I finally watched it with some friends, and all I have to say is...wow! This movie was so incredibly and insanely violent. People lose their heads, get ripped open with a baseball bat covered in razor blades, and get shot to death by an ass-kicking hobo. This movie based on the trailer from Grindhouse has more action than Machete. If you are easily offended by children being burned alive or being watched by a pedophile Santa Claus, you should stay away. This was a fun movie to watch, and all the gore scenes are hilarious and epic.Rutger Hauer stars as a Hobo who comes to a new town, overrun with corruption. He befriends a hooker named Abby. While a Pawn shop is getting robbed, the Hobo can't take it anymore and decides to shoot the robbers down with a shotgun. He becomes a vigilante and goes around shooting anybody involved with crime. Never ever cross a HOBO WITH A SHOTGUN!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"More blood than the Red Cross","review":"I never knew what to expect as I will try about anything. This movie is gory and terribly funny at the same time. It is beyond ridiculous and can only imagine those who gave it good ratings were pre-teens. Save your time and pick anything else which is surely going to be better than this bloodfest."},{"rating":"1","title":"5 stars for Rutger Hauer, 2 for the shotgun, minus 5 for herr director","review":"This film put me in a bind. I wanted to stop watching this worthless animalistic sick-minded crap, but I didn't want to miss Rutger Hauer's insightful, thoughtful & poignant, Dirty Harry-esque performance. He is as good in this as Mickey Rourke was in 'The Wrestler' or 'Sin City'. Molly Dunsworth was also quite good as Abby, the prostitute he protects, and who dreams of a better life. Jason Eisener however, is a self-important, fat, untalented Canadian who didn't deserve a picture deal for his amateurish movie trailer. But I'm happy that Hauer was able to get some recognition for his ability to be creative within this putrefied dreck. I'd like to have read Ebert's review, but he boycotts gore (Hostel for example) so that's an impossibility. In the future I hope Eisener can only attract actors to his projects that I don't like. Ben Affect would be great! Thanks."},{"rating":"2","title":"A little off the wall but I got a kick out of it","review":"This is most assuredly a homage to the old Grind House 70s movies.

There is a sort of 80s, bleak world feel to this movie. Sort of Robocop with more gore and without the humor."},{"rating":"2","title":"this was great","review":"This was a great grindhouse type vigilante flick. Filled with weird comments that did not add to the plot, it was hilarious and filled with cheesy gore. Although the plot was completely different, the cheese factor was similar to the evil dead. If you like b movies and low budget horror flicks this will be a classic. I will try not to spoil it, but the film is about a homeless man who eventually cracks, and becomes a vigilante in a chaotic town; filled with innocent people and a bunch of crazies, led by a evil family. Highly recommend it is worth watching if you like offbeat lowbudget movies."},{"rating":"2","title":"Over the top!","review":"Is the only way to describe the violence, blood and gore in this movie.

I would not really call the film cheesy for presenting a story devoted to excessive violence and gore. Great care was taken to keep the dialogue un-predictable and the action fresh. The makers of this film truly had a love for all of the great 1980's thrillers and action movies that set off the VHS boom. The soundtrack really sent me back. The story is jam-packed with just about every one-liner you can imagine. The killing/mutilation scenes (of which there are many) show so much blood and carnage even I was surprised.One should definately watch this movie with a sense of humour. This film takes all of the schlock of great action movies, multiplies it by 10, and presents it in the story with excellent timing. For lovers of realism, forget this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"You'll either love it or hate it.","review":"I personally loved it.

First off, they shot the entire film in TECHNICOLOR. When that came across the screen I was stoked. I love vintage films, so that put me in a good place visually. There is graffiti throughout the film, and the cinematography was pretty good. There is a good storyline to this film also. The acting wasn't over the top at all. Usally in these films, they are a bit shabby. Do not let your kids watch this, there is blood, guns and weapons everywhere. Enjoy, and tell a friend to tell a friend about this movie. Please buy and do not bootleg. Support this artists vision. PEACE!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Brutal, and mean","review":"Just look at the title, a hobo with a shotgun, brings justice to a small town. Sure we can have some fun with this. I have nothing against violence, especially if it is un-leashed against a bunch of murderous thugs. Fight violence with violence, that is fine, can we please make it entertaining!

So will you if you buy this junk."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good player at a decent price","review":"I stumbled across this little gem while searching for an MP3 player with an FM tuner. It's priced great, has a huge storage capacity and I've found it's very durable. The only real complaint is that you can't create custom playlists, which is a pain when I load audiobooks onto the player. But it does have a good shuffle function, there's a customizable equalizer, and the FM tuner pulls in a good signal. I've had nothing but a good experience with the player, which is more than I can say for my $330 MYFI paperweight, but that's another review."},{"rating":"1","title":"more notes on the rave mp","review":"I agree with what everyone has had to say about this device. It's cheap, and you get what you pay for. My biggest complaint was the complete un-randomness of the shuffle feature. It played the same five songs all the time, in the same order, while ignoring hundreds of others.and of course, I eventually got the sad face/ bug icon, and the player was dead.but a few weeks later I tried plugging it into the USB in my computer, and it came back to life, and has been working fine ever since. Anyone else have this experience?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Peace of Junk. Don't buy it.","review":"I would give it zero stars if Amazon system offered it. This item is really a piece of junk and doesn't worth the money. It works when it wants. Freezes several times and not easy to use. It needs to reindex the music files after any change the user makes which takes several seconds and may last to minutes if you have a lot of files. Do not be fooled by the low price as you are paying it for a product that will annoy you everyday."},{"rating":"1","title":"Resist the urge, don't buy it.","review":"I bought this for $80, not expecting much - just something that would play music. There were lots and lots of bugs in the firmware - I won't even go into them here. Anyway, I just wanted something that would play music, but after only a month of having this thing all I get is a frowny face (the player is dead), and I was quite gentle on my player (I didn't do anything that might shock the hard drive). Although Rave seems like a legitimate company from the looks of their web site, they sent a shoddy and underdeveloped product to the market and you should not spend your hard-earned cash on it. Save up and wait, or invest a bit more into a better product - that's my advice."},{"rating":"1","title":"WORST thing on the market!!!!!!!!!AWFUL!!!!!!!!!","review":"We bought this product in April 8, 05 for my brother. It was cheap, had a lot of memory, why not. Well in less than a month, the little sad face with a bug appeared on the screen. Called into customer support, who gave NO support, said to fax in a copy of the confirmation order, then send the product back to get it replaced. First of all, i don't have a fax machine in my house, and i have to spend money to ship it back in again. RIDICULOUS! Either that, or go to costco and exchange it, and where i live there is no costco. The worst of all, i can't even return the junk.All this process is waste of money, time consuming, and inconvenient. If you can spend 120 on this thing, you wont get your money's worth. It'll die on you in less than a month, then you have to deal with the poor customer support. The funny thing is they consider their support \\"award winning customer service professionals\\".Take my advice.

I like the storage it has and the playback sounded good. The first problem I noticed was when disconnecting it from my computer, you need to unplug the MP3 player from the USB cord first. If you unplug the USB connector from your computer first and then unplug the player, it locks up. I've only used the player for ~ 20 hours and the battery life only lasts 2 hours now. That's just not going to work! As others have stated it does not charge the battery when connected to the USB port so if I'm loading songs onto it, I'll get less than 2 hours of play time.

It took years for both to be diagnosed. There were frequent bouts with alcoholism, drugs, arrests and nasty behavior. I hate to say it, but I moved thousands of miles away while my parents attempted to come to their aid continuously. In a review at this site the writer wonders how the father (Roy) could let it happen when he had an important job. You'd be surprised how numb you can get to aberrant behavior.Two years ago, via genealogical research, I discovered a maternal great aunt and great uncle institutionalized with paranoid schizophrenia. My mother never knew. In the early 1900's the treatment included religious instruction. Ha!If you're interested in the real thing, this is the book for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just not the right book for me","review":"The synopsis of this case makes it sound extremely interesting and unique. Two rich young sons both suffering from major mental illnesses? Especially in one tight nit, religious and wealthy family. It seems most people that interacted with them over the years knew something was askew but there was nothing anyone else could really do. The author tends to really go out of his way to embarrass the mother and victim in this tragedy. Does an overbearing nutrition loving mother drive her boys to insanity in all cases or just this one. This book really had a \\"blame the victim\\" mentality going on. Very sad story but I did not feel it was written to shun Reaganomics or make too many statements about social services. It was just a slow and repetitive book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hit closer to home than any book that I have ever read","review":"My husband has been diagnosed with a type of schizoprenia, known as shizo-affective disored.

The \\"episodes\\" that occured in the book have been simialur to the ones that have occured with my husband. The book was a very knowladgable book and gave me some insight as far as how schizoprnia can be treated inappopratally, and how if you wait too long it will be too late. For my husband has been in and out of the local state mental insitae more than once. I just belive that it is finding the right medication to go along witht the illnees, that makes a differance.

Only rarely do I toss out the book after reading. In this case I did. I was vexed throughout by the author's insistent and wholly unnecessary political message. Every chapter has a dig or two or three at Ronald Reagan. OK, we get it. The author absolutely HATES Reagan. But letting this bizarre compulsion get in the way of telling what could have been a riveting true-crime story is maybe slightly neurotic and certainly bad story-telling. It is obvious that the author chose this particular crime because the victim's husband happened to be the personal attorney for -- you know who -- the anti-Christ himself -- Ronald Reagan.So rather than earning a place on my bookshelf beside the likes of Jack Olsen, Ann Rule, Jim Schutze, Jerry Bledsoe and other notables, this book went into the trash.

The author (and I!) were looking at a family that had suffered a private hell and I knew the author and I had no business being the Peeping Toms we were. The author is especially guilty for using the Miller tragedy for his own political agenda. No, I know that Ronald Reagan is not at fault for the horrible consequences this family has suffered due to schizophrenia. I have actually asked social services to help me protect my daughter from her alcoholic father when I feared I was ill, and the social worker defended him by telling me, \\"But he has his civil rights!\\" So Mr. McDougal is wasting everyone's time by blaming all tragedies on Ronald Reagan.

My favorite overall favorite musical beat is \\"Pure Shores\\". \\"Pure Shores\\" is a unique melody about being close to a love interest. \\"All Hits\\" by All Saints is great to get for the many who enjoy pop music from the 1990s and the early millennium (2000s)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Are You Kidding?","review":"They had two albums, and they have a greatest hits album?

(And adding insult to injury, to do them with arrangement virtually identical to the originals??) I don't get it.Perhaps next time Donny will cover some classic Motown songs with cutting edge arrangements (songs he performed extraordinarily well during the concert segments of the 70's \\"Donny & Marie\\" Show), Stevie Wonder or other songs.

His version of \\"I Can't Go For That\\" rivals that of the original Hall & Oates take. For my fellow cynics, give the dude a break. I know Donny's pretty much perceived as a Pat Boone with stronger vocal abilities, but this CD will change all that. There's nothing wrong with a great singer paying tribute to some of his personal faves, much like Barry Manilow did with \\"Summer Of '78\\". However, the vocal performance and arrangements on this CD are miles ahead of Manilow's recent effort. If you're into Gino Vannelli, Richard Marx, George Michael, and Daryl Hall & John Oates with a nice basting of classic 70's soul - then, by all means, add this to your collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent album of '70s and '80s remakes from Donny!","review":"I liked this album from Donny Osmond a few years ago! He sounded good on the '70s and '80s remakes. I liked his take of Could It Be I'm Falling In Love, I Can't Go For That, the fabulous After the Love Is Gone (Donny did an EWF song, my jam from '79 and actually pulled it off on that one!!!!) Another surprise is his take of Air Supply's All Out Of Love--which gives the original some stiff competition! So very good on it!But I have to knock him for doing Puppy Love again. When he was young, okay, but at 45 years old singing it again? It doesn't fit with him in today's musical times. He's far better with the remakes here than that cheesy Osmonds song. This album shows that Donny gets better with time as a singer and performer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great show","review":"I loved this show when on TV, the first I remember with the ladies as the main characters, and they played so well of each other, to see them together again was great, the years that had passed were explained so well, almost as if in real life things hadn't changed for them. The friction was still there, as was the humour; and the little details were not forgotten, like Lacey's dislike of carrying a gun, and Cagney's wanting to help out financially, only now in an even better position to do so, and Lacey still insisting on being an independant woman.

It's never been released domestically on CD, and probably won't, but I think it should. I'm curious at least.

At 5'10\\", 170lbs, my hands are about medium and the finger padding extends a few centimeters past my middle knuckles. The padding is dense and not intended for boxing on a heavy bag.

However, I do most of my work on the heavy bag and there isn't really a lot of padding in these grappling gloves. By the end of the workout I am definitely feeling it in my hands. My only other complaint would be the size. I got the L/XL and I still end up with a lot of pain in between my fingers.

If you spend about $30 more you can get a quality pair of gloves from fairtex or another brand that will fit better, last longer, and have better padding. These gloves are crap. You might think that you are getting a good deal by buying online and that they might work for you because you are not a pro fighter and don't need pro gear but these will not last and they are junk. Spend the extra money and get a good piece of gear. I made the mistake on these and the everlast sparring gloves, everlast thai pads and they are all garbage compared to say Fairtex or Hayabusa. Just spend the money and get a piece of gear that will last years and not months or weeks. I made the mistake in the past thinking I could use sub par gear to train in.

When they arrived and I opened the box, I couldn't believe how strong the asphalt smell was. I used them that night at the dojo, thinking the smell would wear off, but had to take them off after a few minutes, as I was getting a headache. I've left them in my garage for 2 weeks and they still smell. I've tried calling Everlast but get into a phone loop. I am now going to write to them, as I can not ever use these gloves. What a shame, they seem good other than a chemical they must have used to process them.

While the disk that screws onto the polisher is good and strong, and the velcro holds well, the pads have very little wool and it stops short of the edges, leaving the stitching showing around the edge. I did just what he was warning about...I gouged the surface of my boat by tipping the pad slightly. Once that happens you can't buff it out. It's almost impossible to polish in a recess or where the surface changes to a concave shape without getting that edge in there, and then, gouge!I would send them back except for the price, it's not worth the effort. But I'm looking for something better now.**Added later:I did send these back and got a refund from Amazon (way to go!)I recommend buying the [Makita 192629-7 7-Inch Hook and Loop Pad for 9227C Sander/Polisher] which is sold on Amazon.

I was not a big fan of Victor's Carnagie Hall concert CD. However, this one was done correctly. Victor starts off shaky but in then end show how great his talent is. The songs that make this CD worth purchaing are Tengo Ganas, Nunca Habia Llorado Asi (with Don Omar), He Tratado, Hay Que Poner El Alma, and Puerto Rico (with Gilberto Santa Rosa, and Eddie Palmieri). This concert was way better then his Carnagie Hall concert, recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"El Sonero De La Juventud","review":"Victor's soneos are great as always.

The author spends entirely too much time describing EVERY LITTLE DETAIL, and that includes the unimportant characters about to be killed. Meanwhile, the main character is perfect. Absolutely perfect in every possible way. The perfect warrior, sorceress, leader, rebel, and mother. Not to mention the fact that she's exceedingly beautiful. I can't remember another character who annoyed me so much just by being her wonderful, arrogant self. The only reason I even gave this book two stars instead of one is because at the end, you finally get to see what part the sorceress Nyadnar has in all of this. That part was creative, but the rest was just plain dull. Try to avoid this title unless you feel compelled to read every single Forgotten Realms title."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just boring","review":"This is just a boring book, with no decent plot.

It stuck beautifully and was waterproof without leaving a residue. This is more like a duct tape with a plastic backing. I wrapped it around some tubing and used it outside on a nice sunny day. It unpeeled from itself in a couple hours. It does not meet my expectations and was not a good value."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as good as other gaffer tape","review":"Unlike other reviewers here, I found that this tape DOES leave a residue. I used it to hold cables firmly to a printer in my office. Removing the tape 2 weeks later, there is a sticky substance on the surface where the tape was attached. This tape is less like \\"cloth\\" than other gaffer tape I have purchased, it's more like a vinyl, and I wouldn't recommend it if you are concerned about being able to remove it later without residue. Maybe they changed suppliers since the other reviews were written."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ineffective gaff tape","review":"This is not professional-quality gaff tape.

It's not wide enough, it doesn't have good grip, and it is always coming loose. We end up using 2-3 times more tape than we should, so the money we've saved is offset by overuse and poor quality tape.Go with the wider stuff if you can, and pick a different brand."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not real gaffers tape","review":"I've worked as a photographer for a while, this is not real gaffers tape.

But it seems more like electric tape not the cloth like gaffers tape. Gaffers tape is smooth and wen you don't you scissors to cut it looks like you cut it with scissors. This items is not good. Maybe for an electrician or a plumber. It's being shipped back. No wonder why it was so cheap."},{"rating":"1","title":"The WORST Book of it's kind....ever!","review":"If I could give this book zero stars, I would. While it is generally readable, the 'evidence' provided is sketchy and unsupported at best, the theories are ludicrous, and the author's ignorance of basic science positively astounds me! While it does deserve mention that it was written in 1971, and thus should not be held to today's scientific standards, it still shows little to no knowledge of even basic science known in the 1960's. The author seems to have done virtually no real research, presenting fictional accounts and incorrect information regarding even the most well-known subjects. Overall, I would highly recommend that you not waste your time on this book, as it would only serve to confuse and confound anyone interested in this subject."},{"rating":"2","title":"Top rate Live Garcia","review":"I put in this review, because after browsing around the Garcia selections I was very surprised that this album is not one of the top selling live albums and is not reviewed as highy as it deserves. I've had it since it was originally released and keep going back to it in spite of aquiring a number of discs from the Pure Jerry series.If you enjoy listening to Garcia play guitar, this album is an excellent selection. Live at Keystone Vol's 1 and 2 are my alltime favorites for listening to soulful, emotional guitar. But if you need an alternative, this album is the best of the Garcia choices. Jerry is at the top of his form both vocally and on the guitar. The band is very tight (for a Garcia band) and in good form. Yes, a few of the tracks are played at a very slow pace, but this adds to the laid back feel that Garcia fans have come to enjoy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't You Let This Deal Go Down!!!","review":"I love the JGB and I am genuinely excited about upcoming releases, but this recording didn't impress me. I think the problem was the band line-up. I know the cast of characters changed over the years, but this is a weak ensemble compared to Keystone, Legions of Mary, and the 1991 self-entitled masterpiece. The bottom line for me was that I've heard better versions of these songs performed by different personnel. I hope to hear Legions of Mary material with Martin Fierro on horns as well as Merl Saunders. That's top shelf JGB. By the way, I returned the cd."},{"rating":"1","title":"dreadful grate","review":"SLOOOOOOOOOWWWWW. The songs go from slow to slower. Donna can't sing live, never really could, no matter what the \\"music fan\\" below says. Granted it was ths sound system (supposedly). But was she really that much better in the studio. Keith was a great addition to the Dead and Garcia Bands sound (until the last year, when he seemed asleep at the wheel most of the time). This is hardly the best to be found, of any of the parties involved. Save 5 stars for when they are deserved. They become meaningless when thrown around too often."},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic Garcia","review":"Release of Jerry Garcia\`s \\"extra-curricular\\" work is long overdue. This CD contains some of the finest melodic performances of his career. The combination of Jerry\`s frail, sensitive voice along with his soothing,enticing guitar notes makes one long for days past when one could purchase a ticket for a Garcia Band concert for $5 and hang out on a pier in Asbury Park with a few peace loving Dead heads from Toronto, San Antonio, Jersey City, and who knows where else...enjoy some good food and a whole lot of good music.To the new breed of Dead fans...You are in for an incredible musical treat...\\"You shouda been there!\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent sound and Performance","review":"Some very nice moments with the Garcia Band. It's nice to get a high quality Garcia Band disc, complete show too, to complement the more frequently released Dick's Picks series.

I've never been a huge fan of Donna Godchaux, but most of the vocal harmonies here are quite nice and, because of the vintage, Jerry's voice is much stronger than on any of the officially released JGB albums. The rendition of Jimmy Cliff's \\"Sitting In Limbo\\" is absolutely stunning."},{"rating":"2","title":"The solution to life foy any person who wants to find it","review":"Romans, of course, is the most important book of the bible. It tells what the solution to life consists of and how a person can solve it. First, it is an act of God who wants any person to find and enjoy Him forever. Then, it is tha acceptance of that act by the person who wants to get involved with God.Now, the book is elusively deceptive. It builds on simple sentences, but that is the whole thing: a simple statement can have very deep consequences and you are going to find that in a great number of instances.It has a lot of footnotes and then you may want to use them in your spare time to investigate the matter further. And that exercise might lead you in all kinds of directions!So, there is this first impression and then you are led to heavy thinking. After a while you like the book a lot."},{"rating":"1","title":"GREAT album. suffers as an MP3","review":"First, I love this record! I used to have this on vinyl back in the day. Great, scrappy, early record from these guys. It is out of print, to my knowledge, so I was excited to find it offered as a download. I thought: \\"I will HAVE it! and how bad can it sound, what with modern technology and all?\\"...The sound is VERY tinny and really thin. Somehow, both hollow AND shrill, with NO guts (which defined this band!) I am NOT an audiophile, per se.. Though I can usually tell a difference between waves and mp3s. This sound quality just breaks my heart and I cannot listen to it. So my $ was wasted, essentially. I HAVE the MATERIAL, but it is about the LISTENING! I should mention I listen to this sort of music on my stereo. Through big speakers. Ideally, LOUD.

It is not really a police procedural as the police play a small role. Nor is it really a mystery as we know quite early on who has commited the crine . Some people might find the story disturbing as it deals with crimes against children. The author is a very good writer and there is an atmosphere of menace through the book. The story jumps back and forth between the phsycopaths who have kidnapped a child and the distraught parents.Frankly I thought the parents considering there child has been stolen seemed to decend into self pity and I found the criminals to be more interesting.Anyway the book was quite good and I would reccomend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Compelling Story","review":"It's true you can read the trilogy in any order. I strongly recommend that you keep all three books close until you are finished because I found it fun to double back to check up on details that I might have overlooked on the first read.

How TBTYED did not become a blockbuster hit is a complete mystery. Originally released in 1970, the only explanation is that disc jockeys were consumed by the last recording of The Beatles and Supremes to pay much attention (even on the AC chart it only got to 19).Finally, the album covers finally portrays Barbra as the beautiful woman that she is.I have three final words for you: GET THIS ALBUM!"},{"rating":"1","title":"No track titles... no track samples","review":"How can anyone decide what to buy if ... a) there are no track titles, and b) no track samples?Why do some of your products have track titles & samples and other don't?

The guitar is a trebly mess, the bass is similar to that of jesus lizard (duh), and the drums are very high energy, and give the music direction. my personal favorite on this album is 'trouser minnow\\". the vocals and guitar are amazing in this song, full of desperation and sexual frustration.buy it"},{"rating":"2","title":"Remember what it used to be like","review":"Still shocking after all these years: And not so much for the grease monkey with a degree bitterness to the lyrics (my favorite, if you must know, being Steve Albini's gender-bent rant in \\"Trouser Minnow,\\" when he plays a sorority girl gone way too desperate and promiscuous). No, it's the shriek of the guitar--and I'd use the term \\"metallic\\" if said term wasn't so freighted with everything Albini pretty much disliked -- that still blows us away. This is my favorite Albini project, the Ur-\\"noise as beauty\\" landmark that sandblasted everything else. Abrasive and gorgeous."},{"rating":"2","title":"Albini's best work to date! (after all these years)","review":"If you dont have this album...get it!If you were recommend to check out Albini get it!This album is sonic,noisy,articulate,artsy,raw.Loud and mid-ranged as the man is famous for this is his masterpiece in my opinon but Albini fans will always differ.Real unapologetic rock...Not for the timid or brain dead,looking for something to tap a foot to."},{"rating":"1","title":"raped","review":"Beware, if you get this you probably have a different world view. If you don't get it by now, it may be too late. If you're in the latter, try Jimi Hendrix and mix it in with Biber, the Baroque composer. Then play this one and you may become aware of another sonic-life dimension. And you'll revel in it, unable to control yourself from feeling an instant ahead of reality, begifted with a sort of wisdom. At times you may find yourself craving to join the circling of some primitive-ultra-futuristic ritual fire where your world views shatter to an end."},{"rating":"2","title":"Get a \\"Handel\\" on Christmas","review":"If you like Handel's Messiah but get bored with the solo's then this is the CD for you. Handel's Messiah has been around for many years, with different versions. I like this CD because the collection of the most famous and beloved chorus' are found here without having to hear all the solo's which are usually included on the other CD's that I have found. The chorus' are the best known and those that I look forward to hearing at Christmas. The quality of the rrecording is excellent and the Mormon Tabernacle Choir does a great job at what they do best."},{"rating":"2","title":"HANDEL: THE GREAT MESSIAH CHORUSES","review":"THIS CD IS INSPIRATIONAL!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

They've charged me for that though!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"If you like taking a hot shower FORGET ABOUT IT","review":"Does not mention anywhwere in the add about this item being non refundable. I bought it because whenever someone would flush the toilet the person in the shower would get scolded. After I installed it I turned the water on to take a shower and it cut the water supply off when I turned the hot water on. I called the company Dynamic Living and they refused to give a refund because I installed the hydro guard and told me to sell it on Ebay. How is anyone suppost to test a product without using it? Do not buy this product If you like to take hot showers. But if you like cold to luke warm showers then you will be happy. The way I see it this company took my $53.40. Don't buy from this company!!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very nice!","review":"Just got these in red and they are beautiful. The red is almost sparkly, but only up close. They fit very well and are very soft - no break-in time needed. They run slightly large, but not enough to go up a half-size. The width is very generous for a M, but not too wide either. I will enjoy wearing these to work, but they would be great for going out too. Shipping was within a week."},{"rating":"1","title":"Product doesn't live up to the hype","review":"I bought this product based on what I thought were some good looking images on the box, but once I opened it... Yuck! If you want some really great clip art, best go to a site like Artzooks.com, where you can at least preview the images, buy and download only the images you need."},{"rating":"1","title":"No!","review":"Was extremely disappointed. Disks did not work in my Mac computer and I even ordered set for Mac. I am used to Clipart program through internet and it is so easy to work with but have to pay $125.00 per year. Was looking to save some $ but have decided to renew my subscription to Clipart."},{"rating":"1","title":"Art Expolosion 750,000 Expolded","review":"Sure Art Explosion has nifty stock images that can help in a pinch with small graphic solutions, but what to do with 48 CDs that come shrink-wrapped on a spindle with no lid? In the past the CDs would come supplied with a carrying case. So don't expect one to come with this collection or to get a response from Nova even though they advertise a money back guarantee."},{"rating":"1","title":"Deceived","review":"Buying this product I was replacing my current 750,000 Art Explosion that was on 48 CDs with this new version that was on 5 DVD and it had the promise that I could search the entire 750,000 pieces of art with an onscreen program. I was never to have to page through two huge book trying to find artwork, I would only need to type in key words and the options would be on my screen. Well guess what, it didn't work. What is even worse, the new book that replaces the old two books, has tiny thumbnails of all the art, it's really disgusting to look for something. To top it off, I got my set of DVDs and I got two #3's and no #4. It was a hassle to get them to say they'd send me out the #4 DVD. I should have received it by now. Purchase this if you are in great need of eps artwork."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not that great","review":"I brought this product to use in my graphic design projects, and have got to say I'm disappointed. The content of the cds might be nice if I could ever access it. It takes FOREVER to open the folders on the cd, like almost over a minute and I'm using a brand new, very fast Mac Pro. And while it's accessing the cd it sounds like it's chewing up the cd player. Not great when you're on a tight deadline and every minute counts. The portfolio browser could be better too, the samples are pretty small, better than what is in the book they provided, but still, cumbersome to use, and some features of it make it crash often."},{"rating":"1","title":"Explosion of Crap","review":"This is horribly misleading. Not only did 3 of the DVDs not load (just spun and spun), but the two that did gave me a glimpse of the \\"art\\" they claim to be so great and high quality. The clip art is amateurish, the background images are ... ugh, they're just gross. And the photography is a complete joke. It's all circa 1970s and 80s, the quality is very poor. They appear to be scanned in and have the quality of a shaky grandmother's album. And high quality? Ha! The images not only are lo-res (180 dpi), but they are also small in size (4x5\\")! This is a complete and utter joke. Don't bother."},{"rating":"1","title":"A waste of money","review":"As a graphic designer, I'm always looking for tools like this. When I bought this for our shop, we were planning on using the icons for quick placement in our statement designs. We also looked forward to using the fonts and other clip art eps features for various quicky projects. Unfortunately, the interface is difficult to use, and loading the CDs is tedious.The stock photos are worthless. I have yet to use one of their 1970s photos for anything other than a good laugh.The font database has nothing usable.Overall, this was a waste of $100. Our shop has used it probably half a dozen times, and I don't imagine we'll use it much from here forward."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth the investment","review":"I own an older copy of this product and have used the heck out of it on various Macs over the last 5+ years. Believe it or not, it was the PC version, but I am able to open all of the .wmf clip art files in Adobe Illustrator to use as raw material, deconstructing the vector forms to make fast, original illustrations and logos. A real timesaver if you don't feel like hand-drawing a mandolin, corn-on-the-cob, bicycle tire, or what have you. The huge catalog of images included is a great reference, too. I can only imagine how handy the Mac version will be and definitely plan on buying it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Amateur clip art collection is a waste of money.","review":"Art Explosion 750,000 for Mac is a waste of money! The collection comes with a crippled version of Extensis Portfilio 6 Browser. It is very, very slow! Finding the image you're looking for is a chore, even on a fast MacBook Pro! The first two DVDs I tried mounted, but the third did not. I tried it in two different Firewire DVD drives - nothing. Defective out of the box.Vector clip art resides on the first two DVDs. Image quality is poor - most are badly drawn cartoons. I've seen many of these images from other collections, such as PrintMaster (for PC). While this clip art be okay for children or flyers to promote the neighborhood garage sale, it is not good enough for business use.This collection is a HUGE disappointment. Nova guarantees satisfaction - but you have to send the product back at your own expense to get a refund check for the purchase price - sans taxes and return shipping costs.This collection is a waste of time and money! Skip it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"Some of the DVDs wouldn't mount on my desktop (I have an IMac) and also on the 1st DVD the Illustrator files wouldn't open in Illustrator so this product is worthless to me.

Hard to beat for the price."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must read for men dealing with childhood abuse issue","review":"I have found this book to be a valuable resource for men dealing with childhood abuse issues. As a survivor, I found most of the literature on abuse to be directed toward women. Sonkin directs this towards men and speaks to the issues men go through. Though not an easy read, I have had many of the issues described thoughtfully and caringly in a way that speaks to me. Many of the thoughts and feelings that I've experienced were laid out in the book, but solutions also offered. If you are just beginning your journey to healing or well along the process, this book can be helpful along the way."},{"rating":"2","title":"review of heroic men","review":"This is a very insightful book into a subject that is greatly ignored. This book can help many men to overcome something that is usually hiden from public view and can help others understand what their men whom have suffered abuse go through."},{"rating":"1","title":"Far from the best of its type","review":"Of the growing number of books about male sexual abuse, this one rates just mediocre. The author seems to believe that abused men all grow up to be abusive, especially toward women. He ignores female abusers and the special issues of gay men. I'd recommend one of the better books in this area, especially Gartner's Beyond Betrayal or Betrayed as Boys, but also Lew's Victims No Longer and Hunter's Abused Boys. Also, Moran's The Tricky Part is a great memoir"},{"rating":"2","title":"Men healing themselves from within","review":"I would recommend this book for men who still have the emotional scares, the resentments, child abuse issues from our childhood holding us back from achieving happiness and serenity.

The songs are classics, the orchestra and singing are excellent. Whenever she is in one of those cranky moods, this cd immediately calms her down. I have had to hear it over and over and over again in the car, and I still am not tired of it."},{"rating":"2","title":"My daughter loves it... and that's what counts!","review":"After the first time my 2-year-old daughter heard this CD, she wanted to listen to it again and again. I hoped it would die out, to be honest... it's not a very adult-friendly CD. The voices can be a little on the irritating side, along with their overly-perky dialogue. But her love for this CD would not die.Every time we are in the car, she calls out, \\"Put Little People on!\\" And so it grew on me. A little. It has very positive messages for kids, and is full of praise whenever one of the Little People finishes a tongue twister (\\"That was so good, Sarah Lynn!\\")What I know is that it gives my daughter a lot of joy to listen to these songs, and to sing along to classics kids' tunes like \\"Itsy Bitsy Spider,\\" \\"Hole in the Bottom of the Sea,\\" \\"Pop Goes the Weasel,\\" and \\"Who Too the Cookie from the Cookie Jar?\\" So no matter what I think, the CD is a winner.I'll just wear headphones. ;)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome Cd","review":"My 13 month old daughter usually gives me about 20 minutes in the car before she starts getting fidgety and cranky. This CD has changed that! We sing along to all the songs, she claps and laughs, and dances in her car seat. I would recommend this CD for anyone with a young child!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent collection of songs","review":"I couldn't disagree more with the previous reviewer. I think this is a great collection of songs. Most infants we know including our 8 month old daughter absolutely love the songs. Don't listen to this CD with an adult's perspective. The tunes, background music, song selection, etc. are all excellent and I believe particularly well suited for little kids (the people producing this music apparently have backgrounds in child psychology).I would definitely recommend this CD to add to your child's music collection.spc"},{"rating":"2","title":"This is our 2nd one!!!","review":"My daughter loves this tape so much I need another. She can sing along with all of the songs clearly at 20 months old. She will even do the hand movements for itsy bitsy spider.As far as the other response - it's not about the adult - it's about the child - and it's obviously had a VERY positive influence on both of us."},{"rating":"1","title":"ANNOYING!","review":"Although the songs are very cute, the \\"kids\\" singing get to be annoying. They have conversations between the songs and they just sound so fake and scripted. I have 50+ cd's for our daughter and all of the fisher price little people ones make me bonkers!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing Mounts on the CETME","review":"The CETME does not have a tab on the rear sight extension like the HK-91 or PTR. Therefore, no claw mount will properly mount an optic to the CETME without sliding forward upon firing.I've read some reviews on other sites that state that this is the ONLY claw mount that will work on a CETME. Not true. There is no mount, claw or otherwise, that will work on the Spanish crap. You would be better off finding someone who could braze or weld a rail to the top of the receiver than wasting money on this contraption."},{"rating":"1","title":"Puhlease!","review":"My advice--don't waste a dime or your time. This book could have been done by anyone with or without experience in retirement planning. It is so elementary Amazon should remove it from their offerings."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a waste!!","review":"Look, I only gave this one star because I couldn't go any lower. This is nothing but sickningly sweet top-forty garbage. It has nothing to do with country and I'm offended that people think it does. Is this the backstreet boys with cowboy boots? I'm sure that if everyone buys it though people will be so wrapped up it's dulcet tones that all war will stop and people will all get along. This isn't music but Robbie Fulks is, get that."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Song for Classroom Use","review":"I teach 2nd Grade at Webster Elementary. As a community project, we taught the entire school the lyrics to \\"Random Acts of Senseless Kindness\\" and used it as the theme for a food and coat drive at our K-8 school. This song moved the staff and student body to do some powerful acts of kindness this holiday season. This song is uplifting and fun to sing along with. It keeps kindness in the eyes of our youth. Way to go, Parker Brothers and Atlantic Records!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome song, can't wait for their entire album","review":"I have seen this group's video on CMT and it is extremely awesome. I am looking forward to hearing their entire album. There song has great harmony and they remind me of a country style Boyz To Men. They have a great sound and I think they will really make it. The song is not only catchy, but it has a great story behind it that could really make people think about where they stand in our society today! Think about it next time you see the next person on the street who needs help."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Smashing Debut!","review":"This disc is AMAZING. Quite frankly, Stook's DIY debut cd is one of the more delightful discoveries to find its way into my cd player in several years. There's some real major league material on this album - some of my favorites include \\"Deliverance from Your Eyes,\\" \\"When It All Comes Crashing Down,\\" \\"One Blue Teardrop,\\" and \\"Watching You Fall.\\" In fact, you'll quickly find that you can't get the chorus for \\"Deliverance from Your Eyes\\" out of your head! I love the references to the Jayhawks and the sound of mid-60s electric Dylan, but yet Stook makes it all his own. I also really appreciate the honesty of this disc - the production is warm and true.

One can clearly hear the roots and style which would become trademarks of their complex melodies in the classic albums to come later.Of particular note are the excellent Lonely Wind, a lovely ballad; Journey From Mariabronn, a track which firmly establishes the Kansas trademark style; and Death of Mother Nature Suite.All the other songs are firm although its clear with the benefit of hindsight that the band were still working on finding their perfect groove - one which was to provide many classic songs in the years to come.I would have normally given an album with this composition of tracks 3* but since it is a debut album and the overall quality of the album is such that you can listen to it seemlessly with the albums which follow I felt 4* was a fair mark in the circumstances.Recommendation to buy."},{"rating":"1","title":"The three little pigs with a twist!","review":"Well I've now read several of the Linda Jones, fairy tale books and most have been very cute lite stories that are easy to read and are just perfect for a lazy afternoon.This book was not up to the standards of the others. I loved the front cover, yum yum! The story was bland. I found the heroine to be a brat. I didn't like her at all. She seemed to be very full of herself.

Fromuz's music is fusion at its best. People who are into progressive rock or melodic rock might not like it as much, but if you like Ponty's \\"Imaginary Voyage\\" or the Liquid Tension\\" CD's you will like this band.The music is original and put together well and as the band states on the cover, they combine elements ranging from jazz to electronic music. Technically, the band members are excellent and in par with most of the well known virtuosos. The music gets a bit tedious towards the middle, but then picks up. It was also nice to have a DVD included with the CD.All in all, I enjoyed it. I recommend it.

Disappointing, my shorts! Even with all its faults, this is still THE GREATEST LIVE ALBUM EVER MADE BY ANY BAND IN ANY SORT OF MUSIC. Granted, it is a little TOO WILD for its own good and the sound should've been better. But, hell, it's still a gothic, maximum decibel crunch, like no other. If you want cartoonish, restrained, chops fusion go listen to RTF; do not come to the land of Voodoo. This record is guaranteed to turn your head into a BASKETBALL every single time you even dare to listen to it all the way through. The guitar/drum exchange between Cobham and McLaughlin on \\"Dreams\\" is THE MOST FEROCIOUS THING to ever come out of a pair of speakers."},{"rating":"2","title":"High energy and dazzling virtuosity","review":"This live recording is a glimpse into what jazz fusion could have become had it not turned the corner into hopeless commercialization. Here you have the visceral, cathartic power of R&B and rock combined in working partnership with the elegance and subtlety of jazz and western formal music - not to mention guitarist John McLaughlin's strong eastern influences. It takes great musicians to pull this off, and if you want to know why so many people believe there has never been a better electric guitarist than Miles Davis alumnus McLaughlin, this recording will give you a good start. Also outstanding on this recording are drummer Billy Cobham, keyboardist Jan Hammer and former Flock violinist Jerry Goodman, whose appearances fall short only in that they are too brief.While not as polished as this great quintet's studio releases, this is great fun and recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"great","review":"The reviewer who thought the original (that is, REAL) Mahavishnu Orchestra \\"not that great in concert\\" must have caught them on an off night. I saw them at the Mississippi River Festival (near the SIU campus) during the summer of 1973; I'd not seen a better concert before, and I've not seen a better concert since. \\"Between Nothingness and Eternity\\" is not as good as \\"Birds of Fire\\" and \\"The Inner Mounting Flame\\" only because its compositions are not as good; the improvising is supurb. Trust me: If you already own \\"Birds of Fire\\" and \\"The Inner Mounting Flame\\", you NEED \\"Between Nothingness and Eternity\\".

She was not someone that ventured far outside the pop stations but when she heard this album she went out and got her own copy.

I bought a cheap on (yes, under ten dollars for sure) and realized immediately I had to put a little more money into it. Now, this stethoscope is incredible! I know several classmates bought stethoscopes for $30 dollars that worked nicely as well. Especially for the purpose of classes and clinical work a cheaper stethoscope is great, but for a long term investment for your education or career, not only is this stethoscope great but several healthcare providers have commented to me as to the quality of this particular stethscope. My bottome line review is simply this: Yes, you can go with a cheaper stethoscope, but you can't go wrong with this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Littmann Master Cardiology","review":"Amazon delivered the stethoscope in a timely manner.

I'm not sure what \\"generation\\" it is but it clearly did not work in the Philips player after numerous attempts. I will agree that the picture when playing a regular DVD was just ok and not great but I was willing to overlook that for the Ipod feature. Unfortunetly I couldn't even get that far with this product, I'm not sure if my Ipod is not compatible or if the switch toggle that connects the Ipod to the unit was defective but I sure wasn't going to buy one and bring it home to find out the hard way."},{"rating":"1","title":"I have the 7\\" model","review":"I thought that this item looked like it would be pretty awesome, since it plays so many different formats. One problem, if you listen to the player through with the headphones, you can actually hear the motor spinning the disc.

Philips wasn't much of a help either."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't support iPod Classic... loved the features though","review":"The product was good.. played DVD's nicely and even enjoyed the fact that the screen is turnable so as to turn it into a tablet style player.

So I called tech support. Three times. No one ever asked if I was using a new ipod classic. Mostly they put me on hold or repeated back my information to me.

So far it's been a wonderful player. We love the swivel screen (something we didn't know about before hand) that turns this player into a tablet style portable DVD player. We also love the fact that we can play videos on the iPod, DVD or an SD card. The only disappointment so far is the fact that this player won't support SDHC cards. Pretty much anything over 4gbs isn't useable. That would have been good to know before I invested in an 8gb SDHC card."},{"rating":"1","title":"THIS ITEM HAS FALSE ADVERTISING !

We bought the new 80GB Classic and when we connect it to the player, we could not get the video to work on the DVD player. Initially when we called Phillips they said it would work, but after getting passed to a supervisor they admited that it ONLY works with the old 5th generation I-Pods, and they are aware that they do not state that ANYWERE on the packaging or documentaion, nor did they seem to care.

It also will not play SMHC cards. It looks good, but has limited options for playback. Other than that, it worked fine."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor build quality","review":"While the iPod integration (if you have an older iPod) is really nice, the unit itself has a very grainy, low-resolution screen and the build quality is very poor. Ours is literally falling apart (at the swivel hinge) and started doing so pretty early on in its life. It's a shame, since we have an older Philips 7\\" DVD player which not only looks better, it was made like a tank and it still good as new. This one, however, will need to be replaced soon. I would avoid this and all future Philips models, no matter how compelling the feature list is."},{"rating":"1","title":"Travel Player you can't actually travel with!","review":"Don't get me wrong, I like this player for a lot of reasons, but does it strike anyone else as odd that a portable player designed for travel and containing an international voltage adapter will not allow you to play legal DVDs purchased outside region 1 (North America). I bought it for international travel, so for me, it's close to useless unless I want to carry all my DVDs with me -- $200 down the drain.One other niggling problem... You can't control the volume with the remote controlIf you ever plan to travel with this player, don't buy it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Keep looking","review":"We thought this would be a great option for a trip with a small child. After less than two weeks of use, the video display started to deteriorate so that it was impossible to use at all. The unit is small, so if that is what you want, go for it. The construction leaves a little to be desired. I loved the size, nice and compact, easy to travel with, but it feels cheap. The remote does not stay very secure in the unit when it is stored. We never got to try it with the iPod, but since it won't even hold the remote in place, I would be nervous docking my iPod in the unit."},{"rating":"1","title":"Does not play 80gb & 160gb iPods","review":"I can confirm what others have written about the DCP 850. I went to both Frys and Best Buy and tried my 80gb in their display models DCP 850. The sound came through so I knew the iPod was connecter, but no video. The clerk and I tried every option.. changing the video settings, etc. Music but no video.There is a DCP 855 model out on ebay. I wrote questions to every seller and one replied that it was Philips way of keeping track of interior parts. Maybe, one of those parts is a chip to make the 80 & 160gb units play video.

Flip A Coin is one of those \\"independent\\" movies, this one being from Britain, but doesn't deserve to be associated with a country that is known on this side of the pond for producing so many high quality features. This one is rubbish, amateurishly produced, stupid storyline, unconvincing acting, and an exceedingly annoying narrative that attempts to put cohesion to a failure of a story. I got this movie in the bargain bin, but it's not even worth a tenth of the four dollars I paid for it. And I can't believe I'm the first to write a review of it here at Amazon.

He sound more like a disgruntled malcontent than any authorithy on the NYPD.Even worse is his poor attempt at writing. It is totally disjoined and many parts do not make sense. He seems to have no knowledge of grammar and sentence structure.Biggest paradox is he complains that the NYPD hires all kinds of criminals including former felons then he complains about internal affairs investigatigating police misconduct.Trust me you will be very sorry if you waste your money on this book.

I have seen these pan gaskets used, then re-used, without leakage many times... although no one would recommend such a practice (wink wink).

Granted, there had been earlier future-shock groups (especially in the Kraut-rock movement), but Chrome was the first to really ROCK. But let me emphasize, this is seriously crude. It sounds like the drummer, Damon Edge, was playing on a pawn shop drum kit that hadn't had its heads changed since the 60's, and the whole thing sounds like it was recorded in a basement, which I suppose it was. But then, maybe that crude D.I.Y. cyber-punk quality has a subversive charm. Come to think of it, this would have made good soundtrack music for Mad Max."},{"rating":"2","title":"FINALLY..........another magical treat from Ms. Bentyne!","review":"Having been an ardent fan of Ms. Bentyne ever since I happened upon the long out-of-print album \\"Something Cool\\" from 1992, I jumped to get this album when it became available. And I must say, Ms. Bentyne fulfills every wish. Whereas noone should contest that the voice is one of the most musical in contemporary music, with this album she has decided to do evergreens by for instance Cole Porter and Richard Rodgers.

I expected Masks to be similar, but it was extremely different. It is more modern and twisted. The story revolves around two women, one older and one younger (the younger is the widowed wife of the older woman's son). However, their relationship is not straight-forward; they have a psychic, almost sexual, connection. They use this connection to play with the hearts of the men around them. I found the descriptions in this book particularly striking; there is a party scene with the release of fireflies that I can still very clearly visualize. It was extremely enjoyable to delve into the dark depths of the two women. Just like in the story, the men are inconsequential. This is a great read for those who prefer things a bit uneasy and weird."},{"rating":"2","title":"Deeply compelling and mysterious.","review":"I think this book is wonderful.

However, it is interesting throughout, and while I liked half the tracks much better than the other half, there is nothing offensive here. I have a limited music budget, and likely won't be buying Kyle items at full retail, but if I see any more of his work in a discount bin, I will grab it.

There is a little in there, but the majority of the book is devoted to discussing the relationships between the girl and her parents.As a children's book, it is very wordy and the illustrations leave much to be desired. It is clearly directed toward children who are at least 7 or older.As the single mother of a bright, question asking 3 year-old who was conceived through DI, I am beyond feeling dissappointed with this book.

So, if you are not excellent at math and science, you simply cannot use the book. It will sink you into confusion.The only explanation is this: Browne wanted to give one of his sophomore physics students a project, namely to fill in many of the details of the book. The kid peed his pants and did the job with such excitment that he made loads of errors a high school student would spot. Browne didn't bother to read the damn thing to see whether the kid made any errors. No, he put the thing in an envelope and sent it to the publisher, who published it without checking for errors.

But season six is just horrible. Characters act totally unlike they have in the previous five seasons, and the whole mystery about who killed Jenny (if anyone did) was so boring. Who cares who killed Jenny? The character has been completely unlikeable for years; honestly, I'm surprised that she wasn't done in long before this.And for being the last season, there is no closure. The last show in the season is especially weak. And the whole big mystery around Jenny's death is never solved, either, in case anyone actually cares.

Starting off the fact that it was only 8 episodes long. From the start I knew that meant it was a throw away season. The finale of season five would be a better ending than the last episodes of this season. I have a feeling that so little effort was put in this because it was more of springboard for \\"The Farm\\" which was never picked up then an actual ending to the series. Not even Lucy Lawless could save this great series. I would have loved to have her come on as a regular character and get involved with one of the characters. The whole point of her character being there did not even answer the question that was the basis for all 8 episodes of the series."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing!","review":"My girlfriend and I were both disappointed with this final season. First off, the season only consisted of 8 episodes, so if you're smart you'll buy it cheap because it is not worth the $45 they're charging at Target or Best Buy! This is what began my experience with season 6...I open the box and realize that they only shot half the number of episodes than what a normal season contains.The second aspect of season 6 that was disappointing is that the entire season revolved around Jenny. I think the consesus is out, Jenny is nothing but frustrating...so I don't know why the entire final season revolves around Jenny.All in all, this final season is a disappointing, unresolved mystery about who killed Jenny. I don't recommend it, but if you're into the series until the end like we were, then my one line of advice is find somewhere that sells it cheap!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than expected ...possible spoiler alert","review":"I might not have purchased this final season had I accepted the negative reactions I've read. Now that I've just finished watching it, I feel the series has had a satisfying conclusion which included seeing, if only briefly, characters from the past.

They are very poetic.I actually heard about Slint when I first saw The Shins music video for \\"New Slang,\\" in which The Shins pay homage to all of their inspirations by posing for their album covers.

His version of \\"On Broadway\\" is a great combination of jazz, r&b with a dash of funk thrown in. Mr. Benson's voice has never sounded finer and the song became a top ten single. There are other great performances on the album including the smoky \\"Lady Blue\\", the breezy title cut, the heavy jazz of \\"Ode To A Kudu\\" and a touching tribute to his mentor Wes Montgomery, \\"We Remember Wes\\". There is also Mr. Benson's original version of \\"The Greatest Love Of All\\" which is from the Muhammad Ali biopic, The Greatest. The song is nothing like the overplayed, schmaltzy version that Whitney Houston had a hit with. It is an understated, pretty song that Mr. Benson doesn't go over the top with."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good \\"live\\" cd!","review":"The long version of On Broadway was worth purchasing alone!

I purchased one, brought it home from the store, and found that the cheap stand had broken in the package. The store was kind enough to replace it, they took a new one out of its packaging to verify that it wasn't broken, and then I got home to find that the damn thing had broken during the trip from the store to my home. You would think it would be stupid to make an $80 camera and put a $.03 attachment mechanism on it, but that's what a genius mind at Logitech came up with.

The hinge is so weak that the webcam just flops over and is always pointed at the ceiling or above your head. On the box they show the webcam securely fitted to the screen and it never sat that securely on my HP DV1000 or Dell D600 screens.On the plus side, I liked the image quality and the built-in microphone. But, those highlights are negated by the fact that its very difficult (if not impossible) to even get the camera pointed in the right direction!My suggestion is to try to find a notebook webcam that fits securely on to your screen (e.g. Creative Ultra)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't underestimate form factor","review":"It is a great camera, if optics are the only measure of greatness. But that would be like saying that the engine is the only measure of a good car. If the steering wheel is on the wrong side of the dashboard, that's not just some aesthetic issue.So it is with this camera. The stand is terrible. Not only is it flimsy, it's basically inflexible. The camera can sit in one position, with no possiblity to raise, lower, or turn the lens. It wouldn't take much more in terms of design or manufacturing, to be able to set it up with some flexibility. And it can't sit on a table, etc, because the cord extends from the bottom of the unit rather than the top. Inexplicable.A camera is as useful as you can make it. If you would buy a 35mm film camera that could only take mid-distance portraits, and nothing else, then this is the quickcam for you. Again, the image quality is excellent, but that matters far less if there's only one type of image it can capture."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loving it so far","review":"This cam works perfectly for what I need a laptop cam for. It's small, has a carrying case and is great for travel. The CCD sensor is awesome - VERY clear picture. My work area is dark and the low-lite adjustment did a great job. There are a few things I don't like this cam. The mic is ok, but not sensitive enough. The stand is ridiculous.

Maybe not.","review":"This cam may work at one location, but not at others, depending on the environment. It was a problem to install right from the start and I spent several Sunday afternoons with un-installing and re-installing drivers, Windows \\"clean boots\\" and their like. Logitech online support provides only basic information. The driver software's \\"self healing\\" option is a joke. Proper support seems non-existent.From forums on the Internet I learned that the drivers may not really be designed for Win2000 and that Logitech cams only support USB1.1 anyway. But even after purchasing a USB1.1 interface card the problems persisted. As an electronics engineer I finally managed to resolve the problem with a solder iron inside the webcam.It works fine now - but Warranty void. Too much of my precious private time wasted.

I double checked the sizes and had ordered correctly according to their charts.

I was a little taken aback when I first got it because it was HUGE, and I had to pull the straps on the side very far and tight to make it give me support. So, beware that the sizes are pretty big, even for a twin pregnancy. But other than that, it gave me EXCELLENT support. Helped relieve my hip and groin aches, and was COMFORTABLE. It has enough padding to give comfort."},{"rating":"2","title":"EZ belt","review":"The belt is wonderful for back pain.

I would suggest wearing something under it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very uncomfortable","review":"I I am 25 weeks and bought this belt to help me with my back pains and got no results. It is very thick and sits all around your back. If you work all day and have to get up and down, the belt will slide up your back and you'll need to go somewhere to adjust it because you can't just pull on it to get it down. I showed it to my doctor and she said it is not the best product, something smaller will work better, but if you really suffer, consider physical therapy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Much needed support!","review":"I bought this when I was in the third trimester of my last pregnancy and mainly needed support for my belly. I would walk with my hands under my belly to hold it up. My OB recommended this. I purchased it at the hospital and actually had it fitted for me. I wasn't even allowed to buy it before I watched the instructional video and tried it first. Thank goodness because it's true- the SIZES DO RUN LARGE. In clothing I am an XL but with this belt I am a medium.It supports my back, belly and hips (which is the main struggle in this current pregnancy). I feel very supported wearing this. I've never had a problem with scratching as I always wear a cami underneath. It does require adjustment when you stand up from sitting but it's not too much of an issue. It will look a bit lumpy under more fitted clothes but honestly...there just isn't a product that has it all and with the support this provides, you won't hear me complaining."},{"rating":"2","title":"a necessary evil","review":"When I got this in the mail I was excited because my belly muscles hurt a lot if I walk or stand around too much at a time. Then I put it on and I thought I was going to send it back because it was so bulky and big. Then I took another look at what was else offered (for support bands) and realized I had probably chosen the best one because I had already done the research and the others either have too much coverage and extras (like suspenders) or too little (like not much coverage and not much support) in comparison. I decided to try it for a few days since I could not see any other option. I have realized this is what I needed. It has made it so that I don't have pain anymore. I do have a Bella Band (which I owned first) that I put under it so that the Velcro doesn't touch my skin and that has worked very well. My two problems are, with summer coming I am worried about how hot I will be and, I hate how easily it moves up when I sit down."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great support","review":"This is my second time purchasing this item. I used it during my first pregnancy and it was wonderful, since I carried my son really low. Before I got the support belt I literally carried his head in one hand and used the other for carring items. It also helps with posture and support for those long days of continuous walking and standing. I worked until the end of my pregnancy with ease after getting this belt during my last trimester. Very nice product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful Marble","review":"I used this in a photography project, and the earth is such a high quality, beautiful piece."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect","review":"Ordered for my sons baritone sax and it fit and worked perfectly.

The parents were hesitant to let them, but they did eventually stop and let them climb in the back. While they were turning the corner the RV became disconnected and rolled down the hill. Then this man from the camp came and knocked on the door and took them to the camp. There they participated in many different camp actvities.

This was not the case for a classroom or lecture recording. The hissing sound couched my voice completely even in a very quiet 10 foot room. It may be fine for a scope of 3-6 inches but, other than that, I would not recommend it. I called Olympus directly and found that they made NO digital voice recorders for large (6-10 feet) conference rooms or lecture halls--yet.I would like to say that they were very honest and tried their best to help me out. I am just going to update the older model of the Pearlcorder S720 to an S725 or S950 microcassette model.Again, I would not recommend it for voice recording over a 3-6 inch range even with an external mike--too much internal noise from the recorder itself."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great product, very happy with it","review":"It works very well as a voice recorder and an MP3 player.

I've had this scoop for a few months now and I expect I will have it as long as I am using this rounded litter box. They are a perfect match. The metal scoop is more than strong enough to handle even the most hardened stuck down litter box load and the slots are large enough to sift quickly without being so big that the clumps break up. I compared this tool with similar kitchen gadgets, but this one had the right size slots and nice rounded handle. Great design!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of money","review":"We bought this because we thought it would be more hygienic and better than those big plastic scoops - we were wrong.

IL FIUME was released in 1996 but the drums have that 80s \\"gated\\" timbre so prevalent in certain quarters, as if they were recorded in an echo chamber. This can detract (and distract) at crucial times. Other than that, it's quite a melodic treat with some very nice piano (both acoustic and synthetic) passages and some sitar to spice things up a bit along with some good guitar sampling. And Tony Paglapietra's voice is as perfect as ever. \\"Il Fiume\\" translates as \\"the river\\" (\\"River Of Life\\" anyone?), and the mood is suitably aquatic and flowing.

But, I realized shortly after that that I was wrong. Goodman's writing gets old very quickly. Nothing is clearly written or revealed. She tries too hard to be esoteric. She frustrates the reader by giving little mysterious tidbits and then not explaining herself until several chapters later. That's a fine gimick if utilized one or two times, but every single chapter has incomprehensible information. That's just annoying after awhile. In the end, the story gets dragged out in such a long, convoluted manner, that you just want to give up halfway through. I usually like Goodman's books, but this one just took too much effort. Plot that moves along nicely is a key element that she has forgotten in her desire to be \\"taken seriously\\" as a writer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unpleasant book","review":"This author persistently has one theme for her books.

It was exactly what it was advertised to be. However, I'm giving it a bad review anyway because it simply didn't work for me. The cup was too shallow for my lip structure which would block the opening if I tried to play anything near the top of the staff. I also didn't like the sound quality of what I was able to play in the lower register.

No Way - Not even close. The cup and rim are OK, but the exterior has several deep scratches - through the silver and down into the brass. I appears that it was hit with a fixed blade knife or some similar tool. It plays and I only paid $20 for it and that makes it cheaper to keep it in my book ;especially when you factor in all of the hassle of mailing it back.I suspect that the person that sold this items was expecting that sort of reaction from the rube that bought it. I should have thought twice when I saw a BSL for $20. You can bet I won't use Amazon anytime in the near future.jdjay"},{"rating":"2","title":"great book","review":"This book is a great book.

If anyone really knew this information, they'd be catching limits of lobster every day.

Also I did not like the fact that I could not use USB cord to download, had to buy a firewire cord 4x4 pin, should have been included. Also the Joy Stick is a little tricky .

The second I ordered it I wished I could spend $300 more for something HD...and that's what I ended up doing. If you're going back and forth trying to decide what's the best of the worst - this is it.

The DV interface was fantastic, makes getting all the videos on to the PC for editing/burning easy. The camera is fast and responsive, and is ready to record just seconds after being turned on, which is helpful with a baby, since they have no attention span, and what is cute one second isn't cute 10 seconds later.My only real gripe is the inability to record video to the XD card directly, and the low quality of the digital camera mode, but that's not why I bought the camera, so it's not a big deal to me. Including a firewire DV cable would have been nice too, but they're not that pricey either.This camera is lightweight, comnpact and easy to use (my mother in law figured it out on her own).

When I found it in Amazon for just $41, I was beyond excited. Unfortunately my happy \\"I'm saving $37\\" dance came to a screeching end when I received the product and took a whiff. It smells NOTHING like the real Princess perfume, instead of delicious sweetness I was greeted with the smell of cheap flowers. Hell, even though Princess has some floral notes, it is a soft oriental perfume (it's even infused with dark chocolate and vanilla!!!)

It looks good, actually repels water, is a great windbreaker, packs into a very small and lightweight bundle, has a very good hood that folds neatly into a well designed collar, with plenty of zip pockets, and it resists wrinkles. The only two minor drawbacks are that it does not breathe well and it makes a little sound when worn as the fabric moves.

Caro tells you that when faced with a marginal decision, you need to incorporate more information--but he doesn't tell you what a marginal decision might be, and what sort of extra information you should look for.Maybe there are people this book will be useful for, but I wasn't one of them. If you don't already know how to calculate pot odds, what the odds against improving are for each given hand, how to calculate when you call or raise, then I'd strongly recommend that you get the Rubens book instead.

Recorded live, this recording has a hollow, distant sound the almost hides the orchestra and dulls the soloists.The only real value of this disk is due to its being (I think) the only Fidelio highlights disk available on Amazon (I have seen others in stores, including one from Karajan).

The title track is very good, and as is the case with many good artists, the b-side tracks would be great on the album of the title track.

This is another sad Eddings entry into the epic fantasy genre. The standard plot -- retrieve the good blue rock, foil evil religious types -- begins to pale after the sixth or seventh rehash. The characters are also stale and old. Sephrenia the mother figure, Sparhawk the gruff but tenderhearted warrior hero, Talen the sly thief, etc etc. The characters ramble through uninspired prose studded with the same jokes used in the Belgariad (to better effect, the first time).If you like Eddings, stay away from the Tamuli as well as the Elenium.

Bad!","review":"I purchased this pillow at a local Brookstone thinking it could help me with my snoring, (or more for my wife's insomnia), after trying it our for one night, I've decides that it just isn't worth the $125 price tag, it was not comfortable at all, didn't stop my snoring, I was told that I ended up sleeping on by back anyways. So today we tried to return it, but guess what, they don't allow any returns, not for pillows or any \\"personal\\" product! For any reason whatsoever, the store manager proclaimed.Perhaps Brookstone should test their products thoroughly before they put them in their stores, or AT THE LEAST warn customers about their return policy before a purchase. As an ex-regular customer of Brookstone, I am utterly disappointed by this experience. Anyone wants to buy mine for 1/2 price?"},{"rating":"1","title":"waste of money","review":"CAnt be returned at Brookstone -- even though the salesperson led me to believe I could.

They said that they have a new policy that pillows are considered personal items and can't be returned. I informed them that this information was nowhere to be found on the web page. They still refused. I called amazon and explained the situation. They immediately refunded my money under their A-Z guarantee. They told me they would reprimand Brookstone. Hurray Amazon. Boo Brookstone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terriable!","review":"Beware! Brookstone does not stand behind this product! I tried to return it after my 1st night of really bad sleep and they refused to return the product. Too bad was their responce. Thankfuly Amex took care of me and I got my money back.

Then the middle is pretty cool but then they just walk back."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dull and not worth the read","review":"Sorry to say this, but The Thief did not steal me away. THis book was extremely dull and slow moving. The plot did not interest me at all! While there were a couple Interesting twists, they weren't good enough to keep me reading this book. Maybe if you're a little kid and you'll read anything this book will do it for you. But i would suggest you put the theif down and read something GOOD ..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dissappointing","review":"This book had such great reviews, I had to buy it. Now I'm glad I didn't spend very much money on it. The first half of the book is slow and, at times, boring. The ending was supposed to be good, according to the reviews, but I found it to be dissapointingly predictable.I do not agree with the assertion that this is a book for both kids and adults. As a fourth grader, I believe I would have found \\"The Thief\\" interesting, but as an adult reader, I found it to be quite dissapointing."},{"rating":"2","title":"A book to make your breath catch and your heart to leap","review":"The Thief is one of those books you can't leave at home to patiently wait for you, I had to bring it into work and sneak pages here and there. It's one of those rare books that whispers beautiful secrets to you. the lively story it has to tell is age-old, and speaks of an earlier time.The grecian history that is borrowed as a background for the book, while being told in the first person sets the stage for a book of discovery and refreshing excitment. The world Ms.Turner creates awakens what we learned in grade school about the ancient greeks, but when told in a devilish and feeling manner, it makes all the old statues and boring God and goddess org charts come to life! I definatly recommend this to adults that are looking to dive into a place that is beautiful, secret, and a little wicked."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Adventure!","review":"I was expecting another kids book when I started this, but soon, I realized this was so much more. Turner combines Gen's adventures with her own mythologies to create a masterpiece.The loyalty, betrayal, politics, magic, and suspence will keep you hooked. The plot has so many twist and turns you will be reading it over and over again to catch all the hints."},{"rating":"2","title":"Highly recommended!","review":"This is possibly the best book I ever read. It remains one of my favorites!Gen, an imprisoned thief, is recruited by the magus of Sounis as a tool to give Sounis power over the ajoining country Eddis, although some of the characters in the book aren't what they seem... I've reread this book many times and still haven't gotten sick of it. I highly recommend it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun read for all ages","review":"I've read many books in my time- during days off, I can go through 1 or 2 a day. This book is one of my favorites, and one I consistently go back to read again. It has vivacious and multidimensional characters, a plot that gives just enough away to keep the reader interested (but holds back enough that the ending is still a surprise), and language that is both accessible and interesting for people with all levels of vocabulary."},{"rating":"2","title":"Slow Start but Good Story","review":"An Amazon recommendation I bought on a whim - this book is about a thief, Gen, who starts the book in the King's prison having boasted about his plans to steal the King's seal. He is then taken out of jail to steal a precious stone that gives immortality to the holder. The stone is hidden away in an underground cave that only opens for a few days each year, and is otherwised covered by a river.The book is slow going in places - particularly at the start. Written in the first person, it somehow failed to engage me in Gen's plight. Nevertheless it has a nice twist in the ending. It then is perhaps a trifle slow wrapping up. Not a bad read, but could have been better executed.Nevertheless, the slow start aside, this was a great mystery with some nice twists and the action, when it came, was very exciting. definitely worth a read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thriller","review":"I really liked this book a lot. I read it for Battle of the Books. At the beggining I was a little apprehensive because it didn't sound very good, but after the first chapter or two I had a keen interest for the story that was unfolding. This theif is able to out whitt everyone, and although he seems to have the biggest disadvantage of everyone, he manages to pull it off with suprising turns at the end."},{"rating":"2","title":"I Love It.","review":"Very exciting! Beautifully written and a really good plot with some surprising twists. You will never guess what happens at the end. I LOVE surprise endings. And the characters are really, really, really interesting! You will love this book. It's a serious story overall, but also very funny: the author knows exactly how much humor to put into it so it's just right. I can't put into words what this book is like; you have to read it for yourself. Go ahead! (I don't know why some people didn't give it five stars. I can't think what they're talking about when they said they couldn't follow the plot, &c., &c. Oh well, read it anyway)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best. Book. EVER.","review":"As a 25 year old, I thought I'd leave a good review to round out all the kid reviews on here. My mom bought me this book when I was 13 as part of a crusade to get me to shut off the tv and read award-winning books. I thought I was going to hate it, but was immediately hooked.I still to this day remember reading the ending of this book. I refused to put it down in the car and took it into the grocery store where I sat down in the corner of the Costco and was frantically flipping page after page to get to the ending. I've donated a lot of books to charity, but The Thief remains on my shelf and it's one of my favorite childhood books, up there with the Giver, the Just So Stories, and Enchanted Ella.BUY THIS BOOK FOR YOUR KIDS. While you're at it, pick up the 2nd and 3rd books (The Queen of Attolia and the The King of Attolia) as well. (I wasn't fond of the 4th book, as there was depressing little of our protagonist, so I'd skip that one)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Plot, Characters and Good Writing","review":"This series is among the best fantasy I've read. The plot twists nicely over the 4 book series; the characters interact and develop nicely, with enough of the darker side to hold adult interest. The writing is highly competent. This series is actually smarter and better written than the Harry Potter series (yes, I did like that series as well). Appropriate for any age reader."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Thief is one of the best books I've ever read.","review":"It was very detailed and very discriptive. It explained characters,places and feeling extremly well."},{"rating":"2","title":"[insert title]","review":"I couldn't put this book down. Gen is just too adorable since the beginning that I can't leave him for a second. He says things that actually made me chuckle, and I love the phrase \\"gods damn.\\"However, there's something that's bugging me. I feel like the author is cheating the readers by eliminating some information. The part where the magus loses the stone, for example. I always knew it's somehow safely in Gen's hands. Gen sounds like he's avoiding telling the truth--which actually gives out everything--and since he's the narrator of the book and it's his thoughts we're reading, I simply can't get over the way some of his thoughts are eliminated. In addition, the ending is a bit too explanatory/conclusive/conventional, in my opinion.Nevertheless, it's still a good book. :)Someone mentioned a sequel? It makes me happy. :D"},{"rating":"1","title":"The Thief","review":"The Thief was a fairly decent book. At the time your reading it it dosent seem that exciting but, you always want to find out what will happen next. The writing in it is very long-winded and there was a lot of filler. It made it seem like the Author was just trying to stretch out the story to make the book longer. The plot seemed to dissolve at times and stray away from the plot. There was also a twist at the end that didn't make much sense.The Thief is about a boy named Gen, who at the beginning of the story is in prison. Gen is a theif, apparently the best thif in the world, who's bragging has led to his capture. The story is set in ancient times, mabey somthing like ancient greece. Gen is taken out of prison by the \\"Kings Magus\\" whatever that means. He is taken out to go on a long journey to steal somthing for the king. He won't tell him where their going or what their stealing.This book is appropriate for 6th through 8th graders, but I personally would not reccomend it.PARTY!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"this book is horrible!","review":"I thought I would love this book.

All two hundred and nineteen pages kept me mesmerized, which is something only Jane Austin and Louise Rennison have previously done. As the book jacket says, \\"Megan Whalen Turner weaves Gen's stories and Gen's story together with style and verve in a novel that is filled with intrigue, adventure, and surprise.\\" The intrigue is supplied by the feud between the magus's apprentice and Gen, adventure fills the entire novel, and as for surprise, the ending heavily supplies that. The myths are entertaining, and when the mood gets a little too heavy, Gen's dry humor lightens things up. He is, in his own words, a very well behaved hammer."},{"rating":"2","title":"WOW! WONDERFUL!","review":"Make sure you have the rest of the series, and some time to enjoy all of them.Great characters, great story, intrigue and adventure....you'll be hooked and turning pages with fervor...I had to take a break to order the rest...and I'm on edge for book 5...in the meantime I can enjoy the story all over again. This Thief will steal your attention, and captivate you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Epic!!!","review":"This book is amazing! It entirely consumer the reader into the book and its plot! It really takes you there and makes everything so believable. Perhaps the best part is that you can't predict the end, there are so many books that follow the exact same storyline, to the point where you're like obviously this is how it's going to end, and then that's how it ends. This book is sooo not one of those!! It's awesome and you have to read it!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"suspenseful and enjoyable","review":"This book is a great story, well written, with fascinating characters, enormous suspense, a vivid setting and high stakes -- but what I enjoyed even more is that it makes you re-examine prejudices and preconceptions.

One which makes you do that yourself is more than fine."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great story","review":"Great story, kept me intrigued till the very end.

Written with enough details that you can actually believe it took place long ago in a far-away land. Similar to King Arthur or The Westmark trilogy by Lloyd Alexander, what really sets it apart is the layers within layers of the plot.I can't really explain more than that without spoiling the book, so lets just say that you can never take anything about the characters at face value."},{"rating":"2","title":"Girl in the Bay State","review":"This is a story full of adventure, roalty, laughs, romance (just kidding). It is about a boy, who is a prisoner who is asked to find a stone that can only be given to a royal person for it to work its powers. The magic it has is that it will allow the royal holder to not die in battle. The reason I rate it a 4 is because it can becomes somewhat boring, but more so entriging at times, but then it says one thing that is interesting, and you can't stop reading from then on.

The beginning of the book was painfully boring, but the second half was much more interesting. This book had the potential to be 5-star, but the writing was flat and lacked any kind of emotion. It read like a history textbook that stated fact after fact after fact instead of inducing feelings of excitement and intrigue in this action packed adventure. Regardless, I'll read the next book in the series since it appears to be much better than the initial installment. *crosses fingers*"},{"rating":"2","title":"I don't want to ruin anything, but you really should read this book","review":"There was a lot about The Thief that I liked- the vaguely Greek setting, the well-defined characters, and the new pantheon of gods who interfere or don't in their own ways.Gen was an engaging hero- snarky and smart. The dialogue was a delight to read, and even the characters I didn't like got in a few good jabs. I adore pointed conversation!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A great read! Finally...","review":"What can I say? I've been looking for well written, engrossing fiction for awhile now. And I believe that I've found it. The story doesn't seem to be derivative of other work and the faux-Byzantine empire adds a nice touch of fantasy yet familiar.Our hero is thoroughly like-able and thoroughly a jerk. And yet all of this isn't even cookie-cutter anti-heroism. I don't want to give anything way so I'll leave it with this: this is a well written yet economical book (in that the author doesn't spend needless time expounding unpronounced flora and fauna).I'm already enjoying the second in the series. I can't recommend it more highly.Kindle edition: perfect as far as I can tell. I got it when it was priced more reasonably though."},{"rating":"1","title":"Correct - Not for Everybody","review":"The last reviewer was correct. I did not like this book at all. I ordered it because I am a fan of graphic novels and it was set in Prague.

Although a few of the introductory chapters are similar, it's a huge overhaul of the original once you get into the heart of the book.I've been using the native code sections of this book, rather than the .NET sections. Most of the book, expecially the power debugging stuff, is still focused on native code. However, I don't think the \\"Below the belt...\\" review did this book justice.

Less than 45 days later the metal antenna connector pins (3) began to snap off. The unit is supposed to be mobile between house and car but the design is so bad that actually moving the unit around damages it quite easily. I returned it to Audiovox ( well within the warranty period). They would require $80.00 to repair. Plus about 6 weeks or more. So I'll be switching to XM radio and probably the Sony receiver. Do not waste your money on the Audiovox."},{"rating":"1","title":"reception","review":"I would not have bought this unit if they told me it would cut out all the time on back roads were there are trees. advice to all who want this dont do it for your auto, it is no good buy cds"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Nice, but Not Quite All I Wanted","review":"The first thing I'd like to give here is a warning - NPR lovers beware. The NPR stream available here is probably not what you expect. Check out NPR /Sirius websites to see what it offers before buying. NPR was my biggest reason for buying Sirius over xm.Overall though, I am thrilled, the BBC stream is tremendous, the music channels are varied and play a great collection of music inside their genres. The sports channels let me hear NHL and NBA games now and will let me hear every NFL game.The product is good, not perfect, but well conceived. Setup was simple and 10 minutes after purchase I was up and running, the auto adaptor broadcasts on the four 88.x fm channels.In short I recommend the product, but educate yourself carefully to make sure you know what you're getting."},{"rating":"1","title":"radio ok but customer service kills sirius radio","review":"radio is ok, but nothing could be good enough to overcome the rude customer service dept.they basically told me they don't care and they can back it up.try a basic call to customer service before you buy and compare what they tell you as opposed to there terms and services page.that makes for some intresting entertainment.when customer service fixes itself sirius radio will be good."},{"rating":"1","title":"No more technical support for PNP2","review":"I had one of these receivers for about 5 years and it was reliable.

The first few months, we were moving the unit quite a bit between vehicles & the wire on the antennae began to short out. (My son was not as gentle as he should have been in handling it!) Sirius replaced the antennae under warranty at no charge with no problems whatsoever. We chose to put the antennae on the dash, securing it with velcro tape to keep it from sliding. Maybe not what everyone would do, but easy to remove & take in anyone's car you go in. I have had no problems with the Audiovox unit, but bought a JVC SR1000 from Sirius & after 6 weeks it stopped working! Sirius is giving me a full refund, but won't replace it with the same JVC unit. I take it they have had alot of problems with the JVC's. Would definitely buy Audiovox again!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Great service, crappy hardware","review":"I've been enjoying SIRIUS for about a year now.

The instructions to install and tune were awful. It took two weeks and four calls to Sirius Customer Service to work out the issues. They had to boost our signal...and we had to change stations several times. We still get static.On top of that, Sirius hosed us out of a $50.00 rebate, and despite my calling them several times.....they refuse to let me speak to someone about their error. Each time 'Customer no Service' tells me I need to do something else, or tell me they are putting me on an escalation list, or they send me to a dead phone line. They keep sending me generic rejection cards in the mail. I jumped through major hoops to get the rebate in and on time. They asked for everything except my first born in order to qualify.

The book is great, the price, however, sucks! This was a $0.35 paperback in the '60s. ... To get to $10.19 (paperback) & $9.99 (Kindle) would imply somewhere near 3000% price inflation from 1967 dollars. Even a non book-cooked CPI doesn't show this type of inflation. // Maybe the publisher thinks that this is a college text book where they can simply screw the public.

I was at first impressed by the classy finish and immediately threw out my old original case. I was so sorry that I did this just over 1 week later when the belt clip separated from the holster spontaneously after I alighted from the car, throwing the phone in its holster onto the road. Close examination revealed that the leather tongue tore at the stitch which fixed it the holster, probably because of the fine stitching. Now I will probably have to purchase the cheaper and less attractive original type holster for the phone. As attractive as it is, I do not recommend purchase."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Worthy Mystery","review":"Brookins' first book is a success. He follows the mystery genre's rules, and it works for him. There's early murder (Michael Tanner's wife and a friend), a well-defined and likable character in conflict (Tanner), a beautiful setting (the Inner Passage), a premise he can write knowledgeably about (sailing), love interest (Mary Whitney), and a smoothly rendered plot.The straight forward, no nonsense writing style bends toward literary, with much of the tale spent in evocative exposition on the Northwest's Inner Passage and sailing in general. Some readers might find the suspense a bit bland, as if the plot were developed as an excuse to write about sailing, something Brookins obviously knows a lot about and enjoys.I liked the story, and think most mystery readers and all lovers of sailing and the sea will too. Watch for more from Carl Brookins."},{"rating":"2","title":"We Don't Kill Snakes Where We Come From","review":"It is a wonderfully descriptive and very funny account of the two years the author and his wife spent in the tiny village of Meligalas in southern Greece.

I normally watch TV shows for the first time on DVD but I have watched this show, every episode, from the beginning. Alex O'Loughlin is HOT and his role for Steve McGarrett is perfect! And the perfect complement to his character is Scott Caan's Danno. Their bantering and sarcasm back and forth is so enjoyable and elevates the show to a whole new level.

Blissfully Lost in the Baja : Wandering South of the Border with Barb Thacker and Her Dog, Ink, is delightful. While not the most literary of books it still presents an excellent read of her adventures as a woman traveling alone and camping. It is a warm and funny tale as well as sometimes being very poignant. I personally recommend the entire trilogy of the adventures of Ink and Barbara that encompass almost the entire United States and the Baja.

Then the pulleys started to break. Ordered a new set and replaced those (those I had to buy). Now the flywheel will not recoil. Took it apart...I would have to replace the magnetic wheel assembly. It's time to give up, it just wasn't made to be used. I used this rower for 2 1/2 years. My last rower was a cheap old piston type, it lasted 12 years. I finally broke the frame. I used the rower 4 times a week, this one just couldn't hold up. And, no, I'm not some 350 pound body builder...I barely make it over 5 feet and am under 135 pounds.

I have recently started a workout program where I am using now daily. The problem is the machine is literally falling apart. First the foot straps have broken numerous times. The pull strap has frayed so I call to get a new strap and was told I need to buy the entire recoil system for 366 dollars, I only paid 460 for the entire machine. If you want a machine to impress your friends and not use this is it. NOT WORTH THE MONEY!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"This is NOT for serious workouts","review":"I decided on this machine to replace my worn out Kettler Coach, based on its cost and positive reviews. After receiving it yesterday, it took about a half hour to assemble. The first issue I ran into was the display panel wouldn't work. It would activate at the start of the workout, but the readouts would remain at zero until it shut down after ten minutes. Pulling the display out and replacing the batteries worked for a while, but then it shuts off again even while using the machine.As to the workout. Even at the highest setting, 5, there's very little resistance. After a half hour I never even broke a sweat; I'm 62 and exercise regularly, but I'm no athlete. I expected, however, at least a semi-rigorous cardio for calorie burn, but this just won't do it. Very disappointing. If you're serious about your workouts, look elsewhere.The biggest physical challenge with this machine will be re-boxing and returning it."},{"rating":"2","title":"cd purchase","review":"seller got me the item before the deadline.

BUT, the CD release is marred by remix-transfer, which is, to be diplomatic, lousy.What suffers most is the percussion work, notablyArmando Perraza's astonishing bongo work on the closing medley. (I've gotten samples from the LP release by streamed audio over my dial-up modem and cheesy desk-top speakers which sounded better than the CD does on a good home system. )There are percussionists out there who consider Perraza's work to be one of the best bongo performances ever recorded; why can't we hear it?"},{"rating":"2","title":"1 Stinkin' Star for Amazon.com - Borboletta is Fantastic But This is NOT a Remaster or 2008 Release","review":"Borboletta is by far my favorite Santana release.

After that, it was the same hit-or-miss for a few decades, until his total artistic self-sacrifice with Supernatural, in 2000. Oh well, I console myself with the thought that we still have the classic albums to enjoy. Viva Santana Classico!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing, a lame version of Sly & the Family Stone","review":"I'm a big fan of Santana, especially his more experimental stuff, and have seen him play live many times over the years. I was hoping Borboletta would be something like Caravanserai but it's not even close. Borboletta is full of very weak r&b type songs that are poorly written and dully executed. And on top of that, THERE'S NOT MUCH GUITAR PLAYING!!! By contrast, I think Caravanserai is one of the greatest albums ever recorded so I was very surprised at the wide gap in quality between these two albums that were done only a few years apart. I think there were substantial changes in band personnel (i.e., Gregg Rollie and Neal Schon departing, among others) and that probably did not help. Stick with Caravanserai, Lotus and Moonflower."},{"rating":"1","title":"The beginning of the downslide","review":"My review title basically sums it up.

Vocalist David Yow is at his best on Head/Pure, with his heavily muffled, and sometimes distorted (but in a tasteful way) voice, snarling, moaning, and spitting out his lyrics. Overall, this record may be too intense and difficult a listen for most, so dont start here. Instead pick up Liar, which is still frenetic, but not in the psychopathic way Head/Pure is. After that, check out Goat, which is a much darker and plodding look at the Jesus Lizard.

They do not stack consistently with the better-made English Spode counterparts. But, the difference in porcelain quality was not the worst part. A quick glance at the design made it obvious why these are on sale. They are clearly DEFECTIVE. Spode is made with a handplaced design that is then engraved onto the porcelain.

You probably shouldn't get your hopes up about the CD, though. It was funny the first time I heard it, but I can't listen to it for pleasure.

And I love Minor Threat and even Fear."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is really stupid","review":"I fail to understand why the Meatmen are so revered in the punk/hardcore scene. It's probably because they were around at the right time during the initial hardcore explosion. If this CD were released last year, everyone would probably think that it sucks.

The characters are believable and well developed. In an age when many people don't seem to be finding what they need spiritually in the organized church, Reawakening gives the reader a chance to identify why. I could envision each character in the book and relate to the main character's spiritual reawakening. The information about early Christianity and Church history were especially interesting to me. Through this book Mr. Grant has successfully portayed the modern churches' dilemma and the challenges it faces if it is to remain relevant to people's spiriual needs I felt after reading this book that I would like to read more of Mr. Grant's work."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dan's best ever, as well as my 'first'","review":"Dan Fogelberg reached a magic peak with this album.

My personal favorite is, \\"There's A PLace In The World For A Gambler.\\"When I was younger several of my friends and acquaintences and even myself dabbled in mind altering substances. Music played a large part in that lifestyle. When everyone else was listening to Pink Floyd and Led Zeppelin to enhance their highs, I once played this album. When it was over, everyone was overwhelmed and awestruck. We couldn't find anything to follow it, the emotional content was just so awesome.

What you will get is a standard CD with the same artwork and packaging that it has always had. The mastering sounds pre-1990, claustrophobic and inauthentic. Yes, the price can't be beat and for some people that's enough. But this album deserves to be heard with modern mastering. Anyone who cares about good sound, save your money, listen to your vinyl.

Both my 9 and 6 year old boys enjoy doing their chores, crossing them off, then budgeting their allowance money into 4 jars each week. My older boy has always been a saver/hoarder; I think this will help him realize it is o.k. to spend some money on himself (medium-term savings). My younger boy is the spender, and this will teach him to save (long-term savings). They pay for a school lunch each week (short-term expenses) and contribute to a charity. It does take some work on the parent's part: setting up meaningful chores each week and staying on top of paying the allowance money, but it's an extremely valuable lesson for the kids."},{"rating":"2","title":"Practical, Helpful, and Implementable","review":"Neale Godfrey, the author, gives some very helpful ways of addressing money issues with children, regardless of the parent's income level.Being a practicing Certified Financial Planner, I believe the author provides practical advice on what I consider to be the two most important financial criteria for success as an adult.First, her ideas help to create GOOD SAVINGS HABITS that will stay with children for a lifetime. Second, her tips on open communication help both kids and parents to discuss their values and gain AWARENESS THAT MONEY SHOULD BE A REFLECTION OF ONE'S VALUES.While I don't think a teenager necessarily needs to understand how different investment vehicles function, they certainly will need that understand when they get to a point in their life when they are able to invest.

You don't hear Joplin much these days. Her voice is so over the top and she only managed to eke out three albums before she od'd on junk, so there isn't that much to hear. She didn't make it past 27, and it's no wonder, according to this account. She was either drunk or high most of the time. She didn't fit in in Port Arthur, Tx., but she did more than most of her generation ever managed. Bisexual and straight, Janis was a mess. You wonder where she'd be today if she'd lived. Of course, she'd never have been a misfit if she had been born a little later. Her quirks would barely register today. For that, in today's culture. Janis Joplin is probably one of the ground-breakers responsible."},{"rating":"2","title":"A solid behavioral profile within the context of the times.","review":"Echols provides rich and detailed insights into the motivations and behaviors of Janis Joplin. Her interviews with Joplin's friends, associates, and lovers, adds a complexity and understanding as to why this great talent was so self-destructive. Echols does all of this with a historian's need to place the events within their context...the 60's. I came away with a better understanding of this cohort. Myra Friedman's book pales in comparision."},{"rating":"2","title":"Read This Book!","review":"This is the first account of Janis' life I've read that offers a truly unbiased and balanced portrait of an artist previously thought to be immune to objective scrutiny."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing New Here","review":"Alice Echols new biography of blues legend Janis Joplin is essentially a rehash of what we already know about this great artist. The details of the singers life are stated in a very academic fashion, with a slight edge of emphasis from the perspective of a feminist and lesbian view. The author appears to have little knowledge of Joplin's music, and a reader does not get a sense of what was important about Janis. I am baffled by reports I've read that this biography contains a new perspective on Joplin. This book covers no new ground that hasn't been covered previously in Myra Friedman's classic, Buried Alive."},{"rating":"1","title":"Scars of Sweet Paradise:The Life and Times of Janis Joplin","review":"I felt that the text was very repetitive. The same stories told over and over again. Chronology was difficult to follow. I would not recommend this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Intriguing insight into a talented artist's life...","review":"Take it from one who was there, this biography of Janis Joplin is at the same time beautiful, intriguing and somewhat disturbing. She was such a talented, brave and courageous person that never received her just rewards. Most, except closest friends overlooked the milestones she created by challenging a closed system; both the record industry as well as society as a whole. The strides she made for women in the recording industry are felt to this day. Having met Janis in the late 60s, I can attest to the fact she was a very funny, exciting person to be around. Unfortunately, like most people, she also had a side she kept well hidden. I only wish she could have lived long enough to see what an icon she has become. Great read!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Terrific book!","review":"Alice Echols teases out the meanings of Joplin's short life -- the predicament of thebrilliant woman artist trapped in the same masochistic love-me leave-me I'm worthless mentality that characterizes her songs. Much more than a show-biz biography, this is a wonderful work of feminist social history, full of information, insights, and extremely well written."},{"rating":"2","title":"Scarred but spectacular!","review":"With the expansion of opportunities for women today, it is difficult to comprehend how scripted young women's futures still were in the central US in the mid-60's. It was more of a struggle to break out of the mold then than teenagers today are aware of. That Joplin accomplished as much as she did is testimony to her raw determination to do something with the talent that she possessed; that she was unable to avoid the twin pitfalls of alcoholism and addiction only makes her seem more human. Despite its sometimes dry style, Scars of Sweet Paradise provides an important perspective and gives unique insights through interview sources unavailable to previous biographers. Consequently, I found Echols's book more compelling and insightful than either Buried Alive or Pearl."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great read for any Janis Joplin fan.","review":"This well-documented account of Janis's life delves deeper into her bisexuality, her insecurities, and her brassy persona than previous biographies. Ms. Echols has captured Janis without the usual condescension or idolization to which other biographers have resorted. Janis is shown as a person here --- not as \\"Janis Joplin, megastar.\\" Included is a chapter of \\"Where Are They Now,\\" which gives the reader an update on the lives of key players in Janis's life. Also included is a discography, as well as copious notes and sources. In all, this is the best biography of Janis and her times to come along in a while. It is well worth the read."},{"rating":"1","title":"For ten bucks, it should hold more games...","review":"There is a definite benefit on one of these cases -- I own one -- and that is keeping the GBA protected from the wear-and-tear of day-to-day use.

Yes it holds the GBA SP, but nothing else. Getting a game out of the miniscule pouch is an exercise in pure masochism. A much better idea is to buy a small case for the older GBA, and then use that. The extra space intended for the older system will allow you to put in more games, and your SP. Buying this is like putting your GBA in a tight pocket in your jeans.

John Henrik Clarke gives unsurmountable wisdom with each chapter as he details our struggle. He sheds light on noteworthy leaders like Malcolm X, Patrice Lumumba, Kwame Nkrumah, Marcus Garvey and others in this magnum opus of a publication. His death is a tragic loss especially at a time when the world is filled with craven pseudoscholars like Jesse Lee Petersucker and Skip Gates and Scary Elder. I had to hold back tears while watching his lectures after I found out that he passed away in 1999. This book as with everything else that John Henrik Clarke can give you is as good as gold.

I have spend $200 in wiring my theater with 12 guage so I wouldn't have to have wire running all along my floor.

Philips built the unit so the speakers would ONLY work with this receiver, so now I'm out a receiver, 5 speakers and a subwoofer.

But 6-9 months later, when playing DVDs, this thing would sometimes freeze up/crash. I would have to unplug/replug to reset it. But never was there an issue playing a CD. After another 3-6 months, it would not play a complete DVD without freezing/crashing. So I pulled out an older DVD player, and relegated the Philips to CD duty. For only a few months, until this week. It crashed playing a CD, and now will not respond at all to unplugging/replugging, and one of my CDs is trapped inside.

I did have a bit of an issue with the configuration setup because my dad inherited a projection screen TV so it was a difficult to setup with the length of wires fixed. So what I did was switch the back speakers with the front speakers because they were longer (kind of reverse from normal TV setups and it worked fine). That is the only drawback was that the wires were hardwired into the backs of the speakers, so there was a fixed length. I knew this before I purchased it and was fine with it. But for the professionals or people that are really into their entertainment systems, they probably want to have their own wire (upgrades) and length to do what they want with it.

This CD is music taken from the original movies. Also, the arrangements on this CD for karaoke purposes are not easy to follow nor do they make you really feel like singing. Of course, music is very subjective and of a personal nature. As I said above, I prefer the more \\"exciting\\" arrangements from Judy's concert performances.I believe that if you have a stereo system that is karaoke equipped, you would be much happier using one of Judy's live Cd's and using karaoke controls to block voice and/or music.

They've earned the right. Especially Stevie because she writes her own songs. Anastacia and Shakira??????? Why are they on this. And they both sound horrible. And Celine, while sporting a divas voice, cannot sing rock n' roll. The Dixie Chicks are definitely talented, but it was the presence of Nicks that got the crowd response. Cher and Stevie have stood the test of time and are legends. There should have been more Stevie on the album and maybe another diva such as Ann Wilson of heart or even Sheryl Crow.

A young donkey, Sylvester, finds a magic pebble, one that grants his every wish. Through a logical chain of events which make sense, Sylvester wishes he were a rock. Instantly, he is turned into a rock, unable to move, unable to speak. His parents search for him but cannot find him, and their lives seem without meaning. This, the center part of the book, is very sad. But through another logical chain of events, Sylvester the rock is able to make a wish that comes true. Thus he and his parents are reunited, and all three realize that, having each other, there is nothing else to wish for, because \\"They all had all that they wanted. A wonderful story: funny, then sad, then joyous and uplifting."},{"rating":"1","title":"depressing book","review":"I love all the caldecott medal books that I bought for my son but this one was so-so. It was sort of depressing for a children's book. Kids will have enough sadness to experience in life so I don't feel my child needs to learn about depression and hopelessness just yet. I think the story mentions the word hopelessness several times in this book- something very odd for a child's book. I am not downplaying depression & emotions but for a child's book, this is just too depressing of a read. When Sylvester turns into a rock, he becomes hopeless & keeps sleeping more & more & his parents cry & try to forget about him since he is gone (dead). I was getting all down reading this book. My son kept throwing the book on the floor when I'd try to read it to him-- something he never does w/ other books. I guess he doens't like it either. Maybe he's too young- 4 yr. old?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Sylvester, Better than a Rock","review":"Sylvester and the Magic Pebble was a really good book.

It is about a boy who gets a magic pebble, and he can get whatever he wishes - and he accidentally turns into a rock and his parents cannot find him and mourn his loss. Then circumstances happen that he turns back into himself - like a year later. I just thought it was very weird and we will likely donate this book to the local library.

I cannot say whether or not it burns calories or fat because I gave up on it after a few days since I felt no effects at all.This product is worthless.

A pill that could curb your appetite, improve your metabolism, and curve cravings>? Don't think so right??? Wrong, the first day I received the pills I took one about thirty minutes before dinner. By the time dinner came i had no interest in eating the two bowls of food I would usually eat. Instead, I was shocked when I found myself full and completely satisfied at half a bowl. This is a great thing and believe me, 2 pills a day 30 minutes before you eat will work miracles, no joke. With daily exercise such as TAE BO, you can lose pounds like crazy.

I can only hope she writes more about them. I would have liked to know a lot more about Sabin, the enigmatic captain. She seems to have changed a lot since Precursor, and it was a little confusing. I would not be so nice to someone who had poisoned me. I want to know what happened to the rest of Taylor's Children. I think Cherryh completely forgot about them, because at first there were six, and now there are only two. But, overall, Explorer went into things more deeply, and was a lot more exciting, than Defender."},{"rating":"2","title":"only getting better...","review":"Unlike many series that degrade as they go, this one only gets more focused, more interesting and more exciting.

(eg. the extremely long honeymoon sequence)I must say that James Caan's choice of eyewear leaves a lot to be desired - thank god the 70's are over!

Steven Culp and Catherine Bell had chemistry while David James Elliott seemed to phone in his role throughout the season.Season 8 ended before Elliott signed a contract to continue in his role - thus the Season 8 cliffhanger where one did not know whether Harm would live or die. Preps were made for JAG to continue onto Season 9 without Elliott and presumably with Culp in an expanded role. That would have been much preferable and enjoyable. Unfortunately, Elliott did sign his contract.Nevertheless, these are strongly written episodes - if you've seen previous seasons, you will want Season 9 for your collection as well!"},{"rating":"2","title":"jag the best","review":"all seasons were great except the last season , but the final was good , has a lot of action , with war and lawyer and could have lasted longer"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great service, exactly what I ordered","review":"These casters were delivered within a couple of days.

However, I was so happy with the player in all other aspects, I didn't want to return it. Still, the lack of SVCD support is sorely missed on an otherwise full featured player. CDR and CDRW support are great, and VCD support is there. I've found VCD preformance to be suprisingly good relative to some friends players. All in all, this is a great buy, but if you simply absolutely must have SVCD support, then find another player. If Toshiba would add support for SVCDs this would be an easy 5/5 stars.

I finally called customer support and on the third call they told me I had to take it to a \\"service provider\\" for repair?!?!The customer support people were totally useless giving me different responses everytime I called (the first two times telling me a supervisor would call me back).

I tried to play a cdr with mpeg files and nothing happened except some soundtrack like music that wasnt even on the disc. I sent it back as a defective unit. The skipping problem seems to be common with a lot of dvd players based on many reviews I have read. I am going to try some other brands and see if one will work. Altogether, very disappointing"},{"rating":"1","title":"Do your homework","review":"After the player arrived, it was set up and ready to run in only a few minutes. Then I put in a dvd. Talk about slow. It seemed to take more time to start the disc than it took to hook up the system. When the movie finally did start, I was delighted. The sound and picture quality were excellent. I found the remote to be very easy to use, and the zoom control was fun to play with. Then I put in a second movie, Disney's \\"Atlantis\\", and the player would not read the menu. I've tried three copies of the same movie from Blockbuster, but the player simply can't read this movie. The assistant at Blockbuster even played the movie on the store dvd player for me. It played without a hitch. I don't know if the problem is with my particular player, or with the design of this model. Tried to get in touch with Toshiba product support by email. It's been three days, and nothing. So take care if support after the sale is important to you. Thank goodness for Amazon's return policy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Toshiba: Safe, but boxy","review":"I bought this player because it could play MP3 Cd's and hold 5 disks. I was very surprised with the versatility of the product. All of the features are useful and well planned out. I especially enjoy the onscreen menu of MP3 files. When I invite people over for drinks, I put the T.V. on and it opens up a whole realm of discussion. The chicks really dig the selection. Yet, you must close all of your MP3 Cd's before the machine will play them, and it's really embarassing when a disk fails in the machine and you have to turn it off to get anything working.

Also after the firmware upgrade I have now had some srious problems with this player skipping scenes...also very annoying.Also,can you say slow? This has to be one of the slowest players I have ever come across. It does play everything but it sure takes its time getting going.on the plus side it has a very good remote and as a whole the dvd player would be awesome if I could just be sure that I was going to see the whole movie everytime.

Unfortunately, I didn't discover some of this DVD players' shortcomings until after [local store's] return policy had expired, so I couldn't return it. I bought the carousel model so I could use it to play a selection of CDs at random, but it is very clumsy to program the random feature, and it's VERY slow between selections. Also, you actually have to program this thing EVERY time you play more than one disc, or it will just stop after it plays one disc. The DVD player creates a nice picture, but there have been way too many skips during playback."},{"rating":"2","title":"man it just works","review":"We are delighted with this unit.

I would prefer an option to blank it out in some way.Haven't gotten to MP3 disks yet but I suspect that the other reviewers are accurate enough.Finally, on quality...we don't have the best equipment, but even a novice like me can see improvement over VHS.

Ursula 1000 doesn't try to be sophisticated or deep. He doesn't try to tell stories or break a lot of new ground. I don't think he intended to. That being said this album does exactly what it sets out to do very very well. What seems at first to just be ear candy for the usually more sophisticated listener is actually quite a bit more than that, with ever losing its playfulness.Largely latin and funk, and several artists worth looking into in their own right. The tracks just keep coming and coming, and while you might not like a particular track, I personally don't dislike any of them.

The groove offered by the amazing bass lines just makes you want to move. Listening to this album ultimately will make anyone happy. Heck, I listen to the Who, Pink Floyd, and Metallica also, so you really don't have to be a fan of the genre to appreciate this type of music.I would also recommend anything offered by ESL artists, from Aubele to Thievery Corporation, Thievery Corporation being my favorite.

Despite changing height settings, cleaning debris from the rollers, inspecting and scrubbing all moving parts and even trying belt dressing, I now spend more time changing belts than vacuuming. This is highly frustrating, as you might imagine.In my letter to Eureka, I ask the following questions: Should I bring the machine with me on my trip to the landfill this week, or try some yet-unthought-of trick to keep the vacuum cleaner working? Presuming the former is my best option, do you have a suggestion on a similar replacement vacuum from another manufacturer that might last as long as, say, the Hoover upright I owned previously that lasted 20 years while breaking only a half-dozen belts?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Save up and buy a Dyson instead","review":"After two years the gasket which seals the top of the canister leaks resulting in a considerable loss of suction. Replacing the gasket is of little use since the plastic canister itself has deformed under the strain of opening and closing and will no longer make an adequate seal.

I have heard it once, and I don't think I will ever hear it again. Not that it is horrible, but it is just not worth spending my time for, and Geike has now lost all the beauty in her voice, and now sings quite badly most of the time in my opinion. I surtenly miss Liesje Sadonius' beutiful voice in this band. Anyone knows what has happened to her? But back to the album and the conclusion.

It is so utterly refreshing to hear in a pop band the echoes not of the Beatles, but the Stones, particularly the Satanic Majesties Stones, or the Sticky Fingers Stones. And not because Hoover plays the crypto-psychedelic or heroin.country game, but because it is pop that walks the dark side of the street. This was the utter failure of the Beatles, with their music's dearth of the dark narrative power that came out of the blues, which the Stones used so ably. The Beatles music told stories too, but seldom moved beyond the clever or the flip. Hooverphonic's music evokes something more, something more of the late night than the afternoon, and more than the shiny flash of most techno-ish bands.

Game play was awesome, as well as audio on the BB cable. On saturday, this cable arrived, and I plugged it in - the video was decidedly more jerky, and audio would cut out randomly.

Where composite cables were analog, the signal traveled in waves. For an analog signal the quality of the cable can effect the quality of the signal, a cheap cable would mean a bad picture or sound.But with a digital signal like HDMI the signal quality doesn't really matter, so long as the complete signal gets there, it doesn't matter if the quality has degraded along the way. If a 1 is still a 1 and a 0 is still a 0 when sent and received, then it'll look the same whether your hdmi cable cost you $6 or $60.Don't get ripped off by people telling you that you need a high quality cable for a high quality image."},{"rating":"2","title":"the best","review":"gracia por mandarme el cable a tienpo y a hora mi ps3 se bes mas lindo y a lo mejor la le compre mas cosa"},{"rating":"1","title":"Did not work","review":"Cables did not work.

I've attended every session so far and only five classes in, I feel totally lost. She tells us to do not only web assignments, but to do the book questions as well.

To illustrate, on the first day of class she brought 4 precal books from years past and held this book up to them. The first thing we noticed is that this book is 1/2 the size of the older precal books. Looking through it you find that a lot of critical/remedial information has been left out! As a consequence she had to supplement from those books of yester-year or (as she put it) a lot of people would have probabaly made a D or flat out failed because the way this book was structured!I wholeheartedly agree with her!In short, this book is way, WAY too assuming in the sense that you have a very strong mathematical (algebraic) background and practically throws you off into deep water leaving you to tread it for yourself.

I always like books where good guys go bad. Xanatos was Qui-Gon Jinns former padawan. He already went to the dark side. When Qui-Gon and Obi-Wan Kenobi went on a mission to Telos Xanatos' home planet. They ran into a surprise. Xanatos was waiting for them. They fell into many of Xanatos' traps yet in the end of the book the jedi manages to put Xanatos in a similar trap. This is one of the best books yet and I love it. It shows ones evil fall and anothers redemption as a jedi. Qui-gon is finally letting go of Xanatos and accepting Obi-Wan, This sets a background for the entire saga of Star Wars. I would just like to say that I have read all of the Star Wars kids books and I am the biggest fan. I know what I'm talking about. May the force be with all who read this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not great","review":"This latest edition of the Jedi Apprentice series was not so good as several that have gone before. The main reason for this is that virtually nothing happened. I read the book in <1 hour, and I felt like it had been pointless. Though this is not the end of the series, the author has gotten rid of the main focus of the whole thing. This book also had the same basic plot elements of those which have gone before -- a whole planet's population is obsessed with one event, which obviously isn't that great. Despite all it's misgiving, the interactions between Obi-Wan and Qui-Gon have gone back up to a level of excellence. They finally get somewhere new in their relationship, and they realize that said relationship doesn't always have to be perfect. This is a very good character book, but the plot was quite lacking."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"If this isn't a good book, kill me now!\\"","review":"I thought I would die of suspense. In this one Xanatos, Qui-Gon's former apprentice, (you probably knew that) shows how evil he really is. I mean EVIL. Also, Qui-Gon's feelings for Obi-Wan are shown. Even though they're not Master and Padawan, they begin acting like it again.Although I missed Tahl and TooJay, Den made up for that. Just as funny and action packed as the rest. I still say Jedi Apprentice needs one hundred+ stars!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Climax","review":"This is my second personal favorite in the series. Obi-Wan and Qui-gon travel to the planet of Telos to try and hunt down Qui-gon's old nemisis:Xanatos. Fans of Knights of The Old Republic will recognize Telos as the battered homeworld of Carth Onasi. While there are no obivous refereces to the game (like statues of Carth) OFFWORLD's exploitation of Telos's sacred global parks will likely remind KotOR players of good old(and evil) CZERKA. The book also gives slight messagges on the effecst of gambling rings on a local culture. That being said, I find Xanatos's final fate is slightly anticlimactic(I feel his fate should have been uncertain, so he could show up in the clone wars era or even post RotS era)All in all however, I found it quite enjoyable,and serves as the climax for Qui-Gon's not-so-private war with Xanatos."},{"rating":"2","title":"great buy for the Marcel curling iron","review":"My daughter is going to beauty school and loves this iron.

Problem is this a larger than normal size (guessing 1 1/2) and it won't fit the hole in my brand new table or my brand new base. I noticed it as soon as I took it out of the box, the pole is huge! It looks good, but it will likely not fit your furniture. I've never seen an umbrella with this size pole before.Also the description states the top is canvas, but it seemed like a much lighter poly material to me. Made in China."},{"rating":"1","title":"Astonica Market Umbrella, Hunter Green (10 ft Diameter)","review":"The description of this umbrella states that the diameter of the two piece juniper pole is 1 1/2 inches in diameter. Actually it is 1 7/8 inches in diameter. Since most standard tables have pole openings less than 1 7/8\\", this umbrella cannot be used with a table, rendering it useless for my purposes. Furthermore, the juniper pole came split.Unless you want to stick this umbrella in the sand or have a holder or table with a 2\\" diameter opening, I would avoid this item."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice, but...","review":"Waited all this time for this great deal.

Obviously a broken piece of wood. It turned out to be one of the umbrella supports. What's upsetting to me is that whoever packaged this umbrella had to have known that this was broken. The piece was completely broken into two pieces. I hate going through the trouble of returning items and having to deal with extra postage etc. So I've decided to repair the borken piece myself. I think that there should be some kind of steps taken to assure that items are not shipped already broken. There was no damaged to the box so the wood had to have been broken BEFORE being packaged."},{"rating":"1","title":"Umbrella I bought","review":"The umbrella i bought looks good not broken, intact, but the roundness is way to big for a standard umbrella stand, how the heck am I going to get it to fit?

Having read the reviews I am declining to purchase the umbrella. The biggest issue is the diameter of the table opening and the base, which in my case is 1 1/2 inches.Unfortunately several of the reviews state that the pole turned out to be larger than 1 1/2 inches, more like 1 and 3/4 inches instead of 1 1/2 inches as stated in the description.This would render the unbrella completely useless, at least in my case. I was specifically looking for an unbrella pole of 1 1/2 inch diameter. I thought I had such a pole until I read the reviews.

Upon reading this book, I'm inclined to disavow the existance of this book entirely. The book seems to have been rushed, poorly proofed, and written for no other reason than to have a product about Evangelion for sale. It would appear that the authors made an effort to do some original research, but it falls flat on its face, as it is riddled with mistakes, speculation, mistakes, and misconceptions that had long been disspelled in the fan community. This book will only serve to spread more misconception to fans of the show in their search of answers and commentary. I can't recommend this to anybody but the extremely hardcore Evangelion fans for the purpose of snickering and belittlement.

The only criticism I have is the author's overuse of Visual Studio objects. While they work fine in simple applications, programmatically building your objects (rather than dropping them onto your application) gives you much more control and speeds up program execution. It would have been beneficial if he would have showed both processes (object and programming based) instead of only the simple approach. However, it is still a good intro and I would recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I got this book because it received many good reviews. I was extremely disappointed when I read it. This book felt like a copy-and-paste reference. It goes through code without really explaining why you're programming it that way. Another weakness of this book is that, instead of sticking to code you've learned about, it has you program complex code that they never teach you about in this book. The real-world examples and instruction are also seriously lacking.Overall, I would urge you not to get this book, beginner or not. I went through the entire thing and still feel like I didn't learn anything."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great support with no discomfort","review":"I used to wear a 38DD bra and used a Champion sports bra that had clasps and adjustment straps to get full support. This bra was wonderful when I was larger, but as the pounds started coming off it had issues, such as said clasps and adjustment straps. They would leave bruises or even cut into my spine when I would do floor exercises. I also am a diehard fan of underwires and found that most smaller bras without clasps did not have these. I decided to give this a try because of the molded cups, and I am glad that I did. This bra does not result in uniboob, but still gives excellent support. I routinely run on the treadmill up to 7mph, and I have never had any discomfort from verticle motion. Additionally, you do not need to be Houdini to get in and out of the bra. I highly recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Actually supportive and comfortable for running!","review":"I wear 36C or 34D depending on the bra, and I have one of each in these.

I looked through reviews trying to see if maybe I missed something about it being tighter than a usual sports bra but didn't come across anything. I'm not going to return it or give it a terrible rating because I know it's good quality and I know it is supposed to fit well. I don't know if I ended up with a rogue sports bra that wasn't manufactured properly, or if I just need a larger size. I'm going to keep this one since it will fit eventually when weight comes off and I'll just order a larger one for now. Hopefully the next one will be nice and comfortable.

I knew about it before I bought it so it wasn't a big surprise and it doesn't bother me when I wear it as a bra top for yoga. However, it is limiting in that it really can't be worn under a tank top because the seam would be too pronounced. Also, it's not one of those super absorbant fabrics that would make it perfect for Bikram Yoga. I didn't want to spend $50 on one of those though so for the price this one was fabulous.

After taking a somewhat dark and foreboding turn with their last studio release \\"12 Memories,\\" we are now back to the more uplifting tunes and harmonies of \\"The Man Who\\" and \\"The Invisible Band.\\" Fran Healy has an incredible voice and knack at hitting those impressive falsettos that really get you, and on standouts such as Battleships, we are treated to Fran at his best. I was blown away by the vocals on this great song. My Eyes, I guess, was written for his newborn child. Catchy song, and will stick w/ you just like Battleships. Closer is another winner, as are Eyes Wide Open and Out in Space. Travis is back in their well defined, and comfortable niche with this new cd. And I for one hope they stick to it. Some bands get away with experimentation and broadening their sound, but most bands only fall off the charts by doing so. Travis has done well by releasing a cd that sticks to what they do best!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Refreshing / Deep / Real!","review":"I haven't heard a group this refreshing since forever!

All else boring...emotionless.","review":"There is no \\"Sing\\" or \\"Writing To Reach You\\" on this CD. 12-MEMORIES is a better CD as a whole with much better individual songs as well. Same goes for THE MAN WHO & THE INVISIBLE BAND obviously. \\"Selfish Jean\\" is the best (most upbeat) song followed by \\"Battleships\\" or whatever else. Really doesn't matter since the rest of the palatable songs in the beginning of the CD, while technically good, simply have no emotion and cannot be separated from elevator music. I'm a Travis fan, but don't consider myself a huge fan. Have seen them in concert and purchased all thier albums and dumped the 1st one.

Issues: The cheap cord's screw-in collar would not screw into my D700 no matter how hard I tried, although it did screw into the D200. The Nikon cord screwed easily in. The cheap cord is tightly coiled, which means it won't extend to anything close to its advertised length; the Nikon cord is straight. Finally, the cheap cord has a very flimsy switch with an uncertain initial position; the Nikon has a solid switch that with a solid feel.Electrically, the cheap cord seemed to work OK. No idea if it would hold up with use.So, I strongly recommend spending the money for the Nikon MC-30."},{"rating":"1","title":"Broke after a few months","review":"It was great while it lasted.

I took it out today to do some long exposures of a spectacular sunset and got one shot with it before it completely crapped-out. Unacceptable. I got home and took it apart so see if it was because of a battery by any chance. No dice. Cheaply made device, not made to last. You get what you pay for.

And of course, Nina eventually is back, played even better this season. And of course, Kim Bauer is annoying and whiny and won't listen to Jack at all (and then gets caught in a bear trap - it could happen?!). I like the addition of new characters in this - Kate Warner for one does a great job although she constantly has a goofy look on her face. All in all, this season is highly enjoyable and my wife watched it in only a few days! Not as good as the 4th season, but still awesome!

Yes there were implausible things and other stuff that was stupid but for the most part it was entertaining.After those 18 episodes the plot shifts from the \\"bomb\\" to a government conspiracy wanting to impeach President Palmer and attack the middle eastern countries. Everything about this plot was stupid and implausible. It was so frustrating to watch I can't even put it into words.My opinion is skip this season all together. The funny thing is, they duplicate this exact plot in season 6, like literally it's the exact same thing that happens to David Palmer's brother. This season is an example of an over the top plot that goes in a bunch of different directions.Most annoying things about this season:Palmer conspiracy plotKim Bauer's plotsCarrie CTU agent"},{"rating":"2","title":"Addictive Entertainment","review":"This Season 2 24 is non stop excitement from start to finish.

It was boring and frustrating to see Kim's stories which seemed so silly and unrealistic. It just seemed like the writers wanted her in the show so they added totally unrelated storylines. The President's staff seemed fairly stupid and the one lady who was meant to be supporting him didn't communicate well with him at all, this led to more storylines but wasn't very believable. The number of setbacks that Jack had when he almost had proof of various things was unbelievable mainly because these seemed to happen out of clumsiness and stupidity which he clearly is not.Overall there are some interesting stories here but when you look at it as a whole it it all generic. I feel like the writers have locked themselves into needing to write 24 episodes and so have run out of good ideas."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great again!","review":"Seeing as how the first season went, I don't blame the second season for not being as suspenseful and on the edge of your seat. Be that as it may, the season still held your attention for every single episode and never once waivered. Again you never really know exactly what is going to happen, but what did happen isn't as dramatic as the first season, isn't so mouth open in shock, which is why this is only ranked four stars.Enough of season one, season two is great. If you like season one, you will enjoy season two just as much.

People who talk about the \\"WORST (or BEST) ever, in history, etc. are either very young or use extremes for discription. Unfortunately that is the trend in this country. I have the first set and will get this one. The reason it is 4 stars is the constant confusion at HQ, with traitors, personal relations, and temper tantrums to a degree NO organization (much less national security) could ever permit. I wonder how long the series can continue--by using \\"superman\\" plots it is hard to keep coming up with something the audience will accept.

The acting and writing are both terrific. Novel idea, suspenseful plot with interesting and realistic characters, beautiful transfer, sound.Cons: Loses focus, badly cast supporting roles, not enough ideas to go around, Plot holes and side tracks! A few stumbles, the time laps seems impossible such as jack and many characters doing many things in 1 hour, which is impossible in our real society today.To me, I found that 24 season 1 is far much better than 24 season 2. But despite that, Overall, I would give it a 4.8 for 24 season 1 and 4.3 for 24 season 2!"},{"rating":"1","title":"horrible","review":"horrible quality, doesn't work with the amazon downloader thingy and when i hit full screen half the screen is black lines.. ridiculous"},{"rating":"1","title":"Dont waste your time","review":"The DVD is garbage along with the show.

This season presents a terrifying plot: a nucleur bomb that is planned to be detonated in Los Angeles. This was a terrifying plot: I actually live there! The plot runs smoothly and presents situations that are fairly believable -- and some not. For instance, the series presents an interesting twist: one is likely to think that the Arab is going to be the principal terrorist, but by the end of the show, it is someone else. I was quite surprised, and although I wouldn't likely have written the series this way, it still maintained the high standards that were present in the first season. Every episode is a thrill."},{"rating":"2","title":"husband addicted","review":"My husband says this is the 2nd best gift he every got (Ipod 40gb is still #1).

It seems that all the plot twists are very logical and this wasn't always the case in the first season. Also, I liked the fact the Jack Bauer' family is not involved as much as during the first season, especially his daughter. And again, great acting."},{"rating":"2","title":"Quality television for the adreniline junkie.","review":"Fans of season one wondered how the creative team behind \\"24\\" could out do themselves in season two. One nuclear warhead later, that question was satisfied.Jack Bauer, a recluse since the finale of season one, gets a call from now President Palmer. He needs Bauer to thwart a reported terrorist threat. Jack reluctantly rejoins CTU to get the ball rolling. It's another long day for the most dedicated law enforcement professional on the planet. Fortunately, he dies for a few seconds to get some rest.The storyline with daughter Kim stretches the imagination to the breaking point. And, the fact that President Palmer and Jack Bauer never actually are in the same room together never seems to matter.If possible, a stronger season than the first."},{"rating":"2","title":"Yowza","review":"I didn't think season 1 could be topped. I was wrong. What an amazing show. The premise is pretty simple: a nuclear bomb is going to go off and Jack Bauer has been been called upon to stop it. From there it's a thrill ride of twists and turns until you get to the end. You will NOT be able to watch one episode at a time. In particular, I would highly recommend that you not begin watching the 4th disc unless you have a 4 hour block of time to watch everything.

It could not be more fitting. While somewhat convoluted, the story drags you in and it's HARD to stop letting go. Kiefer Sutherland is back in the second season here and in his first 5 minutes back at CTU he shocks you. Kim's back too, though her stories and adventures are shall we say...a lil more convoluted than what is happening with terrorists and nukes...nonetheless, you still can't stop watching. It's one long roller coaster ride and very worth watching.I think a great drinking game can be made outta this series...whenever Jack tortures someone, shoots someone, or yells, you ought to take a shot...You would prob be drunk by the first episode. Or everytime Kim gets kidnapped. All kidding aside, this is a fantastic show...worthy of space on your DVD shelf."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than Season 1","review":"Season 2 of 24 was incredible. As much as I enjoyed Season 1, I though Season 2 was even better. Kiefer Sutherland is sensational as Jack Bauer. Jack Bauer is a complex character and Kiefer Sutherland plays him brilliantly. He at first seems like a machine - and then you see the softer side - mind you not for long.Season 2 had me on the edge of my seat from start to finish. Season 3 and 4 were terrific also.

The balance between graphics and text makes Winning the Vote accessible to young readers as well as adult readers.

This is not a quick-read, but rather a book you keep close at hand (on our coffee table)to read, if only for a few minutes at a time, to appreciate the dedication of Susan B. Anthony, Elizabeth Cady Stanton and the many lesser known women who dedicated their lives to the suffrage movement.This is, not just a highly informative book, but its color and black and white reproductions make it a pleasure to read and hard to put down.

Lead sheet by itself doesn't cause any health problems. It's only when you eat it or breathe particles released from grinding or cutting that cause an issue. As an acoustics engineer, we use lead sheet all the time as a means of adding mass damping to ductwork to reduce flow noise. It's cheap and can be formed to complex shapes pretty well. In a car, this stuff would be most effective in adding mass to large body panels (doors, trunk floors, etc.) to reduce the amount of external road noise getting into the car. All they've done here is package it in a convienent form with adhesive backing and added a hefty markup."},{"rating":"1","title":"Made of lead!","review":"The thing comes with a warning about installation procedures as it has a literal layer of lead on the thing!

Maybe it does a great job, but, I still ain't sticking no lead sheet in the cabin of my car!So, what I'm going to do is, get a non-lead heat shield from a a heat shield company, like maybe Heatshield Products.

That said, \\"The Heat Is On\\" shows the Isleys as a full-strength, self-contained unit, with breathtaking soul harmony, hard funk riffs on \\"Fight The Power\\" (how shocking it was as a 13-year-old to hear \\"bulls--t\\" coming from my 8-track player) and three songs on (what used to be) side two as gorgeous and sensual as any soul sides ever released.

This recording is so fresh because the performers put something of themselves into the music, sometimes taking artistic license to the extreme, to create a very fun, relaxing, exciting collections of songs. The addition of percussion to the normal quartet of winds makes an energetic rendition out of some normally trite songs. The journey of styles created in Bouffons is worth the the cost alone but the almost Jimmie Buffet second half of Lilliburlero has your foot tapping against your will. The boisterous and very macho Follow Me Up to Carlow will put hair on your chest while the nearly tribal drumming in Pastimes With Good Company pushes that traditional Holiday oldie to a new level.My children LOVED this recording and I had to get a second copy so I could have my own.

This book is a real danger to those young in their faith walk. And it is yet another book on religious things Jesus himself spoke against. If one is to believe some of the things this authors states, then it is doing what Paul warns us about in trusting false doctrine. YES I SAID FALSE!

Although classical pundits might snub the work because its vocalist is known primarily for her popular music, what such vapid haughtiness fails to appreciate is that music is a transaction between composer and singer. As a performing arts major in college, what I take for granted that others may not realize is that upon receiving input and feedack from either a director or conductor, a sensitive rendering of either a play's character or piece of music is best left up to the TALENT of the performer! Otherwise, rather than receiving a holistic portrayal, an audience is liable to witness imitation rather than artistic interpretation. Withal, although many can be \\"classically trained,\\" only a few have a genuine gift."},{"rating":"1","title":"They killed it","review":"I love this album, but what a disappointment this remaster is. Thirteen Grammys and you brought up tons of noise, hiss and it sounds eons worse than the original CD/first re master? The quieter sections are unlistenable through the hiss. And they used so much compression that the whole thing sounds flat and devoid of any air. That pure pristine voice often sounds distorted and like it is oversaturating the microphones. What was once beautiful music sounds like it is drowning in thick midrange soup. Bad. I can't believe Barbra approved it. She should pull all the copies, fire the engineer and start all over. Boo (literal) hiss."},{"rating":"1","title":"A for effort, C for execution","review":"One does have to applaud Barbra for the effort, for showing that she really does care about music, not just her own. Everyone knows about her forays into pop, rock and even disco. Alas, while her voice is lovely, it seems more like an album of lullabies than classical lieder. She actually did a more authentic classical performance of a Schubert song on her TV special \\"Barbra Streisand and Other Musical Instruments.\\" Alas, this serious effort never comes close to showing the range of her voice that she played with in that 2 1/2 minute song. A missed opportunity."},{"rating":"1","title":"why pay again when the original was good enough","review":"The original album was great and I've already reviewed its faults. However, here I am reviewing the addition of two new songs. \\"An Sylvia\\" by Schubert was never a great lieder. It was and still is a butter-churning piece of mediocrity. Even La Streisand cannot raise it to a new level. There WAS a reason it was left off the original album. \\"Auf dem Wasser zu singen\\", also by Schubert, didn't make it either, and the reasons are very evident to those who care to listen: it's dreary.So, buy Classical Barbra Remastered only if you value the remastering process.

Give it a rest.It's obvious that Barbra is not trying to be Elisabeth Schwarzkopf or Joan Sutherland here. She is singing HER interpretation of these songs with her own instrument, which is a thing of great natural beauty. In fact, she is just doing what she's done her entire recording career; to sing straight from her heart. If you can't appreciate that then just skip it.That said, I do wish that she could have done more takes on a couple of the songs where her diction and some notes sound a bit muddy and strained. But overall I think this is a wonderful album that is a joy to listen to on a quiet evening."},{"rating":"1","title":"A curious effort","review":"She sounds so beautiful at times on these songs, you don't notice at first that she doesn't seem to know exactly how to properly interpret them. She seems afraid or in awe, and it sounds like she sang them in pieces. Plus, she affects exactly the same tone for every song. I couldn't help but wish that, at the time, she could just have gotten over herself and called someone like Leonard Bernstein and allowed him to guide her. If she had been able to do that, this album could have been great. As it is, I label it a curiosity."},{"rating":"2","title":"Barbra has great versatility!","review":"I was a little skeptical when I received this album as a gift, but not any more!!!

Best Streisand gift I have received. Only 1 complaint, album is not long enough."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Exquisite Beauty","review":"I admittedly had my doubts before coming into this album. I had wondered if Barbra's voice was capable of handling classical material written for classically-trained vocalists, but as she so often did in the early-mid 70's Barbra took this material and made it her own. Her voice is angelic, soothing, and the arrangements are simply gorgeous.Excellent album. One of her very best achievements."},{"rating":"2","title":"Classical Barbra","review":"Barbra S is no Callas or Sutherland but this record is very pleasant listening.

The product I had recieved was not what the description said it was. Still I decided to give it a chance because I am a huge Placebo fan. I'm always looking for more of their music. I've never been a huge fan of remixes, probably because I'm not really a huge fan of techno. Infra-red is definately one of the best songs of Meds. It's fun, catchy and full of energy. It's great to rock out to in the car! The Hotel Persona remix is amazing! They've slowed it down a bit and you can really hear Brain's vocals a lot better. It's darker than the original but still totally full of energy. It's great. I recommend it for any Placebo fan and for anyone who wants to check them out for the first time.

Unlike other translations, it isn't bland is relatively easy to follow. I normally get rid of books that I either have no more use for or don't care much for, but this translation has made it to my bookshelf and is there to stay. I would recommend it to anyone, regardless of whether they're studying Latin."},{"rating":"2","title":"John F.

Pathetic."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not at all like image, item arrived with chain knotted","review":"I have a disappointed little girl who received this for Christmas from her grandma. It arrived in a box with the necklace in a velvet bag, a KNOTTED necklace. So even though she wanted to wear her very special necklace from grandma it had to wait until I had time to unknot it. I attempted to gently unknot the necklace using a pin and even though I used no force the chain still manged to come undone at the clasp. The clasps are incredibly tiny so it is going to be close to impossible to 'fix' this so she can wear it and honestly, if it broke so easily it isn't really sturdy enough for a child to wear. We are terribly disappointed and in no way can I recommend purchasing this item."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice Necklace","review":"I bought this for my 5 year old grandaughter in memory of her dad who was killed in Iraq.

Each chapter is a story that not only introduces fascinating information about these tiny but ubiquitous plants, but makes the entry into their world easy for a non-bryologist, AND leads to deep reflection about life.

Because the viewer laughs at the utter dreck unfolding on the screen. The story is meant as a tear-jerker, but instead inspires primarily groans and guffaws. I pity Mary Tyler Moore: she is a far better actress than the material she was given to work with here. As for Dudley Moore, at least he is not playing a drunk this time.

It is certainly very illuminating to approach structuralism - the movement of synchronity & autonomous discourse - from a diachronic & contextual point of view. To me it was particularly interesting to understand the context in which Foucault emerged, how he used the structural paradigm brilliantly for his own purposes.If you add \\"Jacques Lacan\\" by Elisabeth Roudinesco, you get an excellent take on the (sometimes flamboyant, often narcissistic) characters and institutional battles of the French 20th century intellectual scene (minus Sartre, fortunately).

He's joined by a stellar group of fellow instrumental superstars, guys like Ralph MacDonald, Richard Tee, Bernard Purdie, David Newman, and Jon Faddis.

Instead I found myself reading something that was partly historical fact, partly creative writing, and contained many inaccuracies. In addition to the zipper incident described by another reviewer, the author gave the name of the Adams's oldest daughter as \\"Nabby\\"; it was actually Abigail Amelia. Mercy Otis Warren's brother James is described as leaving for Harvard in 1769, but two paragraphs later there is a statement that her husband, James, \\"graduated from Harvard in 1745,one year after her brother.\\" (p. 97) These three glaring errors made me suspicious of other information as I read through the book.

Instead, some of the chapters are about women that had nothing to do nor had any effect with the founding of our country. The book is dedicated to her young daughters, and, alas, that is the age level this book was written. I love to read about history, but don't like made up conversations or incidents that the author must put into the character's mouths, as she tells the stories in first person. I wish she had stuck to her premise and written about the wives of the men who founded the nation. As a father of four daughters, I seek to see the women's point of view all the time, this just failed in that regard and as other's have said, is meant to inspire young female readers.

Some noname band that was a spin out of Santana was opening. WOW!I had discovered Genesis, Yes, ELP, Camel, Return to Forever, Zappa==the litany of art/jazz and fusion rock bands, but these guys kicked ass like no one I had heard--and since only Steve Morse and the Dixie Dregs have mixed fusion so well with another major influence (latin blues for Journey, southern rock for the Dregs)in my humble opinion.

They had a progressive edge that usually came out of England. This is when musicians could sing, write good songs, and play their instruments. Many of them were classically trained.

The rhythm section is as solid as they come and Neil Schon's solos make the music soar into space (like the album cover)......Kahoutek is a good example of these guys giving it all they got....Aynsley Dunbar can really lay it down.....the vocals on this album are so much less obtrusive than during the Perry phase,,,and Greg Rolie has a good voice to complement this material.......a good balance of vocals to music.........wholeheartedly recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"skunk bait","review":"Did not work at all.

However... don't count on it for a cat... within 5 minutes of opening it my cat had figured out how to dislodge the food cap and get into the area where it comes out.

Otherwise the spot would have to be enlarged by sanding.This think is a thick milky thick liquid. I cut out a narrow flexible plastic strip as the applicator, pour a small drop on a clean sheet, and dip the thing on the spot.

She also makes excellent points that reflect both the problems and solutions of today's culture. Unfortunately, her premise is based upon the sacred prostitute as an ideal archetype of the feminine essence, which limits the value and capacity of the feminine to her willingness to prostitute herself, sacred or not. The author forms words like a feminist, but I'm hard-pressed to believe that true feminism would attempt to narrow the female potential to a role of simply beauty, sensuality, and a single-minded willingness to please the male. I'm afraid the author's enthusiasm for her concept has blinded her to the limitations of the sacred prostitute as an adequate archetype to express the multifacetted potential of the feminine spirit."},{"rating":"2","title":"Taking the profane edge off of sexuality","review":"Our Western culture has evolved to a point of sad and profane sexual disconnection.

Martin Dakin's 'A Sherlock Holmes Commentary' from the early 1970s. It reads like a true biography with all the information drawn from the stories and with no outlandish speculation. All comments are well thought out without conjecture and using evidence within the 56 short stories and 4 long stories. It contains chapters on the early lives of Holmes and Watson, their meeting, their first case together, the years in Baker Street, Professor Moriarty, Watson's marriage, the 'death' of Sherlock Holmes and his return, their final years at 221B, their final years and much more. There is a chronology and a selected bibliography. An essential book for any true Holmes fan. Cannot recommend highly enough."},{"rating":"2","title":"A stellar reference to the kaleidoscope of gang terminology.","review":"This book is an absolute \\"Must Have\\" for anyone needing to learn about the meaning of gang terminology. Included are thousands of terms you've heard, plus thousands you haven't. The \\"slang\\" is referenced against the gang groups that use them, so you're sure not to confuse one gang's terminology w/ another's.

The pics hereare from the 'Lack of Luxury'/'Busted' Era ofmediocore 'Trick. It's nice the great song fromthe vastly underrated 'The Doctor', \\"It's OnlyLove\\" is on this skimpy 10 cut deal, but \\"If YouNeed Me\\", which was a retracked video (and a prettygood one, too) and Busted are way too much 'Bustedoverkill' here. Busted, Woke Up With A Monster andIn Colour get my vote for 'least best' TricksterLPs of alltime. Back 'N Blue and Wherever Would IBe would have been better. The best Cheap Trickrelease of all time is still 'in the can' as theysay. A compilation of both the Doctor and Standingon the Edge, two of their best four LPs of alltime.The other two?

They are built to last with high quality plastic and metal pieces.Unfortunately, I learned about their greatest drawback the hard way. The metal sleeve the lead advances out of does not retract. I always carry pencils in my pocket and I did not know the metal sleeve had poked through my jeans. When I quickly moved my arm across it, the metal sleeve caught my skin and I ended up with a 4 inch rip across my forearm. The scar is slowly healing but my distaste for this pencil never will.If you plan to leave this pencil in a jar next to your desk, it will serve you for years and you will be very happy with it.

The stories are tedious and depressing. The constant argueing is simply irritating - nothing more. The only reason I gave it 2 stars instead of 1 is because the characters of Tyra and Lyla are just so good looking that I couldn't completely hate it. Also, I believe, due to he writer's strike the season ended rather abruptly - in a way I was happy about that because I couldn't stand the sight of \\"Smash\\" anymore nor the near constant stuttering of Matt Saracen and Julie Taylor - I mean give it a break already. Let's hope season 3 is better."},{"rating":"1","title":"A good concept gone wrong","review":"This could have been a good series, but after all the premarital, extramarital and unnatural sex was featured it turned into just another soap opera.

Much of the credit belongs to producer Quincy Jones. He gives the project a polished sheen that ties every song together, but never comes off as sterile. Uptempo cuts (Dinorah, Dinorah) blend seamlessly with ballads (Love Dance). Apart from two instrumentals, Benson doesn't get much solo space. But when he does get to use his guitar chops, it's always in service to the song rather than a mere display of technique (as in the title track). The high quality of the material doesn't hurt. Rod Temperton wrote half the songs, and they are at least as good as the ones he gave to Michael Jackson. Even the weakest song - \\"Midnight Love Affair\\" - is memorable. Purists are quick to condemn \\"Give Me The Night\\" because it isn't really a \\"jazz\\" album. It's their loss. Whatever happened to the pure enjoyment of music? Pop this in the CD player, dim the lights, get out the Chardonnay, and cuddle up."},{"rating":"2","title":"APT & PITHY ADVICE FOR TEACHERS AND NON-TEACHERS!","review":"Chuck McGuire has compiled pithy bits of sage advice that teachers would do well to heed.

After starting to rewatch the episodes though I'd say that'a bit harsh. He was great addition to the cast that really added a lot as did Hillary Swank as Carly. Much better than next season when it becomes obvious than that the one character that couldn't be replaced is Brandon. I can't give this five stars though as they retreaded the \\"David screws up and gets angry at the world\\" bit one too many times.

The backdrop is Nazi occupied Europe where a young girl flees to freedom. She is haunted by the fact that her parents and their entire village were massacred in a pogram.

For the casual reader who has a layman's interest in American history it's a very accessible view into an often overlooked yet thrilling part of our national chronicle. For the more serious minded it skillfully presents Black Power as a deliberate, complex and multifaceted movement worthy of considered treatment. Like a good drama the cast of characters includes not only spectacular icons like Malcom X and the Black Panthers but also lesser stars like Kwame Toure (Stokely Carmichael) and a host of obscure yet significant figures in supporting roles.

Each story is followed by an instructive analysis of the situation--how the paddlers misjudged the conditions, how they might have avoided equipment failure, what training might have helped the situation, etc. It's all laid out in very practical terms that you could put to use yourself. Amongst the stories are numerous sidebars with more information on techniques and equipment that are also useful, but much drier. My only criticism is that the book has not been updated. Most of the stories are from the mid-eighties and while the principles of kayaking haven't changed, available equipment continues to evolve.

Many well known martial arts masters are featured including:Gozo Shioda (Aikido)Takamiyama (Sumo)Taizaburo Nakamura (Iaido)Sadaharu Fujimoto (Karate)Teruo Hayashi (Okinawa Kobudo)There are also many other Judo, Kendo, Naginata and Samarai sword masters featured. The film takes place in Dojos and outdoors and shows off some of Japan's natural beauty very well. The film also covers some historical areas and a certain amount of the philosophy behind martial arts. What it shows best of all is the dedication and skill required to become skillful in any of these arts. This is an essential purchase for the enthusiatic martial arts student."},{"rating":"2","title":"Intense Martial Artists Only","review":"Are you deep into martial arts? Want a more holistic view?

All you need to know about your horse's muscles, why you need to stretch and in what situations, is in this book. I have never come across something quite so comprehensive and easy to understand in one book before. It has wonderful big glossy colour pictures, spiral bound for easy page turning as well as being able to keep it open on the page you want while trying out some exercises on your horse.I did several relevant stretch exercises on my horse's sore back end, and within a week he was helping to stretch himself and really seemed to enjoy it, closing his eyes, relaxing and wiggling his lips. His lunging work has also become easier as he has become more supple.I especially recommend this book for anyone doing competition work with their horses, as they can become quite tense in certain areas and this book helps to explain and show you how to release the tension. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stretch Exercises for your horses","review":"Stretch Exercises for Your Horse: The Path to Perfect SupplenessNot impressed: while the book looks great and there are lots of good photos, the content is a bit thin. After a couple of times I realize that the information I wanted just was not there. For example, the stretch for adductors which i wanted was 5 lines, but this was after 10 pages of diagrams and pictures of stretches under saddle and with the forelimb. The stretches under saddle are vaque and too general. this could have been so much better had it more content."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I was expecting","review":"I am not a horse trainer, but I have have been training my own horses for 20 years. I was hoping for a book with lots of pictures that I could glance at to visually remind me of what each exercise was. But this is not the book for me. It goes through each body part and gives detailed explanation of how muscles work, then active exercises and then goes to Passive exercises. So if you were wanting to passively stretch the whole horse, you have to keep thumbing through the book. The idea of the active riding exercises is great except she doesn't tell you HOW to achieve them. For example she states that riding the horse with the head and neck \\"Low and round\\" will stretch the topline. That's great, but how do I get the horse to do that. I bought the book because I was having trouble getting this horse to do just that. Overall I have to say I was disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Stretch Exercises for Your Horse: The Path to Perfect Suppleness","review":"Very informative.

It doesn't. The stories are pre-reloaded plot twist, and thus dwell on aspects of the first film without really enlarging them. Some of the artwork is good; so not so good (particularly one story \\"There are no Flowers\\"; the scene where the guy starts to fight matrix style is laughable it's so bad, and a devolution of the artistry of the movies). The first story by the wachowski bros. and geof darrow is a re-tread of the one of the animatrix episodes (history of matrix pt.1). I liked the story \\"Get It?\\" because it was pretty funny.

Once the band left Amphetamine Reptile for Touch & Go, it seemed like they lost focus. Gone was the stunning interplay of heavy, repetitive guitars and inventive drumming.

Also the remote for the machine isn't very reliable ... you can't do short bursts of bubbles ... it's either coming out at full force or not coming out at all.

With control over your own tells, you can harness the power to confuse opponents in to not really knowing if they are getting a real one out of you or not.This book is the best and most extensive choice on the subject of poker tells.

Caro breaks down the basics of poker tells into a handful of simple, powerful rules. I have read this book from cover to cover, taking the time to study the examples. It is full of information and needs to be studied so it sits next to my bed and I review a section every night.I am a Texas Hold'em player but this book covers most casino poker games. Most tells are universal to all games unfortunately the presentation in this book moves through the different games. This is why studying the book over time helps extract the information for the reader.This is a must read book for the serious poker player. You have to take the time to continue learning as you grow as a player. The final thing to do with this book is take what you learn into the poker room. Even just selecting one tell for the night, you will be amazed at how obvious the other players wear their tells."},{"rating":"2","title":"Must have for the beginner!","review":"I purchased this book along with Phil Gordon's 'The Real Deal' as a start to my Poker Library. This was an excellent choice for the beginner!Caro's Book of Poker Tells is a treasure trove of Poker Behavioral information I was immediately able to relate to. Playing amatuer poker, I could recall incidents detailed in the book where I was taken in by many of the tells displayed, and where I had executed them myself. It's an interesting look at how human behavior factors so prominantly into a game of cards.Granted, the photos are dates, and the poker tells cover ALL types of games, which, if you aren't familliar with all styles of poker, it might be confusing. But, the book is formatted in a very easy to reference style, and isn't difficult to apply illustrations using one game to another.This is a definite must for anyone who wants to improve their play as well as understand the psychological element of poker better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Time Has Passed Caro By","review":"Much of the material in this book is dated. The concepts are good, but the situations are outdated. For example, there is a lot of focus on observing how people smoke their cigarettes. Since most poker rooms do not allow smoking today, there is little value to that material. Maybe the book can help you to focus on observing your opponents' behaviour."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not much here","review":"It all boils down to \\"strong means weak, and weak means strong\\". Lots of photos of people sitting at a poker table, padding the size of the book. The photos look like they came from the 1940's. Betting patterns are much more reliable as tells than whether the guy looks at his chips or not."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of money","review":"I should have listened to the other poor reviews and saved my money. This book takes about ten worthwhile (and very obvious) tells, spends a few pages on each explaining what could be summed up in just a few sentences, and then fills out the the book with meaningless other \\"tells\\" and filler. Included are picture that supposedly illustrate the book's points; the only problem being that most pictures are so dark and unhelpful that they only serve as additional filler to turn this flimsy piece into book length. I had to laugh when looking at an unfocused picture, clearly from the '70s, of a man wearing dark glasses -- completely obscuring his eyes. The book advises your to observe how he is shifting his eyes to the side to watch his opponent -- pretty bad stuff.You can spend ten minutes googling \\"poker tells\\" and get far better advice than what this book provides."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the top 5 albums of all time","review":"This album defines beauty. An integral part of the slowcore/minimalist movement of the 90s. \\"Bunch\\" by itself pays for the cost of the album. Every plucked guitar note has a purpose and every drum fill has a direction. The musical tapestry that Sooyoung Park and co. create is absolutely breathtaking. There's absolutely no filler track in the entire album! I just wish they'd play Kenya someday..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic!","review":"Every song is great. Drums are fantastic. Sooyoung whispering or screaming sounds great, and many fine melodies on this album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome","review":"Like I said, awesome. Amazing guitars and vocals.

I bought and watched the entire 1st season in less than 2 days. I LOVED it and can't wait to see the full second season! I have gotten many other friends now hooked on it as well. This is a concept I have never seen portrayed in a way such as this, in such a raw and realistic way. I cannot say enough how interesting and intriguing the writers make this and the acting and way it is put together on screen is close to perfect. GREAT GREAT GREAT!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Gets the topic out there","review":"While I agree that some of the aspects of being dissociative are exaggerated in this series, there is a great deal of realism as well. I can see how some multiples might find it offensive and how some may find it great to relate to. Certainly, every multiple is different and every internal system is different. I give kudos for getting the topic out there!I wish Amazon had a release date for this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Humorous and Captivating","review":"I was thrilled to learn that there was a comedy about multiple personality disorders after simultaneously loving and hating Sybil because of the disturbing nature of that book/film. This series is fascinating and reveals a lot about MPD and is such a great idea for a series. The characters are very funny and I really enjoy their facial expressions and witty quips. The writing is very creative. It's intriguing to watch a female character have a male personality come out and wreck havoc in her life. Hope this series stays around for a while. There is a lot they could do with it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Crazy and Unabashedly Funny","review":"I love, love, love this little half hour show! You can't get any funnier than Toni Colette changing into all her alters. She is an absolutely wonderful actress and it must be great fun to change into all these characters. Like NURSE JACKIE, this show is quirky and real...it shows raw emotions from the mother who has DID to the husband and children who have to put up with all other personalities that come through. This makes for some hilarious and poignant moments."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just Sad","review":"I really wanted to like the show, the acting is nice, I suppose, but the situation is just too abusive for the children, for me to find it amusing in the least.These things don't usually bother me, but the teen daughter is carrying morning after pills, instead of being on sane birth control, and the parents have little interest in addressing this. Very serious issues are overlooked in the cutsie presentation, and I just could not get past that."},{"rating":"1","title":"Seller a complete FAILURE FOR Amazon.","review":"Have filed a complaint with Amazon.

The cast is perfectly matched to their characters, the story line isn't predictable, and I can't tell you how glad I am that finally, a series doesn't insult my intelligence. However, since it is so good in every way, I'm afraid that it will be snatched from the air and replaced with some game show.

Everything started off great until season three, the season would jump, freeze, etc...We had purchased season three again. Everything was going along fine UNTIL season ten---jump, freeze, and then it would turn itself off! We are holding our breath for the rest of the seasons. This was a very expensive mistake.

The book is organized in a very direct, coherent, and distinctive way. The main ideas are clearly illustrated and supported and the chapters are arranged in a sequential manner. The book is divided into 10 different chapters with an appendix and a glossary. I absolutely loved the oral interpretation class I had and we used this text. The book augmented all the things our professor taught us and it was a great tool and makes for a nice reference for the future (especially if I ever do some professional storytelling or when I have to teach a high school speech class)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Redundant if you have other knititng reference books","review":"The tips and \\"trade secrets\\" in this book were nothing I had not read before in other basic knitting books.

Probably would be good if you are a new knitter and only have $10 or so to spend."},{"rating":"1","title":"not for machine knitters","review":"This book is really not worth it for machine knitters. (I hand knit, too, and I'm still not convinced it's worth owning a copy!)

The receiver itself is fantastic and gets 5 stars from me. This home kit, however, is the biggest waste of money.I don't live in a rural area. I don't live in a heavily congested area. I don't have an abundance of trees in my yard. What I have is a normal home in a normal town in a normal state. But for some reason, I can't get a steady signal from this home kit.I'm constantly running around my house with the antenna in my hands trying to get a signal so that I can listen to my programming. Time of day is not a factor. It happens in the morning, afternoon and evening.Please do some research to see if there's an alternate antenna or home kit that would work for you.

Don't get me wrong,this stuff is Potent and will burn your hands if you are not carefull but it has no smell. And what is point of it if you don't get that classic Cinnamon scent? Only Cinnamon Bark oil will give you that. Compared to Cinnamon Bark Oil you can't smell this stuff.

I tried 3 different boxes, sealed, enough space, good wood. I didn't expect an 8 to sound like a larger sub, but this was bad. If you have the capacity, go with a 12 and custom build your box (5/8\\" presswood or plywood) air tight if you have to. The building materials cost about 25 dollars. For a small, single cab truck like I have (Toy, Tacoma), a 12\\" shallow mount(slim set) Pyle 1200w/600RMS went in well giving me enough leg room (6 ft tall). Don't buy their cheaper subs or amps, read online reviews if you want to see for yourself. An average price of a decent to good subwoofer is between 50-100 dollars, give or take. You get what you pay for. If you want to skip research on finding for a good amp at a good price, go with the Kenwood KAC-7204. All good reviews.

Their husband cheats on them and verbally abuses one of the wives. The women are submissive and pathetic. I was so angry, that I couldn't even finish this book. As for the historical fiction aspect of the book, it wasn't anything out of the ordinary. If you are looking for a bible story where women are treated like animals, this is the book for you. If you are looking for a historical perspective on the time period, this is not the right book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just OK","review":"It starts out OK -- along the lines of a torrid biblical romance. But once Samuel grows up, the story falls apart. The romance becomes far-fetched and rambling. This book is OK as a time killer -- no worse than a soap opera, and better for you than raiding the cookie jar. But it is eminently forgettable. If you're looking for something substantial or thought- provoking -- this book isn't it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Small Comfort for those with Infertility","review":"Etzioni-Halevy weaves a clever tale based on the Biblical account of Hannah. However, considering that Hannah is one of the primary sources of Biblical comfort for those struggling with infertility, it's disappointing that the author infers that Hannah's barrenness was punishment for her fictional betrayal of Pninah. It's too bad that, in this book, Hannah couldn't just be infertile without it being retribution for her crime. It's a slap in the face for anyone struggling with infertility to suggest that it's their own fault. If you are looking for comfort through the story of Hannah in this book, don't bother."},{"rating":"2","title":"In the beginning...","review":"For a comprehensive view of the beginning of religious traditions ins four spiritual centers--Greece, Middle East, India, China--this is it.

I suffered through 3/4 of it before calling it quits...","review":"I've read many books by Ms. Armstrong and enjoyed them all. However, this one was unbearable. At times it seems as if she were trying too hard to write an historical adventure novel, especially when she endeavors to visualize from a third-person perspective what it must have been like to be present at the start of each of the great \\"transformations\\". It was like pulling teeth to get through each chapter. I've rarely, if ever, given up on a book that I've invested so heavily in. Reading the unabridged literal translation of the Nag Hammadi Scriptures was more invigorating."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice luxury","review":"Love the refreshing flavor; not as weird as it sounds. As a dental hygienist, I noticed this has more fluoride than our American brands. This may be good for adults who drink so much ( non fluoridated) bottled water.

I find whitening mint to be a little strong at first, but effective for removing light staining on teeth. Jasmine mint is very nice and light, also somewhat feminine. The reason I didn't give it a 5 star review is one simple fact: my breath smells horrible within an hour or so of using. My husband even told me my breath was bad (he's not one to typically say such things). Not my usual Colgate Total.

Her working with Rupert Holmes was certainly one of the better things she has done (and a shame she hasn't recorded another album with him since - pls note Streisand fans - that Barb's second B'way album had to be with him and she recorded several songs in 1988 - including a gorgeous \\"How are things in Glocca Mora\\"). \\"Lazy Afternoon\\" is such a well chosen song project that Barbra can still sing contemporary material and yet not sacrifice herself in the process. Mostly ballads, laidback, beautifully arranged are sung like all us Barbra fans dream of. \\"Moanin low\\" brings back memories of the younger Streisand (and make us wish she should pick more material like this she can belt out!). A really lovely album, though it is sometimes forgotten when Streisand's major albums are mentioned."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nope.","review":"This album really doesn't work. I've been a life long Babs fan and have most of her records. The gap in my collection is most of her 1970's output. I recently purchased this on amazon because I hadn't heard it in a long while and read some of the positive reviews. So I played it a couple of times and realized it's just as bad as I remember it. For me, the only songs that work are Lazy Afternoon, which is really superb; Moanin' Low is fun, but suffers from a clunky arrangement; and A Child Is Born, which I have always enjoyed.I think that Barbra was in a state of confused musical identity during much of the 1970's and was really grasping at straws for most of the decade. This album suffers from sub-standard material and really crappy arrangements. Why, oh why did she waste her time with Rupert Holmes??????? Most of the album is a throw away, in my opinion. I think that Stoney End and The Way We Were studio album are her two best from that era."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lazy Afternoon by Streisand","review":"This company is a RIPOFF!

It was time to replace it and this seemed like a newer model of the one I had previously. The big problem with this one is that it overheats after no more than 10 minutes of use and then automatically shuts down. This makes it virtual unusable as it barely stays on long enough to vacuum a single room. I now use my Miele upright instead which I recommend over this. Too bad because I really liked my old Eureka."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not that great","review":"Mostly OK, but dissapointed in the cord.

With this lashup the TiVo would not change the channels on the receiver using the TiVo remote.Also, the TiVo remote was IR line-of-sight causing us to run long serial and/or IR lines to from the receivers to the TiVo unit, and we could not get it to change the channels on the receivers.

If you wish to use the Best quality, it takes your recording capacity to less 20 hrs. And truthfully, the best quality is still less than you'd expect from a digital recording."},{"rating":"1","title":"Would be great if it worked","review":"I bought the Tivo in November, it worked great until the end of December when it began freezing our TV and eventually just died. Fortunately, we did not purchase the life-time service plan because it would not have been transferred to our replacement Tivo. Also, to exchange the Tivo we were expected ship the defective Tivo back to California (from Boston) at our own expense.If your cable service offers an on-demand option, I highly recommend it above Tivo. The customer service is better, it is more reliable and it does pretty much all the same stuff."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't do it with Tivo","review":"The idea is great. The execution from TIVO is just that, an execution. It would have been less painful to be shot quickly than to go through dealing with their \\"service\\" issues. Dial in and get an \\"expected wait time 25 minutes\\". Please. Then the pitch about \\"if you had gone to our website\\". Well I had already. Everyone I spoke with was rude and condescending. This company won't be around long because other companies provide better DVR's and service.The warranty is the next biggest joke. You have to give them either $99 or $149 if your unit breaks, which it did, and they send you a rebuilt with a 30 day warranty. You can't buy a brand new one for $150, that has a warranty, and use your current subscription service.Don't use their product our service. I suggest you use another provider or your cable service."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great concept but terrible execution","review":"I have had my Tivo for about a year and I have had problems with the screen freezing and skipping. I loved it and think the concept is great but only if it would be dependable. If you go to the tivo community website which has a link from tivo.com, you will see that there are hundreds of people with the same problem. I have done the same things that people have suggested; unplug the unit for 2 minutes; replace the disk; I'm now at the point that the new disk worked great for a few months but just got stuck staying at the screen that says \\"Tivo starting up\\" which makes it unusable."},{"rating":"1","title":"DO NOT BUY A TIVO PRODUCT!","review":"After 6 weeks of use, our Tivo unit is DEAD.

We asked if they could just send the new one right away since we just bought this 6 weeks ago and it shouldn't be broken, and the rep said, and I quote \\"You can do two things. You can keep a broken unit or do this my way.\\"Okay, so to sum up: the unit is broken, unrepairable after 6 weeks. Their customer service has NO toll-free number. We were on hold for over a half an hour. Then we spoke to an extremely rude rep.

The two I have, this and another have acted flaky occasionaly, but it was usually assosiated with one of there updates. It is slower recently, but still very useable. The only hardware issues I have either fixed themself or on one occasion I realized that I was baking my tivo in my entertainment center(oven) it needs room to breathe, especially if you have a crappy comcast cable box near it, the two create a lot of heat, just make sure its not enclosed or near a heat vent.

They \\"insist\\" that it's all harmless and anonymous, but there's no verification of that, and when money's involved (they sell your information) I think TiVo users should be cautious. You supposedly can opt out, but it's offensive to think that you are opted in to their data collection unless you choose otherwise. I wouldn't let my refrigerator tell Kraft Foods what I'm eating, and I won't let my video players tell anyone what I'm watching in the privacy of my own house.

I called Tivo and because it's not under waranty I'm going to have to pay $100 + shipping and wait 3 weeks to get a refurbished unit. My suggestion, see if the store your buying it from has an extended warrenty and GET IT. Don't even think twice about it. I now regret not getting mine from where I bought it. I'm very disappointed in Tivo with the quality of this unit. With reading reports that this has happened to other people, I'm pretty disgusted right now."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Power TO Plan Your Hours","review":"Often I am not home, working over time, spending time with friends and family and the like. What makes TIVO so great is it helps you to compress your TV watching time by allowing TIVO to record your TV shows while your out, when you do get home and have time finally to sit down and watch your favorite TV shows, for me this is late Friday or over the weekend I can power watch my shows, fast forwarding past all of the commercials and garbage news updates right to the part I want to watch and if I happen to want to keep a copy of any of the shows I can tell my TIVO to save the program to tape.TIVO also makes it easy to track and record all of you favorite TV shows, the options seem endless with this awesome DVR.To get more out of life and your time you need a TIVO."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Tivo!","review":"I snickered when my boyfriend brought home a Tivo for the house thinking it would sit unused and be just another gadget. Was I ever wrong. Now, I don't think I could live without it. A slight exaggeration, but it's become relied upon. It records shows we usually watch if we're not home if we program it to, or if we've given a show a thumbs up. Tivo will record shows it thinks we'll like - and many we do. I will actually praise Tivo aloud as if it were a member of the family - \\"Good Tivo!\\" when it's recorded something I liked.The channel and show guide feature beats any I've seen and we can scroll ahead days to see what's on, and search for shows by name to record in the future.If you purchase a Tivo, you won't regret it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Can't Live Without It!","review":"Tivo is the greatest thing that has happened since DVD's! Get a season pass to record all of your favorite shows and then you can save them to a tape!

Also, does not record HDTV signals yet with cable, only satelite-great... . that's just great.Needless to say, if you've spent any decent money on a TV with good picture quality, you'll have wasted your money on it if you watch any signal through Tivo.

The technical support number wait is approx. 30-60 minutes long.

It will become as ubiquitous as TV itself. It has revolutionized how my family watches TV. We watch what we want, when we want to. We never miss anything we want to see. If the baby cries during a show, we just pause it and resume later. Miss a really good play? Rewind and watch it again - everything you are watching is being recorded, so you can rewind and see it immediately. You can rewind/fast forward/pause while watching or recording. The most important thing about Tivo is that it is ridiculously easy to use. It's not like programming a VCR. It's as simple as browsing the onscreen guide (same as you do with cable), and pushing the record button when you see a show you want. You can even tell it to record all episodes of a show - and it know which ones are reruns and which are new episodes. Everyone that visits our house leaves wanting a Tivo - it sells itself."},{"rating":"2","title":"TiVo 80Hr review","review":"It will change the way you view TV. The best feature is the user interface, ease of use and the recording of all live TV so you can stop whenever and never miss anything. The 80 hours is a little misleading since this is at the lowest quality, which you will not want. I use medium quality and this works fine for almost everything. At that level you get between 50-60 hours. not a problem since it's easy to delete old stuff. They did a great job with he interface."},{"rating":"2","title":"Change your viewing habits for the better","review":"I always thought that Tivo would be way out of my budget until I talked to a friend of mine who had it. It's actually quite affordable, and totally worth the money. I watch a few shows religiously, so I was always setting my VCR--and that worked okay, but I would always find myself with a couple different tapes, not knowing what show was on which tape. Tivo has completely solved that problem. I set it to tape my shows, and it does, and then instead of piles of mystery tapes, my shows are catalogued on the hard drive, so I just click on the one I want to watch and delete it when I'm done. Or, if it's a must-have episode, I can record it to the VCR. That's why I love my Tivo--but there are a million other great features: season passes, tivo suggestioned viewings, not to mention the ability to fast-forward through commercials and pause live-TV!Yay Tivo!"},{"rating":"2","title":"suicide girls rock !","review":"I loved this DVD !

So I bought this double cd set and sat down to listen to it--YUCK! All the mastering and cleaning has nearly sucked the life out of old Bobby. What's more, the version of \\"Too Much of Nothing\\" they've given you here is just plain insipid (as opposed to the more \\"Dylan-esque\\" version on the bootleg). You need to own these recordings, but you'd be better off going somewhere else to get them.

However, we get no lyrics and the photographs are pretty shoddy which is a shame. 4/5."},{"rating":"1","title":"How anyone in their right mind can compare this to Blonde...","review":"...on Blonde, I don't know. One is a fully realized landmark album recorded with the best studio talent in Columbia's Nashville division backing a genius songwriter at the height of his career. The other is a collection of half-written joke songs recorded who knows where by a painfully average tour band backing a guy who sounds half drunk and bored. And, as others have pointed out, glomming a bunch of lame Band songs onto this mess is both commercially fraudulent and artistically reprehensible. As a bootleg it was mildly amusing. As a commercial release it's an insult.Don't believe the hype on this one. If you're a Dylan fan, you already know how worthless this stuff is. But if you're just starting to work your way through his albums, save your money here. You aren't going to find a continuation of the '65-'66 albums. What you'll find is the beginning of a long period of serious suckitude only broken in 1975 w/Blood on the Tracks."},{"rating":"2","title":"With My Very Best Friends","review":"Truly an album of friends. Nowhere in the Dylan canon is there anything approaching the affinity he had with the Band.

The result is so pleasing: 46+ minutes worth of fun I call \\"The Only-Bob Basement Tapes.\\" It's way better than often skipping to his stuff track-to-track anyway -- Bob Dylan's \\"stuff\\" being just too magical to always sit alongside The Band's studio takes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Under-appreciated Bob and the Band","review":"this was hard to get ahold of - a shame, because it's a must-listen"},{"rating":"1","title":"Return product service","review":"Delivery of my product was prompt,unfortunately it wasn't the product I wanted.

BUT, the one I had did not have PLASTIC BLADES!!! It says on the box that they are metal, and one is. But the disc it grinds against is plastic so you are grinding tiny shards of plastic into the food with each turn of the handle. With the knowledge nowadays of the dangers of ingesting plastic, this is ridiculous. The idea is great; the execution is not only flawed, it is dangerous. I returned it as soon as I opened it.

I'm giving it 2 stars because, honestly, it does that and does it well. But, if you'd like to actually feed your developing infant more than mushy bananas AND spend money on something that won't break in a few months, then spend a little more and buy a real food mill. You can make a variety of baby foods with a variety of textures that will get your child through every stage of feeding, and you can then use it for years and years after to make mashed potatoes, homemade tomato sauce, etc. If you still don't believe me, ask yourself this question... \\"Why is this product so cheap when so many others are far more expensive?\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"awkward to use, only works on very soft food","review":"This mill is too weak to puree anything but the softest of foods, and it's much easier and faster just to mash those with a fork. For anything of any substance (including very well-cooked broccoli, very well-cooked carrots), the mill just pushes the food down and extracts liquids and I end up using the Cuisinart instead. Also, the design is such that it is very easy to spill food all over the counter as you attempt to remove/add food to the mill. I've had this food mill for 5 months, hoping to use it every day, but have found it so disappointing I have only used 3 or 4 times. Definitely a waste of money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mix foods with cottage cheese","review":"A tip - we mix whatever we're having for dinner, and if it's too dry or doesn't grind well, we add some cottage cheese. It helps it go through the grinder, and makes it stick together so it's easier to handle the food.I notice one review found the unit hard to disassemble. It *is* a little confusing at first (you unscrew the knob at the top and the crank fits on a spline, which is counterintuitive), but once you get the hang of it I found it to be straightforward. We have never bought any baby food (have you ever tasted that stuff?) and always gave our daughter what we were having, including all the spicy stuff! Now she is a great eater and shies away from very few foods."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just okay","review":"This grinder was recommended to me, but I have to say I find it frustrating to use. Juice leaks out the bottom when grinding steamed vegetables or juicy fruit, and grinding some things (e.g., green beans) takes a lot of force. While the price is fine, the high cost of \\"shipping and handling\\" to purchase one unit made me angry; had I noticed before I bought it, I wouldn't have! Since then I've noticed that this is sold at most local grocery stores."},{"rating":"2","title":"Decent product","review":"This food mill is useful for \\"soft\\" food items.

It turns out not much useful. Big chunk of food did not go through."},{"rating":"1","title":"Baby Food Mill","review":"I have used baby food mills before when all 4 of my children were babies, a different brand. This product was a big disappointment and did not work well at all. The top grinding piece is plastic (not metal) and was very difficult to process the food through. On anything other than soft vegetables, I had to often ask someone to help by pressing down on the cylinder while I turned the handle. It has no gasket at the bottom of the cylinder and any liquid would run all over the counter. I would not recommend this mill to anyone, it was a waste of money, I quit using it after a week."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mills with plastic grinding plates don't work.","review":"\\"Food mill\\" generally refers to a product that can make babyfood out of anything by grinding it up. However, some of the newer mills have a plastic grinder plate like this one (the description and picture are misleading), which means it cannot grind meat or anything harder than canned pears. I couldn't even grind up a ravioli with it. I think most people buy this particular product by accident or because they don't know better.It's come to my attention that KidCo still has the original kind of food mill which I think they call a \\"food grinder.\\" Anyway, don't buy this or the Sprouts version- Baby food mills are AWESOME, as long as you get a real one with a metal plate (grinder now I guess) that will actually make whatever you're eating for dinner into dinner for baby too."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ineffective, difficult to use, useless","review":"Used a mill when I raised my son in the 70's, so purchased this for my granddaughter. Found this mill ineffective in grinding anything beyond a banana. Body of item is difficult to push down, and basically a 2 person operation...you push and I'll grind! Blade section is also difficult to remove to insert more food or take apart for cleaning. Frustrates me every time that I use it. Only good feature is that food with liquid does not leak from the bottom. I would NOT recommend this product even though it is reasonably priced."},{"rating":"1","title":"not what i hoped for","review":"it may work for soft over cooked items, for which one could use a potatoe masher. for more fiberous veggies, for which one would actually need a mill, it's a useless plastic failure."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible!","review":"This product was advertised as having a metal grater. However, when I received the product, I found that the grater was actually made of plastic, which made grinding very difficult and even more trouble than it was worth. At times, I felt as though I was using my entire body weight to grind simple foods, such as rice and noodles - even after blending them in my food processor first! In the end, I sent it back. I would highly recommend all interested to avoid this product entirely!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Does not grind well.","review":"When I received the mill it was much smaller than expected and what the picture depicted. I used this twice and am turned off by how dull the blade is. It does not grind up even the softest of foods.

Please just invest in a food processor and skip the cheap route."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great, but leaves some food unused","review":"Took this traveling with us in Europe and it was fantastic, portable and easy to use. The only downside is that after grinding up the food there is a disk of unmashed food left behind. There is no way to get this through the grinder so you always waste part of what you are trying to make.

I will never buy a KidCo Food Mill again!"},{"rating":"1","title":"better than nothing","review":"If you don't have an immersion blender, or food processor, I guess it's okay. But it's almost easier to just mash food with a fork. Or chew it yourself. It wastes a lot of food in the space between the plunger and the grinder. Also, the grinding bit is NOT SHARP so even with a lot of force applied, you aren't going to be able to grind anything harder than a baked potato. It is a frustrating tool, but it's still a tool, better than nothing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Without stainless strain, doesn't work","review":"I bought one of these 3 yrs ago when my first son was small. This one had a stainless steel blade and strainer. It worked great! Easy to use, disassemble, wash. Then, I lost it and had to get another. The current plastic strainer is VERY difficult to take off of the base, it doesn't grind food well unless it's very soft and it's hard to clean. Overall, the product has gone way downhill as far as quality and ease of use. If the stainless blade were to return, I'd give it 5 stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hard to use, clean & in general, not good.","review":"I broke two of these trying to strain peas & green beans. You really have to over cook/steam the vegetables for this to work well. My friend who has to puree her daughter's food for the rest of her life recommended the bullet. I've been using it & it's the best so far. More expensive but i also use it for myself(chopping onion & smoothies). It's also about the same size of this food mill that's hard to use. My son is 18 months now & I still make his apple sauce with the bullet that I've had for about a year now."},{"rating":"1","title":"Kidco food mill","review":"I was excited to start making my own baby food. Unfortunately, this did not live up to my expectations. It was hard to take apart to wash (there seems to be no easy way to get the crank out or detach the rubber ring). It's not like I have a whole lot of spare time to waste. It wasn't good for starting solids as it did not fully mash anything but bananas... and really, a fork can do that. I am throwing this away and just using my blender."},{"rating":"1","title":"Difficult to use","review":"I bought two of these mills to prepare baby food for my daughter. I am very disappointed with them because they require too much strength in order to push and turn at the same time. Some food goes through with ease, but most foods don't. I have found that I would rather use my blender. I am amazed that anyone can put pizza or meat through this thing! I have only tried to put steamed fruits and vegetables through it and have had to work really hard at it. Cranking is easy, the pushing down is difficult."},{"rating":"1","title":"A lot of work...","review":"I got this because I remembered my mother having one. It does work, but it was a hastle to clean and didn't grind through things like the one I remembered. I was disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Helpful tool","review":"I purchased this food mill to make food for my five month old baby girl. I will say that it does work very well for SOME foods but not all. As you can expect, it works great with soft foods such as banana and avocado. It does work with other things such as peas, broccoli, and pears but I found that it still left the food grainy and not smooth enough for my baby who is still eating stage one foods. I had to put those things in the blender to puree them further. I did like that it separated the stings from the sweet potatoes which helped a lot. Overall, I think it was worth the money. You can even put it in a baggy and take it along. Maybe I will use it more once my baby starts stage 2 foods."},{"rating":"2","title":"BabySteps Food Mill does the job","review":"This food mill is adequate for small portions and soft food. Don't try to push the food mill down quickly or you'll pop the strainer/handle assembly out, and definitely don't use stringy foods (like green beans) in it unless you do very small portions.The mill does NOT come with an instruction manual. Apparently that's a separate purchase because it also includes recipes. Whatever. The mill itself is intuitive to use and comes apart easily for cleaning.I'd recommend this for casual users who just want to whip a little something up at a moment's notice.

Never heard of them before, but they stopped me in my tracks. Truly one of the most concussively powerful, rocking, moments in all of my show experience. I managed to close my mouth after another song or two, bought the cd from the tour table, and after all these years, this cd resides in my 'top 50 fave' booklet. I believe this is the best example of their musical vision.Oh, Quicksand and Helmet were great that night, too."},{"rating":"2","title":"Caution- Ear Plug Zone Ahead","review":"This is the first CD of GVSB I ever had, and i have to admit, the first time i played i was shaken by the way the two bass players mixed their heavy, rocking sound with the keyboard, the guitar, and drums. From Eli Janney's astounding distorted bass just filling my ears with sound, to Alexis Fleisig's impressive drum technique, i was riveted. Scott McCloud's scratchy, low singing is a feast for the ears and goes perfectly with the mood swings that exist in this CD. Johnny Temple's melodic tones as he crams his bass to the max really touched me. Their live show only accentuates them, blowing you into the wall with a tangible wall of sound. For anyone contemplating this CD, get it. It is a sound investment and you won't be disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good place to start","review":"This was the first album i ever bought by GVSB, having heard only one song by them previously. I had no idea what to expect. I now consider this not only one of the best albums by GVSB, but also one of the best albums I have ever heard. After buying this, I went out and bought three more GVSB albums within a week. Since I didn't have a job at the time, that was a big deal for me. This album has a very dark, mysterious mood. McCloud's vocals combined with the bass-heavy approach and Fleisig's drumming create a sound you won't ever forget. If you have never listened to GVSB before, I recommend you start with this one. If you already have a different GVSB album, this should be the next album you buy"},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointed","review":"I ordered this for piano for my 8yr old grandaughter.

There are 2 chapters on performance prediction: one covering extrapolation (known as TCA) and one covering modeling (Indy).The problems this book attempts to address are not easy; solving them requires a lot more than a tools overview. The chapter on extrapolation is misleading, implying that you can focus on a single metric, and not explaining prediction involving multiple metrics. The chapter on modeling is very unsatisfactory: they show off this cool looking tool (Indy) but never explain where to get it from."},{"rating":"1","title":"I have to agree","review":"I have to agree with other people's reviews. At first I pulled an impulse buy and picked it up for the Spiderman styling. Within 1 week the side of my index fingers were raw from the screw placement under the handles. There's an edge where the screw enters that rubs your fingers raw. It also gets a little slick when you've been playing a while. I didn't find any use for the slow-mo button either. It just paused my game over and over. I ALSO had problems needing to smash the buttons in after a while. I figure mine lasted about 1 1/2 months before I chucked it.

The dolls are very difficult for her to dress. We have to do it for her. Also, two of the dresses have torn already after playing the game only about 4 times. She loves the game and the princesses, and it does teach memory, but it could be made much better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Crowns and Gowns Game Review","review":"Twice I gave this board game as a gift this holiday season, and my own 5-year-old daughter received it as a gift. While the idea of the game seems good, there seems to be some misleading print on the box. It indicates that the prinesses will be getting ready to meet Prince Charming at the ball, but there is no Prince Charming included in the game pieces--much to the dismay of my daughter! My biggest complaint about this game, however, is with the gowns and accessories the princesses wear as they move about the board. The straps of the dresses are very thin, and my daughter has broken three of the four gowns. She has also broken two crowns and the strap on one purse. My daughter plays with the rubber Polly Pocket things as well, and she has not torn/ripped any of those items, which makes me think the Crowns and Gowns items aren't made as strongly."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a beating of a game!!","review":"My daughter who is about to turn 4 loves this game. She wants to play it constantly. So it's good for their entertainment value but bad for yours. The dresses are hard to get on the dolls and they rip and tear very easily. It takes as long to set the game up as it does to take it. There are also some sketchy directions such as rolling the dice but not having to go as far as the die say but you can't go over that numbers i.e. you roll a 4 but you only want to go 3 spaces then that's allowed. That's confusing when you're trying to teach your kids their numbers and how many spaces to go but otherwise you'd be rolling the dice forever trying to get to the one spot you're trying to reach."},{"rating":"1","title":"Absolute junk.

The rubber clothes tore, the cardboard parts didn't work as they should have. Don't waste your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the money- too many small pieces!","review":"AGGGH! This toy is too hard to set up- I am sure my 4 year old will not want to take the time to set up the board each time. The board is visually attractive and colorful. The little princesses are cute. BUT the dresses are terrible to put on and off! My little girl could not do it herself! We were playing and she finally said, let's just put away the cards and just add the little things to the princess. I would not give this to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed, not worth the money","review":"Ugh I was so disappointed with this game. The dresses are impossible to put on, and the sleeves ripped. The dolls were tiny and the stands to hold them flimsy. The actual game play is all right, suitable for a three year old but the set up is a pain. This is worth about half the price of what we actually payed for. I'm very disappointed with Disney for this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of money","review":"The concept is great. What little girl wouldn't want to play a game where the goal is to have her dress her princess for the ball. However, the game pieces are horribly made. Two of the dresses have already torn (after only playing with it twice); the crowns don't fit/stay on their heads; and the purse and flowers fall off. This makes for a very frustrated little girl. In addition, the game rules are confusing and the cards are too big for the layout of the board - they get knocked out of place over and over. AND the set up/take down is a nightmare. I am afraid the game is a loss. We will keep the dolls and dresses for maybe another week until they are all torn or lost and then throw the whole thing away. A BIG waste of money and not recommended at all. ~Rebecca"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't WASTE your money!","review":"Simple reprint of an apparently VERY OLD film reel.Both movies were entirely GRAINY all the way through.Well, I should say partially ONLY because I didn'tfinish A Connecticut Yankee In King Arthur's Courtbecause I just couldn't bear the ridiculous poorquality of the movie.

I own a Kohler deep, long (whatever it's called) toilet. Not an uncommon toilet. I needed to buy new bolts for the lid to attach this item. As others have noted, the seat is now at an unsupported angle. Also, it seems like my toddler will hurt himself trying to get it open. The lid can still be opened a good 5 inches.

It works, and the install is easy, but the cheap little set screw they us to lock the arm down striped out right away. Luckily the arm sits in the holder without any problems as of yet. We could always glue it in too.The other annoying thing is the push button to open the toilet. We've seen one without the push button and it worked much better than this one.

The major problem for us was that it really does not hold the seat down with any strength. With the lever tightened down and touching the toilet seat lid, the lid is too easilly lifted against the mechanism. We placed the lock on the toilet and then tried lifting the front of the seat, as a child might. The plastic components at the back of the mechanism bend and twist and allow a gap large enough for a child to be able to place their head through. This kind of defeats the purpose of having a lock. Needless to say we pulled it off right away and have ordered a different kind.Additionally - like others have said, it raises the back of the seat so that it does not sit properly once installed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Solidly constructed, but useless for safety","review":"After installing this toilet lock as directed, I found that the lid could still be opened wide enough for a young child to put in their head and upper-body. Thus, this 'safety device' could then possibly trap the child by making it difficult to pull themselves back out.

It comes with a thick bar that you have to place the toilet seat ON TOP of!

I figured out quickly that if you sit down on the seat a few times, it will break off the hinges of your toilet seat and you'll have to buy a new seat! Whoever thought up this STUPID design did not think it through! From other reviews, I see people have already broken some seats. Sent this back and boughtMommy's Helper Toilet Seat Lid-Lokand I like it a lot better than this one!Note: NO toilet seat lock will give you a super tight seal.

I can't reliably use this telephone in my neighborhood (inside the city). It is embarrassing to get an important call and not get enough reception to have an intelligible conversation. I have talked to T-Mobile, who says, \\"Sorry, we don't make the phones.\\" They are willing to give me $50 off a new phone, but that's off the list price (which nobody pays). The phone is small, but that's about all I can say for it. Wait until the rebate pays you $200 to take it, so you can use the money to terminate your T-Mobile contract."},{"rating":"2","title":"Small but Mighty","review":"I love this phone. Its very compact and easily fits in your pocket, purse or briefcase. It has all of the functions and clairty of the bigger heavier phones, but in a smaller package.

I'm sure if you buy this phone you will be surprising pleased."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy it","review":"I have T-Mobile and got this phone becuase I had previous luck with Motorola flip phones. The first V66 I got would turn off in the middle of a call, even with a strong signal and full battery (not a dropped call or lost signal, it would actually power off and on again without anyone or thing touching the power button). After T-Mobile replaced it, the second V66 was 10 times worse - it shut off during during every call at least once, for no descernable reason - not battery, not SIM card, not signal or usage - it happened in many different places and times and even happened to my husband when he used it. No explanation has ever been given to me for this problem, but I can't wait to get a new phone, and NOT a V66!"},{"rating":"1","title":"BUTTONS ARE TOO SMALL...PHONE NOT DURABLE","review":"I have small hands and the buttons a still just to tiny, i use my fingernails to press the buttons.

It gets a little better reception and battery life and is smaller, but I can not hear the ring sounds unless it is out of it's holster or out of my pocket. The buttons are small and touchy.It is feature packed though - for an older phone!!I do not get near the range of my wifes Sumsung e105 or my old nokia, and I can not use it in my work environment without standing next to a window. My wife gave it to me as she could never hear people on the phone - the speaker is positioned lower than was comfortable for her to hold.If I had my choice, it would be replaced already!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Bought V66 with T-mobile","review":"Not worth the money. I got this phone after some problems with my Nokia 3595. Despite my troubles with the Nokia I would gladly trade the V66 for the Nokia. The V66 has much too small of a keypad, bad sim card cover, and a bad screen cover. I have had nothing but troubles with this phone, and would go use a large brick like non-flip phone that gets much better reception and wont break for cheaper than this new phone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Made for talking, not much else","review":"Pretty good, some may find very avearage. Not too many features. T-Mobile won't let you download MegaTones or Games. Can't Play Polyphonic sounds. Looks great on the outside. One can buy a silver case and will even look neater. No external LCD. THE KEYBOARD IS NOT HARD TO USE!! very easy don't even have to push hard on the keys. The antennae is a little annoying, especially when in a pocket. Light-weight. OK display, only 1 backlight. So, if u want a phone just to talk on, this is the phone, and T-Moble will have plans to suit your basic needs. If you are looking for a phone to show off with, than this isnt for you. The T-Moble service upstate isn't the best but it works.

This lock requires the doors to be really close to each other, and I don't see that as practical.I ended up buying a pair of $1.99 sliding window locks (the ones that screw into the rail with a thumb screw and block the path of the door) from OSH and blocking the doors.

The only criticism is that for his next film please leave Los Angeles alone. Los Angeles is not the only city with dirty cops lol. Keanu Reeves has slowly but surely developed into a pretty good actor, his portrayal as an hard nosed yet troubled cop was really convincing. He actually showed some emotion and conviction that has evaded him in the past. Forest Whitaker is good as usual as a sly, slick, crooked vice unit commander that is honed in on black mailing his way up to become chief. The brutal action, good acting, unexpected plot twist will surely keep you entertained right up to the ending credits. This movie is first rate deserving of each of the 5 stars that I gave it.

I especially liked the setting of this one, which takes place all over the enitre state of New Mexico-from big cities like Albuquerque to tiny dots on the map like Tierra Amarilla. BLM(Bureau of Land Management) District Ranger, Leo Drucker, is up to his eyeballs in an unsolved case. And he doesnt realize until its nearly too late how inextricably tied he is to the victim, the victims sister and the underlying reason for her brutal murder. What I didnt expect is how attached I got to a relatively minor character-BLM underling, Frannie DiCosta. She and Drucker make a great pair, and I'm hoping Polisar will bring both of them back in her next book.Melissa Mackwell"},{"rating":"1","title":"POORLY MADE, UNPLAYABLE","review":"If you're looking for a toy that actually works like the original \\"Guess Who\\", don't waste your money. Despite carefully assembling the toy (snapping out, clicking on the \\"flip up\\" card holders; inserting cards by \\"threading\\" through the plastic holders), the toy does not function as it should.The plastic holders stick, and when pulled - gently - to unstick, come completely off the base; the cards slip out with the slightest movement.This game was on the top of my son's Christmas list, and was a complete disappointment and waste of money.

Would definitely recommend this and have given it as a gift with great reviews as well. The only downside is that the plastic is cheap and breaks easily.

Deep and rich in rock, blues, and jazz, these tracks have a \\"Floydian\\" style! Neal is a fireball-for pete's sake the guy is like 20 years old when this was recorded. Dunbar and Valory lay down a back bone like NOONE can. Rolie makes surgical strikes with the keyboards and his adequate-but-silky baritone vocals deepens the texture of the tracks.

Later bought the self-titled and \\"Next.\\" All three are filled with great guitar work from Neal. Many of the songs in their first three releases never made it to popular radio. But than again popular radio does not play this kind of music. Sadly,it is not even heard in your classic rock stations. I highly recommned that if you like real muscianship and want to listen to awesome guitar jam sessions, this is the lp/cd to get.Highlights from this cd are: \\"It's AlL to Much,\\" \\"Look into the Future,\\" \\"Anyway.\\" \\"Midnite Dreamer,\\" and \\"I'm Gonna Leave You.\\"Journey was awesome before Steve Perry, but of course Perry later became the platnium voice for the band.

Guitarists from Santana add to the overall effectiveness of the band. The first time I bought this album on 8 track tape. Most folks don't realize there was a PrePerry band. With it's conception in early '70 up to about '75 the music fused well until the personnel changes modified the style of music.If you like most 70's music you'll like this unique style. Try the media player here at this site to get a little taste."},{"rating":"2","title":"Look Into The Future - Classic Journey","review":"Journey's second album is a much more rock oriented affair, consisting of mostly powerful rockers with the sophisticated edge of true musicians. Greg Rollie's vocals are still very much in the realm of early Santana, very hypnotic while his keyboard playing has grown by leaps and bounds. Neal Schon's guitar playing has more bite, but his runs are more fulfilling. I can't say enough Aynsley Dunbar's incredible drumming on all three of the early Journey albums, but this one in particular contains some of his most ferocious battery. Ross Vallery holds the fort with his strong, confident bass playing. Songs like \\"Look Into The Future\\" and the one-two punch of \\"Midnight Dreamer\\" and \\"I'm Gonna Leave You\\" take the listener through several phases before relenting, which is something they lost when Steve perry joined. This is progressive rock at its finest and should be heard by a wider audience."},{"rating":"2","title":"Look into the Future","review":"This would be Journey's last album before Steve Perry came aboard.Not to put Steve Perry down but I liked Journey better without him."},{"rating":"2","title":"Journey's Second Album Is Another Great One","review":"LOOK INTO THE FUTURE, Journey's second album, is totally wonderful.

In a mere 6 months the dark heavy stains from tea drinking and smoking are gone. My teeth as as white as they were when I was in my 20's -- very white indeed.I think part of the trick is diligence with a very good electric toothbrush (I use mine in the shower for 5 minutes 2x/day, the mouthwash swished at least 2 minutes AND using the 2 hour whitening kit 3 times.

It does start out great, and \\"Led Boots\\" with it's heavy intense funk, is a highpoint, but it doesn't go on so well from there. There's a few mellower tracks that were written by Narada Michael Wilson that aren't as memorable, and \\"Blue Wind\\" isn't that great to my ears. \\"Goodbye Porkpie Hat\\" is another slow ballady song, written by a legend (Charlie Mingus), but it doesn't have the effect that \\"Cause We've Ended as Lovers\\" did on me. Maybe i'm being too harsh here, and maybe I should let it stand on its own. However, you'd expect top grade quality from Beck, especially after following up something so great.

Even on the surface though, would you really want a blaster where you need to put the darts into shells, and then load the shells all while you're trying to run around?

Currently, its barrel is wrapped in duct-tape (the barrel fell apart), and I've had to open up the gun to fix the springs a couple times; so durability-wise: the toy is a piece of junk. But when living in a dorm, a \\"nerf\\" shotgun is pretty-much the coolest thing ever (I realize it's the cheap knock-off brand, but really, who cares?). I stormed my RA's room many-times...Overall, if you're willing to work with a toy when it quits working, this one is worth getting. If you're someone who gives up when something breaks, don't get it. Along those lines, don't buy this for your kids if you're not going to supervise their playing with it... they will need you to fix it, and why would you let your kid play with projectiles unsupervised?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not good","review":"I got this gun in hopes that it'd be fun to play around with the family, and I got maybe 4 shots that came out with both darts, and then another 5 that were just one dart at a time.

When I buy it and go home, I was cutting the strings that were holding it to the box. You see, I mistook the string in the middle that cocked it for a safety string. So, I cut it, and you can see where that went. Now, that was entirely my fault, but they could at least put something to cover the purposely exposed string. So, I returned it. Second one lasts me a month. It broke on the inside somehow. Returned it again. Third one lasted longer. This time, it broke externally, on the hinge that held the the two main parts. At that point, I didn't want to buy it anymore."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun Toy","review":"My son was excited to receive this gun and greatly enjoyed it. I would recommend that it be made easier to cock. My son has to put the barrell end down on something and then lean on it with all of his weight in order to make the darts engage.

But I'm giving it 2 stars because it doesn't fire out of both barrels. I knew that might happen. I didn't care if that happened. I just assumed that something was jammed, like a spring or something. I wasn't going to try to fix it, but when I got curious and started trying to find what the problem was, thats when I got a little mad. When you cock open to reload, you can kind of see the inside of the gun if you look below the barrel. That's where the problem was. There was no spring OR the part that pops up the spring so it can shoot on the left side. If there were no spring or part that pops it up, I wouldn't be mad, but since neither were there, I think it only deserves 2 stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"nerf shotgun","review":"Kudos to supplier Republica Galactica.

Out of My Tree is a good representation of John Sykes singing and hard rocking, guitar playing talent. The guitar solos will put a big smile on the fans of the 1987 Whitesnake album, as they are quite similar. John's vocals are excellent. Most of the songs are somewhat like Blue Murder or John Sykes era Whitesnake(1985-1987) tunes.Each time I play this CD in my car, it usually doesn't come out for a month or so (its that good!!!). It just rocks. Soul Stealer, and Jesus and Mary are two of my favorites, but all of the tracks are great.Sure the price of the import CD is a little expensive, but would you rather pay a small price for some of the crummy music out today, or a higher price for an excellent Hard Rock CD?!!Out of my Tree is a kickass CD. Fans of John Sykes or Whitesnake should not be without it!!Highly Recommended!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than I thought","review":"I was a little hesitant about ordering this book at first for fear it would be dry and complicated. I was very happy to discover it was neither. It is well researched and well written. Warren gives you a good feel about the period and the challenges John faced. I even found myself asking \\"what would I have done in his place?\\" This book busted a few of the \\"Bad King John\\" myths as well as some of the \\"Good King Richard\\" ones. This is a very readable book provided you have an interest and a little knowledge about the period. If you are looking for a \\"Robin Hood\\" type story this isn't it. It's not a page turner but nor should it be. This is the story of a complex man during a complex time and Warren did a great job of bringing it to life without making it dull."},{"rating":"2","title":"Powerful!","review":"A novel so intense and authentic that the reader feels as if the stock of a Garrand has butted them in the jaw. One can smell the cordite and experience the flash of incoming shells as they huddle in a shallow fox hole that might well be a premature grave. Know what it is like to drive home a dagger when it is the heat of hand to hand combat and you only have your own skill and guts to rely upon. Few novels approach the height of realism and magnificence as this volume. If you have the desire that lives in the heart of all real men to know war but have have been tied down at home with family responsibilities, or if you wish you had been born in Germany prior to WWII so you could have participated in the Big One, then this is indeed a book you must read and Paul Watkins an author you will want to remember."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why bother?","review":"All I can say is, \\"thank the good Lord that someone lent me this recording and I didn't pay for it!\\" There are so many vastly superior recordings of Traviata available, with a variety of Violettas (Sutherland, Callas, Cortrubas, Moffo, de los Angeles) Alfredos (Pavarotti, Domigo, Kraus, Bjorling. Bergonzi) and Papa Germonts (Merrill, Milnes, MacNeil, Nucci) to choose from instead. Great Verdians all. The young lovers here are adequate at best, soporific at worst. Sadly, once again, Maestro Hampson makes one of his many misguided forays into the Verdian repertoire. What a pity, for one who is so expressive a lieder singer to be so hopefully lost in Opera. He just doesn't have the vocal power to sustain the long lyric lines or the vocal freedeom to maintain the dramatic thrust that Verdi commands. Still, I am certain that the millions of Hampson's fervent admirers will swoop and croon, much as he does in this affected performance. E strano. I say again, \\"Why bother?\\" with this Traviata."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great LIVE \\"La Traviata\\" in our days!","review":"Villazon is absolutely a LEGENDARY tenor of our time! His energy+passion is amazing and yet, he has beautiful sound...! Netrebko is great Violetta although she is not the best. It is hard to resist the fact that she IS Violetta looking and that makes me to get into this performance. Her voice is rich, warm, and gorgious. Hampton is alright. Considering that this is LIVE performance recording, it is queit nice and exciting. Worth to listen. Therefore, I give full stars! Let us be little generous~"},{"rating":"2","title":"Marvellous vocal acting","review":"There is much in this recording to warrant repeated listening. Netrebko uses her rather dark and smokey voice to great effect. As vocal acting and intelligent singing Netrebko's performance is as good as anything I know since Callas -- but she is not quite up to Callas's effectiveness. Netrebko's voice and technique, however, are not up to the quality of the best recorded Violettas -- eg. Sutherland, Moffo or Caballe. Hampson as Garmont pere also has some very fine passages, though I have heard his voice used more beautifully. Villazon strikes me as a rather ordinary tenor, though he does sing with conviction and character. The orchestra and chorus are first rate, though the conducting is at times quirky and not nearly of the quality of the best recorded Traviatas. Overall, I am very glad to have this recording, though if I had to have just one, this would not be the one chosen. (I would be torn between Sutherland/Pavorotti and Moffo/Tucker.)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Villazon good, but Netrebko big disappointment","review":"Traviata is my favourite Verdi opera and I have gathered at home quite a collection of cds and dvds with some of the greatest Violettas: Callas, Gheorghiu, Sutherland, Moffo, etc. I bought this cd based on amazon reviews, but the fact of the matter is that I regret having bought it: I like the tenor and the baritone, but Netrebko did not convince me as Violetta.- act I: her coloratura is barely satisfactory and not what one would expect from a regular singer at the MET...- act II: her Amami Alfredo was weak; she went off tune rather often;- act III: I got no sense of the frailty and tragedy of Violetta - she failed to convince dramatically.So if you are a big fan of Villazon, you may want to buy this cd for his good Alfredo; but if you are like me and you can't imagine a good La Traviata with a mediocre Violetta, save your money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Verdi: La Traviata","review":"While hearing Verdi's La Traviata is almost always pleasant, this recording captures the magic combination of beautiful melodies, strong individual voices and most importantly the dynamism between Netrebko and Villazon. So often opera librettos challenge even the most romantic of listeners. However in this recording, the love and tragedy are both believable and beautiful."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overpriced junk","review":"For the 2 liter size, the insulation only covers a little more than half the bottle.

While not the greatest insulation (it feels like felt), they so handy, I didn't care. For the first time ever, I could carry a small bag, rather than a giant backpack. My kids each had their own color and could carry their own water through the parks. Since the insulation was a bit lacking, I actually froze our water, slipped the frozen bottles into neoprene drink cozies, and then put the bottles into this bag. It is quite large as other reviewers have said, and you could almost fit two bottles in the bag. Also, the little pocket is the perfect size for keys or those little flavor packets for water. One of my kids lost a tooth while at the parks, and we zipped it into the pocket for safe keeping. The straps are a bit scratchy, and my Dad opted to clip a caribiner to the side of the bag and keep it on his belt rather than over his head.

I have listened to this one so many times, I can whistle the harmonica and fiddle parts. Hurricane is as good as it gets. One More Cup Of Coffee and Sara are wonderful. The minor keys used in the songs gives you a true folk music feel. The strumming guitars, and pronounced bass playing tie the music all together.

If you like Dylan you will love this album. If you like music at all you will like this album. First through last every song is good. Some say a few of the tracks are long ( JOEY )but the Violin and back up vocals more than make up for the tracks that run long. Isis is a wonderful tale and of Course Hurricane is a powerful blast threw the story of Rubbine Carter. I think the most suprising tune is Mozambique. If you have a few of Bob's records and are looking for more this should be your next buy. If you dont have any and want one this should be your next buy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Desire this album","review":"Desire is great. This album is the culmination of Dylan's evolution from folk-master to rock wizard. The stylistic variety of the songs makes the album infinitely listenable even where the songwriting cannot achieve the mastery of Blonde on Blonde. The songs are all still great and \\"Hurricane\\" is of course amazing and touching. \\"Mozambique\\" sounds like a Jimmy Buffett song--in a good way. This is a very interesting album."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"I WAS HOPING THAT IT WASN'T CONTAGIOUS!\\"","review":"This is the Dylan album I come back to again and again. It would be a 5 star album for me, were it not for \\"HURRICANE\\". It's the kind of social injustice song Dylan wrote many of in the sixties. It's just not up to those standards. True story or not, the song just hasn't aged well for me. That aside, DESIRE is a beauty! Some of the most elegant melodies & his phrasing so evocative. \\"Isis\\" is one of the sexiest cowboy heist songs I've ever heard. \\"One More Cup of Coffee\\" is haunting as all get out. No need to talk about the lyrics. The man is a master. \\"Sara\\" is heartwrenching. Where \\"Hurricane\\" falters, \\"Joey\\" suceeds on every level. The musicians play as if they were plucked out of another time, another place. The stories sound well-traveled. A century between them & Dylan. It's just gorgeous. It would be a heinous act to not mention Emmylou Harris here. Her backing vocals (as always) are the stuff that angels wings are made of."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of his more laid-back albums yet very adventurous","review":"The album's sound is rich featuring uncommon instrumentation for Dylan songs (violin, bellzouki) and two extended pieces chronicling two different peoples' lives. There's a lively Mexican-flavored song (\\"Romance in Durango\\"), but most of these tunes are on the mellow tip. \\"One More Cup of Coffee\\" is particularly evocative of the lonesome traveller, while \\"Isis\\" is a wild romantic tale in part about being a pawn of circumstance. I haven't heard a Dylan album that sounds quite like this one. I consider it essential Dylan and one of my favorites."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great CD","review":"You see a side of Bob that isn't expressed as much in his other records.

I'm not crazy about Joey, though. Definitely worth having, DESIRE is one of Bob's hidden treasures."},{"rating":"2","title":"A review by Emily","review":"I like this record. It's one of my Dad's hippy records that he plays a lot. I don't usually like them, but I like this one a lot. This Bob Dylan guy is pretty good, even though he looks like all the other hippies on my Dad's records. Anyways, some of the songs I like are \\"Hurricane\\" which my Dad says is about what happened in New Orleans. I think it's kinda spooky how Mr. Dylan knew this was going to happen. I also like \\"Sara\\" which my Dad says is about Sara Michelle Geller, I guess she was Bob Dylan's wife at some point. The song I don't like very much is \\"Joey\\" which Dad says is about the guy on Friends. Also, on this album there are some nice backing vocals by Hillary Duff, at least that's who my Dad says it is, but I'm not too sure because she sounds different on her own albums.

T-Mobile was unable to ship a replacement because exchange units were out of stock. They were unwilling to provide a new unit as a replacement. Last week I received a message from T-Mobile that an upgrade to the operating system was available. The upgrade failed and I was told they would have to ship me a replacement unit but were again out of stock with at least a 2 week wait. I asked if I could purchase a replacement unit at a retail store and receive a discount and was told that all stores were out of stock also. Phone calls to 2 stores and a check of amazon.com proved this to be another lie. T-Mobile sells a great device that meets or exceeds all my expectations until it breaks. After close to 2 years, they have done nothing to improve customer service. BUYER BEWARE!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent product, spotty reception","review":"Its not the device's fault, but GSM reception where I live is terrible. The device worked beautifully throughout Thailand, and had good reception in Chicago. But despite the poor reception, I make do because the phone is brilliantly implemented in most other respects.

The music, like all other early 80's punk, gets harder and faster with each album.The Big Boys were upbeat, unapologetic Texan Anarchists who pioneered the used of funk rifts and horn lines in a very punk rock, invent-your-own-funner-world kinda way. (They had to do it; they lived in chicken-fried Jesus with gravy Texas!) The insert explains that Big Boys lived out the 'stone soup' parable, but with a legion of art freak punks. It's really great to see in action.Although the Red Hot Chili Peppers followed their musical lead, and got naked - they never reached the all-out ecstasy of the Big Boys. The music has infectiously bouncy bass lines. One just has to boogie - yes, mohawk and all. This is great music for skateboarding, moving anything heavy, or just jumping around like a freak. It's soul music for punks.

They were mixing different styles with hardcore before hardcore was a generally recognized term. The only band you can place them next to would be The Bad Brains because The Boys shift effortlessly between funk and hardcore the way The Bad Brains do between hardcore and reggae. The songs are intense and uplifting. They roar through Apolitical, groove through Kool & The Gang's Hollywood Swinging, and create the finest moment in American punk with Fun, Fun, Fun.

HOWEVER, the gears are plastic, and if overloaded the gears skip and wear rather than the motor stalling. After 6 mos. of use, the gears wore to the point that normal juicing was impossible.

I got this last week and have been juicing limes and lemons ever since. I really like that it gives you the option of straining out the pulp if you want. And I like the fact that the cone rotates in both directions. And that there are 2 sizes of cones - one for lemons/limes, another for oranges/grapefruit. This juicer really gets ALL the juice out of the lemons and limes. It's very stable and doesn't wobble or \\"walk\\" while it's operating. It's easy to use and doesn't take up much room in my cabinet. My only wish is that the detachable parts were dishwasher safe . . . the manual says to hand wash them.

Should you lose the remote or its battery dies, you're almost out of luck as the main unit has no on/off switch--not a good design--and rather annoying as the unit shuts down automatically after 10 minutes with no input.

Both optional units still send signals where the included sensor doesn't (or sends intermittently).And to echo a past review, read the instructions and everything will be fine. If you opt for an additional thermometer, read the instructions all the way through once before starting, otherwise you will need to reboot the unit (remove the batteries) to establish a connection with all sensors.Maybe the best measure of an items worth is to say you would buy it again and I would without hesitation, however, I would gladly upgrade to a base station/remote sensor package that could span over 200'."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great gift to my father, easy set up!","review":"I gave this to my father as a gift and he loves it.

So i searched for a DOCUMENTARY on the Amazon river. After being shown this DVD by the search engine, I took a chance and bought it. Little did I know that this DVD is extremely religious and trys to trick you into believing in intelligent design. Not only that, this DVD and its \\"creators\\" are extremely misleading from the begining, never being upfront about tryingto sway you from believing in evolution. Not only that the video comes with a thick catalog of other \\"informative\\" DVDs on intelligent design, so as to confuse you even more.This DVD belongs in the religion section."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pure creationism in this movie.","review":"I really dislike religious creationism in a scientific wrapping. When people try to remove scientific facts because of their religious belief, I find it a very serious matter. All people are welcome to express their religious beliefs, but when proven facts are denied just because of a persons religion, this is very serious for science and society. How is science thought to be possible when religious ideas are replacing proven facts?The creationists are making movies just to spread their words. Ok, but then I will have the right to oppose these people! Modern genetics show the origin and relations between species, and is very hard to put aside. I will be carefull to keep away from creationist propaganda like this in the future."},{"rating":"1","title":"gray ashes come winter","review":"I love historical southern fiction. I unfortunately wasted my hard earned money on this piece of southern historical fiction. The plot is predictible, the characters one dimesional, the ending borders on being silly. The author waviers between historical novel and hookey love story. If you want this kind of fiction stick to \\"Gone with the Wind\\". At least you will not have wasted both money and time and you will have enjoyed a good novel."},{"rating":"2","title":"At Last!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","review":"After seeing Starcastle live at the age of 18, as an opening act for ELO at Connecticut's Hartford Civic Center in 1977 I was hooked. I purchased every album and tape (for the car) as soon as they were released. I've since worn out the LP's as well as the tapes and have not been able to find them anywhere. At last after 8 years I will be able to get all of their music once again on CD. I am looking forward to being able to listen to one of the pre-eminent progressive rock bands that the US has ever produced."},{"rating":"2","title":"Their OWN progressive sound.","review":"Why is it if someone works in a similar vein they're accused of musical plagiarism? Was Chopin a ripoff of Liszt, or was it the other way around? Is there some unwritten rule that you can only like one example of any given genre?Yeah, there are certainly similarities, from Terry's reedy vocals to Gary's Rick bass to Herb's use of portamento on the Mini, but listen to the guitars, fercryinoutloud! Yes has a more polyrhythmic, orchestral feel, while Starcastle works in a similar style but clearly with an American guitar-rock edge... and without Kansas' (with all due respect) top-40-ness.Bottom line: if you like good 70's prog-rock, give it a try. I did, and I don't regret it.(Oh, one historical note:At the time this album came out, Yes had officially broken up, which left the field to ELP, Kansas, and... Starcastle.)"},{"rating":"2","title":"If you like YES, you'll love this!","review":"In the late 70's I went to a Jethro Tull Concert at the LA Colosseum (Too Old to Rock and Roll, Too Young to Die tour), with a four-band venue : Starcastle, Rory Gallager, Robin Trower, and Tull. Rory jammed to an E-progression for an hour (tedius), Trower sounded exactly like the 8-track (pauses for track changes and all, I think), Tull was typically great, but it was Starcastle (the opener) that blew me away. I've been looking for anything about them, an album, cassette, even a playbill to prove I wasn't hallucinating, for over 20 years. And here it IS! The one, the only, on CD! and it's killer! Play it for your YES-junkie friends and watch 'em freak trying to figure out which early YES album they somehow never heard before. Definite ear-candy!"},{"rating":"1","title":"You've gotta be kidding","review":"This album is so hopelessly derivative of YES that it's a joke. I just listened to Lady of the Lake and heard imitations of Steve Howe guitar style, Jon Anderson's vocal pitch, Chris Squire's entire bass guitar thing, plus direct ripoffs of everything from Roundabout's ending coda, direct lifts from Mussorgsky (as noted, apparently without irony, unfortunately by another reviewer), and guitar riffs right out of YES's Perpetual Change. Starcastle lacks the depth and density of composition that YES pioneered. Sounds pretty, but so does Kelly Clarkson."},{"rating":"1","title":"This isn't prog rock.","review":"Starcastle may have been inspired by Yes, but they lack all of the complexity that Yes has to offer. I would say that this album is more akin to The 5th Dimension than Yes, but a million times more poppy, and it isn't even good pop. It's misleading to call this prog, as it clearly is not."},{"rating":"1","title":"Excuses, excuses, excuses...","review":"-No question these guys are an imitator band. Ya know, the kind you see who go around and call themselves something slightly different but are really clones of what they consider to be the 'sincerest form of flattery'. But that only works if they're honest about it.Unfortunately, Starcastle never was.They were lucky enough to land a big record contract with Columbia at a time when Walter Yetnikoff wanted something to appeal to Yes-heads and prog dinosaurs who couldn't admit the music was five years past it's prime.Give this one a pass, unless you're into faux Yes._"},{"rating":"2","title":"easier to enjoy now than at the time of its release","review":"Starcastle was too close to the edge of Yes back in the prog-saturated 70's; nowadays, they are a fine addition to the playlist of any Yes fan. Starcastle sound great and, as it's now twenty years later, they've got nothing left to prove. We can feel free to enjoy their lush, symphonic rock free of copycat-supporter guilt. In 1999, all that's left is the music, and I think it's remarkably adept, if derivative, prog-rock. Having said that, I haven't heard 'reel-to-reel' and my copy of 'citadel' doesn't visit the turntable too often... there's something faintly disco about 'citadel' that i've heard is exhibited in full cry on 'reel to reel'."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best album Yes never made","review":"An enjoyable walk through 70s prog. These guys are obviously talented, and have some great ideas, but let's be realistic. They ... Yes so much it's shameless. From bass sounds, to moog and mellotron and hammond, to Luttrell's voice, it's bordering on plagiarism.Seriously, if you heard \\"Elliptical Seasons\\" out of context, not knowing who it was, you'd swear it was a long-lost Yes song, or something from a Jon Anderson solo album.Still, this is a fun recording, and enjoyable to listen to. Worth getting, so check it out!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I might be a tad biased...","review":"While I may be a tad bit biased because I am the niece of Gary Strater, the bassist, I wasn't even around when StarCastle was touring. I love the music however and while they may sound like Yes at times, all the music is ORIGINAL and not a rip off as others may call it. Just wait until the new album comes out, heard a cut of it the other day after the funeral of Gary Strater, my uncle, who just lost his battle with cancer. Go check out the StarCastle website at www.starcastlemusic.comTrue fans know what's going on with StarCastle and LOVE the music and know that they weren't trying to imitate anyone. Can't wait for the new songs to come out as they are AMAZING."},{"rating":"2","title":"A unique and worthy variation on Yes-like music","review":"I had been a fan of Yes for a long time when I first heard of and heard Starcastle. Unlike most of my friends and the majority of music critics I welcomed this sound-alike band. They took a popular type of music of the day and made it their own. Then and now I defended and defend my like for them with a furvor. There was a time when Jethro Tull, Rory Gallagher and Robin Trower were coming to my town for a concert. Even though I liked all three groups, I wasn't going to go until I heard that Starcastle had been added to the show. Three huge bands of the day and it took the unknown-to-most opening act for me to buy a ticket. THAT'S how much I was enthralled with this band. I still am. One can yell \\"ripoff\\" all one wants, but to me their music is as valid and worthy of praise as the music of Yes or any other worthy progressive rock band."},{"rating":"2","title":"SCARY!","review":"To me, i find it scary because of the vampires. i only had THE TALE OF THE SOUVENEIR SHOP.

I don't know how much I would enjoy these crackers on their own. They probably taste like cardboard (kind of look like it too!). So I would highly recommend putting something on them - hummus, cheese, peanut butter, etc."},{"rating":"2","title":"High-energy Rocky disc captures the feel of the show","review":"The new Rocky Horror CD does something rare in show recordings...it actually keeps much of the high energy from the live show. Broadway's revival sparkles with color and high octane vocals, which the disc preserves in fine form. Tom Hewitt's Frank-N-Furter stands out as a different, yet equally entralling take on the character, and he gives amusing new inflections to familiar lines. Even Dick Cavett as the narrator is given a few moments on the recording, with his wonderfully droll exposition. The band is allowed to perform much like a rock album instead of being ineffectively buried at the back of the mix, and they use the opportunity to drive everything forward. Tempos are sharp and fun, the new orchestrations rich, and the whole album oozes forth with a good time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Who did this?","review":"I love this show, and see it often. Sadly, Raul Esparaza is no longer playing Riff-Raff, so I picked up this album. It's just bad. It was recorded in a studio (and not a good one), so the energy is muted compared to the live show. This recording sounds like the actors rehersing after a week off.Now, the album is still good. But it is a shadow of what they do on stage."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible!","review":"While filled with talented performers, this cd sucks.Rocky is a campy, 1970's B-Movie, that's what makes it enjoyable. Even as a stage show it's a hokey, rock-and-roll extravaganza.This cd tries to turn Rocky into Thoroughly Modern Millie, and it just doesn't work. The corny sci-fi sound and less than amazing vocals are just what make Rocky..Rocky. This cast has so much less enthusiasm and energy than the original Roxy cast.And lastly, Tim Curry is Frank. His rendition is too ingrained in my head for me to accept the twangy annoyance that is the Frank on this album. Ripley is a little too legit for Janet, and the female Eddie weirds me out.Buy the Roxy cast. It's so superior it's almost laughable."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's OK","review":"The actors sing pretty good, but it all seems emotionless and dull to me. Lea Delaria and Daphne Rubin-Vega have the best voices and add something new though. The guy playing Frank? I know Rocky Horror is a spoof, but his performance was so bad.Hearing these songs live on stage was great, because you have the visuals (and Daphne Rubin-Vega as Magenta!!), but it's a chore for me to listen to this CD. The music has horrible arrangements. I prefer the Roxy cast to this one. And I'm in the minority, but I even like the original London cast better. At least they had some personality."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ick...","review":"I love broadway. I love RHPS. I thought, therefore, that I would love this soundtrack, but I guess I just fell in love with the vocals from the movie version, because the songs from this album seemed all wrong to me. Despite the impressive performances of this cast, I found myself sorely missing the accents, inflections, and tones from the movie characters - particularly those of Little Nell, Susan Sarandon, and, most of all, Tim Curry. Call me old-fashioned, but I liked Columbia with that squeaky, cockney voice, Janet soft and high, and the way Frank belted out those strong, smoky notes with his amusing accent, and I just didn't enjoy the music nearly as much without these specific factors. In short, if you liked the music of Rocky Horror because of the instrumentals and lyrics, then this album may be fine for you, but if, like me, your enjoyment came as much from the actors' individual performances as from the songs themselves, I'd look elsewhere for my Rocky fix."},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT revival!","review":"If you went into the revival of The Rocky Horror Show expecting the movie, you got a big surprise. The sings, in my opinion, have been improved, being played more up-tempo and mroe like rock songs!! Great performances by all! Just a great show!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Outrageous and Utterly Fantastick Rock Musical","review":"I have been fortunate enough to see this incredible show twice recently with the cast thats on the CD. The show is electrifying, and this translates extremely well to this soundtrack. It has become the most listened-to CD in my house usually being played multiple times a day. The musicianship of the singers and the band are impeccable and it has been mixed beautifully. It at once captures the essence that is a \\"Rocky Horror\\" experience without slowing the pace down with too many of the audience participatory lines -- just enough to let you know what you're listing to. Super-charged and Non-stop, it is impossible to listen to this CD without getting up and singing and dancing along. I highly recommend this to anyone who loves Broadway, especially rock musicals."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Broadway Show is great","review":"Recently, I reviewed the soundtrack album and, having just seen the Broadway show, I purchased the cast album. Missing from this cd is Joan Jett. I don't know why. I know she stormed out of the show but, I think that happened after this cd was recorded.This has all the compelling features of a live performance. The instrumentals are more electric (with the distortion turned up to boot) and there is a certain earthiness to the vocals. Compare \\"Double Feature Picture Show\\" on both cds as an illustration of my point regarding the vocals.It's hard to say which cd I like better. They both have their good points. On the one hand, in \\"Time Warp,\\" I like the Broadway cast instrumntals better but prefer the girlie high voices of the soundtrack. The cast portarys the characters very differently in the Broadway show than in the movie and this is reflected in this cd. Both cds are great and if you have room for both in your collection, I recommend them both."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not easy to use as reference","review":"I later learned that there is a standard number referencing scheme for Plato's Laws that this translation did not include.

Here are some reasons why I think the Laws is the best book of the politics. First, This book extensively and thoroughly covers every aspects of the society such as education, laws, politics, justice, and religion. Unlike the Republic, the Laws has some pratical values in it.

Sadly, this (surprisingly short) collection is mostly of that later period; indeed, most of the Argent songs known by anybody (Hold Your Head Up, God Gave...) aren't really indicative of what they could DO. I suggest passing this up, and instead picking up their first two albums (Argent/Ring of Hands); trust me, if you dismissed them after hearing this, you'll be more than pleasently surprised."},{"rating":"2","title":"Essential to any serious music lover","review":"An often overlooked and underated band this disc belongs in everyone's collection. \\"Hold Your Head Up\\" is a timeless classic and worth the price of the disc by itself. The other tracks showcase the wonderful muscianship and terrific singing of Rod Argent and Russ Ballard. Buy this disc now!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Far From the Best","review":"Of course, I am going to fall even farther afield than some of the other opinions here, but I really like the Argent albums after Russ Ballard left, \\"Circus\\" and \\"Counterpoints\\" which were Argent at their most zealously progressive. Since no songs from that period are included here, this is, indeed, anything but a best of compilation."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hold Your Head Down","review":"This has to be one of the skimpiest compilations ever made. Based on the success of Rod and companies biggest hit \\"Hold Your Head Up\\" the rest of the cuts are mediocre at best. Hold out for Three Dog Night's version of \\"Liar\\" , the Kiss version of \\"God Gave Rock and Roll to You\\" and anyone else's version of \\"Time of the Season\\".

I should have started with Greenwood's earlier books because this one is terrible. It reads as if the author dictated the story and the result was never edited. Way too much exposition, and he told me everything as if I had the brain of a pea. It's so much better if a writer takes me where he wants me to go instead of just telling me what's going on.On the advice of a friend of mine, I tried this author again with the first book in his \\"Seven Brides\\" series called Rose. It was infinitely better, tighter written, and quite enjoyable. Greenwood still told me more things than he needed to, but I forgave him for that a little bit. It just seems to be his way to dumb things down occasionally.Don't waste your money on this book, buy the brides' books instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"Chet","review":"Another great one from Greenwood.

The possible interpretations are more than interesting to relish. \\"Chelsea hotel,\\" \\"Bird on a wire,\\" and the Top Forty hit. \\"Suzanne,\\" make up part of a wonderful collection of moving, memorable melodies.

DJ Ray Velazquez played \\"Famous Blue Raincoat\\" in the early hours of the a.m. and I have been a fan since then (1987). The sultry, misunderstood vocals on \\"Best Of\\"-the poetry to song, the beauty of \\"FLB\\" and all the other Cohen songs of love and longing-he puts emotion to sound- giving his fans a glimpse into his heart and into their own. This \\"Best Of\\" album is a fine appetizer to his inspiring sound. I heard a few years ago that he had throat cancer-I hope this isn't true. My goal used to be to hear the purity of \\"Famous Blue Raincoat\\" live-and though I now know this will prob. never happen (he is growing older...) I hope the albums,cassettes,cds will get me through.If your young and moody-this album may get you through your adolescent heartaches.

Cohen."},{"rating":"2","title":"A true poet...if only he could sing","review":"Leonard Cohen is another of those songwriters whose work I have appreciated from a distance. I thought this might work as a sampler of his work, at least some of his early material. The words are sheer magic. Cohen can express emotional depth far more successfully than most writers and the tunes carry the words across. However, it seems that, Cohen, like Kristofferson, is better served when others interpret his music. There is a flat atonal sound to his singing that almost seems a separate entity from the emotion the songs are conveying. Sometimes it works like on \\"Famous Blue Raincoat\\" but most of the time I can't help but wish that someone else was singing these wonderful words. Despite this, the words do win out and this is still worth having."},{"rating":"2","title":"Almost FIVE Stars, Perhaps not Quite!","review":"No doubt, there is much in the is CD to recommend it! In fact, every song here is worth checking into, and you can play the entire CD through with nothing that would blast away at your eardrums. SUZANNE is a near classc,as is SO LONG MARIANNE with it's enchanting female chorus, singing just a micro second behind Leonard's gravelly lead. PARTISONS is another fine tune, and frankly the whole album is full of interesting, tuneful, and poetic songs. So why only 4 Stars? Probably the dreariness at times is overdone, and there is a sameness to many of the numbers!

Cohen is a truly great songwriter and unfortunately not a great singer. This CD will help you appreciate his music but if you want to have a transendental experience find \`Tower of Song, the songs of Leonard Cohen\`. This CD is apperantly not available on Amazon. It is a compilation of his songs sung by other artists. The gem in it is Tori Amos singing \`Famous blue raincoat\`. I never knew so much emotion could be packed into 5 minutes. There are other great songs by P. Gabriel, T. Yearwood (don\`t laugh she is good), J. Arden, S. Vega, Bono, Sting and a few lousy ones by A. Neville and W. Nelson. Please look for this CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"heavenly, simply beautiful","review":"This album actually changes the atmosphere in the room. If you close your eyes and listen to Leonard's exquisite acoustic guitar and that seasoned, velvety voice of his you will just float off the surface of the planet.

Everyone should listen to this cd often, it would enhance and inspire all it touches, without a doubt."},{"rating":"2","title":"Leonard is a Great Singer!!!","review":"Who is a great singer, maybe someone like Whitney Houston perhaps.

While not as prolific as Dylan (and with much of his best work behind him) he is blessed with an emotionally more engaging and intensely personal style of songwriting - it is confessional while at the same time being universal in it's sentiments. Before he started recording Cohen was a published poet and novelist of some renown and his songs reflect a craftmanship and poetic intensity that is unique. Combine these qualities with an interest in religious mysticism and the affairs of the heart and you have a mix that is infinetly rich and rewarding. Since this is a best of collection all of these songs are amazing but Famous Blue Raincoat stands out for me - simply the best song ever written about jealousy and the failure of a relationship."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good best of","review":"The 2 reasons i bought this is because i was really impressed with jeff buckley's version of halleujah, and my father used to listen to cohen alot.

As I was cleaning my bookshelves the other day, I noticed a copy of Blackhearts and immediately sat down to read it again. As a child I enjoyed Aiken's plot; the events that occur aren't plausible in a realistic fashion but they do fit in nicely with the context. As well, Aiken certainly takes her readers to another time and another world: one where there are strict dividing lines between good and evil. The characters in Blackhearts are wonderful from Simon to Dido to Sophie. And if the ending seems a bit too perfect, well, it certainly fits in with the incredulous problems the characters faced throughout. Aiken's children's books are completely delightful, with this one no exception."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent for Dads to read to the Kids","review":"This nature book is wonderful as it tells of the story emperor penguin's unique habits at the kids level and in their language.

My daughter was so enthusastic about this book the I wanted to pop on the plane to Edinburgh, Scotland and show my daughter the Emperor penguins in real life.

Nevermind, perhaps Jenkins and Chapman will write about the little blue penguins, which are in Boston, next."},{"rating":"2","title":"So Cute!","review":"This is a great book.

It sounds like nothing you've really heard before. Jazzy, clanking white noise, god only knows what some of the bangings and janglings on this album really are. At one point, it sounds like someone tips over a china shelf. This band actually sounds like their name. Very slinty. All the songs are named after their parents, and one bandmember's dog as well. Produced by Steve Albini, whose influence via Big Black is obvious. In the first song, you can hear one of the band members complaining about their headphones to him. It always cracks me up when I listen to it, such a weird way to start an album...as he resigns himself to his broken headphones, the band suddenly pounds into action, letting you know to buckle up. Musicianship is amazing- especially when you consider how young these kids were. This is the superior record of their three."},{"rating":"2","title":"Slint at their finest","review":"This album os awesome. Spiderland was a wonderful album as well, but not as good as this masterpiece. Such a lovely album."},{"rating":"2","title":"warning label","review":"Slint's Tweez reminds me of Tool's debut EP Opiate in that it definitely has a more rough edge than later albums. Both bands started their careers with both middle fingers held high in the air, then proceeded down the path to artsy seriousness. Luckily, fans of both bands can get a good beating from these earlier releases.On a different comparison, Tweez sounds a lot like a bizaare Big Black album, very heavy with playful moments and weird lyrics. There is a lot more going on here than on Slint's later, slower and smoother songs. Although rough and at times difficult to swallow, Tweez is as a whole a complicated and rough mess that will annoy your friends and scare your family.

I read this book when I was in middle/high school and never finished it, I searched it out again and finally read it all. I see new meanings in this book, and find how something written in the 70's has ties to what is happening today.

Not worth the effort."},{"rating":"2","title":"Why I love Science Fiction (in 1000 words or less)","review":"In seventh grade, I picked a book off of my teacher's shelf, expecting to be bored to tears.

Its combination of intrigue and imagination made me realize that this genre was not reserved for geeks (those people I was desperately trying not to be one of).

To be there after watching this movie helped me understand the complexity of AIDS in Southern Africa. I attended a presentation by AIDS research experts where they tried to illlustrate that complexity to a group of Americans. This movie artfully and powerfully communicated the message that the research statistics could not. We left the research presentation with a lot of facts and figures....we left this movie in tears. Not only is it a great movie for its artistry, but it is an accurate depiction of the struggle against HIV/AIDS on the ground level. I will use this movie when I teach my students about AIDS around the world. This is a must see movie for anyone wanting to truly understand the AIDS issue in Africa."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Warm Learning Experience","review":"This heartwarming, emotion-tugging captivating South African film entertains and at the same time artistically teaches the epidemiology of HIV/AIDS.

I look forward to experiencing \\"Beat The Drum\\" again when it becomes available in the states."},{"rating":"2","title":"Komachi knives are awesome!","review":"These are the nicest knives I have ever used. They are very sharp and the coating allows them to slide easily through whatever you're cutting. You can cut paper thin slices of Apple or many other items. The knives are color coded which is intended to help you keep them segregated when preparing a big meal. Use one for meats, one for vegetables.Some have mentioned that you can't sharpen these, but I see no reason that would be a problem. Sharpening affects only a tiny amount of the blade at the edge which isn't coated anyway.

The only downfall is that this knife came with no sheath (neither did the Green Vegetable Komachi Knife I purchased) so storing it is a bit of a problem for me at the moment. If there was some sort of protective cover I could lay it in one of my drawers and not have to worry about damaging the blade; let alone cutting myself when I'm reaching in the drawer.You'd think it would be common sense [for any knife manufacturer) to include a plain ol' sheath.

Great pricing compared to local dealers and no tax/freight! I installed this unit myself and had no issues with installation. The unit is of great quality and achieves all of my goals for wanting to get a hard cover unit. The only negatives I have experienced is the locking mechanism seems a bit cheap and not sturdy - it works, but it just feels cheap. Additionally, the unit retracts very rapidly if you accidentally let go of the handle, banging into the canister. Also, I would have liked to been able to open it at multiple points (full, 3/4, 1/2, 1/4, etc), rather than just fully open, halfway, or fully closed.Overall, this is a great product for a good value to help protect and keep items safe & secure in your truck bed.Also, as my title notes.

So I'll get to what I think this is - it basically is \\"instrumental heavy rock jazz\\" but the jazz influence is slight. It is very well done, make no mistake, and does \\"rock\\" pretty hard. You need to like instrumental music if you buy this - many of us have to have that lead singer for music to sound right, and that is understandable. But that probably is more true for rock fans than jazz fans. A jazz fan will appreciate the lack of vocals, but this may not be \\"jazzy enough\\" for a pure jazz fan. It is definitely more of a \\"fusion\\" sound. If you are a fan of instrumental fusion this is a fantastic example of that sound. It is hard to describe this music - so does that make it better or worse? It's up to the listener; I like it! Instrumental heavy rock jazz fusion. Confused? Good."},{"rating":"2","title":"provides insight into the author's life and her works","review":"\\"My Dear Mr. M\\" is a collection of letters L. M. Montgomery wrote to Mr. G. B.

A must-read for fans of Montgomery."},{"rating":"2","title":"Smile despite heartbreak.","review":"I do believe that this one of her most under-rated albums. Laura Nyro released this album after her 5 year hiatus from recording. I am sure that people were expecting all of the bells and whistles of her previous masterpieces. While it doesn't have the intensity of Eli & New York Tendaberry, I feel it was part of her evolution from \\"Funky Madonna of New York Soul\\" to Earth Mother. She had recorded Smile during the end of her marriage to David Bianchini and the death of her mother. You can feel the heartbreak in this album. I would call this album her heartbreak album. I love all of the songs on Smile, especially \\"Money\\", (which gives a hint of her feelings towards ex-manager & \\"friend\\" David Geffen), \\"Midnite Blue\\" and the last song on the album \\"Smile\\". The track Smile is actually a wonderfully soothing one, with it's Japanese flavors. Quite original."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Series that Ended Before It Had A Chance","review":"The DVDs for this series were well packaged and looks like a good transfer. The series, what do you say?

It's a pity that the network executives didn't have the vision to see how great this series was. I'm thankful it's on DVD so that future generations can see how great family entertainment can be innovative and fun all at once!"},{"rating":"2","title":"not quite as i remember it","review":"it still holds up well,i can now understand the humour,as when i first saw it,i may have too young,but its still got all the actiom."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great product","review":"Excellent Family TV Series, if you like westerns you will like this as well. DVD case is nice, not cheap looking."},{"rating":"2","title":"It should have gone on!","review":"This must be the best, if not the only, Western series with its tongue stuck firmly into its cheek. Most of the time it struck the perfect balance of dead pan situational humour from Comet, the articulate and seriously opinionated horse, to the \\"Indian\\" stage coach driver who appears wearing a turban and addressing his passengers in a South Asian accent. It petered out a little after the double episode Treason, as if it wasn't sure where it was going from there but it could easily have been a long running success if it had had a chance for Brisco to settle down with Dixie and be the Sheriff in a town that included all (except the Bly Gang) of the characters we had met along the way. If you know the series \\"Eureka\\" - this was the Western equivalent."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best show on television. EVER.","review":"Quick equation for you: Western + Sci-fi overtones + Snappy, witty dialogue + \\"STARRING BRUCE CAMPBELL\\" = Best television show EVER. No wonder it was cancelled after one season.If you're a Brisco fan, you should pick this up for the sprinkling of commentaries alone. If you're not a Brisco fan, you should pick this up so that you can become one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Fun !","review":"It's fun to revisit TV shows that were favorites. Some reviewers will probably say that it's predictable, or dated, or some such, but husband and I enjoy watching Brisco County Jr. episodes and finding things we missed when the show played on TV. It is reminiscent of \\"Wild Wild West\\" because it tells the story on several levels. Plus it's nice to see the shows without commercials! And it's clean!, no foul language, car crashes, bullet-riddled bodies, or countless hours in a lab with the actors lines a series of \\"Hmmm's\\".Humor, good plots, good acting."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fond memories of Brisco County","review":"I loved this show when it was on TV. More importantly, I just love Bruce Campbell! This box set was on my wish list and I got it for my birthday! Hooray! Since re-discovering and loving all over again the whole Brisco County saga, I think that if this show had been released two years later (1995), that the internet would have kept it alive. The pairing of Brisco County and The X-Files was a great match-up -- although I didn't start watching X-Files until 1999. I would refuse to go out dancing with my friends on Friday night until Brisco County was over! One of my favorite shows and Bruce Campbell is one of the greatest underrated actors/entertainers of all time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brisco & Company","review":"I was heartbroken when this series was cancelled and thought it was a big mistake. It was so tongue-in-cheek humor and always had me watching for something the future might bring (dirigible-John Astin). I loved the series and I can't wait to receive the DVD of this. Bruce Campbell was perfect in the series as was Julius Carry and all the other characters. Of course, the horse being smarter than Briscoe was a hit also. Don't miss this series. It's a winner!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Things to Those Who Wait","review":"Trust me, Brisco County and Bruce Campbell fans alike have waited over a decade for this to come out. Granted, Columbia House did initially put out VHS copies of each episode some years back, but the DVD is what I think we've been waiting for...the tapes go bad after a few dozen viewings (hehe). Besides, perhaps like many fans, I had taped the show when it was on TV back in 1993-94. With the DVDs, fans will have a crisp copy of the episodes that will last for years with unlimited viewings.Now all they have to do is put out \\"Jack of All Trades\\" on DVD and we'll be set!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Brisco County, Jr is even better than I remember","review":"Bruce Campbell is Brisco County Jr. No wonder so many love him.

When I saw this set in a store last summer, I knew it was going to his Christmas present. It turned out that I couldn't wait for Christmas. :-)My kids have been enjoying these shows as well. The humor is witty, the characters and dialogue are well-written, and the story is a barrel of camp fun. I highly recommend this DVD set if you enjoy science fiction, comic westerns, the series Firefly (it has a similar feel), or Bruce Campbell."},{"rating":"2","title":"Before Firefly...","review":"Brisco County isn't really much like Firefly, apart from the offbeat humor. However when it first aired it had a similarly devoted fan following and for much the same reason: it was absolutely different from every other program out there.

With everyone watching that instead of this, it never stood a chance for renewal.Luckily for us, it not only got a full season release, but that full season tells a complete story. This is a Sci-Fi-Western worth watching.

Any season of Star Trek, Farscape, (until recently) Hercules: The Legendary Journeys, and now Brisco County Junior are obscenely overpriced.A hundred bucks is a lot to ask, but the studios will keep asking it because they know desperate geeks like myself will pay it.Well, to [bad word] with that.

The character of Brisco County Jr. shows Bruce Campbell as a youthful and handsome fellow.

When it came up on offer I dived on it. It is a very entertaining sci-fi/comedy western with none other than Bruce Campbell, star of the Evil Dead movies. An excellent show with a variety of characters and storylines. A must see for any Bruce Campbell fans out there."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great family fun!","review":"Our family started watching Brisco County when our children were 5 years old and we needed \\"down time\\" for mom and dad before bedtime for our triplets. This series was and still is perfect! No bad language, sex scenes or anything else we don't want small children to hear or see.16 years later, I just found this series again- after talking about Bruce Campbell (and seeing him on tv-now on Burn Notice) for years! We put the first DVD in and one of the kids keeps saying \\"I remember this\\" or \\"Thats where I saw him\\"! There are a lot of well-known faces that started in that show.What wonderful family evenings we have remembering and enjoying this series all over again. And now our 13 year old is loving it, as are all of her friends!!Its still a great TV show, timeless in its one-liners and action scenes.

A very clever series that just about anyone will enjoy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Only one season...???","review":"I was highly disappointed. Not in the quality of this series. But the fact that it is only 1 season long. The main story line is somewhat generic and you know how it's going to end come the last few episodes of the season. Or do you? Plus the individual story lines in each episode are expertly written. Quite a few twists to keep you on your toes. Not many western-style shows out there anyway. Plus this one kicks it in with a bit of sci-fi. Not a whole lot though. Just enough to make it something totally different. Bruce Campbell brings the character to life. Makes him seem like a normal, everyday guy. The supporting cast also does a great job. Makes you kind of sympathize with them at times. It's always the best of shows that never make it to season 2. I highly recommend Brisco County Jr. Even for those that dont think they'd be interested in a western type setting. Buy this series."},{"rating":"2","title":"great","review":"this was a great show to grow up to, even though it was only on for two years. I was a little too young to get some of the humor, but I loved the mood and the action sequences as well as the theme song! Whenever I hear the song, it makes me feel like a superhero and it reminds me of the good times I had watching the show as a kid."},{"rating":"2","title":"sci-fi western","review":"Reminds me a little of the Wild Wild West (not the pathetic movie) and Indiana Jones. Loved Army of Darkness and all the Evil Dead movies which all had a common denominator...Bruce Campbell. I think he is a very underrated actor. He is just a very likable actor so pretty much what ever movie he's in you'll enjoy it. Live Long and Prosper Bruce!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great show that deserved more time.","review":"Many of you have either read the other reviews or have watched Brisco before, so you know it's a great series. The show gets 5 stars, but the price gets a .5 star. MSRP of $99 and sale at $70 - that just plain ridiculous. No DVD for a single TV season should ever be over $50 period. X-Files even went down to $35. What's really funny is when a show debuts at an exorbitantly high price and then three months later costs $25- proving we were being ripped off at the start. Don't let shows follow the HBO DVD model, hold on to your money until when the price goes down - and it always does, fairly quickly too. Support Brisco but don't get gypped in the process."},{"rating":"2","title":"IT'S ABOUT FREAKIN' TIME!!","review":"I have been waiting FOREVER for this to finally be released. I am so exictied.

I absolutely loved it. Humor, subtle (and not so subtle) modern references sprinkled throughout, cool cameo appearances, and plenty of Western style action. A must have for any Bruce Campbell fans."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brisco County,Jr.","review":"I don't much care for Westerns and like Science Fiction even less. However,the combination of both genres into one finished product called BRISCO COUNTY,JR equals an exciting and amusing good time. I loved this show when it was on TV in 1993-94, and over the years talked about it to many people who had never even heard of it. It was good to see the entire series in one boxed set and at such an affordable price. This is a fun experience, and a couple of episodes right before bed is good medicine."},{"rating":"2","title":"Can You Believe","review":"An intertaining show from 93-94 with Bruce Campbell as a bounty hunter inpursuit of the gang that killed his father and liberated villain John Blythe. Good production values on the most entertaining show it's kind since THE WILD WILD WEST. Interesting, Fox believed this show would be a big success and the show after it would sink. The show after was THE X-FILES!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Selective memories...","review":"I love Bruce. Big Evil Dead fan. Watched this show when it was on air when I could and was happy when the dvds came out.However, after watching the show again, it just wasn't nearly as funny as I remembered it to be. Guess I just remember the highlights (\\"You touched Pete's piece! Nobody touches Pete's piece.\\") with a lot of fondness. Having to sit through all the stuff in between the great lines was almost painful. I got through most of the first year but then simply had to stop. I prefer to have the pleasent memories of the series over what was being done to those memories having to sit through them all these years later.Thank god Burn Notice is out so I can at least have a really good show to fall back on and enjoy the antics of the great Campbell."},{"rating":"2","title":"Everything you want in a sic-fi-Western","review":"I so enjoyed this series was sorry it ended.Proves you can be entertained with outbad language and loud back ground sounds.The DVD's arrived in great shape."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great show","review":"I'm enjoying this series even more on DVD than I did when it was on TV.

It was funny and great action. The biggest surprise in the show for me (don't remember which episode it was)happened when Brisco Jr. and Lord Bowler were staying in a barn one night. Lord Bowler , the rough tough bounty hunter and Brisco Jr's rival, sings the gospel song \\"Amazing Grace\\". He sang it beautifully and I'm gonna buy the show just so my wife can hear that, but I suspect that we will be watching the show many times just because we all need a laugh and to forget the real world!

It's really too bad it didn't get picked up for a second season, though it's really the writer's fault on that. They set up that great Orb storyline, then proceeded to botch it beyond anything a first year soap writer could have come up with. It never recovered from that point. If you listen to the writer's commentary it's self-congratulatory tripe, but you can glean that they were working on such a tight time table, that's why continuity was sometimes lacking. This set is a nice walk down memory lane, but you'll find that the memories were sweeter than the reality."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brisco Worth the Wait","review":"It's been a long time a-comin', but this package was worth the wait. We had almost lost hope that a legitimate release of these episodes was forthcoming, but congrats to those who pushed forward and made this a reality...it's hard to believe that this series is over ten years old! Though obviously inspired by serials that influenced George Lucas and his ilk, it's surprising the teleseries that The Adventures of Brisco County itself has influenced (it's hard to imagine Eureka without Brisco's tongue-in-check good naturedness). Obviously, this is highly recommended, and presented in a wonderful format."},{"rating":"2","title":"I love this show so much","review":"Before there was Firefly, there was Brisco County Jr...

So, that said - this is a great CD set. Lots of intensity, the deep grooves that their shows are full of, and the large amount of new material is great. The jams and changes to the studio versions are there - and they work - but they keep them controlled enough so that no one should be asking \\"when will this end?\\".There are so many great tracks. \\"When The World Ends\\" has a great feel to it on this disc, and \\"Don't Drink the Water\\" is a great kick-off song. There are no duds here - this was a great set to use on an album.The best thing about a studio album is that you can pop it in and feel the intensity of the material. That happens here - and I look forward to many listens in the future."},{"rating":"2","title":"Less Than Great","review":"Kind of a sub-par dmb show but compared to most everything out there it's still pretty good.

The CD opens a little weak but gets much better once Don't Drink the Water begins. So Right is solid and Bartender is an absolute jam as Dave's vocals soar to new heights to the tune of some unbelievable violin play. Much of the first disc is off of the Everyday and Busted Stuff CDs. However, the second disc delves into earlier DMB as well as a cover of All Along the Watchtower. In the end, Live at Folsom Field has about 16-17 good to great songs. It is definetly worth the money!"},{"rating":"2","title":"One of their great live performances!","review":"If your an avid fan of the Dave Matthews Band then you will love this CD, and if your not then its got a great variety of their songs that will leave you wanting more.

I am unimpressed. I'm not sure why DMB is fond enough of the 2001 tour to select a show from it to release. It was uninspiring, in my opinion, at best. I love this band, and I love their music, but I'm not a fan of this album. There needs to be more spontaneity. I'm tired of hearing the same songs on live releases over and over. DMB has become a \\"magnet for money,\\" and sometimes I think it's all they care about. This Everyday-packed live release will certainly sell well with many, but not me. I'll take my 20 bucks elsewhere. I'll also take my 50 bucks for a concert ticket and spend that on 5-6 club shows where I can see more inspired, hungrier live acts like Agents of Good Roots."},{"rating":"1","title":"another live album?","review":"It seems that Dave Matthews band can no longer put together a valid studio album, and so have settled for 'another' live album.

I would feel ripped off if I went to a DMB concert and did not hear \\"Crush\\" - which is a song that I actually enjoy listening to its full 8-9 minute version, unlike other DMB stretched-out songs I hear on this album.So, are you into rock or are you into \\"jam bands\\" and gospel?

So I don't think it would be good for any child younger than 4.All that said--he just loves this toy. Even his 8 yr old sister wants to join in, and it seems to hold his interest a long time, which is rare. The box is very sturdy and is holding up well, even though it got rained on one day!

Since then I wear them ANY chance I get as they can be dressed up or dressed down. They can be a tough boot to last all day in but I found that I am quite used to them now and LOVE THEM. Beautifully made, soft buttery leather, and a nifty pocket for storing stuff if your jeans are too tight or wearing a skirt/dress. They felt true to size for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Okay","review":"This is not a fun book to read. It's like an old textbook in a community college.

The wand is decent quality, simulated wood grain plastic. The glasses are quite huge on my 4 yr old as is the cape. The cape itself is of good quality, but needs hemmed...big time.

The pogo stick wasn't structurally true, as the handles weren't parallel to the foot pegs! Additionally, one of the handles was shaped lower than the other and where the metal was curved/bent (handles and the body) it had small stress fractures. Beyond that, it seemed decent quality materials for the price. Did not contact the company for resolution/replacement, so uncertain if this is an exception for their product. Hopefully this won't be your experience."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great item!","review":"My son loves this pogo stick and hasn't stopped bouncing since Christmas. He wanted an upgrade from his old one and couldn't be happier. It is rated for over 120 lbs. and my son is only 90, but since he already was good at it, it works fine.

The end of the album drags a little, maybe this isn't a quality of the songs issue, just an exhaustion issue; a question of how much you can take. Nonetheless, \\"Tuff Luck\\" and \\"Sometimes I Forget\\" may outwear their welcome at 5+ and 6+ minutes respectively. But \\"Berlitz,\\" the ironically titled opener to a what is virtually a concept album about the failure of communication, sets a high bar with its ringing guitars and a almost documentary look at a collapsing relationship: \\"I've forgotten the words again/ But I'm sure and I'm sure and I'm sure/ It sounds right, but the words come out so wrong/ Am I driving you crazy?\\" Highly underrated band--all four of their albums are worth checking out."},{"rating":"1","title":"kinda weak","review":"I'm not too familiar with \\"Seam\\", but this album is kinda weak.

The seller indicates that it is NOT waterproof and NOT windproof, just water resistent, however, the day after we setup the tent with had winds of 30-40 mph and very heavy rain and the tent survived without any problems at all.

I would not recommend this for a child that plays like a child. My daughter only pushed this around the house with her dolls in it and this is what happened in less then 2 weeks of use.

The author's descriptions, his uncritical acceptance of information that fits his preconceptions, and his attempts to create suspicions from seemingly innocuous facts, suggests that the matter is personal.

An excellent example of how a fascinating and riveting history can be made tiresome."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not my kind of book","review":"What is so bad about people starting a business that mushrooms and has some control over an industry and the people it represents? This author had something against Jules Stein, Lew Wasserman, their wives, the employees, you name it-right from the beginning. And he is determined to prove I guess how awful they were and how big and corrupt their business is. I don't think there's any reason for a expose of MCA and the people who ran it. If it wasn't them it would have been someone. Plus, I do not like books that go on and on about politics in government OR within a company structure and I don't care about courtroom hassles and lawsuits. So this book wasn't really for me.

With Jim Bakker's candid input to the book of \\"I Was Wrong\\", I could see much much more clearly the inside and widely complexing fall of the PTL empire.

By the end of the book, I found myself wishing I could sit down and talk to Jim on his farm, devoid of all the trappings of his former life of excesses. I could not put this book down, and found myself brought to tears, literally, several times; namely, the humiliation he experienced in prison, and the poignant moments he described between himself and his family and true friends. On the whole, I felt that his story was quite sincere, and after reading it, my opinion changed from loathing to having a respect and understanding for the man as a human being, flaws and all. Not being a religious person, the parts that described his interpretations of Bible passages were slow-going for me, but I stuck with it and was glad I did."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not their best but still KILLDOZER!!","review":"This band defies you to sit on the fence.

My husband was in the U.S. Marines for twenty year of his young-adult life, and had the opportunity to have met Chesty on occasion before he passed away.

My husband and I, both Marine veterans wanted to meet him and have him sign our book. I guess I was really impressed by what he signed, \\"Thanks for your service.\\" \\"WHAT?!\\", I thought. I should be thanking him for HIS service. I was very saddened and dismayed that he killed himself. The horrors of Vietnam really did, in the end, kill him after all.

Four images lined up together on one negative make an interesting format. The 'look' of the camera made many people think I was pointing a squirt gun at them!

Personally, I wish the images were divided along the horizontal plane (panoramic) rather than the vertical plane. ....The film advance system and the exposure of each individual lens is inconsistent. In my camera the first image is underexposed by about a 1/2 of a stop and I believe that the film advance gears have already broken contributing to the advance problem.

The book was very disappointing. It was hard to care for any of the characters or to even understand their motives and behavior.

The series speaks to the neurobiology of addiction by showing brain scans and discussing the dopamine system with some frequency.

Some of my students complain that the videos let addicts off too easily by not holding them responsible for their addictions.

I can't believe the number of high ratings this book has received. I can't believe anyone liked this thing.There are certain things heroic characters do not do. Things that make them, in fact, a villain. Things like telling a woman you're going to kill her father and then force her to marry you. This is something the most despicable of villains does. This is also something Carillon does. And despite my clinging to the hope that he'd have a moment of sanity and realize that his plans made hima disgusting, deplorable human being, he carried through with these plans.I feel nothing but utter contempt for this character, and for the author who expects readers to like a book about a man who is nothing better than a rapist."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty standard, enjoyable, easy fantasy reading","review":"Roberson doesn't break much new ground in this book. The characters and plot are standard fantasy material; a young prince intending on reclaiming his usurped throne; an evil sorcerer standing in the way; the beautiful, haughty daughter of the usurper. These, however, are not criticisms. I didn't want to stop reading. Roberson takes these standard themes and employs them expertly, and even manages to introduce a few twists. What's lacking in originality is made up for by the detail and the slow, steady development of characters. In the fantasy genre, I would not go so far as to call this a classic, but Roberson's unique use of such typical themes puts it on a special level apart from the other cliches."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Choice","review":"Although I have not had a chance to read this book cover to cover, I skimmed through much of it and found that it has an overwhelming amount of great information for the Michigan Paddler.

The parents of nine children, they devoted much of their lives to this cause, particularly during the decade of the 1970s. This book is the story of that crusade, compiled in newspaper clippings, press releases and other papers Mr. Lawrence saved over the years. It is a unique two-volume historical work that could serve as a road map for present parent activists. The ironic development, which happened too late to make it into this book, is that the school system that worked to thwart him at every turn in the 1970s, last year approved for use in the public schools curriculum Mr. Lawrence's second book, an autobiography titled \\"Something Will Come Along.\\" Both books are fascinating reading."},{"rating":"1","title":"This one sucks!!!","review":"I bought one of these at Home Depot and it was broken out of the box.

If you intend to use it in any kind of a moderate ambient noise environment, it's a bad buy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Drops calls at radom and phne keypad numbers rub off","review":"Purchased this upscale phone for Home Office use. After a few months noticed calls would randomly drop and phone goes dead in the middle of a call. Also, and most annoying, is after 6 months of home office normal use (avg 5-8 calls a day), the numbers on the keypad wear off. So now I am looking at 12 (correction 11, the * key is still legible) all black buttons which makes dialing correctly a challenge. Hard to believe a phone this expensive would have cheap decals for numbers and no remedy. Called Polycom and they had no answer other than buy a new phone. NOT !!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy this phone","review":"I assumed I was buying the Cadillac of desktop phones. I've gotten scolded by co-workers when daring to use the speaker phone function because I apparently sound like I'm under water. The headset, on the other hand, is so sensitive people can hear me breathing on conference calls. My Jabra Pro wireless headset buzzes with some kind of electronic feedback. And there is nothing in the documentation to address these issues."},{"rating":"1","title":"Polycom sells out","review":"I bought this based on Polycom's stellar reputation and my experience with their conference phones in the corporate world. It was a dog from the word go. Massive static on the handset which numerous calls to tech support and replaced cords couldn't rectify. All of this would be OK except that in the end they didn't step up and admit I had a lemon so now I'm stuck with an expensive phone that I don't use because it's very unreliable. Mostly I'm disappointed in Polycom, I expected more from them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Reliability","review":"I read all the reviews about this phone not working and didn't believe it. Polycom speaker phones work great in businesses I've been to! Never tried a consumer one though and now after having it for 1 day am ready to return it. Got all the symptoms described in other posts... 1- Phone gets warm 2- Makes buzzing sound 3- Stops working completely. All buttons stop functioning until I unplug it and plug it back in again.Unfortunately the negative posts look like they are reality! I'm returning this piece of junk."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unreliable microphone","review":"I have had this phone for over a year, and am regretting every day that I did not return it. The speaker quality is great, but the microphone is completely unreliable. You have to be right in front of the phone, preferably slightly above the receiver to be heard.Also I do a lot of conference calls during which I sometimes remain silent for several minutes. It seems like this completely messes up with the signal processing algorithm of the phone, which tries to sort out voice from noise. The end result is that when it is my turn to speak in a call there is a good 30 seconds during which I people on the other end of the line can barely hear me. I usually end up picking up the receiver, which defies the purpose of this $250 phone..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Auto Interior Paint","review":"This product is great if the spray can actually works.

All the episodes were great. Charlie Sheen is famous and I like that so I like the episodes and just watching them. When the box set came out, I sold all of my single season DVDs and bought it but now I do not like this show anymore so I recommend buying each season separately."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than ever. Silk Degrees","review":"We have been waiting for a long time for this to be re-mastered and re-released. Sometimes I am not thrilled with the sound of the remastered versions. It seems that so much more can be done, like with the recent re-release of ELO's Out of the Blue (which is very good, but could have been better). Silk Degrees comes alive on this version. The songs, of course, are wonderful, as anyone looking at this already knows and probably has owned it in more than one format. The sound is what draws you in and will keep you coming back, I know I will. Hopefully the rest of the wonderful Scaggs releases will get the same treatment. Be sure to buy this one and maybe there will be more."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of His Best","review":"With the exception of \\"Jump Street\\", I really like this varied collection of songs.

Whether its smooth ballads like Harbor Lights and We're All Alone, smooth pop(What Do You Want The Girl To Do, Lowdown, Georgia) or flat out rockers(Jump Street, Lido Shuffle) this album cooks from start to finish without a single weak point. Th Future Toto Band Members and Little Feat's Fred Tackett make nice contributions in support of Boz. Its amazing how Boz never duplicated the success of this fine recording, although he had a couple of other decent songs. None the less, ignore the last reviewer's comments and buy this winner."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent work","review":"This is one of my favorites from my man Boz Scaggs. I love Boz Scaggs since I was 7 or 8 years old. Originally it was the first album I grew up as a fan to the R&B;/Ol' School world. Every since I luv that album, it change how the way I feel now. The songs that most interested me are my favorites of today: What Can I Say, Georgia, Harbor Lights, Jump Street, Lowdown, It's Over, Lido Shuffle, and We're All Alone (which was basically by Lisa Coolidge or whatever).Every song I love on this album is truly a blessing to me. This is highly recommended as a must-have who loves smooth jazz, R&B;, blues, disco, rock, etc. and especially who loves Steely Dan, Simply Red, Miles Davis, Barry White, Bobby Caldwell, etc."},{"rating":"2","title":"What can I say","review":"This is a solid performace by Boz Scaggs.

I will read this book to them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not good for young children","review":"Too much emphasis was put on the birth mother. Although I am greatful for birth mothers, adoption books should be about the child and his/her needs over the needs of the birth mother. It was recommended by an adoption group and we read it to our 5 year old. He cried for a long time afterwards because he could not understand why the baby could not be with his mother. I threw it away and will not recommend it to anyone for kids under 10."},{"rating":"2","title":"Heart warming and clever","review":"This is a gentle way to introduce the young adoptee to the love of the human birthmother, and there is no need for the child fully to conceptualize yet the concepts of birth and adoption. Brodzinsky very cleverly introduces the fact to very young children that there was no father bird to help, that he had flown away long before the mother built her nest and laid her pale blue egg. The images of the mother bird and her struggles will instill love in the children for the little mother bird and at the same time love for the birthmother is sown and admiration for how hard she tried to protect her baby through all the storms, but failed to do so. The adoptive parents of the little bird are also shown to be loving and understanding of the baby's occasional grief. A charming story.Gisela Gasper Fitzgerald, author of ADOPTION: An Open, Semi-Open or Closed Practice?"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Mulberry Bird","review":"We read the original version to our adopted daughter until she was old enough to read it herself.

The topic of marijuana is so controversial these days that it's hard to find information that is not completely skewed in either pro or anti-marijuana use. Usually \\"facts\\" are used only to promote one side of the other and other facts are conveniently omitted. Earleywine takes on the subject with objectivity, intelligence, and a very fine wit. The book is excellently written, with enough facts and science for any hardened scientist and enough clarity for the layperson. I fully recommend it to anyone interested in this subject, and even those who are not!

EJB has bad performance though, it is a well-known fact, no need to say lots on the point. This book is like an advertisement for Spring Framework, but no directly and clear outline of Spring.

He has written two other books, IN DEFENSE OF PURE REASON and THE STRUCTURE OF EMPIRICAL KNOWLEDGE.This book takes as his departure the Cartesian program. Much of the book is a discussion of various epistemological problems analyzed in light of responses to Descartes. (For example, Plato and Aristotle are barely mentioned, and Aquinas isn't mentioned at all.) Many of the current issues in epistemology are discussed, such as foundationalism versus coherentism, and sense-data and adverbial theories of perception. There is a lengthy critique of Quine's \\"naturalized epistemology.\\"This book is part of a new series called ELEMENTS OF PHILOSOPY, which is edited by Robert Audi.

The shifting moods of the music are the whole point of the album, not its downfall. The four talented virtuosos on this album were capable of playing absolutely ANY style of music, and they put these six selections through the \\"jazz cuisinart,\\" so to speak. The result is stimulating, adventurous, and occassionally humorous music. Everyone really lets loose on the first track, which makes one wonder why these musicians are all so underrated.

The new songs \\"Electrical Storm\\" and \\"The Hands that Built America\\" are excellent and the songs picked from Achtung Baby, Zooropa, Pop and All That You Can't Leave Behind are good. I like the remixes of the Pop songs but am dissapointed they left off \\"Please\\" and \\"Last Night on Earth\\". Is this a must have CD? No, not really... I would buy the other CD's instead but if you are looking for a good compilation this is worth buying. I wouldn't waste my money on buying the 2 CD set, the B-sides on disc 2 are mostly garbage."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good, but not their 'Best'","review":"I give this album 4 out of 5 stars because the songs are pretty good, especially the new stuff and the remixes. However, some songs were on there that I don't feel should have been on there (i.e.-Discotheque, The First Time, Stuck in a Moment) while some of U2's best work was left off (i.e.-So Cruel, Who's Gonna Ride Your Wild Horses, Walk On). That being said, the best thing about U2 is that they make such dynamic, powerful music, that each song appeals to different people. So some serious U2 fans may really like Discotheque and think it should be on there while some don't. But I think for the casual U2 fan or someone just getting into U2 (which is usually who Best of albums target), this album doesn't really reflect upon their best work. In my mind, about 75% of these songs deserve to be here. The rest are songs that, although good songs, are not U2's best work and are on this album in place of some good songs that definately should have been here in their place."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good but. . .","review":"the main complaint I have is that we don't need remixes when the original songs are so much more amazing. That said, U2 remians a vital, complex band who perform some of the best written songs in rock today. I would add that the Bsides are often better than some of the singles the band releases."},{"rating":"2","title":"The second 'Best Of' compilation from U2","review":"This compilation album covers the 1990-1999 decade of U2 and includes some great songs. Whilst not at good as the first decade 'Best Of', U2 is still a powerhouse in the folk rock'n'roll scene even now. The album opens up with 3 superhits of U2; 'Even Better Than The Real Thing', 'Mysterious Ways' and 'Beautiful Day'. The album moves into the newer sound style of U2 with a more upbeat rock sound and the continuation of Bono's typical emotional singing. The songs of 'One' and 'Stay' are also included in this 'Best Of' and are great songs for a party atmosphere. The latter part of the album revels in classic songs being remixed/re-edited including 'Numb' and 'Dicotheque'. These new mixes previously unrealeased are good but the originals remain top-stuff. The new mix of 'Staring At The Sun' is also worth a listen.This CD is for any fan of U2 and wants good music in their music library."},{"rating":"1","title":"Missing songs, weak songs, unnecessary new songs...","review":"To many song missing, instead we have some new song just to trick the fans into buying this CD.

Although in my opinion, I feel zooropa and pop are the band's weakest efforts, this cd manages to pull out the best tracks from both albums; further adding to the magnificent array of pop rock that is u2.

Wells was a historian, journalist, and sociologist as well as being a novelist. In his story When the Sleeper Wakes all of his interests are combined in the telling of the Sleeper's story, the story of a man who fell asleep in the nineteenth century and woke up in the year 2100 to find that he owns half of the world. This book that walks the edges of science fiction and science fact shows a futuristic society that, for all of its technological advances, has not much improved.When the Sleeper Wakes is an interesting read as long as you have the patience for the way it is worded. The twists and turns it takes you on to describe an equally messy world will drive you to see if the tangle resolves itself. Just this story is quite worth the whole book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ten Stars Worth Reading - A Thinking Man's Novel.","review":"A short review: To me this book brought out many things.This is a thinking person's Science Fiction Book.What it truly means to be human.What is life and what is death.There are so many facets to this book that to try to describe them would take pages.Just when you think you know where Robert Charles Wilson is headed with this there's always a new twist.I'm glad I read this and to me anyway, this work far surpasses most other works of Science Fiction.Be warned, this book will bring out questions and emotions in you. It will challenge the way you perceived life and death."},{"rating":"2","title":"i love this camera","review":"outdoor pictures come out really good. not really for indoor use, even if you do have good lighting. you just have to be careful when you take it to the beach and trying not to touch the lens."},{"rating":"2","title":"Free Film!","review":"Mine included free 800 asa film! Did not read that in the descrition. The price is high! Wish it was cheaper! It is like a 35mm automatic camera without the batteries and a flash. I plan to have negatives only developed. Hope to save on the cost and then have my scanner that can scan in negatives to the computer. Scanner is the Canon mfr. CanoScan D660u. (is a USB connector). I believe it is avail here at Amazon.com. I have also heard of a Fuji 1x use 8 lens camera for golfing swing analysis. I wonder if it is cheaper!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A definate must-buy.","review":"I bought this book looking for inspiring ideas for wedding flowers - I was NOT disappointed. This book is perfect for the bride-to-be who is sick to death of boring, uninnovative floral arrangements. The pictures are stunning and inspiring, and the book gives lots of detail overall. The book cover reveals that Mr. Connolly has been featured in Vogue - it is not hard to see why. This is definately the best wedding related purchase I've made so far!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Quite Disappointed!","review":"Contrary to the one other reviewer of this book, I was very dissappointed. I want a traditional wedding with a flare. This book shows very out of the ordinary flower ideas that everyday people will not and cannot use. However, the book does show a few nice 'flowers in your hair' ideas, but for the price of this un-inspiring book, it is Not worth it. Spend your money elsewhere."}]`),B={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:E},data(){return{visibleCount:6,poemsData:O,isLoading:!1}},computed:{visiblePoems(){return this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(o=>setTimeout(o,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=6,this.isLoading=!1}}},x={class:"card-container"},C=["disabled"],M={key:0},N={key:1};function H(o,e,n,u,r,s){const c=w("PoemCard");return a(),i("section",null,[e[1]||(e[1]=t("div",{class:"top-banner"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🎉 Your SNAP 🥳")])],-1)),t("div",x,[(a(!0),i(y,null,f(s.visiblePoems,(h,g)=>(a(),p(c,{key:g,poem:h},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),s.hasMorePoems?(a(),i("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",disabled:r.isLoading,onClick:e[0]||(e[0]=(...h)=>s.loadMore&&s.loadMore(...h))},[r.isLoading?(a(),i("span",N,"Loading...")):(a(),i("span",M,"See more"))],8,C)):b("",!0)])}const W=d(B,[["render",H],["__scopeId","data-v-8053a7ed"]]),P=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"library/32.md","filePath":"library/32.md"}'),R={name:"library/32.md"},L=Object.assign(R,{setup(o){return(e,n)=>(a(),i("div",null,[v(W)]))}});export{P as __pageData,L as default};
