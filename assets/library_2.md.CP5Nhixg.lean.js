What a piece of garbage! The hood did not stay in place with the velcro and the bedding looked so dirty. Unfortunately, I now had no time to shop for something else for a shower, so I asked a friend if she could help me. we lined it with a beautiful material and looped bows thru the basket and the hood to keep it in place. It looked fabulous, but cost me another $50, but i would have been much too embarrassed to present the original basket as a gift. look elsewhere if you are looking for a basket."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheap construction!","review":"I bought this on sale for $29.99 after reading reviews stating that it was much nicer than the other brands available that were flimsy and used Velcro on the hoods. I thought this meant that neither were a problem with this particular basket, but boy was I wrong. The mattress was thrown in the basket crooked and by the time I received it the basket was completely misshapen and unstable even for a doll. The hood attached with Velcro and had been pushed flat inside the basket so it wouldn't even stay on when I attempted to attach it. The entire thing was very cheap and not even worth $10 let alone the $60 it costs at full price. I'm sure I just got a bad apple with the misshapen basket, but that still doesn't make up for the shoddy construction and cheap materials used."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not buy this","review":"I registered for this bassinet and the jolly jumper rocker to go with it.

It fails to mention that the hood has to be attached when you receive it- and that it is attached with VELCRO. But that is not the biggest problem- the mattress did not fit snuggly in the basket- there was a sizable gap all the way around between the matress and the basket.

I'd picked it out based on the info I derived from the internet, and returned it as soon as it came in the mail. Shoddy craftsmanship all around, from the flimsy material the basket itself is made from to the ill-fitting \\"fitted\\" sheet and the loose material and shoddy sewing on the bumper. In addition, I guess it's buyer beware for things that aren't spelled out explicitly--this Moses basket comes with a warning NOT to use the handles or even move the basket while the baby is inside. That's specifically WHY I wanted a moses basket to begin with--so that I could carry the basket from room to room without having to wake the baby up. Save yourself the hassle and skip this cheaply made basket.

I saw of the few places the bumper was tied to the basket that one was broken, and I pulled lightly on another tie - poof! broke off. A newborn would have same strength, and you'd find the newborn with the bumper pad over him/her. I thought the product was very dangerous, and it made me angry that such poor craftsmanship is being sold for newborns."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I was disappointed by what I thought was flimsy construction when I received this basket. The bedding didn't fit properly, the sides of the basket were kind of flopping over, the handles hung into the basket and would always be in the way. It just didn't seem sturdy enough. The weaving joined right at the top rim of the basket and looked like it was coming apart. I couldn't picture carrying my baby in it. My husband's first comment when he took it out of the box was, \\"Looks like it's worth about $40.\\" I returned the item.

Jim Morrison was a wonderful poet and songwriter, if not the nicest guy in the world. Yes, its true. these songs are all GREAT songs, but I can only recommend this CD to those who could care less about any of their songs but the ones you hear on the radio. And in fact if you are that type of person, I recommend you stay away from the Doors altogether and find yourself a nice commercial band from the 60's, like the Beach Boys or something. I had this CD for about a month before I got real, bought their albums, and then gave this one away. Start with the Doors' first album, then Strange Days, and L.A. Woman. If you really like the Doors you will not be disappointed by these three."},{"rating":"1","title":"terrible mix","review":"I have to agree with the other reviewers who point out the poor mix on this compilation. The vocals are both low in volume and rather muddled. Compare it toThe Best Of The Doors(apparently out of print due to all these reissues, but many available used), which is much brighter and clearer, with Morrison's voice being front and center. We're not talking about audiophile-level discrimination, you only have to listen to Amazon's samples to hear a huge difference. I'm especially surprised at the number of people who say they're longtime fans and liked this mix, because even if you've only heard the songs on the radio they clearly lack the \\"Doors sound\\" on this album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Break On Through","review":"What can I say that hasn't already been said. Every song that the Doors put on this album could easily have been #1 hits if they were re-released as singles today. If you are just getting into the Doors and you really enjoy this album, I would suggest buying their first 6 studio albums. For obvious reasons, they couldn't include all of their songs on this album, so buying their studio albums will alow you to adventure deeper into the Dark Hypnotic music of the Doors. No Doors compilation album would be complete without Back Door Man, Soul Kitchen, Yes the River Knows, Peace Frog, The Soft Parade, Gloria, Love Street, Not to Touch The Earth, Shamans Blues, Wild Child, The Spy, and The Changeling. The Doors are simply, the Best Rock-n-Roll band of all-time. MR MOJO RISIN"},{"rating":"2","title":"The greatest band ever!","review":"I would give this band more than five stars if I could.

There is some chat before a song or two and a new little guitar national anthem prelude to LA Woman..all which is of interest..but on this new REMIX - especially on the tracks from the first album, it sounds like they put some light echo on Morrison and then buried his vocals back into the music some. I just wish they had expanded the Best of the Doors to this full track listing and not tweaked with the mixes for the most part. I do like the Break on Through \\"she get's high\\" back in the song as it should have been. Tried to up the one star I had given it before but it wouldn't let me. Two stars for tweaking with the sound..but five star for selections."},{"rating":"1","title":"Morrison's voice is buried in the remix","review":"I have to agree with some of the other negative reviews. While listening to this compilation, I found myself straining to hear Morrison's vocals. Botnik's remix has definitely lowered the volume of the lead vocals in relation to the rest of the music.

The only complaint I have is that my other cd's play louder--- I have to turn up the volume every time I put this one in. Of course I have to consider that maybe that is what the music of the doors does to you. You Want to play it loud.

Thanks again!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The Best of The Doors","review":"Worth a listen as a decent pop album, but the Doors must surely be credited with being the most overrated band of all time. One wonders if they would have retained their popularity if Jim Morrisson had become bald, old and fat with his contempories. Nothing creates a 'legend' like a death at the peak of poularity, just look at James Dean, Marilyn Monroe etc. Now don't get me wrong every self-respecting rock fan should have a Doors album but how long are the remaining Doors going to bleed this thing for? I see they have now released 'The Very Best of The Doors' to follow up on 'The Best of The Doors'. Oooh ! Let's hope we soon have 'The Very, Very best of the Doors'. Keep on milking it boys."},{"rating":"1","title":"Skip this one","review":"The music on this CD is great, but the selection is very disjointed. If you're looking for an intro to the Doors, pick up the single CD Greatest Hits.

Poor choice. I could have bought the single-CD greatest hits for a few bucks less and wouldn't have had to sit through the filler to get to the good stuff. I think this CD is good for those that love music that's very alternative and tripped out. What I mean by this is that there are a lot of creative lyrics and musical styles in the set, but I found it to be very mediocre and tiresome. So, basically what I'm trying to say is find someone with some Doors and if you find that you LOVE it, buy this and you'll have a great bunch of tunes, but if you find that it doesn't really do much for you, buy the single-CD greatest hits. You'll be much happier and have the essentials. They did make some great music- but two CDs are too much for my taste."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yet Another Best Of...","review":"The Doors are dead.

But it didn't satisfy. The Doors had some great singles but that's just the frosting on the cake. You really have to hear everything they did to appreciate the Doors. Now I own just about everything by the Doors on CD including American Prayer, the studio albums, their box set and the two albums without Morrison(I still don't have \\"You need Meat\\" however). When it comes to making a compilation to listen to in my car, what I put together is very close to \\"Weird Scenes\\". With some additions and omissions.

But apart from this, The Doors do not have that much excitement to offer.This compilation should have been kept down to one CD, not a double-CD.But IF you really want to buy ONE The Doors album, then The Best Of The Doors is the right choice."},{"rating":"1","title":"They Could Have Fit On 1 CD","review":"I felt just 19 songs could have fit on 1 CD, didn't need 2.

Every song is a hit and though I came along a few years after Jim Morrison's untimely death, I appreciate the group for their innovative music and Morrison's I'll-do-what-I-feel-like-and-f everyone attitude (I'll always love his comment after the group's only performance on the Ed Sullivan Show in the late-60's).\\"The End\\" is an essential addition to a psychedelic soundtrack alongside other goodies such as The Chambers Brothers' and Iron Butterfly's 10 and 17 minute masterpieces \\"Time Has Come Today\\" and \\"In-A-Gadda-Da-Vida,\\" respectively.Even if you're not a die-hard Doors fan, you can't help but enjoy every single song on this collection."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Buy This","review":"In the 1980's the Doors' music was released on CD later than music from other groups. The first release available was this collection from 1985, which also came out on LP (the Doors individual studio albums, of which there were only six, were not issued on CD in 1987). However, with the summer 2003 release of the Doors' \\"Legacy\\", this collection is unnecessary and should be out of print. I will say that the song selection on \\"Very Best Of\\" is good. But the Doors only recorded 64 studio songs (including 2 non-LP B-sides), and while 19 of them are on \\"Very Best Of\\", 34 tracks (including a live track and an unreleased studio track) are on \\"Legacy\\", which represents 50 percent of the groups studio output. The sound on \\"Legacy\\" is also superior. Finally, my one objection in terms of song selection is that neither \\"Legacy\\" nor \\"Very Best Of\\" contain the track \\"The Soft Parade.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Collection","review":"This is a fairly good collection of Doors music.

She has hit upon what should have been the obvious question for all of the spate of recent political writers, both right and left -- how are the real folks doin? By tying her attacks on various aspects of the Bush presidency to the impact that the last three years have had on real individuals, she has made her arguments more persuasive and far more compelling. The book is a pleasure to read.And by the way, that begala-carville reviewer is one scary dude."},{"rating":"2","title":"Funny, smart, and inspirational","review":"Not only have I read this, but I have also attended a book signing given by her. I recommend this book, and I recommend seeing her in person. She's a feisty woman whose book documents some other feisty Americans, and she's trying to get us to be feisty. Her interviews lead to information about the choices those in charge have made affecting these Americans. Her only real complaint with Americans themselves is the great disconnect she's witnessed that prevents ordinary people from understanding how decisions made far away affect them. Ivins spells it out in no uncertain terms. Practically a companion volume to Michael Moore's \\"Dude, Where's My Country?\\", which I also recommend."},{"rating":"2","title":"Outstanding","review":"I hope people will wake up and see that we need a change!

The book has a lot of important facts, and it's well researched. But without Ivins' trademark humor, which is lacking here, it makes it a difficult pill to swallow. I know it's difficult to make light of Bush's policies, especially when they've hurt so many people. But there are books that do it, like Al Franken's Lies, Michael Moore's Dude, Where's My Country? and Jason Johnson's I Hate Bush and So Do You. I don't want to knock the book for not being funnier, but I warn you not to read it with a weak stomach."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thank goodness for so balanced and well written a book","review":"David Brooks in his recent New York Times article rightly bemoaned the fact that so much literature today is extremist (and implicity apologised for some of the material he wrote during the Clinton years). What is refreshing about Ivins is that she is incisive, witty, thorough - and totally lacking in the kind of extremist venom that discredits liberals and enables conservatives to write them off accordingly. She is neither Maureen Dowd nor Ann Coulter (to take examples fairly from both sides of the divide). So whether you are a Democrat or not, you should enjoy this book - if sensible Democrats like Ivins and sensible conservatives like Brooks prevailed, political commentary would be a much better place! This is a very helpful book to read as 2004 is upon us.

For instance, I wasn't aware of the background on the gutting of Superfund during the Gingrich years in congress, and then Bush's decision to let it run out of money.Whereas Franken is best listened to on tape, because his timing is so good, there's really nothing special about the audio version of this. Probably better to just read it."},{"rating":"2","title":"See?

If you think this is a contradiction, please see the review of \\"wiseguyrunj\\" ,the \\"republican.\\" (and look at the other books he/she reviewed). Really, I'm a democrat. And really wiseguyrunj is a republican. And really, all these 5 star reviewers actually bought the book and read it. Do you believe in the tooth fairy too?Seriously, Molly Ivins is NOT hilarious and insightful. As a Texan, she DOES NOT have the full scope of both how Bush first turned Houston into a #1 city (most pollution, that is), cut taxes to make him look good for president (leaving Texas with a $10 billion deficit in the next budget cycle), among other atrocities. And then moved on to the White House to enrich America.Bad book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Amazingly WRONG","review":"Books like this completely amaze me as they seek only to fuel peoples hatred. It's quite clear Ivins goal is to be among the elite crowd of Bush-haters by pointing out idividual cases of Americans misfortunes as oposed to the state of the entire nation.

The book is worth exactly $0.45 (that's new, AND in the hardcover!). Does that tell you anything? Alegations leveled from hypothetical theories and \\"behind closed door\\" accusations make this no more than a poor version of James Mann's \\"The Rebellion of Ronald Reagan\\". It's funny...all the glorious reviews from America's kook-fringe literary public voice could not push the price of this book up to an even buck.

There's nothing constructive here, just liberal whinning."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ivinswhacked","review":"Ivins is an idealogue who despises all conservatives and Republicans; her problem is not with Bush but rather with anyone who isn't liberal. The book makes this quite apparent. The book contains many half-truths to support her disdain for Bush. If Bush successfully helped bring about world peace, Ivins would lambast Bush for doing so, saying that Bush created world peace merely for political reasons. Remember that Kerry and Bill Clinton have stated publicly and unequivocally that Iraq possessed weapons of mass destruction and needed to be stopped at all costs. Ivins conveniently refuses to mention this fact in her politically skewed diatribe. Anyone could write a book saying similar things about the Clintons and Kerry. This book is no different from Ann Coulter's--only on the other side of the political spectrum. There's little concern for fairness and journalistic integrity in Ivins' book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wow... does anyone believe this stuff?","review":"I was interested in buying this book and read the above editorial review. I was shocked to see that they make the claim that Bush is the only president in history who cut taxes and waged a war at the same time. JFK cut taxes and fought the Vietnam War... You figure that a Democratic writer would remember JFK.I borrowed this book from a friend instead of buying it, and I'm glad I did. It was a waste of time, but at least it wasn't a waste of money. While she has some truth in her book, there is also quite a few lies/misconceptions/half-truths. I found myself dedicating more time to researching her claims then I did reading her book.I don't particularly like Bush and I am eager to see what motivates him, but why would I waste my time trying to seperate fact from fiction reading this book?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't have anything against liberals","review":"Liberals are necessary in our country, just like conservatives are necessary also.

According to the title - God plays dice - you may expect gospel, but it isn't. When you think about it: real gospel doesn't sing about God playing dice. Real gospel will sing about God working according to a vast eternal plan. But that is besides the point.This CD is good music to listen to. When I heard it for the first time, it made me think of the music of John Hiatt. After listening it several times, I came to the conclusion it is not John Hiatt-like music. Marty Baggen has his own sound and his own style. It's not the mainstream \\"I love you\\" music you hear all the time. It's more about \\"life is hard but it's still beautiful\\". Especially the piece \\"Ballad of Oswald\\" is my favourite.I would say: try this CD, you will enjoy it. It's good music to listen to and good lyrics as well. I'm looking forward to the second release of Marty Baggen."},{"rating":"2","title":"The XSLT book","review":"The buyrer should be aware the XSLT 2.0 runs only on the authors parser.

It has two critical flaws:1) It lacks any \\"New in 2.0\\" labels. Given the scope and mass of the book, having to reread the whole thing to find the deltas between versions 1 and 2 is criminal.2) Horrible, horrible usability.If you didn't read the first edition, then the content is worth overcoming the hurdles.

Nowadays he's a Buddhist, but he seems to have the same kind of wondering in each and every song, about how the world we live in is in fact. He carried the same torch Punks did, soulfully. I recognised 2 other songs but not quite agreeing on 'Natural', there he says 'if astrology shouldn't be, why it still is?'...In fact many things are here, that shouldn't be...But the fact he put issues of human rights and not just the usual love and peace on his albums have captured me right now..I am willing to order more of his albums, because his music is uplifting, and it with his lyrics are also spiritual, and rich. just rich and the fact it comes as pop genre, makes it a special kind of pop.

This is not only a great HoJo album, but a great album, period.To clear up some points raised by others: The extended version of \\"What Is Love\\" that is included on the cd is the original 12\\" version. The original vinyl LP contained the single edit (as does his \\"Best Of\\" cd).The final track, the instrumental \\"China Dance\\", was not on the original LP at all; rather, it was one of the \\"b\\" sides to the 12\\" of \\"Hide And Seek\\".I still love this album.

Dad's are likely buying this book because they're either single Dads trying to find help raising their daughters or sharing custody with someone with issues. He's constantly patting himself on the back, which would be OK a little, but it's endless. All of that I could live with, but then the religion gets so intense about half way through the book I had to stop reading. I'm OK with people believing what they want, just don't push it on the rest of us, or at least warn us so we don't waste our money on this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Less than impressive","review":"In you enjoy reading books where you have to search long and hard for specific, biblical content, this is a good choice. Granted, there's not a lot of specific Scripture to fathering little girls. Still, this is a very \\"secular\\" book.It's not all bad, of course, and some of the daddy-daughter stories the author shares are good. But then there's stuff like when he (jokingly...like he thinks it's funny) shares a story about one of his little girls masturbating in front of the TV. His alarmed wife tells him to do something and his answer is to simply tell his daughter to go to her room to engage in that activity...yeesh."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice concept, but too preachy/conservative","review":"This book was dissapointing because the authors political and religious views permeate what is otherwise a very positive model for fathering.

Father-son relationships are emphasized more often but father-daughter ones are just as crucial in forming adult self-esteem. Women who grow up to crave male attention like a drug and degrade themselves are sadly, and too often, the result of an absent or abusive father, or much worse ... father unknown and long gone. Although some men do make choices that don't serve their children, it would be helpful (at least) to educate parents on how permanent their choices can be for their offspring and the rest of society in general."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must read for every daddy of a daughter!","review":"Kevin Leman does it again!

It not only explains the acronyms, but also gives you the background to understand how we got where we are with web services today.The author then goes on to explain the benefits and pitfalls of adopting web services. He also suggests how your organization might adopt web services. He has really given this area some thought and it points out some things that will help you sell web services in your organization, if you are thinking of adopting the technology.He includes a couple of interviews with leaders in web service. It is interesting to hear the perspectives of people on the cutting edge of the technology.Combine all the above with the author's easy to read style, I can definitely recommend this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Out of effort !","review":"I ordered these steps for my 2012 Tacoma.

Very useful at malls and shopping centers. Carried the bags for several people at Christmas.

I keep it in my purse now (used to keep it with my diaper bag, but now that DS is 2yrs old, those are one and the same!) and use it with the stroller, shopping carts, etc. It comes in really handy at markets or the mall when you're going around to several different stores and you end up with a bunch of bags to carry. I just hang them on the Mommy Hook and go! Since I usually no longer have the front of the cart to place my purse in (because DS is sitting there nowadays), this is a handy and welcome tool. Then when I get home from grocery shopping, I load a bunch of bags onto the Mommy Hook and carry them all in without any pain or struggle! Super handy. This is definitely on my top ten list."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great little gadget!","review":"I use the mommy hook to keep my reusable shopping bags stored in the car so they don't end up everywhere. While shopping I hang the hook with the empty bags on the front of the grocery cart.

I am going to get another for my baby stroller, and who knows I may need more for other tasks."},{"rating":"1","title":"High hopes, but disappointed","review":"I had very high hopes for this product. Read awesome reviews and the hooks looked industrial strength. As a mom of a 6 year old and 9 month old twins, we frequently have a lot of stuff to drag around, so we were on the hunt for something strong. Initially these hooks worked great....we used them while traveling to hang the car seat bases from the stroller while walking through the airport. They are very strong hooks. We thought, \\"No problem for our day-to-day items.\\" They held grocery bags, my purse, extra toys- you name it. Then one day I took them out to clip on the stroller for a trip to the park and the spring mechanism broke. The clip wouldn't stay closed. Maybe just a bum hook, that happens. So we tossed it. About 3 days later the second hook gave. Couldn't keep that one closed either. We were very disappointed. Expected much more wear and durability out of the these hooks. :("},{"rating":"1","title":"Slides and broke within 4 months","review":"Not impressed with this hook.

So I bought the mommy hook so the diaper bag could be hanging back by me on the handle and free up space in the shopping cart (plus I didn't like it when my dd tried to sit on my jujube diaper bag in the cart) it's awesome it's out of the way and keeps it safe and secure. :) also easy access to the money at the checkout - wish I had bought this 5 yrs ago!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Excellent idea, flawed execution","review":"When I saw this product, I was thrilled. I thought it would be perfect to attach to the stroller to carry my purse and shopping bags when I took my little guy to the mall or out to an outlet center. But the first time I used the product with only a small purse and a bag with 3 baby outfits, the spring mechanism broke. The company provided a replacement, and the springmechanism on the replacement replacement broke after about a month. I received a third one as a gift, and that one's working, several months later...though I don't use it often any more."},{"rating":"2","title":"Must needed if your stroller is your main 'vehicle'","review":"We live in the city so we use our stroller to get everywhere.

All broke with very light use (ie a bag with a change of clothes for the baby, or a cooler with a bottle and snacks). The distributor of Mommy Hooks, Keen, sent replacements for free, but given that they all broke, what's the point?I finally got smart and purchased a proper Carabineer w/ a Carry Handle, which holds up to 150 pounds. The new Carabineer I purchased was less expensive than the Mommy Hook, but a million times better in terms of quality. I'm not worried about it breaking.Search Amazon for 7-3/4\\" Snap Hook: Carabineer Carry Handle with Soft-Grip\\" if you want to order one for yourself."},{"rating":"1","title":"Broke after only using it twice","review":"I heard wonderful things about the mommy hook so I decided to buy one and it broke after only using it twice.

Even though I have lots of other Le Creuset--of all sizes, I got this one to use every day because it has the quality features I rely on, and is as cute as can be!

I'm gonna see them play at Bowery tonight in NYC!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Not Their Best","review":"Fruitcake is an interesting band but this is not their best work.

The glue at the joints is uneven and the unit itself doesn't seem to be particularly robust.The bottom line is that, if you need to use your laptop for extended periods away from power outlets then this is a good product and definitely worth the money, but take care to not handle it too roughly as I doubt it will hold up."},{"rating":"1","title":"I dont like it.","review":"The Electrovaya PowerPads \\"Puff Up\\" and become very ugly and dangerous looking.

The ends are somewhat noticeable in the corner of my eyes. Works well for shooters, RTS, KOTR, WOW, hmm just about everything. Doom3, scary as hell... Completely encloses the ear. The really nice thing is that I can play games and HEAR what is going on. Also muffles outside noise. For movies on my PC (you need front, rear, and center/sub 1/8\\" stereo phone jacks) they again makes everything sharp. One star for that missing booming bass."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Headphones","review":"I play pc first person shooters. I have a good quality sound card.

However, Lincoln was a man and human, and he was not perfect. Many people judge him by his mistakes, and more revere the myth, but Lincoln grew as a man and leader. His views evolved for the betterment of both himself and his country. Judgement based on his myth or his faults are not valid. Oates' book shows Lincoln in his true human form with all his warts and abilities. My admiration of Lincoln grew with the image of him passing his weaknesses and errors and becoming a strong leader.This is a nice read about a true American hero. The author's book shows Lincoln in all his human ability. During the year celebrating the 200th birthday of Abraham Lincoln, this is a great book to read and understand the true Lincoln."},{"rating":"1","title":"old man with a view","review":"The book was a disappointing.

While every one of these songs brings back memories of that trip, the songs \\"Nine While Nine\\" and \\"Some Kind of Stranger\\" can lift me through time and bring me back to specific places long gone with a clarity of emotion like nothing else. This album will be part of me forever."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best!","review":"In my opinion, this is the Sisters' best work.

The first Five tracks are definatly the best with Marian at the top of my list with its screaming guitars and spooky vocal it shakes the floor when I play it (it must be played loud) the vocals surround you like ghosts of the past.15 Years after I bought this album I have to say it is still the most played and unparalleled in its quality. No other Sisters of Mercy album is quite the same with only Temple of Love coming close to the supreme sound of this album.

They have worn well on the heals and the cushioned linings. They are light for my feet which do not tolerate heavy tennis shoes built with inflexible sole materials. Polish is all that is required for the leather pairs (Black, and Navy) and an occasional brushing for the suede keeps them looking like new.I swear by their comfort and support. I have had no problems with sizing. For cushioning I wear a professionally fitted, non-prescribed orthotic in my daily tennis shoes which would not comfortably fit or wear for me in the Softwalks, but I find I don't need it with my Softwalks. This was the best buy that I know of -- short of custom-made shoes -- for my needs, which if I had gone that route would probably have netted me at that time perhaps one pair which would not work for my active life over the long haul."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for me","review":"This shoe is probably good if it fits you properly.

I can dig Lil John and the Eastside Boyz a bit, because they are straight up in why they make music. All Lil John and his crew wants to do is party and get things crunk. But David Banner is trying to come off as hard-core and serious. The beats are alright, but I had to shake my head at some of his lyrics. The worst part about this cd are the \\"guests\\" who rap with David. Hell, they made the cd worst.Its funny because all my friends from Mississippi keep hollaring about how David Banner is putting Mississippi on the map and how Mississippi is coming up to challenge the ATL as the music capital of the south.

After this, he turned into jazz again. Of course, New York flavored production and arrangement by Ralph MacDonald are perfect. Additonally, the flows of lovely molodies would be charming across genders, cultures, and ages. Technically speaking, this album would be the last one where you can hear the \\"elegant\\" collaboration among New York's top players in jazz-fusion including Steve Gadd (drums), Eric Gale (guitor), Ralph MacDonald (percussion), Marcus Miller (bass), and Richard Tee (keybords). Two representive star-players, Eric Gale and Richard Tee passed away a few years after this album.

I had to read this for a college course and was deeply disappointed in the material and the story line. I had to literally force myself to stay awake and read another sentence. Yes, it was that bad. I do not reccomend this book to anyone. In fact I have warned avid reads, like myself, to never pick the book up. I am a reader who likes thick plots, action, mystery, everything but what this book had to offer.I do not think I learned anything that opened my mind to another culture or about life in general. The book jumped around a lot between present and past and it was easy to get confused and disinterested. Not to be too harsh but: horrible, horrible, horrible! Save yourself the time, money, and effort. Read another book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Literary story","review":"I read this book torn between wanting to go really fast to the end to find out what happened and on the other hand, wishing to slow down to enjoy every beautifully crafted sentence. The interior world of the main character and her mother is just as interesting as the exterior world they live in -- descriptions fascinating and most of all, written in a most engaging style. I was very touched by the plight of these immigrants and also learned a lot about the war in VIetnam from an angle different from what I had studied in my history book. But most of all it's a human story, and even if it deals with a historical event like the war, it doesn't do so in a blunt political manner. It's a literary book and a good story."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great introduction to Vietnamese-American literature.","review":"This is the first book I've read by a Vietnamese author, and I enjoyed it.

Puddings from scratch come out perfect and I wouldn't start my ice cream bases without this pan. It took a few tries to learn that cooking with cast iron requires less heat than stainless steel, but once that was figured out, there was no stopping me. The pan is a perfect size for a single person or a couple. When cooking for many more people I often resort to my three quart pan which I don't like as much. Cleaning this pan requires no more effort than any other pan. The skillet top can also be used for terrific grilled cheese sandwiches although there is only room enough for one at a time.

At first, I was disappointed by the \\"slick\\" pages that don't hold pencil well. It doesn't matter how hard you push on the pencil, you still can't see the writing very well. Erasing, even with a good quality eraser, is impossible and just leaves smudges. I was going to use this (along with manipulatives) for our main math curriculum, but there was next to no instruction and I found it to be a little too fast moving. I ended up giving these books away.

We have completed about 12 pages so far and it is a review of what he already learned in kindergarten, which is great to keep this knowledge fresh. The pages offer a variety of activities and provide easy to follow instructions. The only draw back to this book is that the pages are not perforated so I am having to tear them out of the book to make it easier for him to do his work. I would recommend this book as a review or supplemental source for teaching math concepts."},{"rating":"2","title":"book for practice rather than learning","review":"This book mainly provides intensive practice problems to first graders. If your child has learned the topics and needs practice to strengthen the skills, this book is for you. It does a fair job of a WORKBOOK.

Per a previous review, I tried the free Beestar math (www.beestar.org). It provides mixed bag weekly exercises, indeed more interesting to my son. We like it very much. I suggest you check it out and see if the free one suits your child better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Math Made Easy?","review":"I can't recommend this book, unless you are looking for a supplementary workbook for concepts that will be explaine using other materials. I purchased this book to use with my daughter, and was immediately frustrated with it. It doesn't go through the concepts in a progressive way, but tends to jump around. There are absolutely no explanations in the book on how to explain the concepts, for the child or parents. Also, they throw the pages into the book in such a random way that one day you may be learning probability (in first grade?),then doing kindergarten or preschool work the next. There is also no review of new concepts, so that you feel like even if the child begins to grasp the concepts they won't be reviewed until much later in the book, if at all. I did go ahead and use the book since I spent money on it, but I did alot of skipping around and ended up explaining everything myself.

This film is well done in every way, acting, story, suspense and it is riveting. Since I gave it one star you must be wondering why. This movie is unfinished. It needs at least another 10 minutes maybe more. Just as this movie was reaching a suspenseful peak, it ended. No resolultion, no nothing. I have enjoyed movies that made you think, that didn't spoonfeed the audience an ending and explanation. This is NOT what happens here. Even for a mystery ending, they have to have a mystery ending. Watching this movie is like watching the first movie in the Alien series and having it end abruptly just as they are about to interrogate what is left of the robot Ash. Great up to that point, but incomplete.The way this movie ends makes it a complete waste of time. Save yourself the aggravation and STAY AWAY FROM THIS MOVIE!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Never received","review":"I had never received this item(you send me a leather pouch instead of the charger!!) and it last 2 weeks more that you estimate .. also, it was very expensive!!! ...."},{"rating":"2","title":"Some of the best prog I ever heard","review":"This is a very well written and put together album, and its a real shame it never got ackknowledged for it.

After two calls that were on hold nearly 1.5hrs total, I give up. By the way, the computer is a smoothly performing Toshiba TabletPC, with XP Pro. All other sofware on it works fine. I finally got through to a Customer Service rep, who basically had excuses about why there wasn't tech support available.

The simplest of commands, like displaying the source coding, are obfuscated and the ramp-up time to just passably use the program is outrageous. Although it claims to be easy to use and to walk you through webpage creation, the walk-thrus I've found are minimal and still create a number of issues that don't seem to be covered, like having a replaced graphic ripple through the subpages of the site). I've figured out more advanced programs like Photoshop, InDesign, and ULead's Video Editor in a single day without ever cracking a manual, but despite playing around with this for a week and reading most of the manual, it still is clunky and hard to figure out.If you are looking for a cheap alternative to DreamWeaver (which I was), don't bother here.

I loved the product when it worked but I will NEVER buy from this company again. I have had two versions and both worked fine until they released a new version and your license won't work. The support from this company really sucks. They only want to sell you the next product in line. I feel if I BUY the product I own the product and they are just stealing my money.

I should have listened to the many negative reviews. This is a cumbersome program of little use as a writing tool. It offers only a few short definitions for each word -- nothing like the treatment given in most printed dictionaries. Its one innovative feature, its audio pronunciation option, is useful. In the case of foreign names, however, pronunciation is only offered for the last name. Even here I found that, apparently, where pronunciation has been \\"americanized\\" over time, it is used rather than the original. This may have some use to elementary or junior highschool students, but I am afraid it is more trouble than it is worth for normal writing.

There is only 450MB on the CD so I doubt they couldn't fit the rest of the images on CD.The interface is very old (as old as from the time of Windows 95). The scroll wheel does not work. There is no automatic spelling correction/suggestion when searching for words. You have to choose a \\"spelling suggestion feature\\" from themenu every time you run the program to find correct spellings.

I installed the dictionary on my hard disk. Even after I bring up the dictionary, the response time for it to provide the entry for a word I want to look up is about 10 secs. I did an experiment (several times, with different words) to check the response time and it is never better than 8 or 9 secs; sometimes it is 15 secs. In comparison, the response time from the dictionary included in Encarta is only 1 sec and Encarta is accessing a CD-ROM; it is not on the hard disk. I even asked customer service if there was something I was doing wrong; they said Pentium II was a rather old model. Disgusted with this, I bought the Merriam Webster CD.

In 1978 they released their first and best album simply entitled Toto. Since the members of the group were session musicians they all had the techincal skills to perform the various styles of popular music at the time. So songs range from soft rock to hard rock, and R&B. While some people may be putoff by the variety of musical styles found on the album Toto pulls it off, and creates a very listenable debut album, I would have to say Toto is an underrated band, since the albums holds up just as well as many of the other popular 70's albums. Highlights of the album are I'll Supply the Love, Manuela Run, Angela, Girl Goodbye, and the radio hit Hold the Line."},{"rating":"1","title":"Off to a Good Start","review":"Their self titled debut is steeped in period arrangements, and doesn't really hit the mark. Reminiscent of Little River Band, album contains too few bright spots and relies mainly on the repetitive beat of disco. This album is for Toto coniseurs only, and is a stepping stone to Hydra, which is by far their most brilliant work."},{"rating":"1","title":"I Had No Idea","review":"I kind of liked some of the songs these guys had on the radio. The one about Africa and Roseanna were cool songs, so I gave this a listen. I didn't realize that these guys were quite so disco/tech oriented. I felt like I was listening to some kind of goofy version of a black jazz disco group or something. The song Georgy Porgy was so grating that I wished I could take a ballbat to the broad singing backup. Man, this is a painful listen unless you are a fan and have some connection to this stuff from the past. I didn't have the cushion of old memories with this outdated music so I had to take it full bore in the year 2008. I apologize to the people that love these guys, but I didn't know what I was getting into.

I always tell them that they should get this Toto album, too.This was a fantastic debut album. It's full of great songs. The only song on here I don't love is \\"You Are The Flower\\" - and even that one is still an okay song.One of the great misconceptions about Toto is that they don't rock. If you think that's the case, then you should hear \\"Girl Goodbye\\" from this album. The song totally jams!My personal favorites on this album are: \\"Georgy Porgy,\\" \\"Manuela Run,\\" \\"Takin' It Back,\\" and \\"Rockmaker.\\" Still, like I already said, ALL of the songs on here are good.If you like Toto and are interested in hearing more by them than just the \\"greatest hits,\\" then you can't go wrong with getting this album.

Your product costs at same price like in Charleston's local stores.with respect to all"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Deal!","review":"Product works just wonderfully, I feel like this was well worth the price. 50 sheets of sea weed will last me for quite a long time, even though I have sushi almost once a week."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sushi was too fishy tasting","review":"I was so surprised and happy.

That's no hill for those of us that would buy this item, butI recommend another soak beyond what's in the illustrations. Next, it's all one big bag, so you only get one shot at it. I'd hoped it would've been packaged in 3 or 4 serving sizes.The taste? Good. **I had to really take a wild guess at what kind of dressing to use. I made my own soy based recipe.Finally, don't expect the free stuff in the Amazon ad.

Stop it this minute...start making your own with this nori. It's incredibly cheap, good, and even includes the sushi mat. (Line the mat with plastic wrap...keeps the mat clean and each roll will be wrapped up for refrigerator storage as you roll it.) Use chicken or cooked seafood if you are wary of raw fish (or make vegetarian ones) and don't cut out the slices until ready to serve. There are a number of good internet sites on making sushi...just Google it. Oh, and you'll needNishiki Premium Sushi Rice (5#)and Nishiki 100% Natural Sushi Vinegar, 10 Fluid Ounces (or their equivalents - lots of competing products), too.Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"50 sheet pack of Nori","review":"After ordering this item, I was skeptical on what quality the nori was going to be at this price.

I give this product an A+."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheap mat, nasty nori","review":"The rolling mat is very cheaply put together, not impressed at all with it, wish I'd gone for a non-bundled mat, might have gotten a decent one. The nori is vile-tasting; I normally love nori with my sushi, but no one in my family, including me, could stand the stuff; we all ended up cutting the nori off (peeling left a residue on the rice) and eating the maki with a fork instead. A day in the fridge only strengthened the bad nori flavor. Awful stuff."},{"rating":"1","title":"Meh...So-so","review":"Not to knock this but to be honest the nori was under quality.The sushi mat was really cheaply made but what can i say for the price you get what you pay for *shrugs*"},{"rating":"2","title":"Dream Eater","review":"I really like this show. I hope that a second season is made once the manga is completed.

The dubbing is really well done as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Different and fun","review":"I have watched a lot of anime and found this anime new and refreshing. I loved the art style and the characters were intriguing. The characters play off one another well and the dream world plot was done well.

The high amperage (200) needs a substantial connection and it it difficult to do so with this configuration. I would have sent it back, except all the competitive units look similar. I finally designed a connection which would be reliable and not stress the connection points. The item was used for about 30 days with loads up to about 150 amps and then failed when the microwave oven was turned on. (This had been used many times before.) At that time the Inverter drew about 120 amps through this unit. I had the device for several months at that time, so it was too late to return it to the vendor and it was impossible to find the route to the manufacturer to get anything done that way.

The atrocities in the Balkans wrought so much damage beyond the physical destruction of towns and villages. The psyche of each ethnic community - whether Serb, Croat, or Albanian - was impacted and these wounds are the hardest heal. Di Giovanni does a masterful job of capturing several personal stories and painting a vivid picture of what it feels like to be in the midst of war. A powerful read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not that great","review":"Although the book was well written, this is, in fact, a bias account of the war. This was a horrible sequence of events for the balkans, but according to the paradigms of historical data this conflict, without a doubt, was a civil war; therefore, pointing fingers at only one side is hypocritical to the war's designation. It's like having a reporter from the Soviet Union write a book on the U.S. civil war, claiming that the Union (the north) was to blame for everything and commited genocide against the Confederate States in the south. I would not recommend this this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"most biased book ever written about the balkans","review":"this is one of the worst if not the worst book written about the wars of former yugoslavia. It is biased against the croatians and tries to make the serbs look like the innocent victims. It is a shame that this book was ever published and makes me wonder if the journalist ever did go to the former yugoslavia to research what went on. It is true that atrocities came from every side of the war, but the author seems to blame croatian's, as a whole took part while a few rogue serb generals where to blame for the whole serb population. I am not trying to push the blame on the serbs for this war, because there would be no war if there was nobody fighting back. everyone is equally guilty, i am glad that nobody wrote a review for this book, because i hope nobody will ever read this garbage."},{"rating":"1","title":"Avoid This Book","review":"The author needed an editor.

Loved it since high school when it first came out and a staple of my heavier collection. Love all styles of music providing it has a decent beat and no undecipherable screaming. I always keep this one along with a few other favs such as Dire Straits Communicado, Eagles Live, Jackson Browne Runnin on Empty, Iron Maiden Number of the beast, Keith Whitley GH's, Hank Jr, Joe Bonamassa, and of coarse, Hamilton Loomis (if you like funky blues try his cd \\"Kickin it\\" but you really need to see him live as he still travels the blues bar circuit.

The band rarely stepped outside its role as pop balladeers--and certainly not on their singles. [The lone exception was 1971's \\"Mother Freedom,\\" which only went to No. 37 and is not included here.] Album tracks like \\"Fancy Dancer\\" show that Bread could rock when it wanted to, but they're best known for make-out classics like \\"Make It with You,\\" \\"It Don't Matter to Me,\\" \\"If,\\" \\"Baby I'm-A Want You\\" and \\"Everything I Own.\\" These are all pop gems. Nobody recorded as many memorable mellow pop standards as Bread. RECOMMENDED"},{"rating":"1","title":"Cute, forgettable songs","review":"Bread was a band that mastered the concept of songs to work in an office by. Unobtrusive with little lasting value, Bread's songs pass through your ears like a sun shower on a field, momentarily pleasent and then quickly forgotten. The Anthology collects the best of their particular style of music."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Music That Gave 70's Music A Bad Name","review":"The punk rock movement of the late 70's was, in part, inspired by the type of insipid pop music that Bread embodied - fluffy, lightweight, and unchallenging. Bread and a host of other unchallenging pop bands had their fair share of radio airplay in the 70's. But a listen to their music now finds it hasn't stood the test of time.The easy-listening adult oriented radio stations that still play this pablum are going the way of the dinosaur. Other pop music of the era is far more enjoyable while still making a statement. If you're hankering for some 70's pop that leaves Bread flat in the oven, try the Carpenters, Carole King, Carly Simon, Joni Mitchell, and Gordon Lightfoot."},{"rating":"2","title":"His voice melts my heart.....","review":"Yep, I have to agree that when I hear \\"Diary\\" I cry everytime.

Many of them possessed a fresh, original and very expressive sound, gratifyingly inspired; with admirable musical arrangements.Bread knew to captive the most exigent listeners with their wonderful lyrics and the presence of David Gates as vocal leader.If you want to remind or even to know what 's about the legendary significance of this unusual band, go for this album and I swear you: they will never let you down."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the very best from the 70's - a must have","review":"In the 70's I was a newly wed who spent every extra penny to put together a couple of MacIntosh 275's and some Klipsh K-Horns with an orthophon turntable and cartridge. Yes it was the day of the vinyl audiophile, but there was very little recorded that was \\"audiophile quality\\" outside the classics. Then bread got put in the oven... I don't think I slept for weeks as I played their wonderfully produced talent and outstanding recording over and over.

Good luck at actually finding a copy of this box set, UNLESS you're willing to put out some major $$. Although I didn't get to see it, I've heard this 4-disc offering came with an awfully nicely assembled book - back when I used to keep in touch with a rep. from Griffin on a regular basis. But, keep in mind that I do have all four CD's - that Griffin had (also) released separately. No trouble believing that, as with most Hawkwind reissues / compilations that came out on the Griffin label were no less than top rate anyway. Most of the great tunes you remember are here, like \\"Hurry On Sundown\\", a live version of \\"Silver Machine\\", \\"Golden Void\\", the adventurous \\"Magnu\\" and simply too many more to name at the moment.

The author documents the story with heart felt emotion. As I was reading this book, I was asking myself a question.....What was the cause of autism ??My father gave me another book titled, MERCURY: THE WINGED MESSENGER written by Courtney Zietzke. This book explained the cause of autism in glaring detail. The book clearly documented that Mercury poisoning from baby vaccines is the cause of autism. This has been further confirmed by a Rolling Stone article published about 5 weeks ago. I think that it is important for parents to first know the cause of their children's condition as back ground information.This book, A real boy: A true story of autism, should be read by all parents and I must say again, read MERCURY: THE WINGED MESSENGER then think about what the parents are going through with their children.

That way you can get the cursor back to the correct area if it \\"wanders away\\".This is the way we taught them to use the mouse. First the adult hand was on the mouse and the child's hand on top. The child can feel the mouse move and see the cursor move. Then we only clicked when the child pushed down with his finger. Then we only moved the mouse when the child moved it. Then the child did it himself. You can also do this with the adult hand over the child's, but don't click by pushing on their finger...it can hurt.

The lighting meter, which can be seen in the viewfinder, is very sensitive and accurate, which also will be very helpful, espeially in full manual. The colors are perfectly saturated, even on cheap CVS brand film. It's fast, easy to use, and fun to shoot. All you need is a little background research and not much money. The downsides are that the camera is mostly plastic, which if you want a more professional feeling camera, could lead to a problem. The most apparent problem however, is the slow flash sync of 1/125 of a second. But for me, I rarely use my flash, so it shouldn't prove as an issue.

Very few practical examples of the broad, Marxist claims he is making, and very irritating textual citations every second sentence that make reading it about as fun as a root canal.P.S. The one star above was a technical flaw in the program. If I had my way, rather than a star, I would have a giant black hole. Every time I sat down to read this giant cube book of drivel, I died a little inside.

I am going to start my first hive with the Spring season. This book helped me understand how to care for bees on its various levels. Like anything else, please don't look for this to be the only bee book you are going to own. No book can do that task. Join a bee keeping club, read various books on the subject, and take the Bee keeping CD course. Get a Bee guide to teach you the ins and outs. Then you will have more sucess at bee keeping. AIEEEEE!

I was expecting more, but the heat-sink paste used was far from good. I expect to improve the performance with a better heat-sink compound. And don't forget that copper is far superior to aluminum as a heat transfer material. Recommended for Prescott P4 CPU users."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shipped with very poor packaging","review":"This cooler arrived in a bubble pack envelope severely damaged, once opened I found the cooler package damaged and open. The contents of the box were loose in the bag. The cooler's fins are bent, with dirt and debris. also the thermal compound is mostly smeared off and what is left is full of dirt. This item was VERY poorly packaged for shipment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Silent? No way!!","review":"I have one of these. The reason I'm looking for a fan and heatsink now is to replace this one. It is NOISY - much louder than the cheap generic 478 cooler in the other PC. Louder than all the other fans in the case put together. It is also a HUGE paint to attach to the CPU. the mounting clips are offset for some reason and it is very tricky to get these on the holes in the mounting bracket, especially in a crowded PC case. If anyone knows of a truly quiet 478 cooler, I'd like to know about it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too loud for my taste","review":"I was mistaken in giving this cpu cooler only 1 star, thinking it was really loud. It turned out to be the new video card I had added to the system. The cpu cooler is reasonably quiet and keeps the system cool. I thought it was pretty easy to install and it had some thermal grease pre-applied for convenience. On second thought, I rate this a 4 star (but I can't change the rating.)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I expected.","review":"First off, the clips are a pain to attach and remove. After adding this heat sink to my board (P4 3.0GHz, Arctic silver compound), the cpu temps hovered around 55 degrees on idle (and thats without overclocking!) and increased to the high 60's under load. I removed this and inserted my old TT Volcano 7+ and now the temps are around 43 degrees on idle. The heatsink may have been improperly seated, but I'm sticking with my old Volcano."},{"rating":"1","title":"Noisy","review":"I bought this because I thought the original Intel CPU fan was too noisy.

Wheelskins was very prompt in sending me the sample which I had ordered on their website. It greatly helped me to pick/match the color with my original leather. It also gave me an idea of the leather quality.This product was very easy to apply, took below recommended time of 60 min. and sits on the steering wheel as it is an integral part of it. I am very satisfied with it. I have been using it for about 6 months now and have no complaints so far. This was my first time sewing leather, but at the end it looked professionally done, gotten complements on it as well. Overall a good product, good leather quality and the look is unparalleled.Wheelskins customer service was very helpful when I contacted them, an the product was delivered on time as promised."},{"rating":"1","title":"Incredibly childish","review":"My teacher read this to me in school, and I was bored to death. If you want to read real fantasy, read Roald Dahl and C.S. Lewis."},{"rating":"1","title":"Extremely Predictable","review":"I'm sorry to say that this book was really bad. The plot was very predictable. The names of the characters were so cheesy, and everything that happened to them seemed to be made up by a seven year old. I'd say it's a good book to practice reading on, because it is an easy read, but the story stinks. Don't waste your money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Return to childhood...","review":"20 some years ago back in second grade was the first time I explored the exotic land of the whangdoodle. It was being read to my class by the teacher. I could not wait for reading time to find out the new problems the \\"Prock\\" was creating. Fast forward to 4 years ago I needed to find the book to share with my now 7 year old daughter. I remembered the title but was thinking it was by Dahl, due to a reference to the whangdoodle in Charlie and the Chocolate Factory (my favorite movie). After finding it, and letting my daughter age a little to enjoy we began our exploration together. Due to a divorce it took us 10 months to finish but boy was it fun reading it to her those nights. We are now hoping that her teacher will use it as a class reading for everyone to enjoy. It brings back great memories both old and new and I think everyone will enjoy....My question is WHERE IS THE MOVIE?????"},{"rating":"2","title":"One of my favorite books ever!","review":"I first read this book as a requirement for my fifth grade book report. I enjoyed it so much that I could not put it down and actually finished it within two days!Nine years later, it is still one of my favorite books ever. I haven't read it since fifth grade, but I recently had a strong urge to find it and read it again. I've told my 25 year old boyfriend about it, and he is as excited as I am in embarking on this imaginative, enchanting ride again!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Interesting fairy tale, but...","review":"incredibly naive. Much too young for the recommended 9-12 year-old set. Not well-thought out start of story. The children in the story are to rely on a stranger in order to begin the adventure. Sorry."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unsound and unfunny","review":"From the start, the author's grip on taxonomy is nebulous to non-existant. Her command of English is feeble, and her sense of humor is lacking. Most kids I know have don't want to have this read to them --its boring, predictable, and silly. Stick to the classics."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book, hardcover edition quality is very poor.","review":"This is a fantastic book and it deserved a great hardcover edition. I recommend you buy the paperback instead of wasting your money on the lame hardcover edition."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect book for a family car trip","review":"We read this book on a long car trip to our 4 year old. The DNA/genetics parts were over his head (although we likened cells to Legos and DNA to blueprints), but the rest of it was thoroughly understood and enjoyed. It kept us all completely engrossed and wondering what was going to happen next, which is a great way to pass time on a long road trip. The Professor's exercises for Lindy and her brothers to become more aware of the world around (sights, sounds, smells, textures) were something we could do too as we traveled through new parts of the country. There were all sorts of new vocabulary words (even for the adults - I've got to look up \\"sibilant\\"), but the context of each difficult word made it very easy to explain and understand. What an exciting, educational, mind-opening read for the whole family!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Enchanting, Imaginative, and Unforgettable!","review":"I first read this book in grammar school and it immediately became a favorite.I discovered it again as an adult teacher and read it aloud to my 7th graders every year. To this day, when I see my former students grown up, they make some comment about the Whangdoodle book that they enjoyed so much. (One year I even tried my hand at making Wodge and brought it in as a treat for the students).My favorite character is the Oink. Everything he says and does is so humorous! I would have loved him to have been a bigger part of the book.Somebody needs to get a message to Julie Andrews that such a captivating book deserves a sequel. After all, the Whangdoodle said they could come back and visit someday!"},{"rating":"2","title":"My favorite book","review":"I discovered the magic of The Last of the Really Great Whangdoodles first in third grade when Mrs. Bylsma read it to our class. It has a fantastical magic that exemplifies the wonderful possiblities in writing for children and imaginative adults. That was ten years ago but I still treasure the memory of this book. If there remains a child kickin' around within you read Whangdoodles and you will be supersatisfied."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best","review":"I think every 9 year old should read this book. It is very good and there is a lot of suspence."},{"rating":"2","title":"Chris frm Central NJ","review":"...I really enjoed this book. I highly recommend it. I loved it because it had alot of fairy tail creatures in it. Its a wonderful book where you use your imageination and it has a great ending with love and happiness! This is a great book for 8-12 year olds and especially for 9 year olds!"},{"rating":"2","title":"THE LAST OF THE REALLY GREAT WHANGDOODLES","review":"The begining of this novel makes the Potter children seem bored, un-enthuseastic, and such. That, even though it can at times be boring for the reader, helps the plot and charecters devolp. From the minute they meet Professor Savant, you can't put it down! It's a real treasure, because it lets you escape this world and go into Whangdoodleland with Lindy, Tom, Ben, and the Professor, through detialed description and points where you have to think, etc. A gem to be kept forever, it reminds me of THE CHRONICLES OF NARNIA and HARRY POTTER because of the light wisdom and magic blossoming all over. A sure hit with young children, it is best when read aloud. Other books by the author (those are also wonderful!) are MANDY and LITTLE BO. Now, try to go to Whangdoodleland with Tom, Lindy, Ben, and the Professor for yourself in THE LAST OF THE REALLY GREAT WHANGDOODLES!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Written beautifully.........","review":"Great for anyone who loves to have fun while reading. You'll find yourself always thinking about passages in the book wether at school, home, work or anywhere!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved this book!","review":"I tracked this book down because I believe it was the one a teacher once read to me in the 80's. I read the story to my 8 year-old and he had just as much fun listening to it as I did reading it. Perfect book for children AND adults."},{"rating":"2","title":"Remembering the Whangdoodles","review":"When I was in 3rd grade, the librarian at my school read this book to us one or two chapters at a time. It was the first chapter book I was exposed to. I was hooked. After that I wanted to read everything I could. Over the years, I have tried to find this book and was unsuccessful. Now I have a 6 year old and a 4 year old and reading books like \\"The Magic Tree House\\" made me think of the Whangdoodles again. I was so very excited to find it. Now, I am reading it to my kids. They love it! If you like books like \\"The Never Ending Story\\",\\"Princess Bride\\", or the \\"The Lion, Witch, and the Wardrobe\\" you will love the \\"Last of the Really Great Whangdoodles\\". How can it not be great written by the wonderful Mary Poppins her self, Julie Andrews."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sweetness and delight...","review":"At 44, having read literally thousands of books in my life (probably 10's of thousands) this book still stands out as one of the sweetest, imaginative stories ever.

Well done, Julie - Well done!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Last of the Really Great Whangdoodles","review":"I thought that The Last of the Really Great Whangdoodles was really good for all ages, however younger children should have this book read to them. The book brought my imagination that I do not use very much. This would make a great present."},{"rating":"2","title":"I've Always Loved This Book","review":"My aunt gave me this book when I was a child and I immediately grew to love it. I read it over and over again until I got older and started reading \\"grown up\\" books. But when the inspiration struck me to try writing some young reader's novels of my own, I began to gravitate towards those books I'd loved as a child, and I've slowly begun to rediscover them.Julie Andrews-Edwards may be famous as an actress, but she's a wonderful author as well. This book focuses on three children who, one Halloween night, fall in with a slightly eccentric professor who believes in another world ruled by a kind but reclusive creature called a Whangdoodle. This book stretches the limits of imagination with fantastic creatures, incredible settings and marvelous adventures. I loved this book when I was a boy. Now I love it all over again."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Last Of The Really Great Whangdoodles","review":"The book The Last of the Really Great Whangdoodles is a wonderful story of three children and an old professor. I don't want to give the story away if you have not read this, but it is an adventure that takes 3 children and a professor on the trip of their lifetime. They approach many obstacles and finally they reach the Whangdoodle. I will not give away the ending, so read this wonderful book. It captures the reader's attention with its suspense and iterest. In my opinion it is a phenominal book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Astonishing!","review":"This book is so great! It is a page-turner for those who like stories of fantasies and imaginations.I really enjoyed reading the book; it is funny, courageous, filled with emotions and happy moments.A great book for the children and adults.

A must for kids of all ages!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely loved it","review":"This book is still one of my favorite books, and I am 24 years old! There is just something very wonderful about this book which makes it fun to read. I read it to my nephew, and he's hooked!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The best book ever!","review":"I love this book!

The condition wasn't fantastic or even \\"good\\" like the seller said but it is readable and my kids love the book as much as I do."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Fine and Engaging Early Read","review":"A good good-guy, an unthreatening bad guy, three mutually supportive siblings, an inventive fantasy world, and a mellow slightly old-time feel - what's not to like? I'm not sure this will necessarily make a life long impression, (although judging from these reviews that's a definite possibility), but it is certainly a nice option for early readers. It could be a good read-to or read-with, as well as an early read-alone. There are many. many quality quest and fantasy books out there for older readers through adults, and it seems that this kind of book is a nice choice as a first step along that path."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic Book even as an adult!","review":"I came across this book in a used book store and just laughed b/c the name sounded funny. But when I saw Julie Andrews wrote it I ended up buying it. I didn't know she had written any books and wondered how it was. I thought this was an adorable story. It was so fun and interesting. I'm a huge fan of Alice in Wonderland and this had the same magical charm and curious type of characters. I'm 26 (yes I admit it. lol) and I had a lot of fun reading this and felt like I was a kid again. I can't wait until I have kids so I can read them this story!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow ! Couldn't Put it Down","review":"This was the first book of Julie Andrews that I read. This was a book that turned around every way I look at things.It starts you thinking of things a whole new way. Full of twists and turns I could not leave this book a lone. The characters dislay an array of traits and feelings, while unpredictable monsters and creatures add fun.Starts out a little slow but picks up when the characters meet eachother. Pretty easy to undrestand and very descriptive.This book was a really great one."},{"rating":"2","title":"A wonderful fantasy for everyone!","review":"I saw this book in a strore in Germany, about 3 years ago. I'd already read Mandy, and Edwards had me hooked from then. To my delight, this book was instantly my favorite, and has been. Edwards' imagination is wonderful for this plot. She captures our hearts when the whiffle bird gets injured, our dreams with the Jolly boat with any ice cream treat you can think up, and our happiness through and through. All and all, a wonderful book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Your kids will love learning","review":"This was the first book which I truly loved. After finishing it, I couldn't wait to go to the library and find more books like it. Now I'm in college, and I tell all my friends to read it! This book will make a lasting impression on your children - and it will remind you how fun reading can be, too!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I read it 18 years ago and I still remember it vividly!","review":"This was the book that started my love affair with science fiction and fantasy literature. It was read to my fourth grade class, eighteen years ago, and I still remember the book vividly. I've told my friends over the years that if they ever have children, they must read this book to them. I plan to read it to my children, once I have them! As a returning adult student studying English literature, I must say that this book belongs with the classics, right up there with \\"Alice in Wonderland\\" and The Narnia Chronicles. If you're looking for a book that stretches the imaginations of children, this is the one!"},{"rating":"2","title":"My Favorite Book Since 2nd Grade","review":"This book is so good! Since my second grade teacher, Mrs. Ward, read it to me, it has been my favorite. I have read it many times again, and it gets better every time. It is pure fantasy in an old-fashioned sort-of setting. I love it, nothing can top it. Not even Harry Potter, and that's saying a lot!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing! A Masterpiece!","review":"How did a thirty two year old manage to mature enough to write a masterpiece? This book is a wonder to read, never boring and just breathtakingly good."},{"rating":"1","title":"(1.5) Needs pruning...","review":"The Family Orchard begins with the linking of \\"what my father says\\" and \\"what I say\\", alternating perspectives as each new member of the family tree is introduced. As well, each succeeding chapter adds diagrams of the growing family.The scene is Palestine in 1837, certainly a fascinating period of historical perspective. So I was disappointed as I read further into the book and lost any sense of connectedness. I was unable to continue: the relatives became more confusing, their chapters too short to retain in memory. When a writer brings history to life, flesh and blood with human failings, it becomes knowable and informative, almost visual. This book did not offer that reality to me."},{"rating":"1","title":"The intense physicality of their togethering?","review":"If you think this is good writing, you will love this book:\\"They kissed and panted and hungered at and for each other's skin--more, not less, fervently as the years went by. Theirs, they agreed, was an ancient elemental passion that must have existed, like sand, earth, and sky, long before either of them had been born. And despite the intense physicality of their togethering, both Esther and the baker always felt insubstantial, flimsy, oh so light in the presence of this passion. But this was not a bad feeling.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Clever in concept...","review":"...tedious in execution.This book just rubbed me the wrong way. The telling of a family history via their family tree with contributions from a father and daughter telling the stories from different perspectives ought to be a real page turner. Instead I just kept turning to the end of the book to see how many pages I had left. I just could not \\"get into\\" this book, no matter how hard I tried. The book is close to 300 pages long, and I swear it wasn't until around page 286 that I felt any emotion other than dislike.The concept was very interesting and since it is the story of her ancestors, I hate to be so critical, but to me this was just outright boring. This book seemed to go on & on and on rambling in no direction. The loose ends were neatly tied up at the end, but by that time I was so sick to death of reading about citrus trees and how to graft them that I just wanted to scream.It was a very happy time when I finished and closed this book for good."},{"rating":"2","title":"Moving Book","review":"I normally read mysteries.

Ms. Eve makes everything come to life with a remarkable command of the language. She imparts feelings in such a way that you can really immerse yourself in the joys and sorrows of her characters. She made me laugh and she made me cry. The historical background was also beautifully done and the illustrations appropriate and fascinating. We need to know more about these people and I hope she is already working on a sequel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring and poorly written!!!!!","review":"[...]. I finally just skimmed to get through, but it never got better. It goes to prove that anything can get published."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good words, little connection","review":"I wanted to like this book. I certainly admire the author's research and use of language. She writes moving passages that make you feel you are there. Unfortunately this does not occur with her characterizations. Perhaps because there are so many I felt no emotional connection to any of them. The time spent with each generation is so short that you never get to know any of them. Since they were all mysteries,they seemed very much alike (the men and women both). Without any connection to the characters I found the book a great struggle to get through."},{"rating":"2","title":"From the back of the book:","review":"In contrast to many writers who gloss over one or the other, this author is true both to the reality of suffering and to the affirmation that God creates, sustains, and redeems. Creative in his view that certain aspects of what is called suffering-loneliness, experience of limits, temptation, anxiety-are necessary parts of God's good creation. These he distinguishes from suffering after the fall, the tragic dimension of life. Unique is his structure:creation-suffering as becoming,the fall-suffering as a burden, andredemption-conquest from within.The author succeeds in moving the reader beyond the customary way of stating the problem: \\"How can undeserved suffering coexist with a just and almighty God?\\" He also evaluates five popular, leading thinkers on suffering: Harold Kushner, C. S. Lewis, Diogenes Allen, George Buttrick, and Leslie Weatherhead."},{"rating":"2","title":"great record","review":"This has to be one of my most memorable cure albums.

Those people were wrong. 'Inbetween Days' starts the party in full pop swing, with a fast-paced acoustic melody and bouncy keyboards. 'Close To Me' starts with a very dancy drum beat and builds up with even more danceable delight. 'Kyoto Song' with it's far-eastern influences is a dark piece to say the least and 'Sinking,' the album's closer with its Disintegration-esque keyboard sound, is just plain heart-breaking.Pop fans should listen closely; the album is chocked full of dark subject matters. Pop fans listen again; this album is filled with great hooks and lots of variety. While not as much of a mixed bag as their follow-up, 'Kiss Me Kiss Me Kiss Me', 'The Head On The Door' is a bouncy, uneven schizophrenic affair. A very listenable and enjoyable schizophrenic affair."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great CD","review":"I bought \\"Head on the Door\\" last month for Close to Me.

Robert Smith's voice and just the bassy sounds in some of their darker songs will always bring me back to their live shows, standing in the dark, under the stars with the smell of clove cigarettes in the air. Heaven...I've picked up some of the cd's from a \\"newer\\" and yet now defunct girl band, Jack off Jill, that has very obvious Cure influences and yet are totally their own band, edgier and heavier.They were the ones who brought me full circle-back to The Cure."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible book","review":"I like Jack Tickle pop-up books because my daughter wants me to read them over and over. She is fascinated by the pop-ups and the stories rhyme and are easy to read.

I live in Wyoming where we have real cowboys, I was offended at first because they made the cowboy seem so unintelligent. I did get used to the idea, but I could be offended if I was a cowboy.

Of course, Lizzie was wonderful and I felt so very bad for her (becoming a vampire). When I finished the book - I was hungry for more. Will there be a sequel??!! I've passed it on to others who are enjoying it also!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your money","review":"This book provides nice reviews of life cycles of various pests and beneficial speicies, but very little practical, useful information for controlling most of the pests.

Mann's masterpiece. It is a mediterranean, sun-scorched, surrealistic, stylistically baroque magic mountain, and deserves 4 stars only because Bufalino is also the author of the amazing Lies of the Night. Partly autobiographic, this novel is haunted, like other Bufalino's novels, by endless literary echoes and is totally enjoyable by foreign readers."},{"rating":"2","title":"magnificent language","review":"I read this book in italian, and I was absolutely impressed by the power of Bufalino's language. No matter what he writes about, you will be astonished by how effective it is. Like Marguerite Yourcenar, he manages to express very deep concepts with very few words: amazing. I am sure that also through the translation you will be able to appreciate it."},{"rating":"2","title":"FRANKENSTEIN~SOUTH OF THE BORDER!","review":"OFF ALL THE MEXI~HORROR FESTS, THIS ONE IS MY FAVORITE.

I use his albums mostly to fall asleep with so I usually do not hear the whole recording. But that does not stop me from loving these types of nature sounds. If you have trouble sleeping you might try concentrating on bird songs and the kind of three dimensional sound available from this album. So much better than music."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rip off","review":"Ordered my subscription and it never came.....ever! It's been 2 years now. I did call at 3 months, 6 months, and 9 months.

David Wayne kind of looks like Lou Gramm of Foreigner, maybe with a lot nastier temper. His finest moment, and probably the nastiest track on this album, is the gothic-tinged \\"Watch the Children Play\\" which is just way too heavy for most mortals. Very distinctive, doomy type of song, with some classic metal screetching, it will stick with you long after the album does. \\"Ton Of Bricks\\" is a nice thrashy opener and \\"Line Of Death\\" has some interesting melodies. Other than that, theres not much to recommend, its all definitely solid but not terribly distinctive, and kind of fails on the promise of the aforementioned \\"Watch...\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"4 1/2 stars","review":"Pretty nice thrash and some melodic tunes on here. However, Watch The Children Pray is an awesome ballad and my fave song on the whole record. This band is sooo underrated, get this right away!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Dark","review":"Metal Church is a great traditional metal band,The Dark is a classic album.You have Ton Of Bricks,Watch The Chidren Prey which is an awesome ballad,David Wayne has a great metal voice.Over My Dead Body rules it's kind of like OverKill style.If you like true traditional metal with out the crapy butt rock sound,get this album,oh and get there first album also."},{"rating":"1","title":"Scraping the barrel","review":"This album is inferior to it's predecessor and really falls flat of reaching any sort of focus. There were at least 15-20 more bands in the 80's that I can think of off the top of my head that were doing albums like this and doing them way better. \\"Watch the Children Play\\" gets heralded as one of their best songs but is actually one of the worst on here. Get their self-titled album if you want to hear how much better they were just one album before this. Or you could Get \\"Blessing in Disguise\\" if you really want to find a lost gem, this one needs to just be forgotten."},{"rating":"2","title":"Danzo's review of THE DARK","review":"After a stellar first album released in 1985, Metal Church returned from the road and into the studio to record one of their best albums, The Dark. The music is fairly simple and catchy. Once you get to know the album it becomes hard to put down.There are no bad songs here. Of note are energetic opener \\"Ton of Bricks\\", the extremely underrated \\"Method To Your Madness\\", which contains an uncharacteristically laid-back, commercial feel, and the ageless heavy metal classic \\"Watch The Children Pray.\\"If you're looking for a solid straight-ahead metal album from the mid 1980s, it's hard to go wrong with The Dark."},{"rating":"2","title":"BURNIN' FOREVER!!!!!! METAL MASTERPEICE!","review":"This is another one that's name needs to be heard. This classic eighties metal band should have waited 10 years before releasing their first album (METAL CHURCH, 1985)and maybe this album would be more well known. These guys dissapeared into obscurity years ago and this goes to show that popular music only gets that way because of the money that backs it. These guys are easily one of the most talented metal bands in the eighties. If this album was released today, it would be huge! Don't ask me about tracks because I never have bothered. I just put this one in my headphones and let it rip, YEAH BABY, YEEEAAAAHAAAAAAH! START START THE FIRE!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Full of satire and whimsy","review":"First in a series of liturgical mysteries by Mark Schweizer,The Alto Wore Tweed (The Liturgical Mysteries), is a fun and unusual twist on the normal murder mystery. I am not going to go into the product description here since so many people have done a nice job of that in other reviews, but I will say it was a very enjoyable read. Unique and different, you can't approach this assuming it's a traditional mystery --- it's more a spoof than anything else but a very funny spoof.The way the author winds the two stories together (one the mystery he is writing and the other the mystery he is investigating) is ingenious and fresh. My book group read it and we all thought it a good read even though it is like nothing we have every read before. Four different women with very different reading tastes and we were all satisfied.I have already purchased all the other books in the series since I enjoyed this one so much."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amusing","review":"Fun little romp. Not much plot, but interesting characters and purple prose. Lighthearted, great beach read. I'll try another one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as smart as he thinks he is","review":"What a disappointment. This book is a jumbled mess of misogyny, narcissism, and bad writing. The detective is one of those arrogant jackasses who believes he's the smartest person in the room AND irresistible to women. Mr. Schweizer enjoys giving us lots of insider detail about church music and the Episcopal church (and most of those details he gets right) but he doesn't craft a very good mystery. The villain is a cartoon character who is loathsome from her first appearance (I kept hoping there would be some kind of interesting twist at the end, but Schweizer isn't that talented or imaginative)and supporting characters in the mystery are simply unbelievable. The detective ends up being judge, jury AND ecclesiastical court - nothing so mundane for him as actually building a case...I won't buy another one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Utterly boring","review":"After reading some of the reviews, I had high hopes of discovering a fantastic series. Boy was I ever duped. When I was about halfway through the book I started staring at the dust on the windowsill 3 feet in front of me. When you find dust to be more interesting than the book you're reading you know it's time to stop...reading the book that is. Mr. Schweizer should stick to his musical endeavors and stop writing books."},{"rating":"2","title":"A nice escapists novel","review":"I purchased this for my new Kindle and was not disappointed. This book appealed to me as an Episcopalian and as a fan of mystery novels. I especially liked the part with the world class thurifer.The book does have some flaws. The detective is a little full of himself. The portrayal of the female priest seemed a bit unfair. Poirot would have solved this murder in about 20 pages. However, the book is most enjoyable because of the journey, not the ending.I recommend this book and the series in general."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Anglican Humor","review":"Certainly, if you are Episcopalian, you are going to get the jokes and humor a lot easier. But never the less, this is a really fun read.Needless to say, if I had a choirmaster like Hayden Konig, I would still be singing in church choirs. He treats his choir really well."},{"rating":"1","title":"not impressed","review":"This book was recommended to me by a friend so I purchased it for .99 on my Kindle. I will finish reading it, but am skipping all the parts which are the main character's so called attempt at writing a novel. I realize this is supposed to be funny, but it is so bad that I can't read those parts. Just not my cup of tea, I guess, since my friend loves this series and was so happy to recommend them to me. As I like to say, \\"This is America...to each his own.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Disturbing","review":"This humourous book has some enjoyable inside jokes, but it also has a tone of irreverence towards Christianity that I found disturbing. The decisions of the main character show questionable ethics that is even more disturbing. Like others have said, not much of a mystery. It is a book within a book since the character is writing a mystery story. This inside story is poorly written on purpose and tedious to read. The book does have some twists and does portray small town life questionable ethics aside. Without the questionable ethics, I would have given it 3 stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful","review":"The only good thing I can say about this book is that Amazon gives refunds. The humor wears thin after the first quarter of the book. Even at 99 cents it was impossible to read one more insult to women. I know its important to not take ourselves too seriously but this guy has one joke and it just gets old."},{"rating":"2","title":"a mystery","review":"This is a delightful, easy-to-read mystery that I finished in less than a day.

Kristin gets called in at the last minute to be an accompanist for haughty David, and she is both repulsed and attracted by him. How many times have we heard variations of this theme? How about nearly every romance book on the planet! The writing style was too obvious, the way information was conveyed.

The old adage is true, that if it were profitable, it would not be written down in a book because the author would instead be executing the strategy.

It's printed in tiny fonts and filled with sidebar BS so it's hard to read and keep track of what you read. The author rambles a lot and there's very little concrete information even though a lot of topics are covered in a cursory manner. Worst, this book is already way outdated, as ECNs and ATS's as well as industry consolidations plus the Grasso fiasco have changed industry landscape (and enriched many a capital pig who does not produce real products but reaps billions for stealing other people's money). Ok, I'm a financial analyst so i don't contribute anything to this society either, but I'm no capitalist pig, just a lowly employee."},{"rating":"2","title":"AWESOME!","review":"An Emerson \\"must have.\\" If you are a Keith Emerson fan/ELP fan, you must get this CD if you can find it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just A Flash In The Pan","review":"The basic sounds of the band is pretty good especially on the lead tracks Keep Your Hands To Yourself and Battleship Chains. Railroad Steel has alot of powerful energy as well. However, by the time you get the second half of this recording, the ideas are all the same and boy is it stale. The cover of the Rod Stewart song isn't bad and Golden Heart offers a slight change of pace but there isn't but originality after a while. Three chord rock at the same tone and with the same vocal stylings can really grate on one's nerves after a while.The bottom line is where are these guys today? If you were to ask ten people on the street between the ages of 20 and 40 what do you think of the Georgia Sattelites music, I would bet that about half of them would respond Who????"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Forgotten Classic?","review":"This album is a must for all lovers of 12 bar blues based rock music. There are only a handful of bands who can make a three chord song using a riff heard a million times before sound fresh and exciting. The Georgia Satellites achieve this repeatedly on this album.The album kicks off with Keep Your Hands to Yourself, a track originally recorded for the Keep the Faith EP and the band's only hit single.What follows is track after track of loud simple rock and roll with some classic slide guitar from Rick Richards (who later played with Izzy Stradlin's Ju Ju Hounds) and some serious QUO style riffing throughout. Standout tracks include \`Nights of Mystery', \`Myth of Love'\`Battleship Chains' and the Faces cover \`Every Picture tells a Story'. The only weak track being \`Over and Over' a dullish medium paced rocker.In summary this album is the ultimate straight ahead rock album with no hidden messages. A good old fashioned album from a truly great band."},{"rating":"1","title":"CD skipped","review":"Never got to listen to the cd as it would not play.

Not a bad track in the bunch - they are all good (and how many albums can you say that about?)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Overlooked Gem","review":"I purchased this title when it was orginally released in the USA on vinyl in 1982. The Japan only issue is great news for fans of Patty Weaver. This shows that she is more than a soap star (Days of our Lives & Young and the Restless). The production if flawless, Patty's vocals are strong and confident, and songs are fun and touching. I remember seeing Patty sing \\"The Best is Yet to Come\\" on The Johnny Carson Tonight Show. She blew him away.Patty also recorded 3 albums on an independent label RE/SE in the mid 1970s. Most of those songs were standards that she used to sing on \\"Days of Our Lives\\".I highly recommend this cd even at the high cost of an import. You will be amazed at Patty's power and fine production of the album."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I wish the songs were the ones she sings on Young andRestless.

K&N; states that it should increase horsepower by 24 hp. I have always used K&N.; They have an excellent reputation in performance car circles. I have no reason to doubt their claim but I don't feel the extra HP. Nor did I notice any MPG improvement. I do hear the intake noise at high revs and it is very annoying. I would not do this mod if I had it to do over again.I have since removed it as the noise on long journeys was tiresome. Again, I can't tell if there was a power loss upon removal and I can't tell if there was any mileage gain when installed and consequent loss when removed.

I went to my local library and found not only the Mikado but also - Ruddigore, the Pirates of Penzance, HMS Pinafore and my all time favorite \\"The Yoeman of the Guard\\".

Goldie plays a lonely librarian who picks up a hitchhiker and then finds herself in the middle of an assassination plot. Chase plays the starry-eyed policeman assigned to protect her once they realize that she's not some looney tunes blonde after all. A young Brian Dennehy plays Chase's partner; the late Rachel Roberts plays a conniving killer; Burgess Meredith does his kung foo best and Dudley Moore plays a sex-starved orchestra conductor. The film is well produced and Barry Manilow's READY TO TAKE A CHANCE AGAIN garnered an Oscar nomination for its writers (Charles Fox and Norman Gimbel). A delightfully nostalgic trip down memory lane."},{"rating":"2","title":"Finally!","review":"short and sweet, It's about time! I have been waiting for this for years!

Yes, you can tell it was made in the 70s but how cool is that?! Dudley Moore steals the scenes he's in. Chevy Chase & Goldie Hawn are hilarious together.

Add a dash of intrigue (which by todays standards will appear dull) and you have a mixture of laughs and mayhem. Its a great early vehicle for all actors and so sad that its been missing from the shelves for such a long time. Maybe dull by todays standards, but well worth the laughs that it still brings.

Albinos! Pope-Abusers!

The stylish, perky Foul Play, which tips its hat to both Hitchcock and film noir, is also really funny! Goldie Hawn is lovely here, and as a detective Chevy Chase, once an A-list leading man, actually seems hip. Were the '70's truly like this? I like this movie a lot."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of The Best Comedies Ever","review":"This wonderful film is laugh and laugh and laugh out loud funny. Fantastic writing, perfect soundtrack, great film for the whole family.

It is true that a lot of the sources are anti-Mormons, but in a lot of cases, this is because only disaffected Mormons would talk about certain things at that time. Anyhow, equal time is given to Church prophets as to disaffected members and dissenters.Buerger's only occasionally insensitive in regards to the spiritual worth of Temple ceremonies to the members of the Church. But, this is a history book, and so spiritual manifestations and comfort aren't things that Buerger can gauge without becoming more biased.Overall, I think this is a great book for those seeking to learn more about the history surrounding Latter-day Saint temple ceremonies."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must read for any mormon","review":"The best and by far the most complete study of Mormon temple ceremonies. Not only does it address the endowment and the chages the church has made in their ceremonies(most recently in 1990) but also lesser known ordinaces such as the second endowment. The book is daring in subject matter and approach cutting right to the facts. This book tells it how it is without any display of personal religious viewpoints, which in and of itself is an accomplishment. Nowhere else will you find such a frank and fair description of Mormon ceremonies."},{"rating":"1","title":"Interesting but filled with assumptions.","review":"Interesting how they reached their conclusions, but much of it is biased by personal opinion and judgement."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Basic","review":"This book is very basic and gives advice about how to manage money. However the one mistake the book makes is that it assumes that collection agencies and/or creditors are legitimate and offers no recourse to how to dispute charges from less scrupulous companies and agencies. The text for dealing with credit reporting bureaus is very basic. There are more precise texts to tell how to clean up your credit report (naturally after you have closed the accounts)."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best of the Riddle albums","review":"Linda's singing on this was sheer perfection.

This new version was produced by Phil Collins. The two songs that I really do like on this album are \\"Will You Still Be There?\\" and \\"Give Me Strength\\".

This book is crammed with somewhat random information and might be very appealing to those looking for help with natural fibers and dyes, but I wanted details on edible and medicinal wild plants of Texas and this book is a very poor reference guide for that purpose. An appalling lack of photographs and only average black and white line drawings make it almost useless as an aid in field identification.

Mr. Bell is either guessing about things he hasn't tried, or hasn't been able to implement things that work for others because of his lack of understanding or poor execution.

Corky has put together a collection of formulas and uncommon sense that is needed to design and build turbo systems. I love it.I used this book to create an Excel worksheet full of needed design formulas. I can now make tradeoffs and design decisions before I build it, and I have a much better chance of getting what I expect, without a bunch of cut and try and try again attempts.Corky's book will be a huge help to me, and I imagine it will be to you as well. This may not be the book for someone who is afraid of math, or who does not want to understand something.

The story is quite confusing, but that might just be because I was bored through most of it. Luckily it isn't very long (just over ninety minutes). The plot concerns a Russian Roulette tournament, with Sam Riley as Vincent Ferro being the main contestant. Fans of Mickey Rourke will want to check out his role as a man forced to participate in this disturbing game. Statham steals the show as a very intense and very wealthy individual who participates - not by playing, but by betting on the contestants. Ray Winstone is also pretty good as a mentally disturbed person who is partaking in the competition. But all in all, this is hardly the kind of movie many people will want to watch more than once, if they can even get through it the first time. The presence of stars Statham and Rourke are the main reason to take an interest."},{"rating":"1","title":"Less drama than \\"Let's Make a Deal\\"","review":"Less drama than \\"Let's Make a Deal\\"...that's the first thing my husband said when this movie was over, and I'm strongly inclined to agree. I was never on the edge of my seat wondering what would happen next. This was a thriller with no suspense. None whatsoever. The plot is extremely predictable, even the ending was easy to see coming. For a professionally-made movie, everything about it came off as amateurish.No real character development to speak of, which is the real tragedy of this movie. It has a stellar cast, all of whom deserved better than the weak storytelling. I never saw the original, but '13' never had me invested in any of the characters. And not even really in the protagonist, whose actions at times really defy logic.I'm all for shoot-em-ups with no plot, but this movie didn't even achieve that level. A big disappointment."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good action movie","review":"We watched this last night and both of us (couple in our 30's) really liked the movie and it was better than we were expecting. The acting was pretty good, the action was intense and kept you on edge until the very end. I like that they kept it about the story and the action, no cheesy strip club or graphic nudity scenes that seem to run rampant in this genre. There was violence...but considering the storyline, it was expected and they did just the right level of it I thought. It gave you the feel of the room without going overboard. It's the kind of movie that sparks discussion too. One of the better action films that we've seen lately."},{"rating":"2","title":"All for money","review":"SO this is an ok movie, very fast paced and gritty at times. A kid wants to help his family who needs money bad for the father, he watches a man die after hearing him talk about big fast money he is making.. so the kid pretends to be him, takes his phone & the instructions the guy had on him, and away he goes on an adventure that leads him places you only see in movies.... Great cast, everyone fits their roll perfect. There are some Corny lines in it where you know someone in real life would NEVER say, but its also in unrealistic situations and places, so just go with it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Belongs on The Top 10 Worst Movies of All Time","review":"First, Jason Statham must really need money to stoop so low as to be in this movie - and in a limited role. The premise of this movie would elude the most genius among us, and the story is completely brainless. In a nutshell, this movie subtracts from the sum total of all human knowledge. Sponge Bob is more entertaining than this \\"never shoulda been made\\" movie. That said, the movie does have one really good part - THE END of the movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Click.... click..... BANG!!!","review":"THE EXPENDABLES is a touted as a \\"man's man\\" film, drenched in sweat, gunpowder and blood. But lets be honest; it really is the equivalent of a live action Saturday morning cartoon. It had pumped-up action stars, cgi blood and explosions, and expended more rounds than an Irish pub on St. Paddy's Day, but somehow the whole thing felt empty. 13, and the foreign language original, is truly a man's film. The cast is comprised by believable tough guys (two of them were in THE EXPENDABLES) who can bring a sense of realism to the screen. What it lacks in cgi firepower it certainly makes up for with tight scripting, superb acting and directing. Please check this \\"under the radar\\" film out if you are in the mood for testosterone and intelligence combined."},{"rating":"1","title":"Deeply Disappointed.","review":"Jason Statham + Mickey Rourke + Ray Winstone = What the heck happened to this movie!? This movie should have been amazing. Gela Babluani had a great cast to work with and yet the movie blew chunks. The only entertaining part was the \\"Ringmaster\\" and his histrionics. And the little sister not getting her lamb with the black ears, well, that just pissed me off. I gave it two stars because I have too much respect, generally for the aforementioned cast members to completely poop on it. But, for crying out loud!

Horrible story, ugly concept, and the only semblance of a 'good guy' loses at the end... Would not ever watch it again, it was just awful.

The manufacturers were smart and put the tuning keys on the bottom of the neck, as not to draw too much attention (which helps maintain the life of the strings).

Side B had 12 bonus b-side tracks which can be found on Join the Dots, released 19 years later. Until then, the analog version of Staring at the Sea was the only place to find such tracks as New Day, I'm Cold, Throw Your Foot and and Mr. Pink Eyes other than tracking down the original 45s and 12\\" records.

Also bought The Greatest Hits on iTunes a few years ago but because of the limit on how many times you can put the songs on separate hard drives, I had to decide whether to buy that again or get this one. The Greatest Hits also has many of the songs on this one but doesn't have the sublime 10.15 Saturday Night, nor The Caterpillar, nor Jumping Someone Else's Train. So that I wouldn't double up, I bought Staring at the Sea on CD from Amazon, then downloaded my favorite songs from iTunes that were released after Standing on a beach. I recommend this album for earlier fans (as opposed to those who got into The Cure later who might prefer The Greatest Hits) who might have already bought all The Cure albums on vinyl in another lifetime, and just want the the best songs from their collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must have!","review":"I do not consider myself a huge fan of The Cure, but this is one of my favorite albums. Every song is excellent, most notably \\"Charlotte Sometimes\\" and \\"A Night Like This.\\" This album is a compilation of singles from the earlier years of The Cure. I prefer the earlier work of The Cure because it is darker and edgier. One of the best things about Staring at the Sea is that, because it spans several years worth of songs, it shows the constant change of styles The Cure has gone through. If you are a fan of Wish and Disintegration, perhaps you would prefer The Cure's other singles compilation, Galore, but I thoroughly recommend this to every music fan."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great CD, excellent cassette.","review":"To the November 25th review, be glad you got the cassette. It's the only way you're going to get 12 of their early b-sides, and any \\"Cure\\" fan will tell you, they are as good as the a-sides. The only advantage to the CD, besides being a CD, is that it includes a few singles that the cassette does not, specifically \\"10:15 Saturday Night\\", \\"Play For Today\\", \\"Other Voices\\", and \\"A Night Like This\\". All good songs, but I'd take the b-sides any day, and hopefully they get them all on a disc sometime.

From research a good gauge accurate to 1% is not cheap and is at least $40. Liquid filled gauges with a pressure balancer is a good choice.

What a disappointment. The inflation chuck failed to deliver air to the tire valve after a dozen uses. That rendered the whole mechanism useless. Beyond that failure the air tube is plastic and very difficult to use in cold weather. The hose is a tad too short. The gauge is a little small and difficult to read. The air bleeder worked well and the metal body was a pretty blue. It is inexpensive and certainly feels and looks inexpensive. I am a bit obsessive about things like tire pressure and oil levels. This gauge left me wishing I had spent another 10 or 15 bucks to get a better inflator/gauge."},{"rating":"1","title":"Caution!","review":"I took good care of mine. Never dropped or anything of the sort. Used it to inflate a low tire and noticed it didn't look right after.

Now that it's been over 30 days since I've bought it and now discover that I can't find a fitting for it, this unit is completely useless. Everything else on this is a bit smaller too and thus seems less durable and not as well built as similar units. I would not recommend."},{"rating":"1","title":"doesn't work","review":"Soemtimes this inflator will work correctly, but mostly it just pegs out the dial indicator when the trigger is actuated.

Works great!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Works, but accuracy is poor","review":"Sad to say the pressure gauge on this is way, way off. I have to inflate my tires to an indicated 48psi to get them to the 36psi I want. That really limits the usefulness of this product.It's still nice to be able to clip it on, as it makes filling up an external air tank a lot easier than standing there shoving the filler onto the tank's fitting, but for actually filling tires to a specific pressure, it's sadly useless."},{"rating":"2","title":"Air pump","review":"It pumps air, what more do you want from an air inflator, it put air in my tires. All of them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beware Gun is only rated for 100psi!!!!","review":"They are selling this gun upon the notion that it can handle 150 PSI but only the guage is rated at 150 psi, the hose is rated 300psi and the gun itself is stamped on the handle to only handle 100psi."},{"rating":"2","title":"Real Time Saver","review":"I drive a Dodge 2500 and often tow a 30ft. trailer for camping.

Comfortable and easy to read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for my toyhauler","review":"We have about 6 mx bikes and quads + a toyhauler with 4 wheels + the truck - needless to say I need to carry a small 6 gal compressor to the desert. This inflator/gauge is so awesome as I can check quickly and stay safe with proper inflation pressure. I have used mine for a year and had no issues. The clamp on valve stem is a must for taking my rear truck tires to tow pressure of 80 psi as I lower to 65 when not towing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works like a charm","review":"Gave as a gift but seems to work like a charm.

Of course, I still expected the gauge to be useful but it is not! It's almost 10 psi off. Against several other known good gauges I have this one reads high. So far my clip hasn't failed. Of course it doesn't come with the connector for the air hose - how would they know which style you have?Now I have to find a replacement gauge. Likely will have to re-tap for a larger thread, as I cannot find a replacement gauge that fits the current threads.Charge me 2$ more and use a better gauge - I'd be much happier!2 stars - since other than the gauge it works."},{"rating":"2","title":"easier to read but not necessarily accurate","review":"The tire inflator works well. its proven easier to use than its gas station style predecessor.

As other reviewers have noted, the setup does involve some manual button presses etc to get the remote sensor to talk to the main unit but if one follows the instructions, its OK. Also, since the remote sensor is ruggedized for outdoor use, the battery compartment and buttons all have to be accessed after removing 4 tiny screws - so make sure you have a small Phillips screwdriver handy.The problem began when I replaced batteries on the remote sensor. It no longer talks to the main unit. I placed it indoors, near the main unit, 10ft from the main unit just trying to get a connnection but no luck.

The Who's original \\"Tommy\\" album was a success due to it's innovative music but it's very thin storyline and simple themes of worldly gain and loss glare akwardly in this original Broadway cast recording. Peter Townsend's original work compared itself to traditional opera in that it's story was secondary, indeed only a backdrop to the music, but Broadway takies it oh so seriously with nary a drop of humility and restraint.

The rawness and the sinister quality of the original is lost in a mix of terribly done British accents, more emphasis on the tonality and pronunciation of the words than the content and subtext to have any feeling. This is a rock opera. Why not play it as one? I bought this as mere curiosity and was very disappointed. If you are a Who fan and know this show from it's original form, do not purchase this CD.

The story is told out great through this CD. Although reading the synopsis helps visualize more, the lyrics and music really let the listener grip it all. A word on the lyrics, They aren't the greatest words ever written, but they're pretty good. And the singers on this CD give it so much life its unbelievable.

Sometimes when a book has multiple authors the chapters don't fit together perfectly; in this book the paragraphs seemed slammed together in a random fashion.

Uggh, plus many technical inaccuracies -- very, very disappointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"IDG Rename this 5.0 secrets","review":"This was not a 5.5 book at all.

It has so many TIPS & TRICKS & SECRETS which no other book will give you. I don't think that even the Exchange developers realise how many tricks you can do with the existing code.

I was recently diagnosed with diabetes, so I am always on the lookout for good recipes that I can prepare and eat without messing up my diet. I had heard good things about the Everyday with Rachael Ray magazine, so when I found this great price I decided to try it. I loved the general setup of the magazine, but was disappointed that the recipes didn't show any nutritional information.

Buyer beware!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Bland Boring Food","review":"My husband and I got a subscription for this magazine in an attempt to broaden our weekday meal repertoire, and we were sadly disappointed. The food is very bland with a lot of the recipes consisting of sausage and eggs. Most of the recipes just had salt and pepper as their main spice. When we live in such multicultural society, I would expect that it would be reflected in the recipes. Her fried rice (the only Asian-inspired food) did not even contain soy sauce or oyster sauce, and the only other ethnically inspired food represented in this magazine was Americanized Mexican. We tried the weekly menu planner and by day four, both my husband and I were craving something with taste.

I think her recipe \\"lingo\\" is really annoying and condescending (\\"just eyeball it\\") and her food is pedestrian and bland. The magazine itself is pretty to look at, well edited, and some of the features are interesting. But if you're looking for great food, subscribe to Bon Appetit or Food & Wine. I think this is aimed toward fans of her show and her \\"tries-to-hard-to-be-cute\\" banter. Too bad Oprah didn't want to promote Giada or Ina instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Administrative Problem","review":"Took 5 months to receive 1st issue. There are much better cooking mags available.

The problem I have is none of the recipes really appeal to me. Either they are strange, example: \\"Elvis Styled Grilled Banana Sundaes\\" or just not appealing \\"Salami, White Bean and Water Cress Crostini.\\" She focuses a lot on pasta dishes, dishes with tomato, appetizers which are fine, but not tempting, and I don't find they have as much family appeal. The non-holiday months are fairly generic, although I admit I do like the Fall and December issues.There are also articles that focus on clothing, travel and the psychology of shopping.I would suggest buying a few issues and seeing if her style and tastes are yours."},{"rating":"2","title":"Full of fun and food","review":"I have been reading this magazine for over a year now and I absolutely love it. There are always great recipes to share with friends and family also I love the wine pairing section. I do not drink wine but when I have a dinner party and use one of Rachel's recipes I know what wine to include for dinner.The messes and successes is a fun section its great to know that you are not the only one that messes things up in the kitchen.One section that I always read is pet friendly. My dog loves the treats and I make enough to share with my friends dogs too!A section that is very helpful is Everyday menu planner. You can pull it out, take it to the grocery with you and plan a week worth of great meals.

MOP would be crushed. its stupid how MOP gets all this hype when its average at best.sure, all of you metallica fans can wax it with all of the praise you want to make yourself like it that much, but it sucks big time when compared to real metal. this album was hyped up about as much as y2k,you will find better metal out there then this, go get savatage's \\"dungeons are calling\\" for some real metal."},{"rating":"1","title":"THERE ARE TOO MANY OBSESSED W/ THIS ALBUM","review":"master of puppets ain't all that great, it is possible that its one of the most overrated albums of our time. the reason i say this is because there are so many albums that would grind this to dust, like slayers \\"reing in blood\\" iron maidens\\"powerslave\\"accepts\\"balls to the wall\\",ect, get over this guys, its alright by itself, but its nothing compared to real metal,get into real metal and not teenage garage band metal like this.P.S. what is all of the hype behind cliff burton? how is he in any way a bass god like every one claimes him to be? his bass lines were easy as hell! i don't get it, this fool was a o.k. bassist, but by no means a master, steve haris could have buried this clown."},{"rating":"1","title":"14 year olds know nothing about metal...","review":"... it figures that there is some 14 year old snot-nosed reviewer praising this album,hell,i bet he probably listened linkin park and eminem before finding \\"master of puppets\\".listen, this album sucks big time, compare it to any other real 80's metal album and you will see how crappy it is. don't support that A hole lars ulrich by being fooled by even liking this album. do some growing up before ya get into metal kid, o.k.?"},{"rating":"2","title":"YEEEAAAAHHH!","review":"Oh my god.

Sadly, this was Burton's last album ... and after that, Met went steadily downwards with a more mainstream sound. This album's probably the best metal album you'll ever hear.

I think they will never put out another album like this. Cliff is the Jimi Hendrix of bass players. If you never heard a Metallica album before, this is the one you should start with."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's simply the best !","review":"When I first listened to this record, I wasn't sure if it is really the same Metallica who recorded \\"Load\\". This album is the most incredible thing that I have ever listened to. You can hear there influence of Black Sabbath (for me nothing strange, Sabbaths are just the best), specially on \\"Damage inc\\" & \\"Battery\\". I think that in 1986 drugs really worked for Metallica. Song \\"Master of puppets\\" is the best example. In my opinion this is the best Metallica's album and they will never record anything like this anymore. Perhaps if Cliff didn't die.... If anyone wants to get in touch with me just write to my adresse."},{"rating":"2","title":"Welcome home","review":"The last of Cliff.He realy seemed to put his life into this one.We all miss his talent and power he put into Metallica.The power of \\"Kill 'em all\\" seems to be put back into Battery as the speed blows your mind and and rips of one of your legs.Metallica realy are getting to the standard we expect in 2001 and are realy close to the final stile as James' voice gets deeper and the kind of rhythm we expect in \\"load\\"You must get this CD it is the best of all Cliff."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great","review":"This is probably the best metal album ever. I have listened to this cd a few hundred times, and I'm still not tired of it. Battery and Master of Puppets are two of the top 10 best metal songs of all time, and Master has one of the Best solos. It's too bad that they suck so much now."},{"rating":"2","title":"YESSSSSSSSSSS!","review":"Master of Puppets rips especially Damage Inc. The first three are awesome and so is Disposable Heroes.Battery-absolute power, intro takes awhile to kick in. Master of Puppets-All fast beat except for the middle of the song where it slows down, I fastforward it. The Thing that Should not Be-little slower but good to say the lyrics to. Welcome Home(Sanitarium)-not too bad but I like the ending. Disposable Heroes-awesome song of course. Leper Messiah-ok but other songs are better. Orion-instrumental, okay. Damage Inc.-best song on the CD!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Definitive Metallica","review":"Arguably the definitive Metallica album. A must-have, along with \\"Ride the Lightning\\" for any Metal fan."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best albums period.","review":"Not only is this probably the best heavy metal album of all time, but it is hands down one of the greatest albums of all time.Guitarest Kirk Hammet and bassist Cliff Burton had more song writing influence on this album than Metallica's two previous efforts-Kill Em' All and Ride the Lightning. They brought in more of a classical element to the song writing. Such is evident with songs like Battery, Master ofPuppets, WelcomeHome(Sanitarium)and Orion. Especially Battery, the song starts off acoustic. The highlights are Battery, Master ofPuppets, Welcome Home(Sanitarium)and Orion, but the whole album is solid the whole way through, never relenting in hard edge, melodicness and intense vocals. If you love Metallica, hell if you own a cd player, buy this album. Ive had it for about 2 years and it is still awesome everytime I put it on.Make sure you crank up the volume!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Last of the Masters","review":"This album was the end of Metal Metallica. Although they tried to continue this in Justice for all, their sounds have changed since then and also their writting ability. Master of Puppets is their last hard work effort to metal music. If you buy a Metallica album to hear their good works this one is it. Next would be Ride the Lightning."},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic Thrash Metal Album","review":"True classic thrash metal album and one of Metallica's best albums too date. Every song on here is from 5-9 minutes long each with heavy guitar pounding beats and heavy stellar beats that make this CD a must have. Some key tracks on here are, battery, master of puppets, damage inc, and the thing that should not be. I love all the songs on here and its great album too listen too if your bored one day pull this cd out or buy it and than blast it. Great Metallica album one of the best Metallica albums there is buy today!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The \\"Master\\" of all Metal albums! (Period).","review":"To be the greatest metal band ever, it would only make sense to hold the title as having made the greatest metal album ever, right? Exactly! This is Metallica's Magnum Opus. Many tried to duplicate this \\"perfect\\" album and EVERYONE failed. I'm not even going to attempt to give any highlights, okay i will anyway....Every song!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Timeless!","review":"I'm writing this review 17 years after this record was released and I'm writing with the same admiration and awe as when I first heard it. It has not gotten old or stale and if anything I appreciate it even more given the current sad state of affairs in the music buisness. This is a seminal hard rock/metal milestone. It ranks with the very best of the genre; including Black Sabbath's \\"Paranoid\\", Nirvana's \\"Nevermind\\", Guns N Rose's \\"Appetite for Destruction\\", AC/DC's \\"Back in Black\\" and Led Zeppelin 4. It is a near flawless example of metal fused with melody and compelling song writing and musicianship.Best tracks: Battery, Disposable Heroes, Damage Inc, Sanitarium."},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic!!!","review":"Excelent work by Metallica. Everything is fine in this album: the concep, the artcover, the lyrics, the songs, the guitar solos and, of course, Cliff. Fav tracks: Sanitarium, Master of Puppets and Orion. Buy it and remember the good old Metallica."},{"rating":"2","title":"I Am A New Metallica Fan","review":"I am a new Metallica fan who just started listening to Metallica's music. I heard the song ''The Unforgiven II'' on the radio and I loved it, so it led me to buy the album ''Reload''. I thought that it was an awesome album. I loved all the songs on it. Then I bought the album ''Master Of Puppets'' because I heard it was Metallica's best. I have to say that this album is outstanding. I don't own all the albums yet but this is the best collection of heavy metal I have ever heard. There is only 8 songs but it is over an hour of great heavy metal music with not one boring moment. This album is much better than Reload but all of Metallica's songs that I have heard so far are great. I am a new Metallifan but I know that this is some of the greatest music I have ever heard. ROCK ON METALLICA!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Golden Age","review":"I would give anything to go back in time to 1986. Reign in Blood was kicking the world's ass, Megadeth was Selling Peace, and prog shred just started to hit the air waves. More importantly, Master of Puppets was released and it defined Metallica. It was their climax, their epic, their swan song. From the fires of Battery, to the onslaught of Disposable Heroes, to the majesty of Orion, to The Thing That Should Not Be, the album defys the mortal coil of metal and proclaims itself god. Though Slayer is the king of my metal empire, Master of Puppets is incredibly significant, with only the spitefully fast fury that is Damage Inc. holding them back from perfection. Obey your Master."},{"rating":"2","title":"Metallica's Best Album","review":"I got this back in the spring of '86 when it first was released. After the mellow Spanish sounding acoustical intro to \\"Battery\\" you get really kicked in the gut. WOW!!! I literally wore the cassette version of this out over the spring and summer of that year. All songs on here are great and have aged very well unlike alot of 80s metal. Not a big fan of instrumentals but \\"Orion\\" has to be the best instrumental ever. Hard to pick a favorite track off here but it is probably the title track though \\"The Thing That Should Not Be\\" is really great too. James Hetfield's vocals are really eerie on this track. If you only have one Metallica CD this should be it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Really Powerful Metal Album though","review":"Master of Puppets is a really powerful metal album with amazing riffs, drums and so forth. Battery was an amazing intro to the metal album, the album itself is almost perfect though I didn't care for track 6 because of the lryics. As for the rest of the album their are mutiple songs to love and enjoy plus you can bang you head to over and over again just like their album And Justice for All. So if you love or like your metal music then look into buying this album and savoring the music off of it. If your already a Metallica fan like myself then you already have this album in your collection of Metallica albums."},{"rating":"2","title":"its very nice","review":"First off, I have been a Metallica fan since I was in my teens. I've heard and seen it all from these guys. This album changed music forever for me. Master of Puppets, Ride the Lightning and Kill'em All are the three pillars for this band's success and the albums buy which all other metal albums should be judged."},{"rating":"2","title":"Vinyl version is garbage!","review":"I was excited to pick up a copy of this for a good price from a local music store only to take it home, open it up, and listen to it and find out that it was pressed like crap. Right out of the wrappping the record skipped all over the place, my guess is it was produced poorly, and i have super dirty, old records that don't even do this. An amazing album of course, but if you want it on vinyl i would stick to the original pressing."},{"rating":"1","title":"I didn't see what the big deal was.","review":"Why is this album highly praised? Was it becuase the movie OLD SCHOOL had it in the background? maybe so.Metallica sucks. The only decent albums they have are load and reload and their masterpiece ST anger. Their first 5 albums are really bad."},{"rating":"1","title":"Metallica sucked then and sucks now!","review":"The songs were long and repetitive the riff for Master of the Puppets sounds like the cd got scratched and skipped. Don't listen to this sh** or extremly gay Iron Maiden listen to good 80s metal like GNR Motley Crue Def Leppard Van Halen. Yeah theyre more poppy but they actually made good music. The only decent hardcore bands are Ozzie Osbourne/Black Sabbath, Pantera and Nirvana. Ill tell you metallica fans this as much as I hate metallica, Iron maiden makes metallica look good"},{"rating":"1","title":"This doesnt even deserve 1 star","review":"I hated this album so much. The only thing worse then new Metallica is Old Metallica. Someone told me to buy this album, so I did and it is the worst album in my collection. The SONGS NEVER END. If you want a good album Buy BLEACH by Nirvana... all you Metal heads will like the album...Bleach sounds nothing like Nevermind.P.S. did i mention that this is the worst album I have ever listened to. I am surprised that Metallica didnt fizzle out as fast as the spice girls."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring...","review":"This CD is quite possibly THE most overrated album of all time. There is so many songs on this CD that just drag on for far too long and the song writing isnt strong enough to hold my interest. They try to make each song an epic but they fail terribly to do so in the process. What this band does manage to do though is create very boring generic thrash that just makes you tired. While listening to this CD...maybe they'll have an interesting riff but once that riff emerges...the band beats it into the ground until you're sick of it. Metallica does not feature strong song writers and the only good thing that they managed to do in their career is make thrash popular so more of the music was created (and better at that). Oh, I also can handle long songs because I like Opeth and they create long song structures."},{"rating":"1","title":"You guys are gay metallica","review":"this is just sloppy messy misic and if you lke that kind of feeling when you think your cool and blast this loser CD and roll down your windows in your big truck. this is just bad it makes me want to kill little bunnies and worrship statan. The lyrics are dumb and sometimes dont make any sense and there. There is some good guitar but hey its so much over rated. This used to be one of my favorite but now I realize that they are just another 80s metal band nothing special."},{"rating":"1","title":"A HUGE WASTE OF MONEY IF YOU LIKE THE NEW METALLICA!","review":"I bought the black album and I totally loved it. Then after that I bought S&M another good one. On S&M I loved all the songs from master of puppets so i bought the cd master of puppets. I totally hated it. The only single song I kind of liked just a tiny bit was battery and that song gets old. i strongly recomend you DO NOT bye this cd if you have listened to the newer metallica!"},{"rating":"1","title":"another classic in the world of wanna be metal","review":"I can't stress how bad this band is. Particularly their drummer and singer. They think they are like the best at what they do when they really ... James Hetfield's style of singing is annoying, talentless, and shows his cocky attitude. And he acts like he's like a heavy metal god when the band isn't even heavy....or metal. One interview in a magazine will show this. Same with Lars, the drummer. He's not good at all. Kirk is a good guitarist but not good enough to be compared to the likes of Dimebag Darrell, or any other great guitar legend. This band may have been better back when this album was released but it's still Metallica and it still sucks. And to think that they are compared to the likes of Pantera or Slayer! This is music for those metal wannabe's who think they're cool because they ride a Harley and don't take showers."},{"rating":"1","title":"THEY WERE SOO MUCH BETTER ON ST.

More like TRASH metal! Get St. Anger instead.","review":"I don't know why people think this is Metallica's greatest album! It's the same riff over and over and over and over, and I have not even seen a MOP music video on MTV. Like seriously, where's the variety, like in St. Anger?So I say to avoid this album at all costs and get St. Anger. Load and Reload are awesome as well, and if St. Anger is too badazz for you, get those two first to prepare for the ANGER!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Do NOT BUY THIS","review":"THIS IS ABSOLUTLEY AWFUL. IT ALL SOUNDS EXACTLY THE SAME. IF YOU BUY THIS, YOU MUST BE COMPLETELY FOOLISH, BECAUSE YOU WOULD BE BETTER OFF FLUSHING YOUR MONEY DOWN THE BOG. ONLY BRAIN-DEAD TOWNIES WITH NO INTELLIGENECE HIGHER THE 15iq SHOULD BUY THIS. IT IS TOTALLY GARBAGE."},{"rating":"2","title":"Metallica's moment of greatness!","review":"Master of Puppets is Metallica's breakthrough album, and it is also their best album,never again would they make anything close to this good. Master of Puppets opens with Battery, then we have the album's highlight the song Master of Puppets. This is what good metal is all about, this album is one of the albums that defines heavy metal. If you're interested in Metallica this is the album to own. Stay away from everything after ...And Justice for All, because after that they became sellouts and most of the stuff they've done since they became commercialized sucks!STAY AWAY FROM ST.ANGER, IT IS THE WORST ALBUM OF ALL TIME!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A must have","review":"Master of Puppets is one of the greatest rock and roll albums, not just metal, ever produced.This album is a masterpiece from start to finish. When this album came out Metallica was just a word of mouth band, gaining fans from there live shows. You can have the black album, any true Metallica from the start knows that this is Metallica."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing","review":"Honestly the only thing I can say about this album is that its the single greatest album ever produced. Pure musical genius. I wish i could give it more stars so i could express how amazing this album is. From Kurks outstanding guitar to Lars's thrash drumming i cant find any room for improvement. It saddens me to see them produce the [...] they did in the 90's. Long live the gods of thrash metal!"},{"rating":"2","title":"ONE OF MY FAVOURITE BANDS EVER!!!","review":"Metallica are great!!!

As far as shear talent, ...And Justice For All, for a shear power sound, Master of Puppets. This is an essential recording for any metal or Metallica fiend!

Highly recommend!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Heavy Metal's \\"Master (Of) Piece\\"","review":"When I Fist Bought this album, I was trilled by the fantastic music work of Metallica.

Even the instrumental Orion showcased the late great Cliff Burton whom was a better bass player pallies than that joke they have now! Buy now!"},{"rating":"2","title":"MASTER MASTER","review":"Awesome album. Master and Battery kicks hard. And I love the metal play of Orion. My favorite is Sanitarium. This is a must have for any Metallica fan; oh though, I must disagree with a lot of people here. I think Metallica has been doing their best since this album. They had made great albums then, and they are still making them good. I don't care what anyone says. Sure they have a different sound now, but it's still great. If every album sounded the same, then they would be boring. Anything Metallica sings is great. They are great even when they suck. Get all the albums if you are a true Metallica fan."},{"rating":"2","title":"A TRUE MASTERPIECE!","review":"This is arguably the best metal CD ever. The title track is simply amazing, and arguably recognized the best metal song ever. Everything but Leper Messiah is awesome (not to say Leper is bad!). This is THE ideal metal CD.

[...]"},{"rating":"2","title":"Obey your master and own this album","review":"I know you've seen and read hundreds of reviews that tell you how great and grand this album is......and thats just what it is! One of my favorite thrash albums of my collection. The best tracks of the album are without a doubt Battery, Master of Puppets, Sanitarium, and Disposable Heros. I'm not saying that the other songs arent as good, I'm just saying you should probably listen to these ones before the others if you want the good stuff first. I heard somewhere that Dave Mustaine is co-writer of Master of Puppets and Leper Messiah...I dont know if its true, but whether he did or not, they are great songs. And that is my two cents on this album."},{"rating":"2","title":"What?!","review":"This is to that loser who said Blink 182, Sum 41, and Simple Plan was harder than Metallica. What in gods name are you on? You said Korn invented Metal? Korn is downright talentless crap. Your obviously some eight year old who doesnt know the basis that invented rock. Your a downright disgrace. Along with sissy punk bands. If you can judge crappy music with good ratings, you obviously dont know talent. Do you know who invented punk? I didnt think so. Metallica is a good band (except for thier newer albums) and stomp a mudhole in all the bands you call music. What kind of name is Korn? Blink 182? Simple Plan? Sum 41? Sounds like, well, I cant think of anything that makes sense that relates."},{"rating":"2","title":"For fans of well produced brilliant metal","review":"Just enough fast, hard, intelligent, metal for anyone's taste. Well maybe not everyone, but anyone who appreciates really good metal. I must admit that I am not a fan of the \\"New Stuff\\" Metallica has done, but I do realize that it is good music either way. I just happen to like Metallica the way they were. Master of Puppets will keep you awake on a long road trip and will make any party a bit better if you cater to that kind of crowd. I think this is Metallica at their best. You will not be disappointed. GO NOW and get it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best album ever","review":"This is an awesome album it just doesnt get boring. This is the best album Metallica ever released and it is one of the best metal albums of all time. If you're new to Metallica and think any of the recent stuff(anything after the black album) is good get this album ASAP! Actually even if you hate the new stuff get this album, you wont regret it. All of the songs are good. The title track is awesome and the lyrics are great. But my personal favorite is Damage INC. It starts out really slow and then explodes into a really fast really good tune. The guitar solo is wicked. Welcome home is about a guy in an asylum. James was a genius with the lyrics. Metallica should fire Bob Rock and go back to James writing the lyrics. The new albums wouldn't bite then. All fans need to have this one in their collection."},{"rating":"1","title":"What have they done to this album?","review":"In theory this is an LP done in an ideal way - half speed mastered, on quality heavy vinyl, with playback at 45rpm. How does it sound? Frankly terrible - compressed, dull, lacking dynamics, almost like a blanket is being thrown over the speaker. My CD copy sounds better. And I see that I am not alone in feeling let down by this pressing. Surely one of the greatest metal albums of all time deserves better?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your money. These reissued LP's are made with flawed presses.","review":"Out of all the reissues the only lp's that work for me are kill em all which is probly the only one worth getting it sounds better than the rest. Ride the lightning plays ok, but doesn't sound any near as good as the cd and the cd is miles away from sounding as good as the original lp. Puppets is the worst of all of em. I tried multiple copys on multiple players with differnt stylus. You would be better off getting original lp's anyway cuz these reissues are very dull n lifeless when compared. I sent my reisses back n amazon was good about the refund."},{"rating":"2","title":"This Album Set The Bar","review":"This is by far my favorite Metallica album. When I picked this up, I was blown away by their intensity and raw power. It also has some great songs on it. Afterward, I picked up their previous albums and everything up to the black album, and this is still my favorite.This album, which I believe was their third, saw them really get their chops. It shows in the structure and quality of the songs.I can't say much more that hasn't already been said. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"ANOTHER GEM!","review":"This is another metal gem, awesome music altogether, this is a metal album you must own, you will be glad you did, i must mention that this is bassist Cliff Burton's last album with Metallica before he was killed in a car crash, and Jason Newsted took his place, just wanted to let you know that, but like i said above this is an awesome album and highly recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Never Saw the Big Deal","review":"New Metallica, old Metallica, both are worthless artifacts from their respective time periods. Always sounding like the gay Slayer, Metallica's only decent purpose in my eyes was for good bands to be able to cover their second rate attempts at thrash. My theory? Anyone who owns a Metallica shirt has an I.Q. below 65."},{"rating":"1","title":"Music? What music?","review":"Music? This is not music. It's only the usual poor metal stuff, just like all the other metal rubbish. If you bang your head against the wall you obtain the same frantic chaos inside you. Useless and dangerous, without any porpouse, any importance, any difference from...nothingness. So, make yourself and your health a favour and buy something else, something lightfull and joyfull. Something to feel, to think, to remember. Anything else, but metal."},{"rating":"1","title":"Orion is the only good song.","review":"Master of Puppets is a really overrated album, which I don't like music that just seems the same. I've bought a lot of Metallica CDs and thought, these guys are overrated, I mean James Hetfield can't sing, he just screams. He's not anything like Mark Knopfler, or Lou Gramm. Anyway, to this album, well, I thought this was a really annoying album, the title track is just nothing but screaming. Orion is about the only decent song off the whole CD. Rest of the other songs deserves zero stars. Metallica only made about 5 decent tracks, 4 of the others are off the Black Album. Listen to those 5 and stop messin' around with Metallica's lame songs. I will never forget Lars Ulrich, I like Metallica because he's a great drummer(one of the best drummers period!).I'll give this 1 star because Orion rocks!! Rest of the other songs are crappy.......Buy this and the Black Album and avoid all the other CDs from Metallica. Thanks,Brothers in Arms."},{"rating":"1","title":"Utter Nonsense","review":"This so-called \\"great\\" album is extremely overrated.

I still like Metallica, but this was not their best work."},{"rating":"1","title":"METALLICA SUCKS HORRIBLE","review":"I don't like heavy metal.

As you have probably heard. From start to finish, this album is just simply amazing and brilliant. It's just completley clear that you have to own this album. You will be stunned by the brilliant riffs and lyrics on this album. And Cliff is rockin'! The best track in my opinion is Master of Puppets! This album has sold over a million copies and for very good reason. These times were Metallica's best. And some other definite metal albums you must own are:Metallica - Kill 'Em AllMetallica - Ride The LightningMetallica - ...And Justice For AllDeath - Scream Bloody GoreSlayer - Reign In BloodThe Best of Malevolent CreationMegadeth - Rust In Peace"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best album in the history of all music, not just metal.","review":"Battery: Thrash insanity;good way to open up the album. One of my personal faves.Master of Puppets: An epic! Awesome riffs, solos and lyrics. A tad lengthy but hey: It still rulesThe Thing that Should Not Be: My least favorite on the album, but still a great song. Kind of has that sludgy old-school Sabbath feel.Welcome Home(Sanitarium): A great ballad. Changes things up a bit. One of my all time favorite 'Tallica songs.Disposable Heroes: Same as 'Puppets. A little lengthy but still great.Leper Messiah: Slows things up a bit but retains it's heaviness. A taste of the years to come.Orion: Metallica's best instrumental ever. And that's aying something.Damage,Inc.: Heaviest on the album( or any other Metallica album for that matter) and one of the best.Great way to close it.Puppets is by far the best album of all time.

It is one of those extremely rare albums where everysong is totally kick-ass. From the Raunchy yet artfully distorted Orion to the violent screaming and unmatchible guitar solos of the title track, there is no better album of its kind.

And just as a sidenote, for all of you losers who hate St. Anger and like their 80's stuff, you do not deserve to be called fans of Metallica. That album is heavier than Load and reload, they intentionally did that to return back to their trademark heavy sound, ..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Album...Terrible Vinyl Edition","review":"I purchased the Vinyl edition of this album about a month ago. I was excited to listen to \\"Orion\\" only to be disappointed by constant hisses and pops from a BRAND NEW Vinyl. One track wouldn't even play all the way through it would reach a certain point and skip over and over again.I thought I might have gotten a bad disk so I returned it. The second disk had exactly the same problems. I've bought 20 year old vinyls that sounded better.I think this is just a really cheap pressing. I've noticed that the best vinyls tend to advertise they have a high grain (180). This vinyl seems really thin and cheap. Maybe that is why it is so messed up.I'm giving the vinyl edition 1 star. Its a 5 star album though."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awsome!!!! Loud, Fast, and, Heavy","review":"Battery is the best song on this album next to Master Of Puppets. The Messiah commands you to buy this album!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"What a disapointment","review":"After reading all of the glowing reviews of this LP I was very excited to get a copy. I have to say that I was completely disapointed. At first, I thought the turntable or phono pre amp had a problem. But when I listened to another LP, it sounded great. This isn't like when you see a movie that has great reviews and it doesn't live up to the hype, it is worse then that. This is, simply put, a very bad sounding LP.When I compared it to the CD remastered in 1999, the CD just blew it away. Given the extent to which this album was made there is no reason for this. I cannot understand how anyone can think that this sounds good in ANY way. It is always possible that I received a bad copy or the 100,000 press but I don't think that's it.Save your money, buy the CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"The pinnacle of thrash","review":"This is not the best album of all time; that honor goes to Black Sabbath's Paranoid.

I think more than on any other Metallica albums you can feel the hand of Cliff Burton. I will always consider it to be 'his' album.

It's a great album, but not as smooth or sophisticated as Ride or ...And Justice."},{"rating":"2","title":"powerfull and hard!","review":"master of puppets is a great album. its much harder than lightening and kill em all. i dont think its their best though. lightening is better in my opinion and black is better. no song on master can top fade to black and 1-8 on master is not as good as 1-12 on black album. i like james voice better on master than lightening, but its just not as good. Dont get me wrong its an awesome album. not too many bands can get a five star rating on their third best album. that means that they just kick ass. master of puppets, leper messiah, sanatarium, and orion are very well played songs. overall their third best album."},{"rating":"2","title":"THIS IS METALLICAS BEST!","review":"When i got this cd, i immediately listened to it.

It's just a bunch of giberish that u can't even understand. Here are my favorite metal bands: Black Sabbath(Ozzy Osbourne), Led Zepplin, and Meatllica. Now i admit Metallica went down hill after the Black Album. But this CD is a masterpiece. There guitar solo's are amazing and there music is pure metal. Now thats my opinion but anbody who knows metal will probably agree with me. So buy whatever u want but if u want a real metal album or a classic buy this album. It's probably their best."},{"rating":"2","title":"Master of puppets","review":"This album is just too good. The beginning song battery gets this album off to an excellent start. Very fast and very well played. Next the title song is an all around masterpiece. Mixing excellent heavy riffs and melody and the signature metallica \`heaviness'. This in part also due to the presence of Cliff Burton, whose bass playing is still among the best recognized anywhere. The next tune, \`thing that should not be' which live they play it way awesome, is another well written and executed tune. Worth mentioning also is Cliff Burton's bass intro to damage inc which will leave you wondering that it would have been a great idea if he had released an album with him on bass, and all the awesome sounds he got out of it."},{"rating":"2","title":"If you don't like this album....","review":"Then you're an idiot. Other than the Black Album, this is quite possibly the finest example of heavy metal ever recorded. The songs have meaning and substance (although some take longer for you to figure out just what that meaning and substance IS), the band plays extremely well, and above all else, it's just really, really good to crank up way louder than need be.I happen to prefer the faster variety of metal, and that's also something that Master of Puppets delivers in quantity."},{"rating":"2","title":"The BEST album ever!","review":"I have been listening hard'n heavy for 13 years, and I have been listening this album for 12 years. My opinion never changed. Although I am thinking that Metallica is No.1 or not after Load and Reload (I think time will show), definitely this is the BEST album ever. Excellent guitars, bass, drums, vocals, lyrics plus soul(not soul music) result in No.1 album."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the Greatest Metal albums of all time","review":"All I need to say really. Despite this, Metallica is not the greatest metal band of all time. That honor will always go to Black Sabbath. But \\"Master\\" is a masterpiece of speed, lyrics and arrangment.

They, in my opinion, reached their peak on this album for that particular style, and after the not as good (but still excellent) 'And Justice for all', They moved on to newer pastures. Good - Theres nothing worse than a band that lingers too long on the same theme. When they released their self titled album, it was the best move they could make. Sanatarium (as many seem to agree) has to be the best, followed closely by Orion."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply Amazing","review":"This has to be their best album ever.

Master of Puppets is way up there and most likely their best work. This is the CD that defined thrash metal. The dark lyrics, the pounding drums, the roaring bass, and the ultra-fast guitar work of Kirk Hammet and James Hetfield. Every song is incredible. The best are probably \\"Master of Puppets\\", \\"Welcome Home(Sanitarium)\\", \\"Disposable Heroes\\", and \\"Orion\\".

Stop searching, and just go back."},{"rating":"2","title":"If you like metal you should own this album. Period.","review":"Metallica used to rule the thrash metal scene with an iron fist. With albums like \\"Master of Puppets\\", who could not admit that they were the best at what they did.

I would certainly recommend purchasing this album to anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"The crown jewel of metal","review":"Even if you're not a metal fan, you can find a few likeable parts such as the opening of \\"Battery\\", the interlude in the title track, the beginning of \\"Sanitarium\\", and the middle part in \\"Orion\\". And if you ever have \\"one of those days\\", you'll be surprised how listening to \\"Leper Messiah\\" or \\"Damage, Inc.\\" can be such a release.Metallica will never even try to make another album like this, and thats as it should be. Not only should you not mess with perfection, but once you've achieved it, you don't need to prove yourself anymore."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best Metallica album ever!!","review":"Master Of Puppets (the last album with their late bassist Cliff Burton) is arguably Metallica's best album ever. Kirk Hammett's lightning fast guitar solos, Cliff's roaring bass, Lars Ulrich's in your face drum work, and James Hetfield's vocals just kill for me.

Compared with their earlier work, and set next to their latest stuff, this is simply the best. They dropped the yelling and insenced rage from their two previous albums and exchanged it for a balance between the hardcore nature of their music and the intelligence of the lyrics/song subjects. In my opinion, only their self-titled album, commonly called The Black Album, can match, if exceed Master of Puppets. Master of Puppets is truly an exceptional piece of musical and lyrical accomplishment, and definitely worth the price of purchase to add it to your collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"Greatness (better than 5 stars)","review":"If you were to compile a list of the \\"Top 10 CDs That Changed The Face Of Music\\", this would be on that list.

Since when did this apply to 4 would-be-mechanics, whose main artistic feat thus far is breaking the record for smallest pair of pants squeezed into, and most horse-like haircut? I am appalled. I haven't even touched on the 'music' yet.The 'music'? Well, if you believe that many painful minutes of buzzsaw guitars combined with a drummer, adding unnecessary fills to satisfy his vanity, combined with the monotonous roar of...a...horse in pain (or so it seems), is genius, well then YOU need to look in the mirror...and ask.....why... do I look just like my idols?Nay!It gets a star for the front cover. One common destiny. Noted."},{"rating":"1","title":"A huge disapointment!","review":"Metallica is the most overated band on earth. They are a very decent band, but they just don't have enough talent to be an excellent band. They have 2 good albums, the black album, ride the lightning, and thats it. This album is barely listenible. The songs have no meaning to them, they are just a waste of time."},{"rating":"1","title":"this is not real metal","review":"I watched the MTV Icon show honouring Metallica so I figured \\"Hey, these guys must be good if they're on MTV!!\\". Needless to say I heard some of the songs of st. Anger and Reload - as well as a couple of the \\"Metallica\\" album and was quite impressed (although the latter album sucks overall). So I decided to check out some of their older stuff from the 80s. Big mistake. Back then these guys were just a bunch of goths telling you to take drugs and kill yourself. Also the songs are too long. Some of these are over 8 minutes!! If a song goes longer than 3 then it's boring. Thank god they woke up and decided to play on MTV and learnt how to actually play."},{"rating":"1","title":"Metallica MOP.......The Cd that you know isn't good","review":"The Metallica Master of Puppets Cd is way below average. Songs like Batteries, Something Like You, and Suffocating inside of Jose are way too comercial. Metallica needs to go back to their roots. If you want a good Metallica album buy St. Anger."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tom Judd likes it too","review":"I been listenin to Metallica sense I was 4 year old. I play it whenever I play chicken with parked semi-trucks on World Industry Way in Carmel Mountain Ranch. It gets me pumped up like Coach Faverty does in the Autoshop of Poway High School. They call me Tommy Jr. Because when me and Tom Judd get together, things tend to break. This CD gets me so pumped up I wanna go fight Josh Shultz and visit Pagan and Maige. I think some of these songs are almost as good as the lowrider song by War. I think it is worthy to be played over the General's P.A. in the parking lot before school starts. General Lee to Shepard, over. 10-4 to the Mothership. I swear by Bridgestone tires. But, if there was anything else I would swear by, it would have to be Metallica's Master of Puppets. But, I only gave them one star because they sued Napster."},{"rating":"1","title":"DEFECTS IN VINYL FROM NEW Manufacturing Problem","review":"When I purchased this item I was really looking forward to hearing some good Metallica in awesome sound quality, because hearing something on a brand new vinyl is like hearing it for the first time but I was extremely disappointed because right from the start the record would skip, I believe this to be a manufacturing error and not one of shipping or mishandling. I did not try to return it due to my schedule."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your money and get MOP original vinyl or CD","review":"I have compared the re-maser vinyl of MOP to an original, and was pretty shocked by what i found. The MOP vinyl remaster does not have that nice warm sound the original MOP vinyl does. Also the drums are barely audible at times in the songs. The symbols are also further back in the mix. If you are on a budget or want the best sound for your money. Go with getting the MOP 2000 remaster on CD, or an original MOP vinyl. Even the Music For Nations MOP Vinyls sound way better than this new vinyl remaster from Warner. Don't get me wrong I am a hardcore Metallica fan since 1995. Just steer clear of these remasters of Metallica albums on vinyl."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cliff's last album","review":"This is the best album when it comes to Cliff Burton stuff. This is the crunchiest burton album, and it makes you wonder where this band was headed. The is a wide variety on this album. The slow moody stuff, (sanitarium), the slow crunch, (thing that shouldn't be), and of course the speed/thrash metal, (master, damage). Buy this album, i promise you you'll like it. Cliff Burton truly shines on Master of Puppets."},{"rating":"2","title":"BEST CD METALLICA EVER MADE!!!!!","review":"I wont bore you with all the single song ratings, this cd is too good for that, I'm not gonna waste your time. Just putting it short, there is no flaw with this cd, it's Metallica in their prime. Master of Puppets (song)is my favorite Metallica song and best on the cd. Lots of awesome solos, really heavy and lots of madness. One of the best cds I've ever bought, definitely best Metallica cd. METALLICA RULES THE WORLD!!!!!!! BUY IT!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"What happened to true music?","review":"Although not a breakthrough album (that title goes to Ride the Lightning), Master of Puppets remains Metallicas defining album. In many respects, MOP is the greatest metal album of all time. From Hammet's feverish riffs to Ulrich's ferociousness and finall to Cliff Burton's unparalelled mastery of the bass guitar, Metallica's MOP is the work of a drunken ensemble at their prime. Unfortunately albums went downhill from MOP, as they released strong efforts in ...And Justice for All and self titled-- both of which had no comparison to the musical beauty that they captured on this 1986 masterpiece."},{"rating":"2","title":"I want old Metallica back!","review":"Old Metallica, please come back. Your new stuff sucks! Your new stuff has sucked for 17 years. I want back the Motorbreath Metallica. I want to bang my head again, not caress myself to love songs. If I want to listen to that, I would listen to the red hot chili peppers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic","review":"Every band with the right amount of talent at one point releases that one album that just seems perfect. For Metallica, that album was 'Master of Puppets'. This is a really great album. Every single song is great. Amazing guitar solos/riffs, great vocals, great bass, great drums, just a great production in general...I just can't say enough about this album. It is simply amazing. An essential for any rock fan."},{"rating":"2","title":"Master of Puppets","review":"I believe this album of MetallicA's is one of the greatest they have produced. This album has great songs such as \\"Battery\\", \\"Master of Puppets\\", \\"The Thing that Should Not Be\\" and more. This album is in a close second to my personal favorite and many other's and the highest on my list the \\"Black Album\\". It would have to be because of its smash hit songs and deep lyrics. If you are a true MetallicA fan than it is a definite must to have Master or the \\"Black Album\\". This album would be a great addition to any rock enthusiast's collection of CDs. I personally would buy this album but I have it already."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another amazing album from the master's of thrash metal","review":"One can only think when listening to Master of Puppets how amazing this album truly is. All the tracks are great heavy metal power ballads that will make anyone bang their head when listened to. Metallica really pays off with Master Of Puppets and simply is their best album to date. I am very upset to see how less the band has matured from this album. Tossing the public the half decent, infact not decent at all St. Anger. Forget that trash and pick this one up. Ask any Metallica fan, this album rules above all and always will. Master Of Puppets truly is a great album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Damage Inc. well done","review":"All I have to say is...intro of Damage Inc. It gives me shivers every time I listen to it. It is awesome. Not to mention Welcome Home, Master of Puppets, and Orion. Brilliant. Still not as good as Metallica Black album. Once again, Damage Inc."},{"rating":"2","title":"This album is kicks as*","review":"Master Of Puppets is a cool album to listen to. I believe it's one of the best ones Metallica has ever made. All the tracks on here are awsome, not like those othere albums where only two or three tracks are the best ones and the rest are boring."},{"rating":"2","title":"FIRST IS BEST!!!","review":"This was the first Metallica CD I ever owned. It is still my favorite and always will be. I have been a fan for 2 years and I still get a rush from Battery! METALLICA ROCKS!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Battery and Orion are all you need to listen to.","review":"I'll say yes, because this atleast has about 2 good songs in Battery and Orion. Listen to those. Battery makes me laugh."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good news for people who like crappy music","review":"What was good once usually becomes outdated after time. Such is the deal with Metallica. This album was good back then but now it's crap. It's just riff after riff. And whats more many people these days can play this stuff. If it was truly art, )which it is only considered by non-musicians and crappy musicians) then then it would be difficult. So as you all know Metallica are now sellouts and are fading from the metal scene. Good Riddance:) New bands like Blind Guardian (The gods of metal) simply put Metallica to shame. Its harder to play, Lyrics are more indepth, Drumming is 10x better. All of the people in Blind Guardian are 10x better then James, Kirk, Lars and which ever bassist you choose. There is really no comparison. And I know about real metal music and since you consider metallica to be the best, you obviously don't. So you should stay away from Blind Guardian because you don't deserve to listen to it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Metallica=The Kenny G of thrash metal!","review":"Master of Puppets is one of the most overhyped thrash metal records in existance, right up there with the awful Reign in Blood by Slayer. Everybody talks about how complicated the musicianship is and how heavy the sound is, but the truth is that Metallica are one of the lightest thrash metal bands. This record is easy listening compared to Death, Megadeth, Morbid Angel, Hate Eternal, etc. Those bands make Master of Puppets look like the latest Kenny G hit on an \\"easy listening\\" radio station!!! If you're looking for a heavy band, you might as well forget about listening to Metallica. But if you're a big fan of easy listening, I definately reccomend \\"Master of Puppets\\" to you! It'll go great with your \\"Kenny G Greatest Hits\\" CD! LOL!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"master of puppets is the best","review":"Master of Puppets is by far the best metallica album yet. For you metal or metallica fans I highly recommend purchasing this album. The price is right, the music is great, and it'll last forever. I listened to this album and was completely shocked. I didn't think that they would ever be able to top \\"Kill \`em All\\" but I was completely wrong. This album is not only heavier than kill em all, it is more musical. If you like the early metallica then you will love this album. If you like the new sold out metallica album then you will not like this album, unless you like both. It is a huge inspiration to all metal fans."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great CD","review":"Master of Puppets is one of my favorite Metallica albums. I like all the songs on the record to a degree. My favorites are: Master of Puppets, The Thing That Should Not Be, Welcome Home (Sanitarium), Leper Messiah (good car accident song), and Orion. This is an essential Metallica CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome thrash metal stuff, not my fav though","review":"I just became a Metallica fan just about a year ago and I just got this about a month ago. This cd is my 3rd favorite out of all of them. I'd listen to the whole cd except Leper Messiah is such a sacreligious song. Anyways, this one's better than Ride The Lightning because at least you can understand his voice and the thrashing is a lot more thoroughly written. Plus, there's a lot of deepness to the cd. I like ...And Justice for All better just because. But, Black is my favorite. Well, Orion is my favorite song even though most like Master of Puppets. I just love instrumental songs cause I'm a guitar player and I love how intricately written the song is and all the harmonies that go together plus the awesome chunky main riffs. This cd didn't strike me as great at first, but it grew on me. Anyways, this cd is awesome. Essential for any \\"real\\" Metallica fan. Not for the ones who are just into their new stuff. They gotta be into all of it."},{"rating":"2","title":"I rather place six stars to this CD, if u aint got it get it","review":"This one is the best Metallica cd, ever. They will never play the god old metal that they played in the early 80's. Why? 1. Cliff Burton is away. 2. Kirk can't play the old fast riffs anymore. 3.Because they have choosed country instead of metal. Just listen to the \\"Load\\" album. okok Garage inc is ok but what, they are playing covers. Metal of others insperience. That's bad. But U can't be best forever!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Metallica Album ever","review":"This is the greatest Metallica album ever.

According to many people, though, this is Metallica's only truly great album. They are so wrong. Metallica has so much other great work that people just simply pass by and go straight to 'master of puppets'. All of you people like this are missing out on so much. The only reason you say this is the best and say that Jason Newsted has none of the talent Cliff Burton had is because they feel that it would be disrespectful to say that Jason is just as good of a bass player.

It's lame, you can never even hear the bass, it's like there isn't one, while the drummer just keeps on hitting those god damn crash symbols again and again and again. Is this music actually worth listening to? The guitar keeps playing the same riffs over and over as well. And these are long songs! like 8 min. that's ridiculous! however if you like boring music this band should be near the top of your list, right up there with Elevator music and Kenny.

I loved it when they cut their hair off and were trying to be all 90's, completely abandoning their prior fanbase...I haven't laughed so hard in my life. Joining forces with MTV? WHAT WEAKLINGS!When they attemted to change their persona they should have changed their band name too. The \\"Prep-Rock Posers\\" would have been good.

I felt tough. The music made me want to pick a fight. I went to the local bar and picked a fight, still feeling mighty after the heavy music. He was a tall man with a muscular build. And I lost.

It seems to be a complete story of the corruption of power that any political person will want to listen to it, be a fan of metal or not. Enjoyers of the new Metallica sound can learn a lot by listening to Puppets. Back in the day, when they still slashed on the guitars, this album was made.

The only one better is ...And Justice for All. The reason why Metallica is the best is the can change the whole format of their songs(i.e. Welcome Home, Master of Puppets) and still be faster than anyone else on other songs. They were like the PanterA of the 80's and could've cared less what anybody thought of them but now they are just a typical \\"rock\\" band and they expect their reputation to pull them through. Well anyway, this CD is great and you should buy it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Progressive Metallica","review":"After playing deafening, all-out thrash on 1984's Ride the Lightning, Metallica went for a more subtle, progressive approach. Although this CD does have its 100 MPH moments, some of the material is moody and a bit slowed down like Orion and The Thing That Should Not Be. The ballad, Sanitaruim (Welcom Home), is one of Metallica's most progressive moments ever. Also one of their best. But on many tracks, the progressiveness was subtle enough to please the thrash fans, while appealing to a different crowd. My word : buy this album, you will buying a piece of metallic history."},{"rating":"2","title":"Metal Classic, of course.","review":"Master Of Puppets was, is, and will be one hell of an album in the metal genre. Great guitar riffs: fast ones and slow ones. Great guitar solos: furious and technical (not so-technical but still pretty good). Furious and precision drumming and really nice harmonies thanks to Mr. Cliff Burton (RIP).The lyrics are just great. And a nice instrumental on top of it all.In \\"Puppets\\", there's no time to get bored. The crushing riffs will leave you wanting for more. And that's \\"And...Justice for all.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Great album...but what happened?","review":"Listening to Master of Puppets it is very sad to see where Metallica and metal music in general went from here. This is the height of 80's metal. This is the only Metallica CD I own, although Ride the Lightning and Kill em all were very good. I burned out on those albums, but this one never gets old. Orion may be the greatest instumental ever. Not only did metallica die when Cliff Burton died, but the evolution of metal turned to de-evolution and now we're left with garbage like St.Anger and the other nu-metal. It makes anyone who grew up in the 80's metal days very sad."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good thing we have such convincing 1-star reviews (end sarcasm)","review":"Whirligig, just a thought... have you noticed that of all the reviews you have posted, none have received more than 2 \\"Yes, this review was helpful\\" votes? Why no one has found your reviews helpful is beyond me. I mean just look at your intricate wording that cleverly and subtley conveys your unbiased attitude toward Metallica. Example: \\"Metallica sucks metallica sucks metallica sucks\\". That, my friends, is pure poetry. Sigh... if only all of us who gave this masterpiece 5 stars were as charismatic and literate as you 1-star reviewers."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is metal","review":"To the guy below me who hates this album I saw all of your reviews and you like punk music. Your reviewing a metal band.Now I'm not saying that punkers can't hear this album but you said alot of crap to alot of rock bands. If you don't like it well don't hate it because non of your punk bands can't make an album as great as this. If anyone hates this album it's just because metallica beat everyone in making some heavy tunes to rock out to. This isn't for p*ssy like the guy below me. This is metallica at their prime. It is one of the best metallica albums. And then they got bob rock. If you want to hear something metal then hear this album. But if your a weak person like that guy then don't bother because metal isn't for the weak."},{"rating":"2","title":"Metallica's best!","review":"This is the best and heaviest of Metallica.

Cliff Burton dying, new bassisst, new new bassisst etc. Similiar to the red hot chili peppers (3 great guitarists). This album is any TRUE metal fans wonder. From the slower songs on the album to the fast paced ones, the whole band shines as a whole. Before deciding that Greg Dilmore's review is helpful (the one star reviewer) read what else this dude gave 1 star. Led Zeppelin IV, Sgt Peppers Lonely Harts Club Band, and Back in Black?! Its clear that this kid doesn't know what hes talking about. Thats my opinion on the matter. This album is great, if you like metal, you will like this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply The Best Metal Album Ever Made","review":"Metallica are metal gods, and if you're wondering why, just pick this cd up. Even if you're not an 80's metal freak, myself included, Metallica is still the best band you will ever have the privelige to listen to. It doesn't get any better than these guys, it just doesn't. The Beatles can't even touch them. Of course everyone knows the track Master Of Puppets, but another you may not know about is Orion, a masterful orgy of guitar genius. Throw the insane speed metal of Damage Inc. and the ahead of its time, detuned Thing That Should Not Be, and you've got the most rounded record of it's time. Don't believe me? I challenge anyone with some music theory knowledge and little guitar know how to prove me wrong. SIMPLY THE BEST BAND TO EXIST ON THIS EARTH. Proove me wrong.

Unless Garbage Days came out before??I forgot when I moved on to bands like Nuclear Death, A.C. Meat S**ts, Nasty Savage, etc.A lot of bands have self-destructed selling out but Metallica is a true sellout success story. I can't blame them. They are wealthy beyond belief now.I am not going to waste my money listening to this pop garbage though."},{"rating":"1","title":"Timelessly terrible","review":"Even though the 80s are a long time ago, Metallica's \\"Master of Puppets\\" will never sound dated. It doesn't matter what era it is. It could be 1986, 1996, or even 2006, \\"Master of Puppets\\" will always sound just as awful as the day it was released. It is, as I call it, timelessly terrible.In 1989, I borrowed a tape of \\"MOP\\" from a friend, because it was the 80s and this type of death metal was in fashion. My first impression after I played it was that it was the worst album I've ever heard. The guitars don't even sound like musical instruments! They sound like a chainsaw cutting down a mahogany tree! Of course I didn't WANT to hate this band or this album, so I decided to give it another chance. Even after repeated listens, I couldn't find one second of good music anywhere on the album. There was northing good about it. It really stunk! This cd is awful! Don't buy it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful...","review":"This could be one of the worst records ever released. The guitars and bass sound more like chainsaws than musical instruments. The drums sound like somebody breaking cement with a jackhammer.And the vocals...James Hetfield's monotonous roar sounds like a horse grunting. Not to mention that he looks like one too. That proves just how bad Metallica is. Their greatest artistic acheivement is having the most horse-like hairstyles of any band in the music business! I am appauled!Don't waste your money on this piece of crap. Just because Hetfield has the most horse-like hairstyle is no reason to listen to their music. I think Metallica is the worst band of the late 80s/early 90s. (...)"},{"rating":"1","title":"This is 100% proof of what's wrong w....","review":"This is 100% proof of what's wrong with music today. This boy can't sing to save his life and yet he gets a record deal and infinite rotation on mtv. How you ask? It's simple, he has connections. This is a testament to the awful and pathetic state the music industry is in today. You want to know who's to blame for making music so horrible these days? MTV and American radio. Those two are the main culprits. If you have a brain you'll stay clear of the two."},{"rating":"1","title":"These Peter Pan lyrics just won't cut it","review":"I've never understood the appeal of Metallica. While early '80s bands with much more integrity and musical chops like Bon Jovi, Def Leppard, Ratt, Iron Maiden, Saxon and Styx were virtually ignored during that time period, Metallica somehow managed to steal all the critics' adoring headlines - and sell gazillions of records in the process.Metallica's girlish lyrics and sluggish sound on \\"Master\\" come off as lazy, dull, and sluggish by today's rock-metal standards. A better record to purchase would be \\"Velvet Revolver\\" by Guns 'n Roses. It's got the guy from STP singing on it and it's really quite good. Grunge has always ruled and that would be the way to go, in my opinion.SKIP THIS ONE!!!!!!!!!!LATER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"This album SUCKS...","review":"I finally bought this album today after metallifans kept bragging about how good it was. Man.. what a disappointment!! These guys just don't know how to play their instruments and all songs are exactly the same. It's like they were totally out of ideas... I wonder how that happened? Maybe it had something to do with Dave Mustaine leaving the band... I don't know.Anyway to conclude this review I would like say to people that are young and new to metal to skip this boring newbie metal. If you want to listen to good thrash metal check out the metal gods of Megadeth and their groundbreaking album Rust In Peace... you won't be fooled like i was :/"},{"rating":"2","title":"Send Me Green...!!!","review":"Maybe Metallica's most popular album is \\"Master of Puppets\\"...the songs are very popular in the gigs...there's a fast \\"Battery\\", the heavy killer tracks \\"The Thing That Should Not Be\\", \\"Welcome Home\\", the fast \\"Damage Inc.\\" (like \\"Dyers Eve\\" or \\"Metal Militia\\", a heavy track). \\"Leper Messiah\\" is a great song too...there's a riff written by Dave Mustaine from Megadeth. The title track is a popular live track but I find it a little bit boring and overrated...still, it's a classic. The songs \\"Disposable Heroes\\" and \\"Orion\\", an instrumental track are the only songs I wouldn't like to hear live...other are killer tracks.Stars: Leper Messiah, The Thing That Should Not Be, Battery"},{"rating":"2","title":"Adam Sandler's Bl0wj0b Queen","review":"I didn't say it wasn't good to like Slayer, Dark Angel, etc. since they are good bands.

It was their peek for the original line up (excluding Dave)... they sold 10,000 records without even any promotion except playing live. Bands just don't do that. You can tell that the whole band was writing the songs. Unlike their following albums...Master of Puppets hits extremely high on many a metal head's top-ten list, and for good reason. It grabs you and makes you want to headbang or sash the room. Its also lets you rest and chill on the beautiful melodic solos whether it be the bass or guitar. The singing is powerful and meaningful... get to sing along with when you want to get out some aggression. Really that is what makes this a great metal record, aggression and melody."},{"rating":"2","title":"metals finest hour","review":"this is arguebly the best metal album of all time.it surely is my favorite album out of all my albums.this cd delivers fast pace heavy metal music.this is an excellent blend of thrash and melodic sounds blended in together.there is not one thing about this album i do not like.this is how i score the tracks off of this album.1.battery 5/52.master of puppets 5/53.the thing that should not be 4.5/54.welcome home 5/55.disposable heroes 4.5/56.lepper messiah 4/57.orion 5/58.damage inc. 4.5/5yes.this is as good as it gets for metal music."},{"rating":"2","title":"Product works as expected","review":"Got this battery which is an exact replacement for the dead one I took out of my watch.

Worth seeking out."},{"rating":"2","title":"Some hard-driving, intense stuff here","review":"What can I say? This is one of those albums that is perfect to blast from the stereo during long-distance, late night drives. The usual S.F. themes in the lyrics abound: \\"Spirit of the Age\\" is about a future society of clones; \\"Damnation Alley\\" about a city-to-city courier in a post-nuclear war world. The title track can best be described as a love song for nerds. \\"Hassan I Sahba\\" tops them all: A hard rock song with Middle Eastern overtones, sung in Arabic. The musical style here is about five years ahead of it's time (this album was originally released in 1978) and groups like A Flock of Seagulls, and _Signals_-era Rush, owe a great deal influence-wise to this album. It rocks harder than either of those, however. If you're not already a Hawkwind believer this album will make you one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hunter gives up","review":"Ian Hunter has only been as good as the musicians around him. Ian is a fantastic and underappreciated songwriter with a Dylan voice. When he really cares and he's joined by good musicians who also care, the result is magic! (See: Ian Hunter, All American Alien Boy, You're Never Alone With A Schizophrenic, and YUIORTA) On this disc, it seems that Hunter (and Ronson) let Mick Jones come in and take over. Jones claimed to be a Hunter fan, but he trashes the music here. The second disc gives a hint of what Short Back n Sides could have been, but there is little insight beyond that. For die hard Hunter fans only."},{"rating":"1","title":"Blech","review":"I gave up on Ian Hunter with this album. What a jumbled, throw-everything-against-the-wall-and-see-what-sticks mess! Allegedly coproduced by the Clash's Mick Jones, but I'm guessing it's really Foreigner's Mick Jones, as the production, arrangements, and everything seem designed to hide Ian Hunter's unique style, not showcase it. Maybe it was naive to think that Jones would help Hunter come up with something as great as the early '70s Mott albums, or even the first solo album. Then again, maybe Ian wanted to do this, or the record company imposed it. Still, one would be better served with just about anything else from the man's catalog."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tomorrow & Tommorrow & Tomorrow","review":"This book is a gem of Mid-Century Avant Garde, Surrealist, Fabulist & more writing.

A product of Fitzgerald's last couple of years when he had fallen to being a second tier hack screenwriter at Universal, they are proof that he was not really capable of more near the end.The stories are of a comic nature with the main character of Pat Hobby serving as their punchline. Hobby is an unappealing self-pitying schlub of a character, and much of the humor is of a nasty and cartoonishly meanspirited variety.

If you are interested in Steel Pulse buy Earth Crisis, True Democracy, Sound System, Handsworth Revolution. This album is dissapointing and it just doesn't compare. In the past it seems that SP just had things to sing about and the music came out naturaly. One review says they send a strong cultural message, the third track is about having a crush on your teacher. It seems like they are forcing it. Also there is just too much synthesising, and electric guitar solo's. Its not a bad album and some my like it. You might want to listen to it a little before you buy it. Download songspy or limewire now that napsters gone. I can only give it two stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stupid and racist","review":"I thought True Democracy was one of the best reggae albums I've ever heard. This one fails horribly.

I would not hesitate to purchase another Onkyo component."},{"rating":"2","title":"really really nice","review":"We bought this receiver to replace our older Sony unit. The Sony had higher power ratings, but the Onkyo has it all over the Sony in every other department. I'm very impressed with the optical sound, video switching, the great variety of sound stages (and the auto detect feature). It integrates very nicely with our hi def DVR, AppleTV, and DVD player, all optical/digital sound and all component video. Just got around to setting up the distance to listener business, which makes it sound even better. My wife recently remarked that this is the best sounding equipment we've had, and I agree. Voices are very distinct now, whereas they were muddled with the Sony gear. A nice bit of equipment, and much better than I imagined it would be in this price range. A terrific value, and a lot of fun to own."},{"rating":"1","title":"Makes strange noises when using digital output.","review":"I had the TX-SR304. Everything sounded great. However, certain times when I played my DVD, the Onyko produced a loud high-pitched ear-piercing sound. Sounds almost like a record scratching. The most common times it made this sound was during the DVD menu, when it replays the music theme. The receiver would transition from Dolby Digital to stereo then back to DD again, then making that loud sound. Everything was great, but this one problem made me return this item, which is a bummer because I would have kept it otherwise."},{"rating":"1","title":"Early failure, late repair","review":"I bought an Onkyo TX-SR304 in April 2007.

Ended up returning it to Amazon (very easy; super customer service!)due to the annoying hum it puts out on my $200 speakers at low/no volume. I think if you are kinda picky, like me, you have to spend more than $160 on a receiver to be happy with it. If you play the music on the loud side, you may not notice the slight hum, but I did. Also the speaker wire terminals were annoyingly small and cheap--I could not use them with premium cables; had to use smaller cheaper speaker wire. On the plus side, all other options on this unit worked great, and it has lots of connections, but NO HDMI connections for this price range receiver. It also has good Dolby decoders, etc. and 5.1 speaker outputs. The remote also works fine. Another plus is that it's easy to set up; took me about an hour compared to 2 days for my Denon receiver."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice on its own.","review":"I've had this unit for about 18 months. Sound quality is top notch.Only problems I have encountered:I have a sub hooked up to it. The unit just doesn't feed the sub correctly; its just kind of washed out by the regular speakers.Its not really meant for use with an amp- all the audio out jacks are fixed volume. You'll need to make your own cables to go from the speaker terminals to the audio in on the amp.Onkyos help lines are also somewhat lacking...."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best for the money","review":"I bought this to replace my 10 year old Onkyo receiver and I couldn't afford to spend much money. I was surprised to see how little this cost and still have great sound and more features then anyone really needs. It's easy to set up with many options. My only complaint is that it is missing 2 features that my old Onkyo receiver had. One, it has no power plug-ins so I had to buy another power strip to plug one of my other components into, and two, I cannot set it to turn on and off with my TV.

Although strictly speaking, this book does not closely follow the plot of the television series, I enjoyed it immensely! The banter between the characters is very entertaining, though the \\"teen-speak\\" can get a little overdone at times. This book is chocked full of \\"Xanderisms\\" and will delight you if you like the Xander-Willow relationship (which is done very well). The plot of the book relates to Halloween, its origins, and an evil demon who rules the night. There are parts to scare you but keep you turning the pages... just to see if Good will triumph... and of course, it does!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A good choice for Buffy fans.","review":"It started off as a really good book but I found that the characters all seemed to act for like Buffy then they would themselves. I mean, how many times have you heard Willow say something like \\"Are you pondering what I'm pondering?\\" or \\"Like that is soo likely to happen\\". Or something to that equivalent. Still though, I have to be one of the largest Buffy fans around and I know that even if this review tells you something about the book that you don't like you'll still go out and buy like every other Buffy fan out there."},{"rating":"1","title":"maybe book burnings aren't so bad afterall","review":"Buffy didn't move to Sunnydale until half way through the school year.Therefore, she was still living in Los Angeles at the time this book supposedly took place.Glaring continuity problems seem to plague all the Buffy books. The fact that the authors aren't given permission to advance the storyline of the show in any meaningful way make the books the equivalent of really boring filler episodes of the show. Only the books aren't as well-written and Sarah Michelle Gellar isn't around to salvage the tripe.Reading the authors attempts at dialogue is funny (laughing at them funny) at first, but then it just gets painful. The book reads like overly earnest fan fiction and all the characters become insufferable because of their sappiness and led balloon one-liners.I don't know Nancy Holder and Christopher Golden personally, but reading this filled me with a strong dislike and sense of pity for both of them."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Fairly Entertaining Adaptation of the Series","review":"Fans of the earlier seasons of Buffy the Vampire Slayer will certainly enjoy this novel based on the series. Published in 1997 it works from the series at that time. Willow still has a crush on Xander; meanwhile, Xander continues to pine for Buffy. Cordelia reigns supreme as the queen of Sunnydale High. The villain of the novel is interesting and the story itself is better than most of the episodes. Giles is not convinced that Halloween is a rest day for vampires like in later years but this is a minor detail. The work does fairly good job of catching the wit of the characters. This is great for those fans nostalgic for the good old days before Xander became a construction worker in love with a vengeance demon, Willow turned into a psychotic lesbian witch with a magic addiction and Buffy gained an annoying little sister."},{"rating":"2","title":"EXCELLENT!","review":"I really loved this book. There was a lot of suspense resulting from the plot about The Pumpkin King and the things that happens after he comes into the world on Halloween.

While \\"The Harvest\\" was, naturally, great fun, I found myself sadly disappointed with the other two - there was something definitely lacking.But \\"Halloween Rain\\" was like stepping right into an episode of \\"Buffy\\". The dialogue - probably the most integral part of any \\"Buffy\\" book - was fantastic, definitely a highlight. The creepy plot didn't disappoint either.

Halloween is supposed to be dead vamp wise. I was willing to let this go because it might have been written before that fact was established, I don't know.The BIGGEST problem for me was the bad dialogue and the fact that for halloween Willow died her hair red from brown. They talked about how good she looked as a red head and how it looked better than her normal hair color. It was at that point I shut the book unable to read any more.

There is far better Buffy writing at Internet fanfic sites.

Most of the stories are old and could only be loosely verified. In one story, a man had his sight before the NDE or incident, but subsequently lost his sight just before the NDE or afterwards. Perhaps the strongest story was one of a blind woman who saw her friend throwing up in a bathroom in another house. However, as with all the stories in the book, the authors attempt to verify the stories many years after the incident happened when some of the witness aren't even alive, so they take the person's word for what happened.All in all, I would say this is a quick attempt to make a buck, and jump on the NDE-Death-Reincarnation bandwagon. The book only has value if you are looking for a book on NDEs of the blind which cannot be verified thoroughly."},{"rating":"1","title":"A great steaming heap of garbage.","review":"A stunning collection of pseudoscience and anecdotal evidence without a single redeeming value, except possibly as material for campfire ghost stories.

By looking at this particular county, we can see how its fierce republicanism has helped to shape the conflict as a whole. This was where many of the British troops in Northern Ireland were killed and it became one of the most dangerous places to serve in in the British Army.

I wholly enjoyed this book and hope this is just the first of many from him."},{"rating":"2","title":"A gripping account of the IRA operations during The Troubles.","review":"Toby Harnden has written a spellbounding history of the Provisional IRA (PIRA) and their ultimate stronghold...South Armagh. Through meticulous research and personal interviews, he has written a balanced story of the PIRA in South Armagh, an area which was often considered qualitatively different in its resistance to Britain and the Northern Ireland government. In just one example of many, Harnden describes in detail the Goldfinger sniper crew who stalked British patrols, striking so much fear in their enemy that some British units stopped doing their jobs and hid in their camps so as not to be the next victim. To date, there has been no better account written of the PIRA operations in South Armagh...period."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well worth it","review":"This book is very informative, I thoroughly enjoyed reading it. The sheer depth of research is evident throughout this book. The only misgiving I had was that at times the chronology was confusing. Great material - whether for research or interest. 10 out of 10 for Toby Harnden"},{"rating":"2","title":"An impressive contribution to the history of troubles","review":"Toby Harnden's book is an excellent account of the troubles in South Armagh and North Louth. It is unbiased and thoroughly researched with contributions from participants on all sides of the divide. It provides a really insight in how each side conducted their operations and their effect on the local people. It shows the recent troubles in an historical context and explains how the area and its independently minded people have always walked their own path. Strongly recommend for anyone with an interest in the recent history of the north of Ireland"},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Dry","review":"The book was very dry. I couldn't make it through it.

I saw it late night in the London West End as part of the National Film Festival. There was no one on the door so I just sat down without paying. Niavely I assumed film festivals must be free. Good old fashioned British incompetence was the more likely culprit.After a promising start it became apparent that George had decided to eschew his auteur style in favour of a strange hybrid of Hitchcock homage and Russ Meyer. That may make it sound more colourful than the laughable and undistinguished results. At one point during the interminable proceedings I recognised a borrowed speech from Doctor Logan in 'Day of the Dead' about civilization that seemed extraneous.Romero is a talented director who is either 'on' or 'off' and when he's off, the results are invariably puzzling.

Silently responding to sensationalized sketches of this controversial group, Allen takes advantage of his unprecedented access to the hierarchy and membership of Opus Dei to present (what seemed to me to be) a balanced and dispassionate account of this fascinating group.Mr. Allen has occasionally been cited for too sympathetic a portrayal, but I'm not buying this; if anything, the book is, now and then, dry and even clinical, especially in the summary of Opus Dei's finances. If Mr. Allen is sympathetic to \\"the work,\\" this is surely because the works and workers he has encountered are constructive and positive.I recommend the book for facts, not for thrills - but fiction is always better at thrills."},{"rating":"1","title":"I don't rate this cd because it doesn't deserve a rate","review":"I awaited a long time for the release of the Thomas Otten second cd.

I bought the first 2 LPs they did together. When the digital age came, I lost track of those LPs. I only recently found this MP3 collection of their 3 LPs at Amazon. It is wonderful. One of the things that I like is that they do the few lines of introduction that used to be a part of song writing. A good example is What'll I Do. Notice that the song starts out with \\"Gone Is the Romance . . .\\" Most renditions of the song skip this, which is real shame. This rendition is clearly the best ever done of a great song. The combination of Nelson and Linda is made in heaven in my opinion.By the way, I highly recommend putting your MP3s onto the Amazon Cloud Player. I have worried for years that I would lose a hard drive and all my music with it. That worry is gone now and I can access my music on any device that can connect to the Internet. Whew!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Misses The Mark","review":"I enjoy the music but Linda's voice does not cut it singing these types of songs.

Too bad, what a waste!"},{"rating":"2","title":"My all-time favourite torch singer album","review":"If I could give this ten stars I would! After 15 years of loving each and every track on this album, it is still one of my all time favourite interpretations of this great music. I started off this love affair by discovering 'What's New' in our local town library in my mid twenties and I was instantly captivated by Linda's luscious voice and impeccable phrasing. I have never grown tired of the music on this compilation of three albums she made with Nelson Riddle and, having explored many interpretations of these songs, Linda's versions are my personal benchmark. I love many other jazz vocalists, but have never tired of listening to this collection of songs. I would buy 'Round Midnight' again in a flash if anything ever happened to my CD set!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Only the best will do","review":"Linda Ronstadt has never made a bad album and this is only more proof. I absolutely love this cd, I also own the three original versions with Nelson Riddle, if fact I think I own all her music. Albums, cassettes, CDs, whatever I have them. I even have the Spanish ones, that I only know every third word, and love them also.I have a hard time comparing her to any other standard singer, but if you want to hear the difference between her and the others just listen to her Christmas CD and that will explain it all. I am a huge Ella Fitzgerald fan and I have heard all the others, but I place Linda right up there in the top 10, if not the top 5, She can sing any type of music and is one of the very best harmony singers ever, just listen to the Trio album.My favs (if I had to choose) are FUNNY VALENTINE, \\"ROUND MIDNIGHT, and of course the other title songs, but I love all the songs. It's not just one thing with Linda, it's the whole package, fans will know what I mean.Pam"},{"rating":"2","title":"Linda deserves 10 stars on this one!","review":"This double CD set containing three albums is so spectacular it will bring tears to your eyes.

I also told them if anyone asks- why is this Linda Ronstadt music playing? You tell them- because this is what he is listening to in heaven for all eternity. Thank you with all my heart Linda."},{"rating":"2","title":"This cd was a brilliant effort on the part of Linda","review":"To please everyone out there with a cd is impossible. Some will like one kind of music and others will not. I'm happy to say that I am one of the people that loves this kind of music. This music is terrific.There were a lot of bright spots for this cd. To begin with we need to look first a Lindas' voice. Linda did a good job with this crossover project. Her voice is not custom made for this kind of venue, but she did a good job learing how to be a torch singer. She really made these songs sound fresh and new again.Nelson Riddle showed that he still is the man with the golden touch. He really came up some top notch arrangements. Nelson assembled a who's who of musicians to play in the orchestra. There were many brilliant solos performed on this cd.In conclusion, I would say that this cd came within a wisker of being great. It definately will be remembered as a classic."},{"rating":"1","title":"Surprisingly Boring-Anna W Colorless-Endless Meetings","review":"I suppose if you want a real life look into the putting together of a fashion magazine this might be the movie for you. If you also happen to love film though, be warned, this documentary is like watching paint dry. There is nothing glamorous about putting together Vogue magazine. The endless meetings involved are mind numbing. If I am going to watch fashion, I would prefer watching the raw creativity of the project runway entrants who are actually trying to create something. If Anna W was really the inspiration for Meryl Streep's character in the DEVIL WEARS PRADA, you would never know it from this film. She is drab and colorless. If you are expecting an interesting personality like Karl Lagerfeld (from his documentary), abandon all hope! I think this might be a real good film for someone to see who wants a job editing a fashion magazine as it operates at a real life pace and spares you nothing of the day to day detail of working there."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"The video seemed less about the fashion than about who is afraid of Anna, who seems like a business woman trying to do her job while those around her moan about her not being warm & fuzzy.

But he knows the true voices of this movie belong to those who make VOGUE the fashion Bible that it is...great job."},{"rating":"1","title":"Junk","review":"This \\"movie\\" is nothing more than a random bunch of video. It is an unedited mish-mash with no value whatsoever. It sounds like it would be good-but it really isn't. It is also boring. I bought it to show my fashion class,but I won't bother, I could barely watch this drivel."},{"rating":"2","title":"Grace Coddington a Gem","review":"I've only recently become aware that these people exist and I was riveted. Grace Coddington now ranks among my heroes, and as a fashion industry outsider looking in it was so fascinating to see her in action behind the scenes of the shoot. Grace's shoot side-by-side with Mario Testino's was a masterful juxtaposition- Testino is the court jester to Anna Wintour's queen (Where is Grace in this image? Supreme Goddess in the clouds away from the nonsense below). I think that the light Anna is cast in is a little harsh- I admire her self-confidence and calm. While seemingly cool and nonchalant about her dismissals, I think it is important to remember that she has seen a lot and has selected people to provide the best possible material to work with. She does know what she's doing, and she is not dismissive of many opinions of the also talented men and women that she hires. She is honest in her praise and critiques."},{"rating":"2","title":"Engrossing bitter sweet tale","review":"Divine visions presented to a run away in a NW forest, or were they something else?

Unfortunately, this book does not come close. There is a recurrent theme of raunchy sexual thoughts that permiate the book and add nothing to the story. A suggestion or a thought from one of the characters perhaps but we are continually bombarded by the lustful ... thoughts of the priest and the raunchy thoughts of another main character. Too much and unnecessary as were the continuous references to Anne's period and allergy problems.I was also disappointed in the ending, felt it could have been so much better. Instead of uplifting it was depressing and unsatisfying. Hopefully Mr. Guterson has another good book in him - this isn't it."},{"rating":"1","title":"ONE STAR???

In his quest for neutrality, Guterson failed to develop a single character into someone to care about.

I winced on every page as the author referred to the Virgin Mary as Mother Mary (as in the rock song)! Did you ever hear of Catholics addressing each other as Brother and Sister, or ejaculating Amens, Alleluias, and Praise The Lords? Sounds more like an evangelical tent meeting than a Marian apparition sighting to me. Nor do I know of any priests (old or young, pre- or post- Vatican II) who talk to people the way these characters do in confessions and sick visits. This has to be the worst-researched novel I've ever read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointing","review":"This is the only novel I've ever thrown into the trash can upon completion.

A Marian sighting in a Pacific Northwest logging town is surely possible, but it would generate a response of about ten people. Lots of good description of places and some of people. However, this isn't Rosswell, New Mexico people here in the Northwest aren't that gullable."},{"rating":"1","title":"No redeeming value","review":"This is possibly the least worthwhile and most depressing work of fiction I have read in my life. No one is redeemed nor is characterized as redeemable. Everything smells, everything is tainted, the characters are all, respectively, lusting, molesting, raping, aborting or masturbating. Our Lady is given short shrift, no one is transformed (except for the worse). However, the worst aspect of this wordy exercise, which bores for pages, is that there is no message in it. No direction or lesson. Nothing salutary. Ick."},{"rating":"1","title":"Still waiting for the point of it all...","review":"Snow Falling on Cedars in one of my favorite books. Even the movie was great. I read East of the Mountains with the expectation of enjoying it just as much. Boring. So I thought I'd give Guterson another try with Our Lady of the Forest. Even more boring. The most redeeming part of this book is that Anne sees the apparition at the very beginning of the book, on page 10. The rest of the book I kept on reading, waiting, hoping for something to happen, but nothing ever did. Ok, I'll admit it was mildly interesting to ponder how faith moves people in profound ways. But other than that, I think I'm done with Guterson. Or maybe I'll just read Snow Falling on Cedars again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Honestly, the worst book I've read.","review":"I struggled to get through this one.

The resolution that was given seemed thrown in at the last minute - I was happy only because it was the end!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Completely Offensive","review":"Was this an anti-Catholic book, or what?! I was completely disgusted by the way Guterson portrayed Catholics. After reading half the book, I actually decided that it wasn't even worth my time. It was almost as if he was too lazy to even do any research on the Catholic religion... there were times where I was saying to myself, \\"What is he TALKING about??\\" A lot of what he wrote was not even correct. Instead, he portrayed them as a bunch of freaks who masturbate and rape, saying prayers that in actuality don't even exist in Catholicism. If you're going to write a book about a religion, Guterson, I suggest you actually do the research first."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointment","review":"I was extremely disappointed in this book and felt it was definitely written by an anti-Catholic. There was nothing uplifting whatsoever. I felt it was just another slam against the church and would not recommend it to anyone.Especially after loving Snow Falling on Cedars, this was a big letdown."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shallow exploration of spirituality","review":"Very disappointing tale of people who are confused about their spirituality. Very demeaning to women at just about every level a writer can choose to demean women - and all types of women are out down, from the young and abused to the Virgin Mary herself."},{"rating":"1","title":"Guterson's fall","review":"An utter disappointment. Guterson falls way short of the bar he set for himself in Snow Falling on Cedars, which was the best book I've ever read. I feel like I've been raped in the same way Mark raped Ann."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stopped at page 129","review":"While David Guterson's previous book, \\"Snow Falling On Cedars\\" was exceptional -- it won an award -- and \\"East of the Mountains\\" was ok, \\"Our Lady Of The Forest\\" just doesn't rank with his others.My struggle to continue reading this book has come to an end because I stopped reading. The first time I stopped reading was on page 111, but later picked up the book, hoping to get to the final page. However, on page 129 I decided again, enough is enough. There just isn't enough interest and believability in the story to continue.One curious characteristic of this book is that Guterson has chosen not to use quotation marks in the dialogues, and I wonder why he left them out. Maybe that is a new trend of which I am unaware.Maybe someday I will finish the book, but not now."},{"rating":"1","title":"is there a point?","review":"This book is very slow and only just barely keeps your curiousity. The book spends to much time on characters that aren't relevent to the story and it's extremely dreary and you don't feel enough sympathy for the main character because you see her so little. This book isn't a fun read and so far just feels like a waste of time. Unless you want to be annoyed and depressed choose a different book."},{"rating":"1","title":"rain","review":"I bought this book after reading East of the Mountains by the same author. (I thought E of the M was outstanding) This book was well-written, but left me feeling empty. I like to read uplifting books and this one felt like the rain-drenched area of the setting of the story."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT a \\"Snow Falling on Cedars\\" by any stretch of imagination","review":"I read with great satisfaction Guterson's \\"Snow Falling on Cedars\\" for which he deserved an award... It was good reading and skillfully done... And of course I was interested since I was born in the Northwest and raised there... When he did refer to sex acts it was done within context.. Next I decided to read the next book, \\"East of the Mountains\\", also skillfully written but a bit more sex than the first book...But, when I borrowed this one from my Public Library, I was distressed at how much of the book was taken up with the sex act, sexual fantasy, several of the main characters engaging in self sex, etc that it was not all that enjoyable... He could have told the story in about half the pages if that had been left out... Nowhere do the reviewers seem to note these pages.However, Guterson is a good writer of description....I would not recommend buying this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's practically plagiarism","review":"A friend of mine lent me this book, and as soon as I saw the title, I knew it would be awful. The title is practically plagiarized from Jean Genet's 1943 masterpiece \\"Our Lady of the Flowers\\" and the plot is riddled with overt correlations as well. I have to say I'm surprised that any publisher would touch a book that was so obviously trying to copy a previous (and famous) work of literature, especially given that \\"Our Lady of the Forest\\" doesn't even come close to touching \\"Our Lady of the Flowers\\". If you're thinking about buying this book at all, don't. Go buy the original, which IS well written, with a wonderful introduction by Sartre."},{"rating":"1","title":"Someone has been eating too many mushrooms","review":"Yuk! I am having trouble finishing this book. I had to take a break to see if I was the only one who felt this way. No, I am not, but there are also some who claim to actually enjoy this mishmash of a story.Having loved Guterson's \\"Snow Falling on Cedars,\\" I couldn't wait to read \\"Our Lady of the Forest.\\" If the author's name were not on the cover, I would not believe it is by the same author. I think Mr. Guterson must have been eating those magic mushrooms he talks about in the book too. His story rambles on. The lack of quotation marks makes it difficult to follow. There is not one redeeming character in the story. Although I am not quite finished, I do intend to even though it makes me feel as though I have been \\"slumming.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Promising story, almost unreadable book.","review":"I haven't read any of Guterson's other novels, but this story seemed interesting. I thought I would like the book. How wrong I was.Guterson has been too lazy to use quotation marks on the dialog. Or perhaps he chose not to, for some unknown reason, perhaps just to be artsy. It serves no purpose other than to make the book almost unreadable. Half of the time you don't know if you're reading narration, dialog or characters' thoughts. This is very annoying but might have been forgivable if the book had had any other qualities, but unfortunately it's mostly pointless and very boring. The main reason I finished reading it was that it worked just as well as sleeping pills against my insomnia.A boring story and a writing style that seems designed to frustrate the reader make \\"Our Lady of the Forest\\" a novel best avoided."},{"rating":"1","title":"A bit boring","review":"Not up to the quality of his first two novels. I found the subject of this book interestinig, but the plot manipulations not equal to the subject. It just didn't seem consistent and my attention waivered. I listened to it on tape and that may have been a factor. The written word may have been the better format for this book. I would not spend money on it."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Disappointment","review":"I was delighted to find this book in my local library after enjoying Snow Falling on Cedars so very much a few years ago. Delight quickly turned to disappointment. Guterson's main characters are all obsessed with sex - Ann masterbates, she's been sexually abused in her past; Tom Cook thinks constantly about raunchy sex and imagines himself doing it with every woman he runs across; the priest masterbates and thinks about sex and the woman that \\"befriends\\" Ann (really uses her) is worried about men being attracted to her. I felt like Guterson was having some sort of mid life crisis, couldn't stop thinking about sex and had to write a book about it. It totally overwhelmed what could have been a very interesting and imaginative story. The ending was a disappointment as well - not what I had hoped or expected. I hope Mr. Guterson's got another good book in him somewhere - this sure isn't it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where's the eloquence.....","review":"Like another reviewer, I found myself wanting to abandon this book at several points. However, I was determined to finish it in hopes that Guterson would throw a twist or SOMETHING to make the drudgery go away. Instead, I finished the book with immense disappointment and a strong sense of having wasted my time.A confluence of poor character development, slow pacing, repetitiveness, an incomplete plot and absolutely NONE of the eloquence of \\"Snow Falling on Cedars\\" render this novel meaningless.Sadly, Guterson may have achieved his artistic peak with \\"Snow Falling on Cedars.\\" Unless word of mouth influences me, I will not bother with future Guterson novels."},{"rating":"1","title":"Author quit before the ending","review":"David Guterson is capable of much better writing than was evidenced in this book. While he wove an interesting and suspenseful tale, he committed the mortal sin of giving up on the ending. When authors do this, I always picture the author as being under intense pressure from the publisher to get the damn book finished. Was that the case here, or did Guterson's pathological cynicism, expressed through the book's characters, simply overcome him? What else but cynicism and a complete disregard for his readers would allow an author to tag on an ending that can only be described as a crappy copout - illogical, empty, and totally banal? If you don't mind investing hours of your time on a book only to feel like the author doesn't respect your time enough to finish the book, go ahead and read it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dreary beyond belief...","review":"I absolutely adored Guterson's 'Snow Falling on Cedars' and was thrilled to see he had a new book out. I've just spent the last two weeks trying to wade through 'Our Lady of the Forest', almost falling asleep a couple of times, and must say what a HUGE disappointment.Guterson's writing was dismal and dull, his characters lifeless and boring, and the story pointless. Couldn't wait to finish it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Our Writer of Disappointments","review":"The character development in this book is absurd. Ann is mentioned all over the place in the context of the dialog of others, but has such little development that in the end, she barely matters. The priests are stereotypes, and terrible ones at that. Many parts of this story could have been cut and were absolutely boring. I am so disappointed in this book and the overall story. I'm angry at how negatively G. characterizes people, society, (not that I want a happy go-lucky book, but G. is just obnoxious, self-serving, and elitist) and the faithful. The quirks of Carolyn are idiotic and not humorous. The only one you end up feeling something for is Tom Cross (albeit mildly in that Hallmark Channel ending way). This book could have been so much more. G. has proven himself as a smart and talented writer. Too bad this book got in the way."},{"rating":"1","title":"Intriguing Story Drenched by Explicit and Graphic Sadness","review":"If you're looking for another \\"Snow Falling on Cedars,\\" this isn't it. Guterson certainly has a gift for storytelling and painting characters with vivid descriptions and voices. But be forewarned - The language is gut-wrenchingly foul and the horribly brutal and graphic descriptions of both consensual sex and rape are so explicit that they overpower the story. ... The story of the homeless Ann Holmes being visited by the Virgin Mary is beautiful in its simplicity, including the crowd of both cynics and followers that surround her. However, Guterson seems so determined to develop dark, flawed characters with few redeeming qualities that you're left wondering why he bothered to embark on this journey. This is a sad story that leaves you not with a feeling of hopefulness, but rather despair at the cynicism that abounds in Guterson's world."},{"rating":"1","title":"Goes to sleep half way through","review":"This is no \\"Snow Falling on Cedars\\". The story arc peters out about half way through and the reader is left with a lot of wonderful descriptions of the rain forest, but little character development or plot. A lot of the negative reviews had to do with religious issues. I don't think the author did much more than throw around a couple of cliches about Mary worship in the Catholic church. His approach was too weak to even warrent taking offense.I found this book in the give-away bin of the local library... I put it back after I read it. It's not worth buying."},{"rating":"1","title":"Long Winded","review":"Very disappointing. I loved reading Guterson's other novel, Snow Falling on Cedars, but this one was boring and long winded. Almost like boasting that he could use hard words and write complex sentences, words and sentences would be thrown in that could have been more concise. The book was returned to the library without even finishing it."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Perfect Example of Bloated Modern Prose","review":"I have not read anything else by Guterson before this novel and was not familiar with his acclaim for Snow Falling on Cedars. I was ready to enjoy this novel. Guterson does great work in the first chapter to create an interesting scenario with a possibility of a vivid look at the difficulty of being religious in a postmodern society. The writing quickly turns to the bloated, repetitive prose of which many contemporary writers have been accused. There are numerous paragraphs in the text in which he rephrases the same concept over and over again within in the same sentence and throughout paragraphs. I fear for American literature if Guterson represent the new tastes of literature. Long-winded is not literary."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hard to get through, but good in the end.","review":"Most of the time, I didn't know what kept me reading. It seemed to go on and on. The ending was good, but I'm not sure the rest of the book was worth it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Blah","review":"I can't say much about this novel except that it had a lot of promise and didn't live up to it. The characters are intriguing at first, and then become wooden. The story sounds interesting, and then becomes boring. I also feel that many of plot lines in the story are cliche. I feel that Guterson had a great idea for a story, but didn't take the time to allow that story to reach its full potential. I know that he researched the book for a really long time, and so on the other hand, maybe he put so much effort into the research that the story lost its human side. Guterson is a great writer, but this is not a good book."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Big Disappointment from Gutterson","review":"I loved Snow Falling on Cedars and was hoping for a similiar literary experience. I plodded through this book hoping it would get better, instead I was disappointed and felt cheated of my time and money. I cannot recommend this novel plain and simple!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Our Forest of the Lady","review":"As a great fan of Guterson's previous novels, I was eager to read \\"Our Lady of the Forest.\\" Page by page, the book has elements that please, particularly the descriptive treatment of the forest community and Guterson's literate dialog. But ultimately the book fails to satisfy.Ostensibly, the theme is the personal struggle to come to terms with religious experience. But Guterson makes it clear through this book that he has no first-hand religious experience to draw upon: no anguish of soul, no conversion, no sense of devotion, no spiritual witness, and ultimately no faith. We're left with a portrayal of Christianity so lifeless and banal that it might have been pieced together from NPR talk-shows.Please, Mr. Guterson, inform your next novel from your own experience, and people it with folks that you really know."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great album in 80's and maybe throughout the HM history!","review":"It really rocks!

The first four tracks, particularly the epic \\"Beyond The Black\\", are fantastic. David Wayne's screeching vocals only make the music even heavier. The musicianship is top notch, particularly drummer Kirk Arrington. The second half of the album isn't as strong, but there's nothing bad either. They end the album with a cover of Deep Purple's \\"Highway Star\\", which is twice as heavy as the original. I heard this album when it was first released on Megaforce in '85 and after \\"Highway Star\\" there was a decent track called \\"Big Guns.\\" It wasn't released when Elektra released it though. If you like bands like Megadeth or Testament, this is definitely worth checking out."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must have for true metal fans","review":"This album is awesome!

This is a great read for the enthusiasm of the Beats for bebop jazz and jazz's connection with the whole Beat movement. As a student assigned to interview the university's resident Beat writer, I paid a visit to Mr. Holmes and drank a six-pack of beer and spent the afternoon and early evening with Mr. Holmes who talked more about Kerouac and Ginsberg than himself. He referred to Kerouac as a genius, and was exceptionally modest and considerate. However, I think his work stands up with the rest of the Beats and is very good. This is my favorite of his books. I find it interesting it's being released as a paperback in 1999.

This album did give respect to rappers who should be at the forefront of hip-hop, like Dead Prez, and up-and-comings like Poyce Da 5-9.

This album starts out strong with an unbelievable live performance by one of the greatest MCs ever, Big(RIP), and continues with Big L (RIP). I enjoy the different flavor this album offers and unlikely pairings of emcees (Mos Def & Ghost, Redman & Saukrates, Kool G & MOP, Talib & Dead Prez), but was hoping for new faces.

But instead i got a kind of commercialised version of the latter. On the whole the songs are good, nice collabo's from Mos Def and (surprisingly) Ghostface Killer serve a bit of a shock but are interesting to listen to.

About half of the first six chapters seem to drag on and most of the time restates the same thing from an earlier chapter or from the same chapter. I like what she has done with discussing multicultural issues, but some of it seems to be patronizing to the reader.

It allows you to record five 5-second long audio clips and the recording is easy. Also it seems you can broadcast music or sound through your controller by leaving it hooked in through the recording wire to a computer or MP3. It takes 3 triple A batteries and it will shut off if unused to preserve the batteries. The headset link used to record is very short and the preset sounds suck. However, I found it fun to play funny sounds over the Xbox 360 and since it was cheap I think it was worth the money."},{"rating":"2","title":"YAY!","review":"This thing is awesome.

This disc leans far more towards R&B and hip-hop, while the reworked version with the yellow and red cover is pretty much pure pop. I prefer the other version because it's just more fun and twice as infectious, but like I said, it depends on your taste.

It was pretty popular back in its day ... around November/December of 2000, I think? I'm not sure. But anyway, I loved that song and asked for the CD for Christmas, which I got in the end. (The version I received was not an import, I don't think, and it was out at Christmas. It had all the same tracks as this, so it really doesn't matter.) I listened to it through a couple times and never picked it up again. I liked three songs on this CD, \\"Gotta Tell You\\", \\"Come On Over\\", and \\"Always Come Back To Your Love\\".

I was unable to use it the way I was familiar with and it was almost impossible for me to whip simple eggs due to the hinge. The head of the whisk can flip back and forth to lay flat agains the handle and does this while in use. There is no way to stabalize the head for whipping. Also the handle is pretty slim, making it hard to grip and the head is pretty small probably making it more work to cover a big pot. Maybe a thicker handle might be more comfortable and a bigger head for less work. It may do well for stirring sauces (sliding head flat along bottom of pot) and preventing lumps as my old one did but I returned it before trying it out."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dissapointing","review":"I was hoping to find a whisk small enough to whisk things I usually did with a fork.

The items was supposed to be mounted on a 1999 Ford Econoline Full-Size Van. The contoured shaped, which is nice to protect the body around the splash guard where it is mounted, does not adjust. The entire splash guard is made out of a stiff material and does not adjust to the shape of the vehicle body around.If mounted, there would be either a rather large gap at the top between the flap and the vehicle body (which would allow debris and water to run into and sit there), or the flaps would be in an angle which would look awful.The Powerflow 6416 Pro-Fit Splash Guards, ordered at the same time, were a perfect fit, you might want to check out the description and review there.[...]"},{"rating":"1","title":"Good on the towns, not much in between","review":"This is basically a list of towns in the order thatyou hit them driving Hw101.

It is BLUES at it's finest from a truely gifted blues man. This is average at best. Boring, cliche riddled songs without much originality. A voice that sounds out of context with much of the material and most surprising the guitar playing is full of flaws and half realized ideas. The tone ( one of the standouts on LIVE ) is grating at times and never reaches any hights.

And if you have a Corrado VR6 the parts will be more expensive. The title for this book should be changed to \\"A Beginner's Guide for Sport Tuning your 4cyl. Volkswagen\\" and the Corrado should be removed from the cover. \\"European Car Magazine\\" and The Corrado Club of America web site are much better resources for specific information.

I bought this book due to an interest in this time period and it does give facts about research in this period but is not really a history per say. The lack of material regarding colonial United States was surprising to me. Most history books deal with the initial founding of an area and then jump to the Revolutionary War. If you are looking more for a developing history rather than facts I would recommend Russell Shorto's, Island at the Center of the World, but that only takes you to the beginning of the 18th Century. Finding material from 1700-1770 is are rare unexplored nitch in time. You will find the Anglicanization of the America's interesting and it's clash with the Dutch culture that originally settled this area."},{"rating":"2","title":"On the other Side of Through","review":"Excellent price.

I thought it was a great investment. If you use frozen fruit or vegetables you can literally make 24 servings of baby food in less then 10 minutes with no preservatives or additives. Plus it is so much cheaper. You can buy a bag of frozen veggies for a $1 on sale. I also thought the book had a lot of good information on what ages certain foods should be introduced. Also keep in mind at this stage babies are only \\"learning\\" to eat; they don't need nutrition from food. They get plenty of protein, etc. from formula/breast milk."},{"rating":"2","title":"So Easy!","review":"This book really did make preparing baby food at home so easy! I made peas and sweet potatoes the first week that took no more than 10 minutes of my time, but the servings will last 3 weeks.

He loves to dance and sing to the introduction. This CD has good selection of adventures to choose from. I'm not quite sure which one is his favorite cause he goes from one adventure to the next pretty quick.This diffinetly fuels his learning and his imagination. It's also filled with the learning of nature and ecosystems and of course the discoveries of letters, words, patterns and songs. I strongly recommend this for your three year old and up."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"Once Baby Einstein/Julie Clark and crew sold out to Disney the quality of the movies went down hill. There is way too much animation and less reality in the movies now, with this one being no exception.

I was young then and did not know the song was a cover, and in the end, I don't care that it was. It should not have been removed from the album. With Peace Train, this was worth 5 stars as it is, it's still a great albumn. 10,000 Maniacs was the only time Natalie was worth listening too. Not too fond of her solo stuff and not too fond of their stuff without her.M"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great album","review":"I was introduced to the 10,000 maniacs, and specifically, this album, by one of my best friends in 1989. At the time, I was a young adolescent just beginning to heal the scars of incest. In the lyrics,(particularly the song \\"Like The Weather,\\") I found a voice for my pain and frustration, as well as a hope that things might improve. Because of Natalie Merchant's distinctive voice, it may be difficult to understand the lyrics until you have listened for quite some time. However, each song has a very important message. This album tackles such topics as child abuse, alcoholism, and illiteracy in a way that is both graceful and unique. While the lyrics are sometimes melancholy, the melodies are upbeat, creating a much needed balance between intensity and playfulness. As a suicidal teenager, this album showed me that I could feel intensely and still have fun, something which I am glad of to this day."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best of 10000","review":"I am a major Natalie fan, and this is by far the best cd by 10000 maniacs.

When I got the disc in the mail back in the day when you could belong to a CD club, there was a typed note saying \\"We're sorry that 'Peace Train' was not included on your CD.\\" Personally, I never noticed. I find this album to be very thoughtful and full of great melodies. Merchant's voice is smooth and silky on each track. The first track is one of the best anti-child abuse songs I've ever heard. I believe it was released around the same time as Susanne Vega's \\"My Name is Luka.\\" Merchant sings about depression, alcholism and wife abuse, questioning the wisdom of going into the military and why some women settle for a man who isn't very good. This is a fine album and worth the price. Probably the Maniacs finest effort."},{"rating":"1","title":"wont work","review":"Opened up and tried this supposedly new cd for the first time in my lab top and on two cd players and it would not play any music.

Natalie Merchant & Co. were very influential to the 90's Lilith Far acts that broke into the mainstream. \\"Verdi Cries\\" is wonderfully beautiful (Worth buying just for that one song). This album has all the ingredient's of a great album but looses a star for it's unevenness. There's about 5 or 6 standout tracks and the others are easy to forget. This album also looses points for it's 80's production values that has not held up well (Too much Reverb on the drums). One aspect of the album that has aged well is the lyrics. Merchant takes on issues that are still important today(Not that thats hard to do; we've been dealing with generally the same issues since the beginning of time). \\"They're so good at making soldiers, but they're not as good at making men\\"; is one of the better lines. Although this album might not hold up as well as U2's \\"War\\" or R.E.M.'s \\"Murmur\\" it's still among the great albums of the 80's."},{"rating":"2","title":"A lost classic","review":"Though not appreciated as such by critics, \\"In My Tribe\\" is one of the most significant albums of the 80's. In addition to being stellar on it's own merits, the Maniacs were pioneering the field of folk/pop rock, which is now standard. Such songs as \\"Like The Weather\\" and \\"Don't Talk\\" were not recieved when released, but would have been succesful singles in the 60's or the 90's. More people should own and enjoy this awesome album. Read the reviews below! Maybe critics didn't get it, but they didn't get the Beatles or Bob Dylan either. Critics at the time of Mozart or Beethoven didn't like them either! So there! [:P"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Haunting but....","review":"This album is very haunting but well worth listening to. Songs in particular tells stories about child abuse(\\"What's the Matter Here?\\") and what is being kind of being done about it and a life of a famous writer who died young(\\"Hey Jack Kerouac\\").All the other songs are just as good, if not, rather worth listening to as well.

It will be a lot safer and less frustrating!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't hold a blade","review":"This knife is cool looking and slim and can be opened comfortably with one hand. For about 3 days of moderate use it was great but then I tried to cut a few layers of corrugated with it and the blade popped out of the knife and remained stuck in the cardboard. After that if just wouldn't hold a blade anymore. I think it was a reasonable task to ask of a utility knife so unless mine was defective the quick change system isn't adequate."},{"rating":"1","title":"dangerous","review":"I've carried a cheap locking blade razor knife for 2 years. I got this one as a present and I loved it!But, after using it for 2 months I've had several close calls (cutting myself) while using it.I've used it for cutting those heavy duty plastic straps that bind our paper orders and I use to use it to cut down the cardboard afterwards...DO NOT USE FOR CUTTING CARDBOARD!The pressure used to push the blade into the cardboard is more than enough to release the spring loaded stud that you use to load and unload your razor blades. So the blade comes right out. Either slightly out of the blade, sticking in to the cardboard box, or falling out completely.So... be careful. The easy load stud was a great idea... just wish they could make it safer.

When I turn the volume up for the live sound, I can't hear the drums, the guitars sound weak, and overall it sounds like it was recorded at a large stadium instead of a smaller club. Yes, it has that true live sound and it sounds like you're actually there, but it sounds like the concert you go to once in a while that sounds like s**t.The song selection is a good mix of his best solo stuff and some Hagar-era VH stuff, like Dreams, Why Can't This Be Love, Right Now, and some others.This cd is for the die-hard collectors only. If you want decent sound, you'll be disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"VERY DISAPPOINTING","review":"This cd is mostly a re-hash of Van Halen songs.

There are live tracks on this album from Sammy's early stuff, from the VanHalen years, from the post-VanHalen years and even from the MONTROSE years! This album is so full of the energy you get when you attend one of Sammy's concerts that you can't help but slap a silly grin on your face when you listen to it.Personally, I thought 'Not 4 Sale' and 'Ten13' were fantastic albums, but this one is on top of the pile now!"},{"rating":"2","title":"great decision","review":"the cost of the album purchase as compared to selecting single songs was definately the driving force behind the purchase, and anyone who loves Sammy the way I do will appreciate the album as well as the ease of download and convenience of the cloud player and availability for all your MP3 players."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sammy Hagar live","review":"Downloaded Sammy Hagar's autobiography from audible.com and have been enjoying it so much I decided I needed to fill in some of the missing pieces of his albums.

However, if you're looking for an informative resource to actually learn how to dance exotically this is NOT the place. I must say, after reading the previous reviews I was eager to recieve my video, but it didn't take long for my excitement to dissipate once it arrived and I hit 'play'. I already like myself. I wanted to learn how to dance sensuously for my partner! This video focused too much on the \\"every day participants\\" in the class and not enough on the instructor.

We don't get to see her very often and this DVD is a rare treat for any Carly Simon fan. Carly Simon is a national treasure."},{"rating":"2","title":"Go Carly","review":"This DVD reminded me that Carly Simon is a great singer.

That's what I found myself doing throughout this wonderful performance. Perhaps Carly's voice is not quite what it used to be, but that was never her attraction. It is now, as it has always been, her uncanny ability to touch our hearts and give us all an intimate insight into the depth and breadth of her perception and emotion.I loved the old standards from the Moonlight Serenade album, mixed with her own pop hits. But I think my favorite part was the acoustic set where she sat down with just one guitar player, plus her own, and the backup singers, including her daughter, Sally Taylor. Carly's duet with Sally on the old fifties song, \\"Devoted To You\\" was enough to bring tears to your eyes.My only regret is that I was not there on the Queen Mary II, to witness this memorable event. Thank goodness someone had the foresight to capture it for the rest of us."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful songs, excellent singing, and ideal location","review":"This is an outstanding DVD. Carly sings beautiful songs, and her voice is just great. For the reviewer who said that Carly's voice is not good, I am only going to say that there is a difference in Carly's voice if you compare it with how she sang 20 years ago. She has a lower register, but her voice is still vibrant and full of color. She gives a unique emotion to each song. Her phrasing is perfect. And frankly, I don't know any contemporary pop singer who can sing these songs this well.I agree with another reviewer who said that the acoustic set is a highlight, and Sally Taylor is fantastic.Overall, this is the best DVD I have bought in years."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nobody Does It Better!","review":"What a performance this is!For the person who wrote a negative review.....yes, Carly has aged. But haven't we all? Carly does an excellent performance on the QM2. The elegance of both The Lady and the ship are awe inspiring.My husband and I are avid cruisers and would have loved to have walked on board and found Carly performing! The accoustic set is most touching, watching Carly and her daughter. Each time I watch \\"love of my life/devoted to you\\" there are tears in my eyes by the end of the song.We have a collection of over 100 concert DVD's and this one is absolutely, without question my favorite!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Classy as moonlight upon the water","review":"I apply that to Carly and to the venue for this concert.Yes, Carly's voice is different than her recordings. And it shows in a wonderful, real way. Just like the lady herself there is no artifice.She has always been an original.I admit it took a couple of songs to adjust to the deeper register of her vocals. < Not nearly so noticable on the acoustic set> But after that, as comfortable as ever.I loved the elegance of the QM2.The orchestra.The black tie atmosphere.The acoustic set extra is simply delicious. Carly's voice sounds more \\"recording-like\\".Informal, acoustic guitars, Carly's wonderful poetic lyrics, Sally Taylor accompaning her Mom. I love that. It is Carly-Cool.Carly's Martha's Vineyard DVD is one of my fav's. I willgladly make room for the QM2 DVD right next to it.

It seems that Craxi gave many many favours to Berlusconi, who seems to have something to hide about these favours and his own past. It's true, it's possible that there was somebody behind the judges in the Operation \\"Clear Hands\\", maybe the ex-Communist Party \\"PDS\\".

Seiko has been making self winding watches for years and they keep perfect time and won't quit working if you take them off for a day or two. this watch may look like a combination of a Rolex Submariner, and a watch made by Breitling, but the movement is junk, and I am surprised that Amazon continues to sell them considering how many of them get returned."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"Whilst the product arrived in a very timely manner and packaging was impeccable and the watch kept excellent accuracy, this was counteacted by the watch stopping most nights neccessitating the time to be reset nearly every morning."},{"rating":"2","title":"Invicta Men's 8928OB Pro Diver Two-Tone Automatic Watch","review":"The watch is attractive and heavy.

I own a 2-tone Rolex GMT, and the bracelet weighs about half of this one (the gold links are hollow on that watch), this is a SOLID stainless steel band, and weighs a lot.The time keeping seems as to be expected for a mechanical watch.

Tells time perfectly, looks great, feels great, and just gets the job done. Only criticism is the supposedly magnified date indicator is still pretty small to read.OK, now that I've owned this beautiful watch for over a year, I find it loses a couple minutes here and there, and I have to re-set the time about once a month.

You have to send it in to be adjusted. $20 shipping fee (ABSOLUTLY ABSERD!) $10 to do the adjustment, and another $20 plus to ship it back? Very disappointing Invicta!! I'm going to try to find a local jeweler to do the adjustmnet for much less. Untill then I'm Sticking to my Croton which I was able to adjust myself for, Ready for this Invicta?

The colors I love even more. I bought the womens style the start of summer and didn't like it as much only because it was to small of a face. In fact I bought one of the womens for my roommate, she too gave it back stating she wouldn't wear it. So I gave them to my longest and best friend and my cousin and they went wild when they saw them together. They tell me they wear them every day."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor workmanshio","review":"After 3 months the bracelet on this watch has fallen apart.

I have bought a few invicta watches and honestly not all that impressed with them. Maybe it is just mee but something looks cheap about this watch. Automatic watches are a pain if it isn't an everyday watch and this is more of a dress watch so if you don't wear it every day you are going to need to reset it every time you wear it. I believe the large sport watches are more invictas thing. For something like this I would have rather gone with a citizen or a bulova watch for a little bit more and got something I was proud to wear."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice looking, good functioning watch","review":"This was a gift, so I can only state what my father told me. He really loved the watch, he thinks it looks great and functions well. According to my mother, he acts like a kid with a new tech toy (he's 71). Also, apparently the \\"automatic\\" part, which can sometimes be an issue, seems to be working well over the two weeks he's had it, and he hasn't had to wind it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great looking watch with auto movement","review":"I like the two tone bracelet and the deep blue dial that has luminous markers and hand with a magnified date window. But what is really nice is that the watch body is on the smaller size of 40 mm, so you don't notice the weight as much as the larger watches. And its good to a depth of 200 meters, so getting it splashed or going for a swim means no problems. Being an auto movement means no batteries and that's one less headache, and it has the see through back so you can see everything, and made in China in is not present. Of all my Invicta's this is my favorite."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice watch!","review":"I've had this watch about a week now and thought I'd share my thoughts so far.The watch really is good looking, I can see how many would think it is a much more expensive piece than it is.

I set the time and date the first day I got it and it hasn't lost or gained any time at all, it's spot on.For the money I can't see how you can go too far wrong buying this watch!As a matter of fact I'm considering buying another Invicta in the future."},{"rating":"1","title":"very disapointed...","review":"I was very disappointed when I took my pro diver watch swimming first time, 3 days after the delivery and to my surprise i discovered the water leaked inside my watch...

I had to pay another $28.00 as they claimed the crystal was cracked. So I paid another $28.00. That's $49.00 for a $79.00 watch, and I still do not have it back.

Now it gains OVER FIVE MINUTES PER HOUR. So I contacted them via email requesting replacement and they wrote back that they only replace if the watch has the same problem three times.

It doesn't slide under my couch or fit neatly in my closet, but I really don't care. It was easy to construct with the help of the dvd and booklet and very easy to use. It took a minute to find the tolerable space for my feet, but I think the boots are the best solution to that problem.It locks easily in a fully vertical position for sit ups and is easy to get out of so a full range of stretching and work out options are available. I too sleep better when I use it and so does my little one.On the down side, if you don't have really strong hands it could be hard to adjust. My daughter can't do it at all and I sometimes have to give it a second try. Even though it's hard, it is very secure and I feel safe on it.

I had never heard him before this purchase. Well, I was shocked to hear this artist. He sings & plays the blues in his own homedown style and boogie woogie way. This has turned out to be a very credible addition to my blues collection. What, no awards? What can they be listening to. In the 80's, he played with Hollywood Fats and Ron Piazza. I wish I was around to hear these guys live. Anyway, this CD features covers and his own songs. Also, the female vocal chores were covered great by Janiva Magness. Who is she? I'm listening to it now, and it stands out as a great Blues CD no matter how often I play it.

Anyway, this is Sony's best cd walkman in awhile. Their previous premium model, the D-FJ787 was a piece of junk because the tuning and playback controls could only be accessed using an external, wired remote control you had to plug your headphones into to listen - resulting in a MESS of wires. Fortunately Sony moved the controls back onto the player and I must say, they are creatively placed on rings around the center of the lid's face. The only thing I don't like about this player is the digital display: it does not give you an accurate seconds playback (off by a second). A minor complaint but it shouldn't deter you from picking one of these up."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great product for the price","review":"I have been a customer of Sony for years now and they have not let me down.

The sound on the unit is very good, tough not quite as good as Panasonic's. It has 2 equalizers, while may CD players out today have 3.The design is below average. The buttons are poorly placed, and button are hard to find and memorize. The CD player is very slim, which is a plus. Also, the CD player is sturdy and has good construction, as most Sony products.There are many features, such as AM radio, FM radio, TV, and Weatherband, but there is no MP3 feature, which is a big minus. The player does come with a remote, but only very basic features are on it, like play, stop, pause, back, and next. There is a hold button on the CD player and remote.The cost is way overpriced. Most players at this price range have MP3, and have better sound.Overall, the DFJ200 is a flawed and overpriced CD player. Not recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sony's China products debase the brand","review":"Well, it's better than a string and two dixie cups but rich detailed sound? Not even close.

Hence two stars instead of one. But the Panasonic plays MP3s!Have not been able to get much radio reception out of this thing.

Its a really nice collection of Patriotic based music that contains some original, as well as traditional selections that are all done in the Steamroller tradition of spicing things up a little. Not all the selections are great, but certainly enough of them to make picking up this up new worth it, and used well worth it.

He's sometimes hard to understand because he has a thick English accent, but on \\"The Warmest Room,\\" Bragg sings something about Chairman Mao. Even more obvious is \\"Power in a Union,\\" wherein Bragg sings about his love for Organized Labor and distrust of corporations.

Bob Dylan filtered through The Clash? Perhaps. BB came onto the scene in the early eighties with an electric guitar and many axes to grind. His songs are usually overtly left-wing, but later in his career he began incorporating more and more romatic themes (in addition to more instrumentation). TWTTAP is the perfect transition album. The usual political rants are present and accounted for (\\"Ideology,\\" \\"There is Powere in a Union\\"), in addition to tender valentines (\\"Greetings to the New Brunette,\\" \\"The Warmest Room\\"). Billy almost never resorts to cliches. His songs make you think and make you feel.

It didn't feel like just another staid french literary criticism book. It felt more like a travel guide-book (though a warped one). Obviously the text is the same as the original and you shouldn't judge a book by it cover, but in this case, layout and design I think make more than a subtle change in how the reader will approach the book.I just did some research.

They say it covered too much ground and it didn't sound like \\"old\\" Cure. I view this album as a natural progression of their work and an experimentation with the new members of the band. Exceptional tunes can be found on this album (You probably know them already so I won't laboriously list them) and all show the increadable range of The Cure's music. In short, this album is worth owning if only for Like Cockatoos, my personal favorite!! ....like all the faces that quiz when you smile..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic Cure","review":"While Disintegration is probably my all-time favorite album by The Cure, this one ranks a close second. It's got a lot of tracks taking the listener from catchy dance-tunes like HOT HOT HOT, to great narratives on social issues like HOW BEAUTIFUL YOU ARE. I was a fan of the Cure when I first heard Disintegration (an album done after this one). So when I got this Album, I realized just how versitile they are and how great a songwriter Rober Smith is. This album has a lot more pop-singles than a lot of their other later CDs, so it's good one to get if you are just getting into the band."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"Kiss\\"-ing to Be Clever.","review":"This is the Cure's first studio album since winning over American audiences with their \\"Staring at the Sea\\" compilation. Originally released as a double album before omitting \\"Hey You\\" to fit the material on a single disc, \\"Kiss Me Kiss Me Kiss Me\\" is a slice of pop at its most thrilling. There's the gloomy and spiteful sting of \\"The Kiss,\\" the bubbly punch of the hit \\"Just Like Heaven,\\" and the innocent love song \\"Why Can't I Be You.\\" Robert Smith glides through a range of emotions throughout this album: infatuated, detached, angry, smitten, and gloomy; but the whole disc works consistently and never tires. The Cure have struggled to retain their audience within recent years, but you can always turn to this disc to see this band at one of the peaks of their enduring career."},{"rating":"2","title":"well..","review":"Whats wrong with Hot hot hot!?

This CD covers the gambit of emotions and styles from absolute hatred to apathy and back again. Kiss Me Kiss Me Kiss me has got to be one of the best recorded songs in Alternative history. But it also emcompasses some of the worst crap imaginable Icing Sugar and Fight, but then that is what track skip is for."},{"rating":"2","title":"Their best work","review":"The stinging guitar riff in \\"The Kiss\\" should alert you that this is not your older sibling's foppy new-wave. Kiss Me, Kiss Me, Kiss Me is 2 LPs worth of Robert Smith's sprawling musical world. From the haunting \\"Catch\\" to the spiteful \\"How Beautiful You Are\\" to the party-ready \\"Hot Hot Hot\\" (not the Buster Poindexter tune) this album easily rates as the group's best. \\"Just Like Heaven\\" is the single best song in their repertoire, and it's a shame it did not become a U.S. hit. There are a few clunkers here--\\"Hey You,\\" for example, sounds like a work in progress.

Bruce Lee wrote the body of this book when he was bed ridden for 6 months from back injury. it is his martial art, Jeet kune do, as a whole-the art, the physical, the mindset, the soul. Bruce Lee recorded his views on attitude, conduct, mindset, balance, coordination, endurance, exercises, stance, and some effective body tools-strikes, etc. it is not a how to guide, but a collective of what makes up Jeet Kune Do as the ultimate martial art. simplistic, direct, fast. if you want to know Bruce Lee the martial artist, get this and Bruce Lee's Fighting method:the ultimate edition. weather you are new to martial arts or a seasoned fighter looking to broaden his/her martial horizons, or you just love everyting Bruce Lee, Tao of Jeet Kune Do is MANDATORY: call it the Bruce lee study bible, if you will. 5 stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bruce Lee Book Review","review":"The book is a great read for those that are little interested in the martial arts or who have great knowledge of the art. It shows the great mind of Bruce Lee and his many ideas,thoughts and philosophies, which at times could confuse the reader. The reader must remember the author was speaking in various aspects of a person views. Lee tries to let the reader understand its not always about the set of rules,regulations and routines but rather which you as an individual can utilize the best for yourself.

This is a classic and a must for the modern martial artist. This book will help you with any martial art or sport you may be training in, and it will give you the inner strength, the mental strength, to help you achieve success in the arts, your sport, and in life.

Lee was one of the first to realize that in order to train for the street you had to go all out everything goes and free your mind from styl-thinking, for instance developing qualities in all the different ranges of fighting ( kicking range, punching range, trapping, grappling...). You have to adapt no style as style and have no limitations whatsoever. I find this to be a very good guide for advanced students. I first bought this book 15 years ago, and did not understand much other than some of the foreword. Having practiced martial arts and selfdefense for the last ten years i now start to understand the tremendus insight and depht of this work. A must read for everyone wawnting to make sure that they train to survive outside of the ring as well as inside."},{"rating":"2","title":"Like it but wish I knew...","review":"This book is a great addition to the martial artist's library.

What the book actually says is to \\"when you fully understand this book discard it\\" meaning don't rely on the book to determine your actions and personal development, rather learn form it book and develop your own style, not copy Bruce's action and style word for word.This book is not determined to be an instructional \\"how to fight\\" type of book, but rather a book of educational, psycological, and physical understanding.I highly recommend this book for beginning martial artists, and the veterans of the arts."},{"rating":"2","title":"More than just technique","review":"I am just beginning to become involved in martial arts, so I was not sure how helpful this book would be to me.

I read this book while studying Eastern philosophy and I just could not believe how well Lee was able to apply the ancient philosophies of Taoism to everyday living.Note that this book was not meant to teach you the art of Jeet Kun Do, per se. Rather, Lee's intention for writing this book was to give his readers a general philosophy as well as a basis to train for any fighting system. He also discloses his mind for the world to inspect.Lee has diligently lived his philosophy in everything he does, from accepting challenges from fighters around the world to dealing with family problems. His philosophy is one of peace and flexibility.

The band gave up their glam look, and went for a tough looking street look complete with harleys and leather. I tend to look past their looks, and instead listen to the music. This album is harder then TOP, and considering that this album was made when the band was at its lowest this album rocks. WILDSIDE, GIRLS GIRLS GIRLS, ALL IN THE NAME OF, ALL I NEED, JAILHOUSE ROCK are the standout tunes I think from this album. ALL I NEED is a great ballad that talks about killing your girl becasue you love her so much. ALL IN THE NAME OF is a killer blues type rocking song that I can listen to over and over again. Of course WILDSIDE, GIRLS GIRLS GIRLS are just classic rock songs that will never go away. Of the bonus tracks, RODEO is a killer song that I enjoy and probably would have been a hit had it been released all those years ago.

Attending a powwow and meeting Chebon Charboneau, a Native American, remedies that problem. The two share a weekend of love that will last for a lifetime--she hopes and he promises. She hopes she's not being used. She doesn't want to be just a powwow pickup. She wants desperately to believe Chebon's promises, but should she?Leanna Potts writes a fulfilling story of a woman's hunger for love and the cost of satisfaction. Lovers of romance stories will savor every moment Ilianna and Chebon spend together.

I played the tunes for my Japanese mother who was so delighted to hear familiar songs of her childhood. I enjoyed reading the English translation of the lyrics and especially loved reading about the backgrounds of the songs. The Japanese romanji lyrics included make it easy for Americans to pronounce the foreign words of the songs. I would have loved having more than just the first verses put into romanji but realize it would have interfered with the page design and adorable artwork. This book is a gem for those of Japanese heritage or those who have lived in or loved Japan. It would also be excellent for elementary school music teachers."},{"rating":"2","title":"interesting if a bit dated","review":"This is the story of the author's journey in search of the truth about the Shroud of Turin. His personal experiences are interspersed with historical data. Wilcox interviews experts in every relevant field and opts for authenticity.

An updated edition, addressing finding since 1977, would be nice, and skeptics won't be convinced but overall not a bad book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another Queenan Triumph...","review":"I love Joe Queenan's books, this the fourth of his that I have read. He is usually hilarious and always on the mark. This book lacks (and that is not a bad thing) has usual trademark razor wit that causes bleeding when touched. However, he goes after fair weather fans and Yankee fans quite well. With the exception the extended chapter on Notre Dame (I still hate Notre Dame and can't enjoy even Queenan's wise commentary), the book is terrific. Parts are moving. Queenan's life, as many of ours have, been shaped by sports. Friendships, family, etc. The book is funny; but it also honest and a bit moving. The end, taking place at Wrigley Field (of course) may move you to tears. Great stuff."},{"rating":"2","title":"A quick, dead-on read","review":"Joe knows the suffering that goes along with loving the sometimes unlovable loser teams that most of us follow. He also has some pointed attacks at the bandwagon jumpers that should satisfy all who, like me, have those friends who check the box scores before declaring their allegiances. A great gift for even those moderately interested in sports and a great addition to any personal library."},{"rating":"2","title":"strange but solid","review":"Queenan is a witty fellow---in a serious way, not in a moronic way like John Stewart or Stephen Colbert. Though Queenan makes some silly remarks about race and politics, the book is very creative and clever. He really hits along the lines of why sports fans are the way they are in a very honest way. Those who dislike this book were likely offended by his frankness or just didn't understand his thesis. A good read. And the one or two historical errors do not ruin the book, though some may think so foolishly."},{"rating":"1","title":"Queenan is an idiot.","review":"I will not read anything this man writes and nor should you - he publicly cries out about and pans Al Gore's documentary \\"An inconvenient truth\\" (NPR Movies 6-15-07 - listen to the podcast) using the medium of radio to spread his own ignorant and bitter opinions. As far as Queenan is concerned we should not be paying for documentaries that enlighten us and inform us (but should pay for his books!)

No longer will I need to suffer the generalisation of Filipino cuisine to \\"lumpia\\" and \\"adobo.\\" This volume brings the wonderful flavors and aromas of real Filipino cooking to the general public. Perhaps we will begin to see a revolution in the fickle American palate and celebrate the one of the world's first true fusion cuisines; where else can one taste the influences of India, China, Mexico, Spain, America, and Malaysia integrated seemlessly with indigenous flavors and ingredients.

There aren't many pictures, but the few pictures in the book are lovely. I made the sapin-sapin (sticky rice cake), and it was a success. I even bought a copy of the book for my mother because my dad lost her Filipino cookbook that was over 30 years old.

We are both filipinas raised in the US and are deeply fond of our ethnic cuisine. As such, we were excited to try recipes in the book. We tried the chicken siopao recipe first. It was a disaster. The dough did not rise despite the fresh yeast. After the addition of the flour the dough was hard and unworkable. The seasonings for the chicken were too conservative. The filling should be slightly sweet. We had to doctor it up quite a bit.The Kutsinta recipe was a complete failure. It turned out thick and cakey rather than transulcent and gelatinous. It was also much too sweet.I would not recommend this book to any native filipino.

I followed the CHICKEN ADOBO on this book and it does not taste or look like adobo at all. I added some coconut milk for variation (page7) but certainly, it does not taste like ADOBO at all!

Needless to say, not a world of moral or ethical judgment.Most entries are criticism of some inept Italian General (too fat, and dyes his hair !), complaints about the Germans , or complaints about Albanians stealing silver cutlery at official dinners. Admittedly there is some emotion after 1942 when they start to realize that everything is going wrong, but the psychological analysis is very shallow (Ciano merely notes the 'depressed' mood of everybody after 1942). Nothing about Ciano's personal life in Rome's upper class, which would probably have been more interesting.For a clever (too clever ?)

Based on reading the closed captioned script it works very well at silencing up to your chosen levels of tolerance in several categories.

This CD is Loud and in your face. It cranks and it drew such attention when we pumped it through 400w amps in the back of a picup truck. This music had women dancing in the streets and comming out of bars in Buffalo. the sound is soo cutting edge it is hard not to draw attention and approval to it. It is good but different enough to make people wonder. This music was good but never overplayed which preserved it forever as a gem. True party music, hard edged but you can still dance to it. The sound is so upbeat and optimistic, something that has been lost in the music of today. There was such power and feeling in the music of the 80's, it made you feel that there was no limit to what you could achieve. 80's had it all, pop, rock, metal, new age, techno, punk the list goes on. This album especially gives you a lot of bang for the buck, every song rips!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Locked and loaded","review":"\\"Back for the Attack\\" sees Dokken making a pretty serious album for them, and with all the talent at their disposal, the ensuing hail of bullets does not disappoint. I really like the dark shadings on here that go along with Don's (and Jeff's) supreme grasp of melody. There's an isolated Sabbath vibe to this thing; \\"Kiss of Death\\" takes a page right out of the Sabs' \\"Back Street Kids\\" playbook. Of course everything is updated with the latest guitar histrionics of the day (which hasn't been surpassed...God I love the '80s!) George sending his Jimi Hendrix over the mountain with enough shred to blast Yngwie and his imitators back down a scorched path to hell; just some incredible sound sculptures here. But the ever cool Don reigns everything in with his smooth metallic croon, total confidence that his choruses will be spot on, the perfect antidote for all the marauding on display behind him."},{"rating":"2","title":"Don's voice is like a God!","review":"I love this album and others have mentioned how great it is.

But what elevates it far beyond that is the quality of the performance. Both Don's vocals and ofcourse mainly Lynch's playing, not to leave out the others. I agree completely with the reviewer that said he doesn't normally like Lynch's shredding, and that here his playing is as perfect as possible, skillful and interesting without being shredding of the mindless variety. The production is quite reasonable too.There's also something to be said that they released an hour long 13 track cd in 1987, which not even Iron Maiden had gotten too. To this day Dokken are a band with potential that manages to surprise, see my reviews of newer albums."},{"rating":"2","title":"Driving Music enuff said!","review":"If you have to make a long drive during the late evening or early morning hours this is the album for you.

In 60 Minutes!","review":"I think many people are just blind Dokken fans or George fans, I cannot believe there are so many 5 stars on this one? The songs sound like they were written as they were recorded. No depth at all, typical late 80's demise of Heavy Rock. All hot air and sounds like it was made for the band to cash in, or check out. Mr. Scary is about the only stand out here, and that is because there are no lyrics... which are aweful on this disc. This sounds lyrically like the type of stuff I wrote and rhymed in high school. Very amateur. And the production is terrible, again, typical late 80's reverb fluff, Mick has never sounded worse.This cd comes with ONE recommendation: BUY the new Jeff Pilson and George Lynch CD (****), now that has some quality songs on it, not mention a direction."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dokken's \\"Progressive\\" Album - Sorta","review":"I view this Dokken album as sort of one neverending 'song' - i.e, they are long, riff-heavy, solo-heavy, and not nearly as commercial as the previous two L.P's. The only songs that come close to having any real melody or commericiality are \\"Burning Like a Flame\\" , \\"Dream Warriors\\", and \\"Heaven Sent\\" - i.e, the three promotional videos made from this album.That said, this is an enjoyable listen from a technical standpoint, but sure to dissapoint those looking for poppier metal in the vein of the prior two Dokken discs."},{"rating":"1","title":"You keep wondering if the next song will be better...","review":"This CD has not a style. It begins fooling the buyer, because of his great cover art, which has nothing to do with the songs' lyrics, which talks, as ever, about love on the beach, etc, etc... \\"Mr. Scary\\" is the best track, an instrumental, showing the versatility of the musicians (Lynch the most brilliant, as ever!) I think it is a little better than \\"Tooth and Nail\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"George sure knows how to waste potential","review":"The only good thing about this Cd is the \\"KISS OF DEATH\\", it gives us a glimpse of what George could of been doing if he didnt waste his time with making cheesey hair ballads. \\"Dream Warriors\\" is a good track but there is not a cd out there worth buying at full price, just for 2 good tracks. I never fully understood why so many people praise DOkken, all of their cd's suffer from being very mediocre. If you want some good LA styled metal with glam elements, that doesn't suck , check out W.A.S.P."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Release","review":"I'm listening to the lp right now. I had the original disc but I think the lp sounds better- crisper highs and lows. Enough about the format. This is the best release from the first 4 records. I don't own the first, but the general consensus for that one is that it's not very strong. Back for the Attack is strong, though. There is a maturity to the songwriting which makes sense- they'd been doing it for awhile by the time this came out. Check this out if you're interested in hearing them for the first time, then proceed with Tooth and Nail second and Under Lock and Key afterward. This is the band that had a certain element to the songwriting that most of their contemporaries- Crue, etc. - just didn't seem to have."},{"rating":"2","title":"In other words, Faith","review":"Although I do not speak or understand Spanish, the music/rhythm on this CD is outstanding.

I couldn't even force myself to finish each song before fast forwarding to the next track.The only one I could listen to was \\"Pegale a la pared,\\" but only because I had heard it so many times on the radio and I knew the tune so well, not because it's a quality song. It's the 21st century. Do we really need to remind men not to hit women, but rather a wall. How about hit nothing, don't be such an emotional wreck that you have to hit something. Really guys, if you need Reyli to tell you that women are brave and deserve good men, then you're in trouble.Anyway, major disappointment. Not worth spending money on this CD.

This book has a very good story line and is even a tear jerker at the end of the story. However, the pictures are in black and white making them somewhat enjoyable. This book deals with soldiers and shows them carrying guns demanding that the flags be taken down and again at the end of the story shows a helicopter and a soldier with a gun. This could make the book questionable in a classroom setting, although a good description of the time and reasoning for the soldiers could overcome some of the questions that may arise."},{"rating":"1","title":"Serious quality concerns","review":"I have serious concerns about the quality of the WT-22. The handle is flimsy and unreliable. After my first trip with the WT-22, the button on the handle became non-functional. I could not rotate the handle back to normal, and so my bag did not fit into the overhead bin.I sent it back for repairs and although the button now works, the handle is still flimsy. Also the handle usually sticks as it retracts, some internal part rubbing against another.

I highly recommend this music to anyone who likes punk, socialism, or protest music. A New England is probably his best known song, and it's here."},{"rating":"1","title":"Socialism Sells (Out)","review":"What I like best about Billy Bragg is his wonderful, quirky sense of irony. While he croons on about his working class \`identity,' social justice, and the wonders of multiculturalism, he is careful to live in a posh mansion in 100% rural White Dorset - as far as one can get socially and geographically from the multicultural chaos, confusion, and high crime of his native Barking.Well done, Billy, keep selling 'Socialism' and 'Multiculturalism' to Guardian readers and keep living the good life in nice, White, safe, upper class Dorset. No doubt Tony Blair will make you a Lord soon. Meanwhile all your fellow working class Whites who couldn't escape from the socialist multicultural chaos of Barking seem to have started voting for the 'far right' British Nationalist Party."},{"rating":"2","title":"Solid record, stands the test of time","review":"I've been listening to this album pretty consistently for the last thirteen years or so. It is a lot to sift through for those who may be just getting into Billy Bragg, but worth the effort. Make sure to play it for your kids, the underlying socialist message will be good for them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic Bragg","review":"A must-have for any Billy Bragg fan. Despite the fact that politically charged music these days tends to risk sounding a bit contrived (or at least dimly uninsightful), Bragg's lyrical brilliance and the crunch of his lone electric guitar create a powerful, almost minimalistic, atmosphere where raw emotion and politics are united into a single elegant modern narrative."},{"rating":"1","title":"I-deas","review":"Not as helpful as I thought it would be.

Yours, Mine & Ours is another great album in his catalog (could even be the best, although I will see how it stands the test of time). From the first listen, you know you must own this album. The opening track, Weakest Shade of Blue, is reminiscent of many songs Joe has penned before, except he is now allowing little rays of happiness creep into his music...and the fun does not end there. As with most of Joe's albums, there is not a bad song anywhere to be found and it leaves struggling amature musicians, like myself, wondering how it comes so effortlessly for Joe. For fans, you already have this..but for newbies to the Pernice world, or anyone else interested in good, pure songrwriting...pick this one up. Ultimately this is a really fun Sunday drive with the windows down album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect summer soundtrack","review":"I've never been a huge fan of the Pernice Brothers - I mean, I bought the last 2 albums, and I liked them, but I never played them very often after the rush of the first few days. Something there kept me at a distance: too lush, perhaps, or not quite enough catchy hooks. But this new album is much, much better. Let's put it this way: if you listen to the first minute of the first song, you'll know whether this album is for you or not. It's an astonishingly good song - energetic, brimming with melodies, wonderfully produced, and with great lyrics. And what's even more remarkable is that that standard is maintained through each of the 10 tracks here. If there's another band on the planet right now who could make a record this good to listen to, I'll be amazed."},{"rating":"1","title":"What hooks?!","review":"Let's just say Joe Pernice was treading water with this album. So much so that the best songs on this album would be the lesser ones on his other abums.The words \\"dreamy\\" and \\"blissful\\" are fleeting when listening to this bland album.Thankfully, Pernice rebounded with this year's vastly superior\\"Discover a Lovelier You\\".Even the much vaunted Morrissey had his lulls."},{"rating":"2","title":"wow","review":"being a long time scud mountain boy fan, joe pernice has always been one of my favorite song writers. however, i must admit being confused by the first two brothers efforts. the burt bacarach meets angry lyricist approach was lost on me. songs ended with me still searching for the melody. happily the third cd is more in step with the classic 'big tobacco' (which pernice wrote while a scud but published it after the band's demise). driven by strumming acoustic guitar lines, 'yours, ours and mine' is the pop derivative of the scuds. glad the horns have been bagged. now if pernice would only go back to adding a touch of steel..."},{"rating":"2","title":"VERY happy to have found this band!!!","review":"If you like Elliott Smith's falsetto, Morrissey's crooning, XTCs ironic lyrics, peppered with Johnny Marr's licks read on. Now imagine all of that combined with the best The Smithereens could offer... you start to envision what The Pernice Brothers bring to the table. No, they do not match the sum of those parts, but they are great in their own right. This is by far the strongest album and you will hear pieces of all the aforementioned artists, but served with Pernice's individuality. This is a strong band, comprised of talented musicians and strong song writing. Give them a try, I doubt you'll be disappointed. Water Ban is a strong stand out, with How to Live Alone a close second. Number Two, Judy and Baby in Two are also very good."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing Album!!!","review":"Simply put, this is best pop album of the year. Buy it as soon as you possibly can. Joe's voice has never been in better form, and the band that is backing him up is tight, and firing on all cylinders. You will not be disappointed!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Not \\"The World Won't End\\" - Did it?","review":"First, I love this band, and I've seen them live and they're even better and more impactful in a club venue - so go see them!!! As much as I love the music and the gifted writing, this most recent release has gone a bit off the introspective deep end, and I am left wanting the edginess, jangle, and energy of the prior release. I am left fearing we've seen an evolution from alt-country to powerpop to soft rock. All in all, this cd is a must have, if for no other reason than the continued strong lyrical content.

It has so many different kinds of lists in it.. everything from magazine and celebrity compiled lists to obscenely obscure trivia, and of course, those morbidly fascinating ones! My husband and I make an occasional game of opening to random pages and seeing if we can guess what's on the lists. I've bragged about this book to friends more often than any other and I'm shopping for another copy now because my poor copy's about to fall apart. Beware buying this one.. it's a longtime addiction. ;)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun and educational too !","review":"Really, even though its got a lot of mindless fluff in it (that's fun to read I'll have you know) it also has lists that are fascinating and important from a historical or geographical standpoint, such as thirty new names for old places (i.e. Ethiopia for Abyssinia.) Besides that, the other lists are interesting even if inconsequential (like \\"seven remarkable messages in a bottle.\\") And I bet you didn't know that Anne Boleyn, wife of Henry VIII, had three breasts! Just another amazing fact that one can find in this praiseworthy book to discuss on long car trips .

Given his flagrantly political, infamous, and UNTRUE statement I may have to be careful of the rest of the information in the book. I'm just saying...What the author did to a perhaps otherwise decent work was make it instant garbage with his foolish personal attack. He could have listed Mao, Che, The Dear Leaders, Stalin, and a host of other historical murdering miscreants. Naming Bush an infamous man and then dragging his mother into the page was a needless, thoughtless, immature, inaccurate, and outrageous personal insult.

T.V.'s Webster has nothing on this kid in terms of \\"I'm-so-annoyingly-in-your-face-that-I'm-cute\\" syndrome.

The whole book Bobby saw Gracie as just a good friend, not his type, and a good piece of \\"you know what\\" whenever he wanted some.

I think though this was my favorite one. Gracie, reminds me of the way alot of women in society feel today. Bobby Tom is the most caring hero. I enjoyed the fact that even though Gracie thought she was quite homely,Bobby saw through this and made her feel pretty.

I hate it when the h's characters are b**chy but the authors consider it tough and feisty. The h was a good match for Bobby Tom(the hero). IMO the H was hilarious. He was such an arrogant a** but that was what I love about his character. He was mean to the h in a funny way at the beginning of the book. I found myself laughing a lot reading about the H/h interactions with each other. I especially love the groveling scene the H did at the end of the book. My only complaint is I wish the H had a different name than Bobby Tom.

Unfortunately this one is a disappointment. What I can not understand is the glowing customer reviews for Heaven, Texas. The relationship between Gracie and Bobby Tom is rather superficial and the nature of the main characters are slightly more than ridiculous. Bobby Tom and his life style is definetly kitsch! Although SEP had tried hard to make the readers believe his talents and intelligence, the result is somehow disappointment. On the other hand, personally, I liked to read the dialogs between Way Sawyer(the rich and the bad guy of the town) and Suzy (Bobby Tom's mother), their sizzling relationship was much more interesting. Hence, I must say that their part might have been a little bit extended.I highly recommend you to read Dream a little dream and Nobody's baby but mine from same author, you will not be disappointed if you prefer light, humorous, real love-romance."},{"rating":"2","title":"Heartwarming and Funny","review":"Although the basic plot line has been done countless times before... handsome, rich, charming, alpha male, falls in love with a virtuous plain woman after discovering her inner beauty... I found this retelling thoroughly delightful. Susan Elizabeth Phillips' writing is delicious. The characters, especially Jane, are quirky, heartwarming and well-developed. The dialogue is snappy and engaging and there was a fairy tale quality to Bobby Tom Denton and Gracie Snow that I really enjoyed.Once I started this book, I had trouble putting it down.

Each slowly learns to appreciate what the other has to offer.I also enjoy the other characters in this book. I love Bobby Tom's mother and the struggles she's going through.

What a huge disappointment! By time I got through half of it, I was pulling my hair out in frustration and had to force myself to read through the rest. The heroine is a doormat who swoons almost every time she sees the hero, the hero is a chauvinist with a head that's much too big for his shoulders, and the way the rest of the secondary characters reacts to the so-called hero kept on sending goosebumps down my arms. All those women who clamored to take the \\"football\\" quiz. Dont' they have any self respect at all?

More like real people..I have enjoyed SEP's other books, but this one & Nobody's Baby But Mine have been SO dull!The only reason I gave it TWO stars is because one of the sex scenes was good..But I think it involved the older lady (the guy's mom), not Gracie..For me, Sugar Beth Carey is still the best female lead - she's got a bit more personality..It was embarassing the way Gracie was mooning over the guy...

They were all \\"easy reads\\" but the plots were sadly alike, the characters the worst type of sterotypes... Generally this author seems to make her heroines virgins or the next closest thing, the men on the other hand have slept with thousands of women, but deep down they are ready to settle down. (Of course once the hero has sex with the heroine, he sees fireworks like he's never seen before, how pathetic!) Love seems to be all about giving up something, and the plots seem built on the worst type of teen fantasies about love and sex. If that is what you want OK. But a warning for those thinking of getting this book, due to links like \\"people who bought this book also bought\\"...

Therefore, I cannot blame the horror that is Melodies of Life on Emiko Shiratori, though it pains me greatly to blame Nobuo Uematsu, whom I hold in the highest regard. But this music is absolutely terrible. Ms. Shiratori's English coach was likely drunk, which is why her english is half the time slang, yet still rings with the perfection that only foreigners can achieve. Furthermore, the melody goes nowhere: no climaxes, no variation, nothing, not so much as a crescendo. Rather it adorns itself with meaningless and poorly placed ornamentation.

After the strong vocals and emotional impact of songs such as \\"Strong Enough\\" and \\"Soldier\\" (2 of my favorites from \\"Wishes...\\"), most of \\"Draw Them Near\\"'s tracks seem like mere filler...heavy on the pop-style repetition of vaguely-meaningful \\"this-sounds-really-deep\\" refrains, light on the actual depth."},{"rating":"2","title":"Folky","review":"I found this cd to learn more towards folk.

The front raises to engage wheels and lowers to engage level posts for a more stable platform. Easy to move around. You can make a custom fit as I did for your work shop. Takes a little bit of time to put together but is very stable and strong when done. I also bought the next level up 2000 mobile base for my craftsman radial arm saw after buying this unit.

If someone has a complaint about this item I feel it would have to be pretty nit picky. I don't know what else you could want.P.S. - I'm becoming a fan of buying items directly from amazon. Their service is great. Next time your at a big box store starring at a shelf full of items wondering which one to pick and how it is going to work out realize that you can do the same thing on amazon and read through hundreds (literally hundreds if not thousands) of reviews to know exactly what your getting, what people thought of it, and how it is bound to perform for you once you make the purchase."},{"rating":"2","title":"First one I got broke, replacement has been good.","review":"I requested this press for my birthday on the strength of the Cooks Illustrated review. It came (from Amazon) the other day, and it looks great.HOWEVER, when it came time to use it for the first time, I put in one clove, started to crush, and the press just broke in my hand! The short pin that forms one side of the top handle hinge broke away from the body. No garlic even made it through the seive!Since everyone seems to love this press, I'm willing to chalk it up to bad luck and give it another try. I'll be calling the company today to see about getting it replaced, and will update my review accordingly.UPDATE (2011): I called the company, explained what had happened, and a few weeks later received a replacement.

After perusing Amazon and reading a lot of reviews I decided on the Kuhn Rikon Epicurean Garlic Press.Holy crushed garlic! This baby presses the garlic and leaves little but the papery skin behind. Added bonuses, it takes little effort to use and, due to it's design, it's very easy to clean."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best one","review":"I use garlic a lot in cooking and out of the ones I have tried, this one is by far the best one.

All of my broken presses share a design similar to the Zyliss presses (among others). These presses boast a simple, traditional press design and the best ones have a good fit and finish.But, in each case, I have ended up breaking out the perforated press area. When reading reviews for both the Rosle and Kuhn Rikon presses, I noticed a fundamentally different design, with a much stronger design for the perforated press area. On inspection, you find the Kuhn Rikon press offers a much stronger steel material for the perforated press area than many other presses offer. This is possible due to the ingenious double-swivel design.I can give the design 4 stars as I have not used the press for more than two months. So far, so good and I would give it five stars once I see this press perform for over one year."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overbuilt","review":"This garlic press is way over-engineered. It is very heavy with lots of moving parts. Lots of moving parts means lots more cleaning as garlic squirts everywhere into all those hinges and gaps. In a nutshell, this press is expensive and totally unnecessary.I much prefer my old aluminum Zyliss Susi press. Yes, the finish is flaking off. It's easier to clean by virtue of being a far simpler design.I don't know what possessed me to buy this thing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wish I had gotten the Rosle","review":"My first garlic press choice was the Rosle but decided on this one, perhaps because there were some reviewers of the Rosle saying theirs didn't last as long as they had hoped. However, I wish I had stuck with my first choice because, while the Kuhn Rikon functions great, the way the edges of the levers come together have me fearing that I'll get my fingers caught in them one day. The Rosle (which I've also used in the past) have nice separate, round handles that feel easier when pressing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Garlic Press","review":"I have had several garlic presses over the years and this is by far the best!

But the design is flawed in that one arm overlaps the other. When you're squeezing hard to close it, if your hand is cradled too closely around the arms, your skin will get caught when the top arm closes over the lower arm, resulting in a serious pinch."},{"rating":"2","title":"Does a great job but hard to clean","review":"This garlic press does its job very well: it presses your garlic like there is no tomorrow.

The extruded garlic must be scraped from the outside, which is true for most presses of this type. Cleaning? Not difficult, although some care must be taken, since the components tend to flop around a bit when the handles are opened. The handles are well shaped to allow pressure to be applied and the leverage provided makes pressing quite easy. One wonders, however, if the relatively high price is merited."},{"rating":"2","title":"Really great.","review":"The Kuhn Rikon garlic press is the best garlic press I've ever used.

First the pros: the compartment where you put the garlic in pops out for easy cleaning. It's entirely made of metal too. My previous press made by Oxo had plastic parts and when it eventually started to chip off, I had to throw it out.The cons: the compartment is a bit narrow. I wish it was slightly bigger so I can fit one large clove. The handles also not made for small hands. Again, to compare to Oxo, I like Oxo's heavy handles that sort of do the work for you when crushing the garlic. With this, it's light so you really have to use more strength.The garlic itself that is extruded is fine. Not very fine, but good enough. To get very fine pulp, use a Microplane grater instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"Kuhn Rikon Garlic Press","review":"This is a great press. Small hands can handle it well, it minces multiple cloves with ease, and is easily cleaned."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hard to clean","review":"I've had this press for about 6 months and compared to the other presses I've owned it doesn't measure up. And that's because its very hard to clean. Other presses allow you to reverse the pressing action and clean out the left over garlic. This press has to be cleaned by pulling out all that's left and that can be very messy. It's well built but I'm going to look for something else."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good product but way too expensive","review":"Indeed, this is a really good and sturdy press, but paying $30-40 for that seems excessive -- you might as well buy cheaper ones and replace them when they break. Well, if you're ok with the money and you need something that will not break down -- go for it. I certainly do not regret this purchase."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mother of All Presses","review":"This press looks and acts the part. Solid construction ensures longevity and reliability. The press is tough enough to take on other harder roots like ginger as well. Pressing garlic is a cinch with this but although pressing ginger requires a bit more effort, this press handles it quite well too.The pressing surface is fully openable to enable quick and easy cleaning. The all steel construction makes for faster cleaning compared to some of its competitors which have plastic parts.The large and curved grip makes it comfortable on the hands, and allows more surface area of your palm to be in contact to spread out the pressure.I would give it 5 stars if not for the price, which I think is a bit on the high side, but I guess you do get what you pay for. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"High Quality kitchen gear!","review":"I'm a musician (guitar/producer), so I'm a certified gear freak. I research gear extensively to find the best in show, and then work my way down from the top to the price point I can handle, if I can't buy in at the top. In this case, I had an Amazon coupon, which made this purchase a no brainer @ $11 out of my pocket.This is a near perfect Garlic press. All stainless steel and very well engineered - very well thought out by a smart designer. It does an excellent job effortlessly, and it's quick and easy to clean. What more do you need?Since both handles are made from one piece of stainless steel, they won't break like other units that have plastic handles joined to a steel crusher assembly - Oxo junk anyone?At the full price, it's a bit hard to justify, but it's the kind of kitchen tool you can pass down to your kids."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great while it lasted, but broke.","review":"Thought I had found the ultimate garlic press. One that could take it in the kitchen. But after about 50 pressings, the top part broke free of the bottom. I tried to press it back on but it wouldn't go. I threw it away...very unhappy at Kuhn Rikon who made my wonderful pressure cookers. Then I ran into big green Prepara press. WOW. It takes up to six large cloves at a time...actually more.

First, I picked up a cheap version at Target. It failed miserably and made pressing garlic and cleaning the press a dreaded chore. Even after research at Cooks Illustrated, I was hesitant to purchase this product due to the price, but my husband pointed out that it is a tool that I use regularly and I should get one that is a pleasure to use. I love it! It presses the garlic with less force than my previous press and it is a dream to clean due to the swing out perferated basket. A quick rinse and a towel dry are all that is needed. I would highly recommend this to anyone looking for a garlic press.Kuhn Rikon Epicurean Garlic Press"},{"rating":"2","title":"A great purchase!","review":"The price of this garlic press caused me to hesitate before purchasing, but the reviews were so good I went ahead and bought it. This is hands-down the best garlic press I have ever used; it is absolutely worth the price. The chamber is only large enough to handle one clove at a time, however the claims are true, you can put it in unpeeled (just cut off the hard, dry base), and only the papery skin will remain in the chamber after it is pressed! The garlic comes out in the finest, even mince I have ever seen. Our garlic consumption has more than doubled since purchasing this press, since we enjoy using it so much! Cleaning is a breeze too. Highly recommend!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent tool for the kitchen","review":"Based on the recommendation of Cook's Illustrated I ordered this garlic press. It is the best I've ever used. I am a petite person with small hands and my squeeze strength, while vigorous for my size, is challenged by items that require lots of squeeze. This tool is effortless. What a dream to press my garlic now. I love to cook and especially enjoy creating my own stocks and a wide variety of soups - so I use lots and lots of garlic. I didn't yet mention the ease of cleaning. Very easy. Let me say that again, very easy. Don't suffer any more with poorly designed garlic presses.

I come from a culinary tradition that just doesn't use garlic presses. My aunt, a true gourmet cook, wouldn't ALLOW such a crass tool in her kitchen.That said, I came across a review in Cook's Magazine that had a review of several garlic presses. The Kuhn Rikon was at the top of the list! I figured if I was going to destroy a perfectly good clove of garlic (according to auntie) I should do it in style. At $40 it is a pretty tool, feels good in the hand, is easy to clean and if you peel the cloves,you can run quite a few pieces through the press without cleaning in between squeezes.

Gave it 4 stars instead of 5, because after crushing the garlic clove, you have to remove the leftover garlic skin before crushing the next clove for optimal results. The only solution to avoid this would probably be to peel the garlic prior to pressing, but it doesnt hurt to wish for something better. The crushing mechanism appears to work from brute force of pushing the handles together but it's not difficult at all. Very ergononomic, easy to use and clean. Take out the garlic skin and rinse.

No more corrosion like the more flimsy alluminum alloy presses. Ths one also is very comfortable to use (at least for me) and cleanup is a snap. I have had a hand powered can opener and a vegetable peeler from Kuhn Rikon for years, and both are still as good as brand new.

It has a very strong and thick frame. I had some inferior ones that had broken in the past. It is nicely made and attractive. I dont spend much time writing reviews but this one deserved it. I wouldnt hesitate to purchase this press. I bought the garlic press in the winter and have been using it regularly. Its a dream to use. Fits multiple small cloves or 1 large clove easily.

Although some reviewers had problems with pinching that has yet to happen nor is it likely to occur."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Garlic Press","review":"I have been using this garlic press for the past month and so far I am very happy with it. Solidly built, easy clean-up, little watse and requires very little pressure. I bought this press to replace my old Zyliss press and this is definitely an improvement. The stainless steel construction should prevent the peeling and oxidization of the Zyliss. I have not yet tried it with ginger root, but am sure I will soon as it is advertized to work well pressing ginger.

It fits perfectly, it functions perfectly EVERY TIME (and I do mean every single time), and it seems indestructible.It's easy to clean, you can press unpeeled garlic, which actually makes it much easier to clean the press because the skin tends to come off in one clump.

Cooks Illustrated's top rating was very accurate, and this press is everything I always wished my other garlic presses were. It finely presses the garlic with no squishing out the sides, presses nearly all the garlic put in it with very little residue, is extremely easy to clean as there is no deep well to collect garlic residue, and is hefty but very comfortable to hold. My last press was an Oxo, and though it was also hefty and easy to hold, it pressed poorly in comparison and was difficult to clean. The Kuhn-Rikon is also so sturdy enough to be a lifetime purchase."},{"rating":"1","title":"Be careful! This garlic press pinches your hand","review":"I bought this press a few years ago based on Cook's illustrated highest rating. I can't believe they didn't notice how easy it is to pinch your hand between the two arms of the press. I'm stunned Kuhn Rikon didn't design it better. Based on the many positive reviews here, I'm obviously one of the few dissenters. My first pinch was mildly painful. Later I pinched it so badly I had a blood blister for a week. I've learned that if I hold it very carefully at the tip of the press I won't pinch but over the years I'm so nervous now I hardly use it. I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS PRESS!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Good - But with Important Caveat. Use Gloves to avoid bloody skin pinches.","review":"This is a well made and very durable hand press for garlic and ginger. BUT BEWARE! The handle can and will severely pinch your skin. I found I needed to wear light leather gloves to avoid getting my skin pinched between the body and handle of the tool. My wife had the same problem and got pinched badly also. CONCLUSION! Its a good tool as long as you are aware of and take serious precautions against what could be a painful, bloody skin pinch. If it is re-engineered to prevent skin pinching it would be a great tool."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Fondue Set","review":"I agree with the previous reviewer that stand is incorrectly displayed in the photo. Other than that, this is a great product! The enameled cast-iron pot is nice and heavy, and the charcoal-gray cast-iron stand is well-made. I have tried cheese and chocolate fondues with the set, both worked really well. the cast-iron fondue pot heats gently and evenly. The thick cast-iron wall helps keeping the sauce warm for a long time! Great set for entertaining and holidays."},{"rating":"2","title":"Done the job","review":"I have had my Filigree set for 12 years now. It is rather sturdy considering I now have three children that are 7 (twins) and 8. It is not chip resistant nor unbreakable like Corelle so if that is what you are looking for, buy Corelle. Also if you have had Corelle in the past, these plates and bowls take up more room. I have a few pieces with chips, but they were rather hard hits to get them to chip. It does show some silver/gray marks from silverware. I am careful what I place next to them in the dishwasher as marks from pans will happen if they touch/rub during the dishwasher cycle. Overall I was looking for a dinnerware set that had more \\"character\\" than Corelle and would go with any table linens and this is the set."},{"rating":"2","title":"Elegant Pattern!","review":"The Filigree pattern is truly beautiful! The pictures really don't do it justice. The color is off-white...very subtle and not bright as it looks in the pictures. Also, the bowls and cups do not have plain, smooth sides - they are gently \\"scalloped\\" all the way around. It's hard to describe, but there are slight verticle indentations all around the sides which give them a very elegant look. They look more expensive than they are!I love the color because it makes any food look appetizing. It also matches any color/pattern of table linens - even white. I ordered two 20-piece sets and hope to add more pieces soon. I did have one small manufacturers defect, but I called the company, and they replaced it with no questions asked. That sold me on Pfaltzgraff!"},{"rating":"1","title":"ugly gray marks","review":"I would never buy this dinnerware again. My dishes are covered with gray marks from flatware. The marks can be removed with Pfaltzgraff's special cleaner or other products, but they would need to be cleaned after every use. When I emailed Pfaltzgraff's customer service asking what type of dinnerware (stoneware, earthenware, etc.) they sold that was not prone to these marks, they never replied. I won't buy Pfaltzgraff again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Two Words, it chips......","review":"My 3 year warranty has just expired, and now I'm finding all sorts of chips on my dishes. Although a nice product to start with, it doesn't hold up under normal day to day wear. Both of my serving bowls are chipped and so is my platter (I rarely use these items AND they are BIG chips) and there are silverware gray marks on the plates. Guess there is some cleaner for this, but I'm not going to bother. I'm going to replace this set with another by Corelle when I find someone that carries it. I'm bothered by the fact that Pfaltzgraff is now dominating the market, it is everywhere! I don't think their stoneware is ment to be chip resistant."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is ridiculous","review":"I can only reiterate the issues raised by other reviewers.

I was terribly excited when I found this book; a first edition, bound in snakeskin of all things. A topic close to my heart, in an amazing binding! I figured it would be some plummy Etonian wit. I was disappointed in the contents. It started out as a curmudgeonly Thereaux-like rant about the married state. It degenerated into some sentimental hogwash. It was interesting in its (possibly fictional) account of rural Britain and Italy of the day. I figured this was something written and privately printed by a rich boy to impress a chick. Oh well: it looks neat. I am surprised to find it in reprint; this is something which certainly should have faded into bibliophile obscurity."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rare Valjoux movement and incredibly accurate!","review":"What an incredible watch! I recently picked up this watch in gold tone with brown dial. When it arrived, I was so pleased of the quality and craftmanship of this watch. The watch held in my hands felt very sturdy and solid and I can't believe the detail. Even though this watch doesn't have the COSC certificate, ever since I had it, the seconds hand exactly matched my atomic clock's second hand. Owning one of the rare Valjoux movements was a great addition to my collection. So now that you heard the good points. The only bad points are that I wished it had more luminescent markers and hands. And the dates are hard to read with the \\"wavey\\" dial. I find that if I try to reflect light off from anything that is shiny on the dial, then I can read the numbers. Other than that, this watch is indeed a great buy for it's high quality and accuracy.

Ed Walters continues where he left off in Gulf Breeze Sightings, trying to convince the reader the he was actually the witness to multiple UFO sightings, most occuring right at his house! How convenient. Maccabee tries to convince the reader that Walters is just too inept to be able to pull off a hoax while underplaying the fact that Walters was a successful building contractor in Florida. The camera he used to take the UFO pictures, a Polaroid, was the same camera he used everyday in his work. In addition, as a contractor he was familiar with measurement, size and distance; a talent that would facilitate creating a perfect UFO picture. There may have been UFOs in the Gulf Breeze area at the time..but the question begs to be answered...how did Ed Walters get 40, nearly perfect photos, of the UFO and no one else could manage to get one?UFOs Are real...but this isnt the proof."},{"rating":"2","title":"A real winner from one of R&B's best male vocalists ever.","review":"Although he could no longer sing with the vocal ferocity and prowess that had been a hallmark of his PIR (pre-1982) albums, \\"Joy\\" is as good as any of his 1977-82 releases.

Aside from the interesting keyboards solos on Starship Trooper and the Spanish Wizard and the pretty keyboard bridges and lyrics on The Neverending Road, anyone else could have written this album and that is precisely the problem. This is just too easy Rick! Your backup band does not shine: elementary drum sequences, trite electric guitar passages. One gets the impression the album was done in a hurry, for the sake of exposure. The Neverending Road is still notable though for its simplicity and the beauty of its keyboard bridges. Overall, this album is plagued by an unfortunate over reliance on synthesizers which reminds the listener that the use of synthesizers can be very challenging as far as achieving original results.

The ability to accomplish more through team work than individuals. It is a backlash against the idealistic 60's and is unfit for the 21st century where team work is a highly prized trait in the business world. It has good points on how individuals must be self reliant, but the author is too extreme in his views."},{"rating":"2","title":"As good as they get","review":"Been looking for this book for ages, The in sights this author can give you will benefit you the rest of your life. I purchased it for my daughter, Recommend it for mature adults."},{"rating":"2","title":"best motivational book ever","review":"This book is amazing. Very well written planned out and explanatory. It does not say that any one opinion is right or wrong it just gives the very intellectual wisdom that he has and you can run with it or spit on it. Very motivational and eye opening. I would recommend this book to anyone but mostly to adolescents anywhere from 15-30 especially 20's. It helps understanding of choice making and things that are most important and the importance of not feeling guilt for things that aren't your fault. This book covers intelligence in all areas of life including politics, general life, expenses, families, relationships, employment and professionalism. That's all the info i've derived from it so far and i'm hardly a 1/4 of the way through it so far. definitely worth reading more than once and throughout your life for healthy reminders!!!

When I finished I wanted more!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Realistic Childhood?","review":"Between the Lady's ability to perform random acts of magic, the man at the bottom of Saxon's Lake, and Cory's constant run-ins with trouble, anyone reading this book will be thoroughly entertained. Although this book is mainly surface plot, McCammon will shock the reader every now and then with surprising depth. Boy's Life reminded me of the type of childhood filled with excitement that people dream about, but do not really have. As Cory also faces problems with his parents, his dog, and stage fright, McCammon's Boy's Life becomes more realistic. Perhaps I loved this book because of the fact that it took me back to the days of slumber parties and riding bikes (ordinary ones, not like Cory's Rocket), or maybe I just needed a good reminder of what it is like to really have fun."},{"rating":"2","title":"Before us demons fled...","review":"This must be the definite work about the magic of childhood. Never have I read a book that captured childhood as I remember it (or as it should have been?) so well.A truly beautiful tale about childhood in a small town. As Vernon Thaxter says in the book: \\"And maybe there wasn't a real plot to it... but the book was about *life*... [it] was sweet and deep and left you wishing for more.\\" This is a good description of Boy's Life.It captured me on the first page, with this little poem about \\"checking coke bottle bottoms, to see how far was far\\", and then again in the prologue, when he talks about how we all get the magic educated right out of our souls when we grow up. From there on, it never let me up for air until I was finished. As in Vernon Thaxter's book, the murder story seemed kind of pasted on, to give the book a plot, when in fact it felt more like a stroll through the memories of our own childhoods."},{"rating":"2","title":"Read this in Seventh grade .......Sitll the BEST","review":"For all of you readers out there, Boy's Life is a superb novel that catches your attention and leaves you wanting to read it over and over again!!! It completely engulfs your mind with stories of hilarity and stories of great suspense. It pockets your imagination and takes it to a place where you remember what being a kid was REALLY all about. Each character is portrayed in such a unique way...Cory Mackonson is the main character that has trial and error in his life but manages to learn to deal with it all. You follow him through his journey of a childhood and learn that Robert McCammon is truely an excellent author.Though I would love to give you complete detail on everything and give you the MILLIONS of reasons why I loved it, I just am too lazy....besides....READ FOR YOURSELF AND FIND OUT! ..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for everyone I guess...","review":"I loved Swan Song (one of my favorites) and all of the Matthew Corbett books. I just received Providence Rider and will be starting that soon. I can understand why many people enjoyed this book. His writing style is exceptionally good. He develops great characters, good plot lines with lots of suspense and action. My wife suggested this one I realized going in that this was going to be a different type of story. I grew up in the sixties and it brought back a lot of memories from that simpler time which was enjoyable, however, to me, it plodded along and the story line seemed cut and pasted together. It developed very slowly. Nothing grabbed me and I was beginning to lose interest. I made it to the part where Cory is riding his bike with his friends and all of a sudden he takes off, ala \\"E.T.\\", and starts to fly around. Ya, right. At that point, I put it back on the shelf and said, no thanks. This is not for me. I couldn't finish it. It bored me to no end."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not McCammon's Best","review":"I have read most of McCammon's books. This is the first one I have not given 5 stars. The book is set in the 1960's and is essentially a coming of age story. If I had grown up in the sixties I might have enjoyed this book more. Baby Boomers would find much to like here.Even aside from the generational issues, I found the book to be arranged poorly, with sections that skipped randomly, leaving me confused at times. I also felt that the prose was overdone...as though McCammon was trying too hard.Finally, I felt the book was difficult to categorize. It is clearly a coming of age story, but it also has elements of the supernatural in it (such as a living triceratops that escapes from a carnival), as well as an ongoing murder mystery with a predictable conclusion.McCammon remains among my favorite authors. But this one was a disappointment."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely delightful!!!!!","review":"As a lover of books about childhood, I was extremely impressed with this book. McCammon hes managed to put his finger on the pulse of childhood in a way that makes it come alive on the page. I recommend this book to anyone who has ever been a child and still remembers the rush of joy that they got when the final bell rang, signaling the start of a summer vacation."},{"rating":"2","title":"Now for something completely different","review":"McCammon is known as a really good horror writer, but here he steps away from the horror for a novel about boyhood. Somehow he is able to step out of his own shoes for a bit and step into the shoes of an All-American kid. He captures boyhood perfectly in all its awkwardness, wonder, joy, and even terror. Some might say the book is written a bit piecemeal, but McCammon deftly holds the book together by keeping the initial thread intact while wandering here and there. This is not a middle grade reader--it's much lengthier than that, which makes me believe that McCammon wrote it for an older audience. I remember thinking that if I read the book to my grandson, I would leave out an occasional sentence or section just to keep things moving. But you will marvel at how well McCammon captures emotions we all felt as kids but didn't think anyone would be able to capture in words. And he does it very well."},{"rating":"2","title":"childhood magic","review":"This is my favorite of Robert McCammon books, and I've read it many times. This book recaptures the magic that we all believed in when we were children. When we believed that bicycles were magical beasts, we could fly, and that there really is a monster in the sleepy river flowing by. But none of the happiness of a childhood summer hide the fact that there is something very wrong with the town, and a hidden secret that ends with murder."},{"rating":"2","title":"When can we expect \\"A Man's Life?\\"","review":"First: this should be required reading for every young person in America. McCammon paints a perfect picture of life in the deep south during the 60's. The principles young Corey learns are as true today as they were then. Second: This book represents real life. Sure Corey's lessons came from more dramatic circumstances, but who among us didn't learn the same life lessons in our own fashion. This is one of the finest stories of innocence lost through experience examples I can ever remember reading. Thank you Mr. McCammon! This book IS what a great book should be: a compelling story that encourages us, the reader, an opportunity to drift away to a magic place."},{"rating":"2","title":"My all-time favorite","review":"Whenever I have occasion to recommend for another serious reader a good book, Boy's Life is the first title to spring from my lips, almost without my knowing I've said it. Even though there's a thirty-year gulf between protagonist Cory's childhood and my own, I recognize every word of it. I remember so well the apple-flavored days of summer, the adventures both real and imagined, the off-beat characters of small towns, and the one weird girl in class nobody liked. McCammon drops the word \\"magic\\" quite often throughout the novel, and if I had to use one word to describe the cause of my deep-rooted love for it, I would indeed call it, simply, magical."},{"rating":"2","title":"# 1","review":"I have been an advid reader of all types of books since I was very young. This book is one of my favorite books of all time. The author was actually able to put me in the story. It is so well written I could not put it down and have read it three times since. I recommend this book to all types of readers."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is one of the top ten sf/fantasy books of all time.","review":"You can't really classify the book as mainstream fiction, fantasy, or science fiction. Boy's Life is a masterpiece, and should be required reading from junior high age to retired folks. Just an absolutely wonderful story. Read this book and discover the wonder again."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Genuine Work of Art","review":"It's been 17 years since I first read this book and it's still my most favorite book of all time. Before \\"Boy's Life\\" it was Stephen King's \\"Different Seasons\\" that held the spot and I thought that it would never be knocked from number one. I still think about how I felt after I first read this book. It was a combination of awe, hope, and anticipation. McCammon wrote in such a way that I just prayed that he'd come out with another book really soon. Which he didn't, but that never took away from the quality of \\"Boy's Life.\\"Do yourself a favor and read this book, and then read it again, and then a third time. Read it to your kids; a few pages at a time each night, and they will be hooked on reading forever. Do ya'all remember what it felt like after watching the movie \\"The Titanic\\"? Yeah, that's what I felt like after I first read this book. Awesome."},{"rating":"2","title":"Jackie","review":"This is one of the best books I've read. I love reading \\"coming of age\\" books.

Everytime I think about that dinosaur out there alive and well I smile."},{"rating":"2","title":"Quite good, really displays life how it is.","review":"McCammon is a wonderful storyteller and really piqued my interest in several matters that the reading of this book brought up. Life is portrayed so differently in Cory's world yet really it is all the same as our's. Brilliant, though I thought some of the language went overboard, while other interjections were necessary."},{"rating":"2","title":"I have lost count on how many times I have read this book","review":"I have probably owned ten copies of this book throughout the years, I read it, I loan it to someone I never get it back I buy it and read it again. I will continue to do so. The writing is extradordinary, the story is beautiful and heartfelt, sad, and hysterical, a must read for anyone who wants to get lost in the stories and secrets of small towns in the South."},{"rating":"2","title":"Boy's Life","review":"Boy's Life is a truly unforgettable novel. I finished the book months ago and haven't been able to shake it. A genuine masterpiece. The town of Zephyr, which McCammon creates with such precision and imagination, is a wonderful place that has much of the same DNA as your own hometown. One of my favorite books. Check this one out!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Spend some time with this boy.","review":"At nearly 600 pages \\"A Boy's Life\\" is not a novel you will be finishing in an evening. Nor will you want to, there is so much here to savour, smile at and remember. My husband assures me that for a 12 year old boy growing up in the 60's his first love really would be his bike, his ticket to freedom and the world around him. How fitting then that Cory's beloved bike plays such an integral role in the story. This novel reminds us of that innocent time at the end of childhood, before our eyes and minds are sullied with so many of the harsher realities of life. A boy, his buddies, his bike and a big mystery, what a ride!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The best book I have ever read","review":"Words cannot begin to describe the elation that I felt while reading this book. McCammon has captured the wonder of boyhood perfectly while managing to unravel a great mystery. Although I enjoyed the mystery aspect of the book, the real power of the story lies in its depiction of boyhood. It is uncanny how easy the book is to realte to. Everything is here, the magical bike, bullys, everything I remembered from my own childhood. The magic in this book is in how the child narrator views his world. Wonderful, wonderful book. Definitely worth the time it takes to read. Be sure to read this."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book didn't fool me","review":"I agree with the reviewer who remarked that the author was just \\"showing off how well he could write.\\" McCammon injects his acquired, adult maturity into this little twelve-year-old, and we're supposed to believe this kid is this smart, this mature. Just because description is ample and words are carefully chosen doesn't necessarily mean the book is well written. I'd rather read something more credible, something along the lines of _Where the Red Fern Grows_, which, by the way, is head and shoulders above this collection of unattached, irrelevant thoughts."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book, too many F bombs","review":"I loved this book. It's similar in style to my all-time favorite To Kill a Mockingbird. There are plenty of smaller stories flowing through the larger story, which I liked. The only thing I would caution about is the language. I finished and wanted my 14 year old to read it, but I had to hesitate and eventually decided not to. I wish I had \\"edited\\" out the cuss words (with my trusty pen) as I read. I never think the F bomb is appropriate and thought it was WAY overused in the book. I think this book would have been a perfect one for kids as young as 12-14 with a bit of editing, but as it is, I wouldn't recommend it. I think that kind of language adds nothing to a story. Other than that, wonderful book."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best books I have ever read. I loved it!","review":"If you haven't read this book yet, by all means, buy it! I could'nt put it down and didn't want it to end."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is THE book you refer to every friend who reads...","review":"....Like many others I stumbled onto this book. So impressed, I bought my own copy, re-read it and for the first time in my life, I wrote an author. Robert McCammon responded, expressing his thanks. I felt some of the giddiness of my own childhood; for a few minutes I was a 10 year girl, hearing from a far off celebrity but this was no electronically signed photograph - rather, a warm, personal letter. Robert McCammon's book brings back the magic of childhood -- the way it was or the way we wanted it to be - I recommended it to very first friend, my brother, who did the same thing I did, upon reading it; he went to the library and checked out every McCammon book. Though all were well done, none captured either of us quite like \\"Boys Life\\" ... The following Christmas my brother's favorite gift was a first edition of \\"Boys Life\\" .... the bottom line? Boys Life is a must read and, yes, a re-read. Enjoy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"You'll only like it if you were ever 12 (or will be, or...)","review":"You'll like this book if you were ever 12 years old... or will be... or want to be again. Robert McCammon is from Birmingham, AL, my hometown. Apparently, he was spying on me as I grew up! Boy's Life opens with a poem, and closes with some acknowledgements. Just reading these two pages makes me smile and laugh, and even cry. The story in between does the same, every time I read it; I read it at least once a year. I think it helps me stay young... If this book doesn't move you, I feel sorry for you; you obviously missed out on the magic parts of growing up."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of My Top Ten of All Time","review":"What an amazing book! I've read it 3 times now, and each time I find it exciting and illuminating. McCammon has blended magic and art so deftly, that it is what I can only call \\"page-turning, heart-pounding, serious literature\\". Few novelists of the current era have offered such a beautiful, moving, and redeeming tale."},{"rating":"2","title":"In my top five.......EVER written","review":"This book is magic. The characters, situations, writing, etc. are all pure magic. This book is so wonderful I cried numerous times while reading it, (not something I do often.) I lent it to my Father to read and he cried his eyes out. I just picked it up again today to reread and I thought I had to post a review to tell everyone how amazing it is.The description at the top and the glowing reviews on this site don't even begin to compare with how great this book is. I hope I am not overly hyping this book because when that happens often people get let down but honestly, I don't see how it is possible to be let down from this book.This is not like any of McCammon's previous work, so don't expect a thriller or supernatural horror story but do expect a magical wonderful book that will make you feel young again and appreciate life and the little things in life.Zephyr is truly a place where magic lives."},{"rating":"2","title":"A wonderfully magical tale! Enchanting!!!","review":"This was my 1st McCammon book. Needless to say now I'm hooked. This story has so much feeling and depth. Have you ever read something that makes you feel so strong it hurts?

Probably the best book I've ever read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent","review":"I read this book years ago...and I loved it, the characterization was excellent, and the story was superb...after this book, I read about 3 other books by McCammon.

The adventures Corey and his comrades have bring back the giddiness of youth to readers of all ages. The novel also has a heart felt side to it. Corey must help his father overcome the misery of the man at the bottom of Saxon's Lake. Whether Corey is hanging out with his friends or playing the role of detective the story is garaunteed to keep the reader intersted and on the edge of their seat."},{"rating":"2","title":"School Assignment","review":"I was required to read this my senior year in highschool, and fell in love with the story.

I'd reccomend this book to anyone of any age."},{"rating":"2","title":"Magnificent!!","review":"Mr. McCammon - Thank you for this beautiful book! I recently completed my 4th reading and love it more and more each time. This book must be READ. There are no words adequate enough to describe its magic."},{"rating":"2","title":"Most Memorable Book","review":"This story is one of the most intricately insightful, emotionally evocative, and hauntingly human epics I have ever read. I live in Alabama and the setting and depiction is spot on, giving me shivers as he talked about areas I have lived in or visited. I loved McCammon's work before I read this book but he showed his true brilliance in this novel."},{"rating":"2","title":"Of a time that once was.","review":"\\"Boy's Life\\", by Robert McCammon serves as a reminder of a different time in America. The place is the small, fictional, town of Zephyr, Alabama, where the story's protagonist Cory Mackenson lives with his family, his friends and his adventures. It's where magic exists within a young mind, alongside commonplace events that we all surely remember or, at least, should or wish we did. I had gotten down to the bottom of unread books in my library and briefly thought I might just skip over this one, however, the first chapter dispelled such thoughts and drew me in completely. There were many moments I found myself laughing aloud and others that evoked concern and ultimately tears. This is a book that will pass the test of time and one I've already passed on to loved ones. It is that good."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Nostalgic Tale & Mystery","review":"McCammon's Boy's Life is an excellent tale of nostalgia for the simple life of a boy growing up in small town USA combined with a mystery that protagonist 12-year-old Cory Mackenson must solve to save both his father's sanity and his own life.Murder in a small town means that someone unsuspected must be the killer: a neighbor, friend, or even public figure. The brutal killing of a stranger coupled with a historical setting during the Civil Rights Movement and Vietnam both serve to contrast the innocence through which Cory sees the world.Though some elements of the plot may seem somewhat outlandish--such as the hunting-down of a former Nazi prison camp figure--what really makes the book shine is its portrayal of small-town life through the eyes of a 12-year-old boy. Masterfully done with touches of imagination and magic and wonder, the story makes for an excellent read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just Okay","review":"I thought Boy's Life was an interesting book. It had several aspects such as drama, suspense, mystery,and even a little bit of romance. The book only received four stars from me because I solved the mystery before the end of it.Even though I had solved the mystery before the end of the book, it kept me turning pages because the other aspects were still good."},{"rating":"2","title":"thanks!","review":"The book arrived in great condition in a timely manner - one of the main reaons we use Amazon.

McCammonBook Review By: Shon OwensDo you want a good book to read? Well, Boy's Life is not that book.Boy's Life is good at the beginning, but only gets worse from there. It gets just plain boring, and then unsatisfactory. It's boring because it's so slow paced. I wish I didn't have to read it. Even the plot is boring.The story is about a boy that, while walking with his father, saw a car go off into the lake. Later, he finds out the car contained a man that should have been in the ground pushin' up daisies. Throughout the story, the boy tries to find out who the killer is. How original ... and yes, it's that boring. I do not recommend this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book is one LONG bore!","review":"\\"Boy's Life\\" starts out with a good a premise and I have to say that McCammon does a good job setting up his mystery. Unfortunately, the book goes downhill from there. The book lose track of its central premise and loses itself on a bunch of unrelated, nonsensical tangents. The books loses the central plot for chapters at a time before comming back to it. McCammon seems almost self aware that his book just about a small town with murder mystery that just doesn't quite fit when the character of Vernon writes a book with a similar problem. This book would be at least a 4 star book if it got the point and was about 200 pages shorter. As a mystery novel, it just misses the mark."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring and unrealistic","review":"This is the most boring book I had the misfortune to read in high school. I'm an avid reader, but this bored me to tears. It had your typical \\"boy coming of age\\" plotline, including the death of the boy's dog. It was unrealistic and ignored many of the serious issues and ways of life of the 1960s."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not read","review":"This is one of the most pointless books I have ever read. All it is is a bunch of short stories, all mostly bad, combined into one, to make one big bad story. It is portrayed as an emulation of part of the author's childhood, but you can tell it was all fictional. It jumps from topic to topic, and each section is worse than the one before. McCammon gives away the murderer halfway through the book, and when he officially announces the murderer, there is no point in reading after that because the ending is utterly horrible. It is the same old type of ending. So, as I say in the title, please do not read this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Glove I have ever used","review":"I originally purchased these at Home Depot, then reordered a dozen from Amazon.

They knew right from the start how to get listeners and they kept them to this day!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Can I give it 6 stars?","review":"The greatest speed metal CD of all time (at least the original version is). Nothing else is even close. This CD rocks from start to finish. It's Metallica before they sold a ba-zillion records and started suing Napster. It's raw power and emotion. This is garage band Metallica when I think they actually only cared about making good music.But, be careful, because this re-release is missing two great songs (Am I Evil & Blitzkrieg)."},{"rating":"1","title":"horrible remaster","review":"this gets 3 stars because the music is great but the sound is terrible and they took the 2 extra songs \\"blitzkrieg\\" and \\"am i evil?\\" off this version. PLEASE! why remaster such a classic album that sounded great to begin with? Black Sabbath waited till the 90's to remaster their recordings from the 70's why did they have to butcher this one so soon?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Root Beer","review":"What can be said that hasn't been already? I just wanted to throw out a few words of my own.I admittedly began my Metallica love with the Black Album. I moved from there to Puppets, then Lightning...nothing was as great as that Black album though! Long story short...bought Load, then ReLoad, then ...And Justice... and THEN I bought Kill Em All.You could say I was scared of their roots.After nearly two years of listening to Children of Bodom and super-fast classically-inspired metal, I come back to Kill Em All and have a new, *true* appreciation for this record. While the production quality is different (but good!), and the songs aren't as complex, there is still something humbling about beginnings.This album has the \\"sickest\\" (as they say) guitar solos of any metal song I've ever heard, period. While I was unfortunate enough to have grown up without this album, it is still an appreciated record, one that I respect and listen to, while acknowledging what Metallica once was."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT GOOD!!!!","review":"I don't see why so many people are praising this album, because it's not good. It's inadequate, and close to being poor. I thought I would like this group, since I was a fan of Zeppelin, Pink Floyd, and AC/DC, but this doesn't compare. If this is considered good rock, music has gone down big time."},{"rating":"1","title":"AWFUL AWFUL AWFUL","review":"This is the fifth Metallica album I bought and by far the worst. It's like a parody of their later stuff. The lyrics are completely brainless and unsophisticated. Most of them refer to heavy metal itself with some very obvious and utterly brainless references to Satan and death. This is heavy metal at it's cliched worst and if this was the first metallica album I bought I would have been turned off them for life. Do yourself a favour-buy master of puppets, ride the lightning or ...and justice for all instead. Avoid this album like the plague."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not my cup of tea.......","review":"First off, I will say Metallica is talented. They were the best of the \\"thrash\\" bands when the genre started. However, I never cared for thrash or speed. Playing as fast as possible does not make a band better, or more metal, or truer to the music. Groups like Iron Maiden, Judas Priest, Led Zeppelin, Deep Purple, and Black Sabbath are true metal. You might call it \\"hard rock\\", but it's the real heavy metal. This stuff is influenced by punk. A lot of people like the heavy, fast style, but real metal and hard rock has some melody. This stuff is the start of modern heavy music. If you want to find out about real classic metal, try groups like UFO and Scorpions, Thin Lizzy and Nazareth, Blue Oyster Cult and Triumph, Whitesnake and AC/DC, and the above listed groups. Long live real metal!"},{"rating":"1","title":"THIS CD IS VERY BAD","review":"This cd is like blah blah blah. Kill 'em all has no style to it. If you like metallica, than you should get reload, garage inc. or the black album. Pass on this cd."},{"rating":"1","title":"Virginal music....","review":"The cover of the album says a lot, very cursory and virginal. Let's just bang on some stuff and who cares if somebody likes it? This isn't much different than the attitude you might hear from someone like Nirvana. It's popular, family-pleasing, screamy, and adolescent. That's all fine if you like that kind of thing, but my review is not for those people.One other reviewer (who likes this) says, \\"A 20-year-old James Hetfield's unpretty vocals? The controversial cover?..They had acne\\". I don't disagree with any of that. It all sounds like a bunch of guys who picked up drums, guitar, vocal lessons, about a week ago. My only question is, who would really listen to this? There is no musical value, and it doesn't sound heavy, it just sounds like kids having a party."},{"rating":"1","title":"kind of a disappointment","review":"I didn't really like this album.

There isn't a bad song on this CD. Very heavy. Great all around sounding music. Kicking Lyrics. I highly recommend this CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"MetallicaTHP","review":"The beginning of Metallica, their first album Kill 'Em All features an extreme onslaught of thrash metal. The bands who influenced Metallica like Motorhead, Diamond Head, Danzing, Discharge, also great bands like Iron Maiden, Black Sabbath, as well as Judas Priest are ever present on the album. If you like any of the above bands you will surely love Kill 'Em All. The music is tight fast and very agressive, the band plays together as a unit, the whole time like they always do but the first three reign superior in this category. Such classics as The Four Horesmen, Seek And Destroy, and Jump In The Fire are the real highlights, but other great ones like Motorbreath and, Whiplash which has became a concert favorite, make this a truly remarkable album. It's raw but all Four Horsemen, James, Lars, Kirk, and Cliff play with such an uncanny tenacity this album is untouchable to all. A truly great album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pure Raw Metal","review":"This album ranks only behind Lightning and Puppets. While not as refined as those two, it has the pure raw Metal feel. This album was definatly not over produced like their latest albums, but has a perfect feel to it. Lots of power and great riffs. A Must for any Metallica fan."},{"rating":"2","title":"Where it all began.......","review":"Hard to believe how good of musicians James, Lars, Cliff, and Kirk were just when they started out. Though the songs aren't as memorable as their later works, they are just as good and lightning fast as their future masterpieces. You can hear a punk influence on \\"Motorbreath\\" (either that or James was listening to too much Motorhead), and \\"Seek & Destroy\\" is still a heavy metal anthem that Metallica even plays today at their concerts. This is a classic and a landmark for the early thrash era. If you like older thrash music, check out Megadeth, Anthrax, and Pantera's albums for a rockin good time."},{"rating":"2","title":"yeah i'm starting to like this band","review":"i'm not going into my story about how I used to hate this band now I love em cause I just did read my review for master of puppets anyway hey the debut first I have to rant who the heck cares that they used someone elses songs the stones first 4 or so albums were about 80% covers fact is these are good songs early metallica is amazing stuff sure this one's a little immature but hey I would like to see anyone make a album this good as a debut buy yhis one if you liked master of puppets for those of you who never really herd this album start with the puppets it's the best one of the few metal bands with true talent"},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing amazing","review":"There is nothing good about this album. The songs are mediocre, the lyrics are beyond cheesy and the riffs may be fast but are boring. The solos are terrible, every lick in the album sounds the same and all kirk does is descend and ascend in the pentatonic scale really fast, which is pathetic, in my opinion.I think that master of puppets is a much better album overall and if you are looking for good guitar solos do NOT buy this album, listen to music of guitarists which are a 1000 times better than Kirk such as Satriani, Vai and Yngwie Malmsteen."},{"rating":"1","title":"overrated the album not the band","review":"this is not mettalicas best work its the least medlodic most thrash sounding album ive ever heard just sounds a bit dumb to me there are some good tracks like seek and destroy and a gew others but this album is very overrated i do not see the metallica who wrote master the puppets ride the lightning or black album in this cd is a piece of history but not really worth your cash if your gonna listen to it"},{"rating":"1","title":"The most sold out Band ever","review":"Mettalica wants to be the most sold out band in history.

Is still have it actually. This CD is what every modern metal band is modeled after. The guitar sound on this disk was the first true \\"crunch\\" guitar sound ever. Along with Black Sabbath's \\"Paranoid\\", \\"Kill em' all\\" is probabbly the most influential Metal CD ever recorded. Although the Material and production on \\"Ride the Lightening\\" and \\"MOPuppets\\" is a bit more mature, this CD started it all. The riffs are timeless and the whole attitude of this disk is what make modern Metal what it is. Brutal, heavy and honest."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best Metallica album's","review":"Kill em' all was their first album.This was when they hadDave Mustaine on lead guitar when they first started out.Then Kirk Hammet joined the band during the Kill em' alltour.Both Dave and Kirk are amazing and brillant guitarplayers.Every song on here is awesome,there's not onebad song on here.Kill em' all is a must own for everydie hard Metallica fan and this is a classic metal album.Although there are 2 version's of this album.The originalKill em' all has the 2 cover song's they did on it \\"Am Ievil\\" and \\"Blitzkrieg\\" I strongly reccomend for fan's toown the original version.The other version doesn't havethe cover song's on it.Kill em'all is definetley one oftheir best album's.Cliff Burton has an awesome bass soloon this one,you've got to buy Kill em'all now!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"An early Metallica classic, and metal masterpeice","review":"Kill 'Em All is one hell of a metal album (like most of Metallica's works), and a great debut CD for one of the best metal bands to have ever graced music. Metallica perfected speed metal, just listen to this album! Every song is incredible! \\"Hit the Lights,\\" \\"The Four Horsemen,\\" \\"Whiplash, \\"No Remorse,\\" every song is metal to the fullest extent. Half the metal bands that exist today suck, even Metallica has lost their edge since the release of the Black album. If you want metal at its very best, check out early Metallica, and this is a great album to start with. Also check out Ride the Lightning, Master of Puppets, And Justice For All, Metallica (the Black Album), and S&M for some great live performances of their best songs. Check out Pantera and Megadeath, too."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not their best but still a classic.","review":"This one hell of a debut. Just to think, this is where thrash started! This may not be as good as later offerings but it is still a solid metal album and a very good debut. You can feel the energy, the willingness to climb to the top and show that metal wasn't just like Iron Maiden and Queensryche. Don't get me wrong, I like those bands loads (Iron Maiden are, in my opinion, the best metal band ever), but this has more of an edge, it showed that the complexity and technically high standard of metal COULD be blended with the energy of skate punk at the time. But this is no punk album, this is heavy metal.Four Horsemen, Seek and Destroy, Metal Militia, you name it, they're all good songs. Get Master Of Puppets first, but this is better than Ride The Lightning in my opinion. A classic."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of Metallica's best albums","review":"First off, you can trust me. I have every Metallica album and love every single one of them, I am a dedicated fan.Kill 'em all is a brilliant album. It is very fast paced compared to Metallica's newer stuff (Load and Reload). Jaymes' voice is a bit weird a screamy but it still sounds amazing. The lead guitar solos are amazing, and the riffs are great. The beginning of No Remorse is Kirk Hammet at his very best. The best riff on the album is the beginning of Seek and Destroy. If your a new Metallica fan looking for which album to buy first don't buy this, buy the self titled black album, but if your already into Metallica and have a few of their albums you will love this"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Classic","review":"The original sound of Metallica back when these guys were young and crazy, this is straight-out raw thrash metal; no ballads, and not a slow song on here. Though it's their next three albums where Metallica made a name for themsleves and formed a sound of their own, this remains a classic among metalheads. Although they show hints of their future progress in \\"The Four Horsemen\\" and \\"Phantom Lord\\", they mostly play to their influences on this one, with lyrics that don't go too deep but talk about how they love to rock and other trademark metal themes like the appocalypse. Former lead guitarist Dave Mustaine (now known for Megadeath) co-wrote several songs on here and the late Bassist Ciff Burton shows his skills on his solo track \\"(Anesthesia)-Pulling Teeth\\". It's not their best, but it is the beginning of something great and every true Metallica fan should own it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Early Metallica ROCKS!","review":"I recently became obsessed with rock/metal from the 70s & 80s so I sampled the tracks on this album here at Amazon. Instant fan. The album just arrived today and I must say, WOW! Awesome album. All the songs are great but I think the best song (in my opinion) is \\"No Remorse.\\"Overall, it's a great metal album from the 80s. I like the early Metallica better than the present Metallica. Highly recommended if you're looking to get into Metallica or just want a good metal album to add to your collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great metal album!","review":"This is just a flat out excellent album.

I hade been listning to some of the them \\"pop\\" music, and just really liked what I heard. The guitars,and bass were unbelivable. Unfortunatly Lars just haden't really gotten in to the groove yet. The most outstanding example that impacted me the most, is \\"The Four Horsemen\\". even today, I can listen to it again and again AND AGAIN!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Could've been much better, notably lacking in song structures","review":"Kill 'Em All, to me, ranks as one of Metallica's weakest albums. The sound quality is terrible for the most part and Kirk Hammett's guitar solos are very long and monotonous. The only great songs are \\"Four Horsemen\\" and \\"Metal Militia\\". It's a shame they fired Dave Mustaine back in 1983, he wrote most of the whole album. Truthfully, the demos and old mix tapes from the studio sound way better than the actual production of this cd. However, if you want a decent solid 4 1/2 star masterpiece from Metallica, I recommend Ride the Lightning."},{"rating":"2","title":"Old-school thrash at it's best...","review":"I was thrilled when I heard Metallica was re-issuing their albums on Vynil.So thrilled in fact that I immediately logged on to Amazon and purchased the first 2 albums and a copy of S&M; and Garage, Inc. on vynil as well. Unfortunately, Garage Inc. didn't work right and I eventually had to get a refund. However, Kill'em All still sounds as good and raw as ever.

It was all out thrash, in your face. Now I find it funny, a young James Hetfield fresh out of high school, screaming his head off since he can't sing.

A low-budget introduction into a much bigger multi-million dollar industry.Throwin' the metal!"},{"rating":"2","title":"For the real fans","review":"Metallica's first release wasn't quite the revolution in metal they were destined to become, but it's still well worth owning. Although they hadn't quite found their own unique style at this point in their career, and their sound is a bit generic, it's still some of the best thrash metal around. . .both then and now.

Hard, heavy, and lots of attitude. A lot of the songs are about physical abuse; Hit the Lights, Whiplash, No Remorse, Seek and Destroy, Phantom Lord, Metal Militia. This is a fun album to listen to when you're in a good mood. It never slows down and keeps your adrenaline flowin'. As almost everyone else says, I highly reccommend this album to fans of heavy metal or hard rock."},{"rating":"2","title":"Give Kill 'Em All a chance!!","review":"The first time I listened to this CD I grimaced and rushed to put on Master of Puppets. After listening to every Metallica CD I could stand, I gave this CD another chance. I never really cared for James Hetfield's early singing, but once I got past that I discovered that this is a truly great album. With glam-rock bands like KISS and Whitesnake strutting their stuff, Metallica dropped this bomb on the metal world in 1983. Though technically, this album isn't as advanced as Puppets, Justice, or the Black Album, I would stake KEA (Kill 'em all) against any modern metal album. This album has an energy unlike any of the subsequent offerings, more aggression and youthful fire. Be warned, however, if you listen to Seek and Destroy more than three times you may become addicted!..."},{"rating":"2","title":"The remorseless Metal Militia","review":"Metallica's debut is the epitome of thrash metal. Fast riffing, hyperspeed drumming and gut-wrenching bass playing. Over all this thrones the recognizable voice of mastermind/vocalist James Hetfield. Together with Slayer's \\"Reign in Blood\\" and the Exodus-classic \\"Bonded By Blood\\", this cd represents the eighties-thrash movement (which was founded by Metallica). Early hits like \\"Seek and Destroy\\" or \\"Whiplash\\" are still as brutal as they were then and build the cornerstone for their later worldcareer. So \\"Kill Em All\\" is a must-have for everyone who calls himself a metalhead."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thrashing All Around","review":"Metallica's debut is hard stuff. It's brutal metal with no mercy. There's some songs which have one writer their former guitarist Dave Mustaine: \\"Jump in the Fire\\", \\"The Four Horsemen\\", \\"Metal Militia\\", and \\"Phantom Lord\\". James Hetfield's voice is quite brutal too...the songs are brutal...and then the song \\"(Anesthesia) - Pulling Teeth\\" is an instrumental one...at first I thought it was a torturingf track...well it's quite near (but I like it!). There's that original power that can be found only in debuts. \\"Motorbreath\\", \\"Whiplash\\", and \\"Metal Militia\\" are that kind of songs. I have to say that Dave Mustaine doesn't play in this album...he made his own version of \\"The Four Horsemen\\" to Megadeth's debut \\"Killing Is My Business...And Business Is Good!\\" called Mechanix. It's even an better album than this, so I recommend you to listen to it...the whole album.Stars: Phantom Lord, Whiplash, Jump in the Fire"},{"rating":"2","title":"underated masterpiece!","review":"When Metallica had released this album they were all teenagers looking to hit it big. The people who criticize this album have totally overlooked the fact that this album has the true headbanging capabilities as of Ride the Lighting and Master of Puppets. Songs like The Four Horsemen, Jump in the Fire, and Seek and Destroy are true thrash metal anthems. This album truely captures the youth metal scene during the eighties. Dave Mustaine had just been replaced by Kirk Hammet when the album was released so their songs might have sounded alittle different from the later albums. Metallica still plays the songs from this album to this day. Kill em' All truely belongs to a metalheads collection.

Most of the songs are far overlong, and would be much better if they were shorter and less repititous. If you like early Metallica, I would recommend RIDE THE LIGHTNING."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dated","review":"I'm sure that this was brilliant and revolutionary when it was first released. I was 3 years old at that time, so I wasn't really into thrash metal then.I enjoyed it the first few times I listened to it. After listening to the same songs played live (and much more recently), I really can't stand any of the tracks off of this studio album anymore, except the Cliff bass solo. James' voice is just too high-pitched and grating.Not recommended as a purchase. Instead buy the Live Sh*t DVD or go to www.livemetallica.com to pick up some downloadable concerts from '04. That would be a much more satisfying Metal experience to most listeners, I think."},{"rating":"1","title":"Metallica's first album doesn't match the rest","review":"This is obviously Metallica's first album. It is probably my least favorite album of all the albums Metallica has made. The songs are thrash metal at its best, but it is very different from the newer CDs such as The Black Album or Load. This is a CD you have to judge for yourself, you'll either love it or hate it."},{"rating":"1","title":"I wish the quality was better.","review":"Ok..The music is awesome.But the quality of it all,the Way James used his voice.Its just kinda hard for me to listen too.But There are some MetalliClassics on here like the 4 horseman,Whiplash and Seek and destroy.I wish they would touch up the quality of this album.But I understand they were being rushed to make it too.The 2 stars I gave were for the 3 classics I listed oh yeah...phantom lord is a good track too."},{"rating":"2","title":"THIS IS A DEBUT???!!!!","review":"Holy crap is all I can say when it comes to this mutha. This is my favorite Metallica album because it is raw and it is GOOD! For a bunch of young'uns, they had the wickedest chops around! They should start releasing singles off of this baby right now in 2004, cuz they'd beat the fertilizer out of today's bunk. Hit the lights really kicks the album off, and 4 Horsemen just sends shivers down my spine, cat! Seek and Destroy tops my list cuz of 1. The kickass intro and 2. the rest of the song! Every song except whiplash is EXCELLENT, and the only reason i'd exclude that one is cuz of repetetiveness. I dig on the bass guitar, and I worshipped Cliff Burton from the get-go once i popped this album in. If only my band would realize what kickin' music really is!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome Debut Album","review":"This album layed down the blueprint for Metallica's later stuff. The sound is raw and full of energy. The lyrics are good, but obviously the band becomes more sophisticated with \\"Ride the Lightning\\" and \\"Master of Puppets\\"Track 5 is gem, \\"Anesthesia:Pulling Teeth\\" is a mind-blowing bass solo by Cliff Burton. The solo alone is worth the price of this album. The solo is Anesthesia to the ears, hence the name. \\"The Four Horseman\\" makes you feel the galloping of horses and hooves knocking at your door. The other songs are good, but are a big step down from other Metallica songs on future albums.But, overall an excellent debut album from rock's most powerful, musical band. Just give it a listen."},{"rating":"2","title":"Raw and Powerful","review":"Kill Em All was my first metal cd. When i first heard Hit the Lights, I was blown away by the intensity and raw engergy that Metallica posessed. They wanted to be agressive and they didn't care who knew it. The album sounds fresh, even now, when other rock bands are getting a more polished sound to their cds. With respect to their songs, Metallica's initial offering showed some great tunes. Seek and Destroy is great, not to mention the closer Metal Militia. You simply can't go wrong with this one. It's hard to fathom the kind of band Metallica would evolve into by just looking at the cover photo in the booklet. With more majestic records and powerful musicianship, Metallica would demonstrate to the world their power. They may not be the best or heaviest band around, but their live shows and albums speak more words than any elitist trying to take away from their contributions to the metal scene could. I hope that makes sense."},{"rating":"2","title":"Metal Militia!","review":"Kill 'Em All was Metallica's debut album.It was full of great thrash metal tunes that would make you wanna crank up your stereo and bang your head as hard as you could.The songs on here really show promise,that Metallica was not f--ing around when it came to heavy metal.I've always loved Cliff Burton's bass playing style,he was absolutley amazing,and this really shows in songs such as \\"Anesthesia\\".So,if your new to metal,or to Metallica,Kill 'Em All would be a great place to start.Then pick up their second and third albums,Ride The Lighting and Master Of Puppets.They are just as great as this."},{"rating":"2","title":"A GOOD DEBUT","review":"Well I am no Hardcore fan of Metallica but this is a good album.Those album that they have made which I have listened to(those are KILL'EM ALL, MATER OF PUPPETS , AND JUSTICE FOR ALL, BLACK ALBUM) are all very good. This is probably the heaviest. This is what I call A hard Rock'N'Roll and they surely fitin that category. The album is raw and fast like they're later masterpieces and you can just feel like you're in a concert fullof crazy fans jumping on each other while they are performing. I like they're songs and they are probably good at stage but I don't like them while they are interwieved because they show a lot of ego but they're great musicians and if you see this album in a store just buy it."},{"rating":"2","title":"And thus began thrash metal...","review":"It's so amazing how well these guys could play at such young ages, and the impact on music they had back then. Since Kill 'Em All, Metallica's debut, metal has never been the same."},{"rating":"2","title":"Working my way backwards...","review":"So the 'black' album was the first Metallica CD I ever bought. Since then I have been slowly collecting their music- at first the newer stuff, and then the older stuff. I bought 'Kill em all' on a recommendation, and really really like it. At first I didn't as much - their sound here is not as deep, or full, or melodic as it is on their 'black' album, but upon repeated hearings, I have found that I like it almost as much and it is fun to listen closesly and find those little riffs or whatever that developed into the full, throaty sound that they have today. I recommend it highly."},{"rating":"1","title":"unknown.","review":"i ordered the W.B. Marvin fan from Deerso but received a \\"Powerhouse\\" fan, which isn't the one pictured.

Shouldn't we get to read stories about interesting women who actually did something with their lives?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Writing, way too short","review":"I got interested in this after hearing the radio adaption on Sirius/XM radio. While the radio adaption was adequate and geared for an 1940's audience, the original story is darker and more serious. I like this book, although I feel that Mr. London could have expanded more on life after the plague dissapated - how mankind de-evolved into primitive societies, the civilization that they know with all of it's technological advances disappearing and if there was hope for them. I do recommend this book as a jumping off point if you are into that type of fiction."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great novella in a beautiful format","review":"1) This is a novella, not a short story; if you are expecting a thick book, don't go for it, but it's just as long as many published books.1b) I was shocked to discover that Jack London had written what we'd now call postapocalyptic fiction. The frisson was stronger to realize that the apocalypse was now!1c) I'd highly, highly recommend this to anyone who enjoys postapocalyptic fiction. I don't know if it's the origin of some of the tropes we often see, but it's definitely an early instantiation of them, and it's kind of heartbreaking.2) This edition in particular is a beautiful edition of a text that is available online, proofed and corrected. I would much rather read this than any of the free editions for that reason: I find errors distracting and this version has none.2b) I'm looking forward to the rest of the Radium Age series!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A debasement of the original","review":"Jack London's Scarlet plague was well written and memorable. This recently produced rewrite is a dreadful travesty, poorly prepared and in no way comparable to the original classic. It is not deserving of the name and should not be so marketed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Need a good story?","review":"This is a good story to read in front of the fire one night.

It is rare that a remake is actually better than the original, but 4U's version of \\"Waiting For A Girl Like You\\" is extraordinary. I hope the world gets ahold of this and it catches fire for the band.

It was enjoyable on many fronts: the mystery within a mystery, the comedy, the poetry, the location, the church descriptions and the music! Pure fun."},{"rating":"2","title":"A fun mystery","review":"So as to give the author a good quote: The most pleasurable experience I've had since the local methadone clinic closed.Really, \\"The Alto Wore Tweed\\" was a fun book, and yet in its humor still found a way to keep me guessing. A rare balance of humor and mystery; definitely one of the best books in this genre I have read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Choir fun","review":"Having sung Alto in a church choir, this book is a hoot.

Well, maybe they do and \\"The Alto Wore Tweed\\" should be on every musician's reading list this summer. In fact, anyone who is into whodunits will love this book about a guy who writes a book with no plot, except it has one, as does the main book. Or something like that. (There's even a cemetery plot, too!) All I can say is the butler didn't do it. Heck, \\"The Alto Wore Tweed\\" takes more turns than an O.J. Simpson car chase. The surprise is that it is June and I suddenly have a hankering for Hugo Distler's \\"The Christmas Story\\". Mark Schweizer, that's the mark of a good book....a bookmark, you might say."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing, Forget This Realms book","review":"This book, as should be obvious, is another of the standalone novels of The Harpers series.As a longtime fan of the Forgotten Realms novels, this book is quite possibly my least favorite Forgotten Realms novel. Some of the books are cliched, some are poorly written, and some are just bad. This is heavy on the last issue.As several reviews have pointed out, it was apparently too much effort for the author to use a Harper as the main character. So, with a weak tie-in they bring some supporting characters on board.The book also fails me in that it doesn't feel like a Forgotten Realms book. At all.Overall, this is easily my least favorite of The Harpers series, and arguably the worst Forgotten Realms book I've read. Skip it. There's plenty of other options out there."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not one of the better FR books to date...","review":"I found this book to be lacking in numerous areas. Primarily, it seemed hard to follow and somewhat irrelevant to the Harper series. The main character, although she had a lot of depth, didn't stike me as very interesting and most of the supporting characters met untimely ends too frequently thoughout the story, making it more like a bad horror movie. The writing style was okay. I wouldn't recommend this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not so much Fantasy as it is Horror!","review":"Scott Ciencin is a GREAT author (Shadowdale was AMAZING), but unfortunately The Night Parade was a bit of a disappointment! It is much closer to HORROR than it is to FANTASY. Therefore, it is not your conventional Forgotten Realms fantasy novel. For those fans who enjoy Horror this is a book that combines the two, but for the rest of us, I recommend other books from the Series such as Red Magic or Parched Sea to mention a few, all the while keeping in mind the \\"heavy artillery\\" Forgotten Realms novels that have been written by RA Salvatore, Elaine Cunningham, Ed Greenwood etc My advice, read The Night Parade only after you're done reading all the other Forgotten Realms books and you are still in need of more Toril related material."},{"rating":"2","title":"More early works by Greg Clark","review":"Greg Clark was a master story teller, bar none. From the 1930s until his death, his humorous exploits and encounters appeared regularly in several Canadian newspapers. In his time, he was high praised, but since his death, his works have, unfortunately, been largely forgotten. The stories that constitute this book were first published in the 1930s. Jimmie Frise was a long-time friend and illustrator. Personally, these stories lack the refinement of his later works, but are, nevertheless, very entertaining. Another collection of his early writings was compiled in Greg Clark & Jimmie Frise Outdoors."},{"rating":"2","title":"Difficult to take in all at once","review":"I picked this album and 17Seconds up on a rainy grey Saturday. I played the disk while I was doing errands around the apt. \\"All Cats are Grey\\" came on and I had to sit down. The piano at the end of that track still rings in my head. \\"Two pale figures ache in silence... timeless in the quiet ground... side by side in age and sadness\\"... Funeral Party. I had never heard anything like this before. At the time I had several Cure disks (late 80s), but I had never heard their early stuff. I ended up listening to it at least a dozen times that day. I don't think any music will ever impact me the way this disk has....."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bleak and painful, yet beautiful","review":"This album is difficult to listen closely to because it is so emotionally evocative. It is a good album to stay up late in a daze to, also a good album to kiss to. \\"Other Voices\\" drift in and out of the darkness. This is classic Cure and is a magical listen."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfectly grey","review":"This album is the most grey of all the cure albums....it is not as pleading as some of the other albums or as questioning (except for maybe \\"primary\\" and \\"doubt\\" which both sound vaguely spiteful just in the intonation of the music alone)....instead it is sort of resigned to a sadneess that can only be expressed through music. When love gets to confusing i listen to this and cry...It would be impossible for me to choose which song from this album is the most perfect.... Other Voices is haunting... All Cats are Grey is the most swirling grey and lost song ever... The Funeral Party sweeps me away.... I do not know what to say....Very sad, to say the least, but with a little bit of hope sometimes"},{"rating":"2","title":"Part 2 of 3 of THE TRUE CURE TRILOGY","review":"Robert may consider Pornography, Disintegration and Bloodflowers as his band's Trilogy, but to many listeners they are simply 3 excellent albums in the bands long career. In my most humble (read arrogant) opinion, the true Cure Trilogy is Seventeen Seconds, Faith, and Pornography.Faith is an absolutely amazing album and a great follow up to Seventeen Seconds. Actually it's my favorite in the Trilogy. As with many other reviewers, I too rate All Cats Are Grey as my favorite on the album and one of my favorite Cure songs altogether. If you have never heard these early recordings and like Disintegration then you really must check out this masterpiece of minimalist post punk/goth."},{"rating":"2","title":"THE PREMIERE CURE ALBUM! GET IT!","review":"This is absolutely my favorite Cure album. Very dark and beautiful... I always feel like I'm adrift at sea when this one's on.

Very influential... right up there with early Joy Division (Closer), only cleaner sounding in my opinion."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Ultimate Cure Classic (besides Disintegration)","review":"I read once that Robert Smith thought of Faith and Disintegration as a continuation of the same thought or feeling. I've been listening to this album for almost a decade, and it carried me through the throes of puberty to the confusion of college, through the drabness of everyday life. The sound is atmospheric, intoxicating, soothing, enraging. It's like a rainy day with thunder and wind.

Being a native of Philadelphia, I particularly enjoyed how the story took place there; reading about the neighborhoods and streets I lived in was cool!I liked the characters; there was definitely Philly flava written in this book. I only wish the \\"bad guy\\" wasn't so easy to figure out. I knew who it was before I could hit the half way point of the book. And Eddie... he was TOO perfect of a boyfriend. He could have had a psychotic side to him or something interesting!Overall mystery fans should enjoy this book and if you're from Philly you'll definitely like it. It's a little disappointing figuring out who the \\"psycho\\" is so soon in the novel... but then again, it could just be me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Read!","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed every moment I spent with this book. Ms. Connor did an excellent job of making me care about all the characters, the good and the bad alike. That's why the discovery in the end was tantalizing. And, talk about folks in other folks business...just wait until you find out how crazy making that can be. The author gives a new definition to the word friend between these pages. Pick this one up soon for that rainy afternoon when all you want to do is treat yourself. You will not be disappointed!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great Read - A Must Buy!","review":"The book details a journey from Jamaica to the U.S.; the cut-throat industry that is Financial Services, and the impact on September 11 on the NY financial services industry employees - especially the protagonist. Very well written, and seemingly autobographical, this is a good glimpse into a world with which many of us are completely unfamiliar."},{"rating":"1","title":"Enormous and Out of Tune!!","review":"I was so disappointed in this mobile. My husband put it together and put it up to surprise me and threw away the packaging so we're stuck with it. This mobile is ridiculously tall and the music is horribly out of tune! There's no way I'd turn this on and hope it would sooth our son.Edited to say: #2 is now seven months old and he loves this mobile. Apprently he is tone deaf but he'll watch that red \\"S\\" go around until it turns off!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Album to date","review":"While this is not her only album that i own i do think it's her greatest. This is an album you can listen to and cry and think about life and society. I even got my teenage sister and my cousins who were not even teens at the time listening to it. My favourite songs are Fast Car, For you, mountain o things, For my lover and Behind the wall. WHat is so great about her lyrics is the subtle changes in the songs. IN fast car the song goes from we've got to make a decision to you've got to make a decision. That simple change relates the meaning of the song so beautifully. This is definitely a must have album. If for nothing more than delving into your inner thoughts."},{"rating":"2","title":"Unique","review":"Whether you like Tracy Chapman's music or not, it is unique, you do not hear anything else like it.She has a very special way of singing. Her extreme voice underlines her strongly political lyrics in an emotional, but in no way exaggerated, way.The best tracks are the superhit Fast Car and For My Lover. The most different song is the afro-reggae-inspired Mountains O'Things. Most of the songs are very short.An interesting collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tracy Chapman is a superstar to me","review":"This is one of the very best CD's I have ever listened to. Tracy Chapman's voice is so beautiful, and soulful. I purchased this CD about ten years ago and still listen to if often because all of the tracks on it are timeless, and they all sound so perfectly together.Of course my favorite track is Tracy's biggest hit, \\"Fast Car.\\" Her voice is so clear and beauteous and sad on this track. I also enjoy all the other songs on the CD, especially \\"For My Love\\" and \\"Baby Can I Hold You.\\"It is hard to believe that Tracy did not break into musical superstardom like today's halfwit wannabe singing stars of the reality TV generation. Tracy Chapman is a musical genius and a superstar to me though."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great music","review":"I have always been a fan of this album. I can't say I found the rest of her albums as good as this one. But I pretty much like every song on this cd. I have learned to play \\"Fast car\\" and \\"Baby can I hold you\\" on guitar. If you are a Tracy Chapman fan you probably already have this cd. If you aren't but want to check her out... i say start with this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Still relevent, still beautiful!","review":"I loved \\"Fast Car\\" when it came out, and bought this album on vinyl. I listened to it until the grooves wore out! Hearing this CD was like stepping back to 1988, when I had a fast car, and was ready to go anywhere. What a voice. And such real lyrics. She told stories that made you feel like she was in your life at that moment, and that by hearing it through music, you could change your circumstances. Love this CD. Love Chapman!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good, solid album","review":"Tracy Chapman really amazes here. She does some great work and she is a talented singer as well as songwriter. There is nothing pretentious or boring about her; she simply sings the songs she wants other to hear and they are wonderful. It is easy listening with a bit of a light tempo pop background,but she manages to keep one's interest the whole way through. My favorite songs are fast car, talkin about a revolution, and for my lover. It is not perfect, but it is definetly a great album to give a chance and listen to. It is certainly better than anything out there today, there is no manufactured music, just simple and light. Bravo!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Master CD","review":"This is a master CD - must in every collection. In the same line of all the fine albums.

However, after several car trips I have heard this album a few times and it isn't half bad. \\"Fast Car\\" is the best song on the album and one you'll want to listen to several times. Not a bad album at all."},{"rating":"2","title":"Can't ever have enough.","review":"Cannot ever have enough of Tracy Chapman. I will have to repeat this line over and over to fill in the necessary words to make this a review, eh Mr. Review Person"},{"rating":"1","title":"This is what all the excitement is supposed to be about?","review":"I was working at a record store when this album came out (back when they had record stores) and was forced to listen to this on our PA system on a daily basis. Musically lacking any ambition, chock full of really simple-minded, self-righteous lyrics, and about as interesting as a ten-pound bag of fertilizer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Comes Very Close to Music","review":"Tracy Chapman demonstrates how simple it is to read random selections from a newspaper in a sing-song voice. I particularly liked how they chose to accompany her with musical instruments in order to suggest melody. The CD has eleven tracks. This was done, no doubt, to suggest divisions in what seems to be a 30 minute exercise in how to affect odd inflections of the voice. Perhaps, in the future, Tracy will treat us to imitations of other musical structures."},{"rating":"1","title":"I wonder....","review":"..if, when the poor people come to \\"get their share,\\" if that will include the share owned by rich recording artists. Nothing worse than a hyporcrite, and no profession exhibits it worse than the entertainment industry. Chapman just happens to be one of the most \\"vocal\\" but is really nothing but the primus inter pares."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of my all-time favorite albums","review":"I'm surprised that it's taken me this long to replace my cassette with the CD, but now that I have I know that it will once again be a staple in my car. It instantly transports me back to the summer of '88 and the road trips I took with my best friend, Michael and all the singing along we did...some great lyrics here! My favorites, along with the incredible \\"Fast Car\\": \\"For My Lover\\", \\"Baby, Can I Hold You\\" and \\"Mountains of Things\\"...!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Heartbreakingly funny and sad","review":"I laughed out loud at the wry and tender humour Novakovich brings to these intimate essays. Several of these essays belong alongside David Sedaris' writing about his misadventures in France--insightful, intimate, and heartbreakingly funny observations on our human predicament. Picking up this book is so much like sitting in a Balkan cafe with a long-lost friend telling exquiste funny / sad stories that leave you hanging on every word that later you swear you can smell the espresso, brandy and smoke. Reccomended!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A little ordinary","review":"I bought two types of edible glitter to decorate a birthday cake. This version went on very grey with not much of a sparkle or luster. Quite dissapointing. I ended up sieving more powdered sugar over the area that I'd put this glitter to cover it up, and used the disco glitter I bought as a far more sparkly alternative."},{"rating":"2","title":"Greek Myths come to life beautifully.","review":"That said, \\"Perseus & the Gorgon\\" is a verybeautiful and faithful retelling of the tale of Danae, the shower ofgold, the birth of Perseus and the slaying of Medusa (no Andromeda, though). But a particularly beautiful rendition of the legend of Atlas. However, it doesn't quite reach the high bar set by the original Storyteller series, because there's little added to the original in the adapation.\\"Daedalus & Icarus\\", however more than compensates. Perhaps the best of the four episodes, there's a humanity infused into all the characters, but most notably through the performances of Derek Jacobi as a guilt-ridden Daedalus and John Wood as King Minos.These episodes may be frightening to very young children simply because they are so faithful, but if they're reading things like the D'aulaires' Book of Greek Myths, this is a perfect companion."},{"rating":"1","title":"a bad bootleg of a great band","review":"This album should never have been released. It is just a bad bootleg put on a cd.(it has 4 tracks, each track has 4 or so songs, each tack must have been a side of a bootleg vinyl record). This is a shame, since UFO was a great band. Buy \\"Strangers in the Night\\" great live album that captures UFO at its peak."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"Why didn't UFO ever make it big in this country? After hearing this recording I know. A really great band with great songs that just sound flat. They play all the hits from the Michael Shenker era albums, but Paul Chapman sounds like he's just learning the songs. Mediocre recording quality. If you want a cool UFO album you haven't heard, try The Early Years collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Cars at their not very best","review":"This is the first and most recent studio album for the Cars since the release of THE CARS' GREATEST HITS in 1985. The songs are very good in this album. YOU ARE THE GIRL,STRAP ME IN and COMING UP YOU are wonderful. Since the release of GREATEST HITS,the late Ben Orr released a solo album and Ric Ocasek released THIS SIDE OF PARADISE. For their own reasons,the Cars decided to disband after recording DOOR TO DOOR."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Overlooked album","review":"The Cars \\"Door To Door\\" is an under-rated masterpiece. In my opinion \\"Heartbeat City sounded a little too clean and processed. Door to Door was a return to form."},{"rating":"1","title":"SAD END TO A GREAT BAND","review":"It is really a shame that this was the Cars final release. With all the promise of thier debut less than 10 years later this jumbled mess was released. There are a few good songs here but not nearly enough or anything really classic. Funny on all thier other releases the Cars crafted melodic pop songs that stuck in your head. None of these songs do that so it was obvious the tank was on empty for one of the greatest bands of it's time."},{"rating":"1","title":"unhappy","review":"The quality said excellent but after receiving the item I was not so impressed. The case for the CD was cracked and broken and the disc itself had some scratches on it. Luckily the disc played okay. Excellent quality doesn't mean scratched and broken. Very disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Idling Cars...........","review":"There are a few decent songs on \\"Door to Door\\" and maybe a handful are worth repeat listens. And even those are marginal, (with the sole exception being the tuneful \\"Coming Up You\\".) \\"Door to Door\\" plays more like an album of B-sides than anything else. It comes up especially weak in comparison to the stellar work that came before it. This album finds Ric Ocasek at his lowest ebb when it comes to songwriting. Dull, flat and uninspired. At this point, Ric was champing at the bit to get on with his solo career and \\"Door to Door\\" suffered because of it. It comes off more as a contractural fulfillment than a full-on effort. This becomes all the more evident when one compares this album to the far superior 2011 release, \\"Move Like This\\", which finds Ric reinvigorated and focused. I am a HUGE Cars fan and have all their albums. Only \\"Door to Door\\" languishes on the shelf year after year. Thank God the boys have reunited! Let the good times roll again!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The rust is setting in","review":"Oh hell, what happened here. This would not be a bad addition to the collection for reved up cars fans, but lacks the sound we came to know the group for. Worth nothing more then a $1 bargain at the local record fair, the only song that brings the group to their trusted synth-rock style is \\"you are the girl\\". \\"Double trouble\\" seems to be a left over jamming session from \\"Heartbeat city\\", with some selling potential as a single, but sounds too raw. Would have been nice if they given it some more production work. \\"Fine line\\" was a shellow effort which somewhat reminded me of a Leonard Cohen song, but without the soulful texture. Most of the album sounds nothing more then some inferior noise, like the group no longer having that magical desire. Not worth the effort of re-buying on cd."},{"rating":"1","title":"What can I say...","review":"If you look at my other Cars reviews you will see I did not like \\"Heartbeat City\\" very much, and I really hate this one. When it came out it was DOA, and it never had much spark to it. It reminds me of the solo stuff all the members did, it sounds kinda like the Cars but is missing something. I am a huge Cars fan, but I do not even own this one anymore and I do not like any of the solo stuff the memebers did. This was a sad end to one of my favorite bands."},{"rating":"1","title":"Forgettable","review":"How anyone can rank this album as The Cars' \\"best\\" or \\"finest\\" is completely beyond me. I own all their albums and this is by far the worst of the lot. When you want an honest review of an album, just check out the used price. $1.68. Knowhuddamean?None of the songs are great. The best of them fall somewhere between listenable and good. Several are painful to sit through. The worst of them has to be Fine Line, which just sits there in front of you, endlessly droning on and on and on for well over five minutes. OK, I get it already. There's a fine line between us.The Cars crossed that line with Door to Door. If this album shows where they were headed musically I'm glad it was their last. Sometimes I think it's a shame they didn't call it quits after Heartbeat City and go out on a good note."},{"rating":"2","title":"What a purchase!!","review":"I received mine today and they look wonderful. I love that they look handpainted. Each one is just a little different then the other, but not enough to look weird or anything.

They are strong and sturdy yet very pretty."},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT, but Pricey","review":"USING THIS WITH EPSON PHOTO PRINTERS, the quality has always been great.It is kind of expensive if you print a lot."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best paper: just wait 24 hours","review":"I've tried all the major premium papers (not the specialty papers like watercolor or canvas styled ones), and I keep looking for a paper that has the subtly and fineness of color, range, and clarity of this paper, so I can save money. But I still can't find one. One proviso, you must wait 24 hours after your print comes out of your printer before handling the finished product. It might look great and 'touchable', but it takes about 24 hours for the chemical reaction to fully bring out the full tonal qualities. Print, admire, put it in a safe place for a day, then look at the results. If you can find a truly comparable paper, let me know."},{"rating":"2","title":"Studio Quality Photo Paper","review":"This paper is rivaled by none as a professional inkjet photo product. Epson has mastered the ink/quality/longevity/appearance of photo printing with this paper. The paper is heavy weight and has that \\"photo studio finish\\" on the front. The back of the paper very lightly says \\"Epson Professional Paper\\" but never gets seen so not a big deal for me. The wow factor is really the finish of the paper. Epson has resin-coated the finish side to maintain paper durability and color hold for a very long lasting image. My wife and I are Artists and have really found a winning combination with this paper and our Epson R2880 printer. We would certainly recommend to others and have already purchased more."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great paper!","review":"I have been using this paper for about 1 1/2 years. It is awesome. I sell my wildlife and landscape photos and this is the only paper I would consider using for my 8x10's.

Oh brother."},{"rating":"2","title":"Epson Ultra Premium Photo Paper Luster","review":"I was very pleased with the prints produced on Epson Ultra Premium Photo Paper Luster. The only thing preventing me from giving it a 5 star rating is the fact that the back has a slick coating requiring a photo pen if you wish to write anything.

I printed an 11x14 of a photo that I had printed by a photo lab on luster paper, and it looked as good as,and in some respects beter than the photo lab print of the same size.

Disk 2 of their Toronto compilation is awesome. But here Sharam gets to use his musical tastes. The entire album is mesmerizing. There are a lot of vocals on the disc and some people say vocals + house/trance=cheese. Quite the contrary. Track 2, \\"The Wish\\", is beautiful and funky. Track 7 is a Timo Maas song that is just plain trippy. Track 8, \\"Lovegame\\", is more of a downtempo song with an addictive melody. This is easily one of my favorite discs I've ever heard or owned. It's been stuck in my car CD player for a week because I can't stop listening to it. There's a reason these guys are so well respected in the biz.

It explains the four \\"worlds\\" and the ten \\"sephirot\\" of each that make up reality. There are more complete books - or sets of books - about this complex and esoteric topic, but this one should appeal to the beginner who wishes to know whether he or she wants to learn more."},{"rating":"2","title":"Start Here!","review":"Does anyone really understand the Kabbalah? Understand is not the correct word because it is not about understanding, it is about 'getting it' at a spiritual level. It is about experiencing God, not 'understanding' that which words cannot define. Waite has undertaken a massive pursuit here and provides tremendous help, as much as one can in grasping the ineffable. He himself shares, \\"The truth is that every word of Scripture enshrines Supreme Mystery and is capable of SIXTY methods of interpretation.\\" Again, it is not about the \\"right\\" interpretation, it is about experiencing the Divine.

In every respect, Winterson has reasons for insecurity. The same church that once embraced her condemns her for unorthodox practices; her friends mock and desert her; her mother who once expressed unconditional love towards her daughter, now disowns her. What then? Left with nothing but herself and her homosexuality, Winterson puts two and two together and creates her own world where oranges are not the only fruit. I truly admire her inner strength--if only the rest of us found love within ourselves when the world turns dark--we'd be much happier. I say, let your true self radiate from within. Life is too short to live by others' standards and criticisms."},{"rating":"2","title":"Yes it was good, but enough fruit puns, fellow reviewers!","review":"It was good.However: each word did not resonate in my brain endlessly, it was not the most beautiful thing ever written or read, it did not reveal universal truths that had been hidden to me before.On the other hand: I didn't find the characters cartoons, you cannot dismiss it as simply being a \\"fruitcake\\" novel, and the writing was not just quirky, it was truly original and memorable.I wouldn't rush out to read another of her books, but neither would I avoid them. It was a nice, thoughful, well written book that was sensible short and to the point--so many novelists just don't know how to edit--and I really liked those fables that were woven into the story."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pointless","review":"Let me state right off the bat that I have nothing against homosexuals at all. I found the idea of this book very appealing and was anxious to read it. But, I really didn't get this book. I understand it was an autobiographical novel about a gay woman's upbringing and coming out, but I just didn't care for it and I found it pointless. The interspersed fairy tales made no sense to the story, and at times it seemed like it was jumping around like random thoughts that pop into your mind."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as Smart As She Thinks She Is","review":"An impressive piece of work but irritating and ultimately unsatisfying. The structure is confusing - not really innovative, as many seem to think, just quirky - the inserted fables little more than pretentious nonsense. The characters, especially the mother, are caricatures, cartoon figures who only serve as opportunities for the author to demonstrate her superiority.Worst of all, Jeanette, both as a character and as a narrator, has no empathy for others in her life. She betrays not the slightest sympathy for anyone who behaves differently than she wants them to. In some circles, this type of behavior is known as \\"sociopathology\\".As a reader, this leaves one with no sympathetic or full-blooded chareacters, no social context, a plot that is as ordinary as they come, and a lot of fancy writing.I know this is a minority opinion, but I must be honest: I found this book annoying and pretentious."},{"rating":"1","title":"eh...","review":"I like the way that she writes... but the story got kinda creepy.

I don't see how it's a classic of anything. The story isn't very interesting and, except for near the end, it's hardly lesbian. Maybe it was all of the religious overtones, but I struggled through it.

At the same time that I was doing this, I also PlastiDipped my rims a bright white (my Grand Am GT coupe is white as well.) The contrast is striking!There's plenty of paint in this kit -- easily enough to do two sets of calipers. I gave my remaining paint to the tech who helped me get my car on the lift and showed me how to use the air tools for my wheels."},{"rating":"1","title":"Chips-ahoy!","review":"I wanted to save a few bucks and paint instead of buying caliper covers. I know paint prep is important for this type of job and spend at least 30 min on each wheel. I also followed the temperature and curing times closely. I used 3 to 4 coats on each caliper. Within the week there where multiple large chips flaking off."},{"rating":"1","title":"You get what you pay for","review":"Given the price this was an okay purchase. If I did it again I would spend a little more and get the g2 kit.ProsGreat red color.Easy to use. No mixing involved.ConsAs others have said, the included brush is terrible. I didn't finish a single caliper before it fell apart.After 1 month there is already at least one chip in the paint. I spent my time by taking the calipers off completely and cleaning them heavily so the paint would stick and there would be no dirt or grime. There is no reason they should be chipping already.I'm already planning to redo these this spring with a different brand of paint."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great product, plenty of paint!","review":"This product was easy to apply and looks great. I painted 4 calipers and did 4 light layers of paint and there was still plenty of paint left to do another car.The kit comes with a brake spray to help clean the calipers and prep them for painting. Make sure you use it wisely and not run out, like I did after 3 calipers. Make sure to have a tooth brush or metal brush of some sort to scrub the dirt and brake dust off since this kit does not come with any brushes.After reading the reviews about the supplied paint brush, I didn't bother using it and went to Lowe's and bought a 1 inch quality brush and some smaller brushes for the details. It worked out perfectly fine.Highly recommend this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"So-So product...","review":"Like many other have commented, (and I did not listen myself and totally regret it)... DO NOT DO NOT DO NOT DO NOT DO NOT DO NOT DO NOT DO NOT use the brush that came with this product, it will come apart during use, and bristles will get stuck in the paint. Since paint dries extrememly fast, you will either have to leave the bristles in the paint, or pull them out leaving line impressions. The paint itself is not bad, but the whole brush thing makes this kind of a weak product. I am normally a big fan of dupli-color products, but this one was a let down."},{"rating":"1","title":"Coarse setting is too fine","review":"This grinder works OK, but not great. You have to hold the button down, and even at its coarsest setting it still grinds finer than I'd like for drip coffee. It also produces a lot of powder and coffee dust."},{"rating":"1","title":"Broke within a week!","review":"My grinder broke within a week after purchasing it from Target. I would have probably returned it anyway because my BUNN coffeemaker filter overflowed THREE times with the setting on \\"Fine\\". Yeah, no more messes but yet, no coffee in the AM for now until I get my new one!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not good for Expresso","review":"I got this grinder last week and I'll return it today. It's good and quiet for regular coffee machines, but the finest it will grind would not work for espress machines.It's a great price and deal if you only brew regular coffee."},{"rating":"1","title":"Seems to be poor quality","review":"This Black & Decker CBM205 barely worked when it was new and quit entirely after about two months of daily service. While it was working, it was extremely slow in operation, as other reviewers have mentioned, taking minutes to grind enough beans for a pot of coffee. Add this grinder to your list of cheaply made, poor quality Made-in-China consumer products headed prematurely to the landfill."},{"rating":"1","title":"great machine but makes powder","review":"I just bought this machine at Target and liked pretty much everything about it for an inexpensive piece.... easy to rinse container, easy to put beans in for grinding, and it grinds pretty quickly. The cons for it is that you have to hold down the button until it finishes grinding (not a big deal). It produces quite a bit of powder which is creating a bitter coffee. I am actually taking mine back as I do not enjoy bitter coffee. You can adjust the courseness of the bean grinding, but the very course seemed pretty fine to me with quite a bit of powder around the sides of the container that catches the grounds."},{"rating":"1","title":"Does not work","review":"I really wanted this model to work. $24.95 at Target. Cheapest price for a burr grinder around. However, after 3 (!) that were all DOA's AND NEVER WORKED AT ALL, brand new out of the box, I gave up. Maybe this Target had a bad batch, but after three refunds I can't help but give it the lowest rating."},{"rating":"1","title":"Much Worse Than a Blade Mill for Espresso","review":"It gets one star because it doesn't function as advertised. It grinds fine enough for drip, but not espresso. There is a fair amount of dust produced too, about the same amount as my blade mill when I shake it while grinding. Also, the collection container is made of brittle plastic that hold a nice static charge which makes pouring the grounds out difficult, and there is only a momentary power button that you need to hold down. Oh well, the price was too good to be true..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Black & Decker CBM205 Coffee Bean Mill, Stainless Steel","review":"Hey all,For the price this may be an ok grinder. The problem as I see it, is that the beans will not fall down into the grinder on their own and you need to constantly shake the grinder to gets the beans to fall into the grinding element. Coffee also gets stuck in the space where the coffee transfers from the grinder to the storage container. Over all spend a little more and receive alot more. Would not buy again."},{"rating":"1","title":"design is flawed","review":"This mill is seriously flawed because it jams up from all the dust it makes. After a month or so it clogged with coffee dust and the motor seized. I removed the twistoff cleaning plug from the loading funnel and tried to clean the chamber. I got some of it out but it is impossible to get most of it that way, and after a couple more runs it jammed again. The mill is defective by design as there is no way to disassemble it for cleaning. Save your thirty bucks!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Might be from the makers of Italian cars","review":"Although it's just a B&D; product, this mill looks like they used pininfarina for the aesthetics. However, like many fine examples of Italian engineering this mill looks great and that is where the positive features end.Awkward and frustrating to use, the button must be held down, it blows coffee dust everywhere, it grinds inconsistently and clogs with even slightly oily beans. The receptacle is small, has a cheap and frustrating lid system and is made from a kind of plastic that coffee loves to stick to.Attractive form and nearly useless function. Much too frustrating to use before you've had your morning coffee!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad all around","review":"This grinder is just a bad product all around, except for its looks. The grinder is slow; the receptacle slips off its base and has to be simultaneously held in while holding down the side activation button; the coarseness indicator wheel is unreliable; grinder creates excess dust; narrow delivery chute requires cleaning and inspection much too often; receptacle's flimsy cover falls off easily and spillage is way more common than with any other grinder I have ever used; grinder requires constant agitation or tapping in order to get beans to feed into burrs at constant rate. Even at $25, the hassles of a regular, slow dusty mess every morning make this a DO NOT BUY.I have had other Black and Decker home repair products that worked great, but this little number is a bad egg."},{"rating":"1","title":"useless for espresso grind","review":"I could almost kick myself for not reading reviews before I shopped. I figured it might suit someone who just wanted a regular grind for an automatic drip or something. Apparently, it is just as bad at that. So, I got a cheap coffee grinder and I would still like to have a coffee grinder that actually works. I should have taken it back, but by the time I faced that truth I had lost the box and receipt."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible, just Terrible!","review":"I just have to add my review even thought it is a repeat of so many others. Here is a great, longer review that sounds exactly like the problems we've had:http://www.amazon.com/review/R19H8C1S856T69/ref=cm_cr_rdp_permFor the first month we had this (got it as a gift so at least it was free) it worked \\"ok.\\" It creates a huge mess, though, and you spend as much time cleaning coffee grounds up off the counter as you do grinding coffee.After a month, though, it started smoking. This was the first time we ran into the grinder clogging up. It was so clogged that the grounds were a think, molasses type of mess. There's no easy way to get in to the bottom of the grinder to clean it up, but we managed after some struggle and mess. The very next use - it was all gummed and jammed up again! This thing is not easy to clean, does not work well, and has been very frustrating. Save your money and buy something else."},{"rating":"1","title":"Noisy & Hard to use","review":"Come on Black & Decker, you can do better than this!? For as much noise that this thing makes, I'm surprised that the police haven't been at my door for disturbing the peace. They could have at least put an \\"on - off switch\\" on it that would stay on instead of having to hold it on for 5 minutes while this thing tries to grind coffee. If you want fine ground coffee, plan ahead, because you are going to be standing there holding the button on for some time. Make it a weekend project. I think that Black & Decker should have their design crew jailed on this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"I give it a zero stars/ one star is too generous.","review":"Life is too short to own a gadget that causes so much aggravation (especially when you're uncaffeinated) and have to work so hard to make the beans grind properly.The directions never say what that release valve is for in the well where you put the whole beans! What is that for?As others have said it grinds too coarse (with whole pieces left in the grinds) or to a disgusting dust that flies away all over the kitchen when you open it.All I wanted was a nice med-fine grind for a cup of drip coffee and this mill will not provide it for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Irritating Machine","review":"Looks okay. No real problems with Grinding (maybe there are betters out there? I never thought about it). I CAN'T STAND THE GRINDING BUTTON! You have to continuously hold down the button to grind. After using it for about 4 months now, I've had enough. It's a waste of time to stand there for 5 minutes holding the button down while it grinds. It started as a minor irritation, but has culminated to the point where here I am shopping for a new one on Amazon. Don't buy this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Useless for espresso","review":"This grinder looks nice for a low price, but it won't grind coffee fine enough for espresso. Plus, you have to hold the button down the entire time it's grinding."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good for the money","review":"I usually bought my coffer already ground because I didn't want the hassle of grinding it and cleaning up, but found I could save some money buying whole beans at Costco. So, I looked for a burr grinder and found the Kitchen Aid one for about $140. That seemed a little rich, so thought I would take a chance on this guy for $25 at Target. So far, I've been pleased. Contrary to the other posts, I found it grinds plenty fine enough for espresso, although I do agree the grounds are not uniform. One thing that really annoys me though is that it does not have an on/off switch where you can turn it on and walk away. Instead, there is a toggle switch that you need to hold down for the duration. Grinding at the finest setting takes quite awhile and it's a bit of a hassle to stand there holding the button for 1-2 minutes. This may be a safety feature, but I wish it were different. Overall, I think it's an acceptable product for the money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worthless. Avoid at all costs.","review":"Grinds are so coarse you could do better with a knife and cutting board. Fine grains shown on box are impossible to reproduce at home with this unit.Strangely, mine ground whole beans at a fairly decent medium-grain size when it first came out of the box, but the minute I adjusted the coarseness, all bets were off. From here, no matter what I did it spit out nearly-whole beans and nothing even resembling coffee grounds worthy of a drip coffee maker. I cleaned and adjusted thinking that there was no way that the out-of-the-box performance I first saw was a fluke, but it obviously was.Design of how the grounds are accessed is great (as opposed to many Cuisinarts that force you to flip over the entire unit and fight gravity), however the grinding mechanism is just terrible. Oh and the static problem many others have mentioned is a very noticeable nuisance.Bought it yesterday, will be returning it today. Back to the drawing board!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Just stopped working","review":"* used for French Press - the button pressing thing - blows!* Only lasted 2 years.* Not worth $40 or even the $20 it is selling at now.I enjoy french pressed coffee. This did well enough for that. Was reading the other comments about it doesn't grind well enough for espresso - very true. But for me... I do not require the grounds that fine. It worked for a while (2Yr) and then it just stopped working this morning. This is my way of venting. I need my effing coffee. For $40 bucks would have expected a longer life out of this product. Meh. Looks like I will have to resort to Barstucks today - BURNT SWILL I TELL YOU!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Oily beans killed my unit!","review":"I got 3 good years out of this grinder, but there are more minuses than positives. It is consistent, easy to use and very inexpensive compared to many others. The immediate downside for me is that you have to hold the power button on; very noisy compared to others; and this unit is easily killed by fresh, oily beans. I have ground dozens of batches of inexpensive, store-bought beans with no problems. I did 3 batches of freshly, French roasted beans and the unit died. Cleaning & rescue proved to be too difficult to justify more hours, so it is headed for the junk pile! I have had a DeLonghi unit that's much easier to use and is twice as old and a smaller foot print, but i will have to beg to get it back. Using a blade grinder on the oily beans is my only choice now. Actually, I use a French press for brewing and a blade grinder is sufficient, imho."},{"rating":"1","title":"All heat","review":"The product is all heat with not offsetting taste.

They were often about folks who were frightened, disappointed, confused, lonely and sad. Being all these things when I was a lad, these songs spoke to me and I really enjoyed them and Mr. Chapin. In a fit of nostalgia I got ahold of this cd and was sorely disappointed.His lyrics are usually prolix, unfelicitous, stilted, and forced things that poorly serve the maudlin tales he wants to tell us. One of the worst is Mr. Tanner, the tale of a man who lives for his singing, but quits when someone says something mean to him. I sure do feel sorry for him, but not in the way that Chapin wants me to. I'd expect this sort of thing from a teenager, but not from a grown man -- Harry or Mr. Tanner. Aside from \\"Cat's in the Cradle\\" and \\"Circle,\\" most of his songs are dreadful.The music is ok at best, as is the singing.I liked the spoken tracks best, because these show Harry Chapin as the good man he was and his commitment to doing good things."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely Excellent","review":"This is some of Harry Chapin's best work.

For a reviewer to condemn this title by Mr Rodgers as \\"garbage\\" is inaccurate, crude and lazy. If anyone has a legitimate analysis or criticism of the book by all means voice it, but why give a forum to a damaging and unfounded attack that is not developed, explained or justified?

These are certainly not original messages, but Komisar weaves the message with a fictional story of two people looking to raise money from Venture Capital to start a business and also his own personal stories.

The founders in my company were once asked by a top VC why they started a company? The answer was to make a lot of money. I never liked the answer then and after reading this book I'm sure that VCs don't like it either. There is, there must be, something more than money. If you're not in it for the long haul then you're not likely to succeed. Having drive is great, but it only takes you so far. Do you have a passion for your business?

Rather it is a good look at how to think about the relationship between life and work, passion and profits.Definately worth the time, gives you pause to think, and has a message without being preachy or egotistical."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome!","review":"This is one of the best books I've read in quite a long time. If you're looking to be entertained while gaining invaluable knowledge about life in general and the dotcom world in particular, this is the book for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"I'll sum it up in one paragraph","review":"You can't be happy in life, being an entrepreneur, unless you find a way to find meaning into you business. Venture Capital, post \\"the bust\\", is very hard to come by; finding meaning in your business will be a key component in providing you with the drive necessary to overcome the many obstacles inherent with owning your own business. VC's know this and want to see it when your giving your spiel before they fork over the cash. There you go; save your money. Define it and use it as your central drive in life and business. I was a little duped into buying the book. Babson College requires it for one of their entrepreneurship classes. What's with professors making you buy books that tell you what they (the professors) can tell you in just one paragraph?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Waiting for Something More","review":"This is probably one of the worst books I've ever finished. The first story of Randy and the Monk was interesting, and seemed to foreshadow something zen-like and remarkable to come, but it never arrived. After all the book is entitled the Monk and the Riddle; a title which connotes something profound, something very important. I guess the riddle to me is why I finished reading it if I thought it was such a terrible book.The writing style is accessible, and the themes seem to flow well. Despite that, I just couldn't find myself caring about the narrator, or the man he's supposed to mentor in the story. The whole message of the book simmers down to do what you'll love to do for your business, and you'll find a way to succeed. Certainly good advice, but the author didn't need 200 or so pages to make that point."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must read for the 30 and over entrepreneur wannabes","review":"I do not think the views by Komisar will/can be shared with by the younger entrepreneur wannabes. I am in my mid 30s and am in the midst of growing a high tech start-up. I can appreciate the very essense of this book in the spirit of Komisar."},{"rating":"1","title":"Badly written, Boring & Little (or no) value","review":"Randy tries to present an old concept in an old way. There are tons of books that tell you to do what you feel passionate about, how to succeed in investing and how to love life.Randy fails miserably in delivering his story that is a mix of all of the above.With less than 200 pages and big font, there's not much space to say in the book.Randy, get a lesson on collecting thoughts before you write a book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Narcissistic Zen Drivel","review":"This book is intended as a mix Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance and Who Moved My Cheese. However, it does not work. The author seems in love with himself and his self-discovery that the world of Silicon Valley should mean more than just money. But the author's own experiences belie that. When did the author come to these self-discoveries about \\"the journey being more important than the destination\\"? Probably after he made his own millions. He never tells the readers that. Give us all a break."},{"rating":"1","title":"I just don't see the lessons...","review":"...that were supposed to be set forth in this book. The author talks about not puruing the money, yet at every turn the detail lies in his material possesions and his ability to travel to exotic places. Are we really to believe that Lenny changed his heart in a week? No, he just figured out a better way to get his capital.This book was not inspiring in the least, as they say, actions speak louder than words."},{"rating":"2","title":"What's the answer to the riddle?","review":"Komisar's personal interests in Buddhist monasteries has led to his encounter with the monk, and hence the riddle. This book has given me a different perspective in being an entrepreneur. Many a times, we hear of people who wants to start a business to make heaps of money (if you have one of such ventures, i want in). There are some who wish to change the world. Whatever the cause may be, the book has made me realised, that the journey has got to be the most excited part it all. During the ride, we learn about issues and also re-discover ourselves. However, no one says the road is going to be easy. But if you are looking for a how-to book, this is not the one for you. And, by the way, you won't find the answer in the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Deferred Life Plan","review":"Most of the reviewers of this book seem to be looking at it more as a \\"how to\\" than it is necessarily intended to be. I think this is a useful read for anyone who wants to look at why they are making career choices that they are making and evaluating what's really important in life. If you look to \\"The Monk\\" to provide you with a blueprint for starting up a dot com, forget it. If you want to remind yourself what you want your journey to look like, check this out."},{"rating":"2","title":"Muy lindo","review":"I did not know that Linda Ronstadt was Hispanic until I heard this CD. Her papa was definitely a Mariachi, it shows in her singing. I like his Spanish CDs better than her English ones.I am so glad that I found this CD. I hope that she continues to do more songs in the Mariachi style. I'm glad that she was able to go back to her ethnic roots. This is a wonderful, beautiful CD."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mediocre","review":"Kudos for her as an artist to make a difficult cross-over from Pop to Mariachi. However, the arrangements aren't innovative, she chose some questionable songs, as a singer she lacks good phrasing in Spanish,and her voice is monotonous (her voice has only one color, and she doesn't present us with meaningful volume contrasts)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Canciones de Mi Padre","review":"I was very disappointed in the 2 CD's I bought. Linda is in the background, her songs are muffled and words cannot be heard. In the foreground is a loud guitar which overtrumps the whole music.

What a disappointment."},{"rating":"2","title":"easy","review":"The process was easy. The product was as advertised. And the seller was prompt. All in all a great transaction."},{"rating":"2","title":"canciones de me padre","review":"Ms. Ronstadt is sensational throughout the CD!!

I really was disappointed and not likely to buy for your serve again,"},{"rating":"2","title":"Passionate music","review":"Songs of pain and reflection, with a pure clear voice that's a joy to experience. Ronstadt pays excellent tribute to the world of Mexican music. Ronstadt was considered one of the world's best singers in the authoritative book ''Billboard Guide to Tejano and regional Mexican Music,'' and this CD is proof of that. Great stuff, highly addictive."},{"rating":"2","title":"A real surprise!","review":"I was prepared to put up with the material to hear Linda Ronstadt engage yet another musical genre; I was not prepared to admire it so much. The songs reflect a culrure of heightened romance, braggadacio, machismo, drunkenness, and the drama of love. The almost operatic quality of some of the more dramatic vocal lines is enough to make your hair stand on end. If anyone doubted Ronstadt's vocal facility, the sheer power of \\"La Cigarra\\" should quell all doubts. But there is subtlety here, too, and lovely sweet songs delivered in a coy style appropriate to the lyrics. The recording is very crisp and live; your neighbors may think you're having a party with a mariachi band!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful !!","review":"This is THE BEST!

Everything sticks in the spring. I've tried many times to use it on different items and still have a difficult time cleaning it out."},{"rating":"1","title":"Indie folk-pop","review":"Unfortunately, compared to Crowd, Barbarians sounds like a group of songs recorded quickly, before their possibilities were fully explored and exploited. The songwriting is still there, but the extra care and refinement that made Crowd so rewarding has been replaced by a more one-dimensional sound: changing electric guitars, fewer counter melodies, harmonies that teeter, and simpler, more staid rock arrangements."},{"rating":"1","title":"Crushingly Boring","review":"Old worn-out sound. Waste of money. As another critic wrote, the montage of word and motif for the album cover is Un-American. Very '60s and British sounding. Buy it for your Mum."},{"rating":"2","title":"Epson Paper","review":"I use the standard size Epson luster paper ALL the time and I have no problems whatsoever with it. However, when I decided to print larger images for a gallery on the A3 size I found it challenging.I'm not sure how or why, but the paper seems to be more sensitive. Even with gloves on and keeping the paper pressed flat, random little bends and scratches would appear all over some of my images -- particularly the black and white ones, and even after multiple prints.I'd use this paper again for color images, but be weary for black and white ones. I'm really hoping this isn't a continuing trend when I move up to the next size of paper, I'd hate to have to turn to printing companies."},{"rating":"1","title":"Epson Premium Luster Photo Paper","review":"It is great paper, but not for what I need it for. It would be great and is great for photographs, but I make my own prints from my art work and it is no good for that."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than the others","review":"We needed soft bibs that were still waterproof and absorbent. These still aren't perfect, but they are better than the other bibs we tried. They really do soak up a lot--our baby just spits up a lot. At some point, though, they soak through, and of course, stuff still runs down them too fast to be absorbed. Overall, I would definitely get these again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"My daughter has had to wear bibs all day everyday since about 4 or 5 months, (she is now 7 months) because she drools so much. I was very excited to see these bibs and the good reviews on them, and wanted solid colors........but turns out the waterproof core it has does not work. Her shirts were still getting wet after just a few hours. She does drool a lot, so maybe they'd be good for a light drooler, but now I'm gonna go back to Walmart and get the 10 pack of solid bibs with the plastic back for $10 since they should do the trick better..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good but not great","review":"These bibs definitely help prevent the drool and moisture from soaking through to baby's clothes but they do not stop it. It just takes longer than regular bibs. I'd purchase again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love!","review":"The perfect bib! Great for our 4 month old drooler, that requires a bib with every outfit! These are nice, waterproof, but not noisey! Tough to find great bibs that blend with outfits and don't have tacky sayings plastered all over them!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The BAD velcro","review":"These bibs have the BAD plastic velcro that tears up baby's skin and reeks havoc in the laundry. The colors of these terry bibs are nice, so it's a shame these aren't made with the soft baby friendly velcro I've found on many other bibs. I quickly stopped using these."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I really wanted to like these bibs. I was willing to get over the fact that they are quite thin and not completely waterproof since they are more eco-friendly, but then the velcro started irritating my baby's neck. I prefer Carter's bibs--they also use velcro, but it is not at all abrasive and the material is a little thicker. More expensive but I guess you get what you pay for! I would definitely not recommend these bibs!"},{"rating":"2","title":"exactly what I needed","review":"These bibs are perfect for my 6 month old. I wanted a waterproof bib but not one that was so full of plastic that it warped after washing/drying. These fit the bill. I actually ordered 2 more packages after this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good price for a big pack of very decent bibs","review":"My daughter is teething and drools A LOT. She easily goes through 2-3 bibs a day, and so we bought 2 of these packs. They do a good job of absorbing the drool and protecting her clothes (there's a thin layer of plastic between two layers of terry). If you are looking for a more \\"plush\\" thick and absorbent bib -- this is not it. But this does the job without feeling weighty on baby. I also like that the design is simple - solid color so it can really be worn with anything and won't get \\"boring.\\"Why 4 stars and not 5? It's not the best quality -- a couple have separated at the seams, revealing the inner plastic.Happy, otherwise, and would recommend."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good bibs!","review":"Very satisfied with these bibs. Nice colors and material is very soft. Velcro doesn't scratch my baby's neck at all, as other reviewers have stated. Thinking about purchasing more!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great quality","review":"These were a value for the price and great quality. Very absorbent and soft for a drooling baby. Great buy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Value","review":"My liitle one was a big time drooler since she was 2 months old and would soak throught 4-5 bibs a day. The quantity of the bib for the cost was one of the best parts. They made it so we didn't have to wash as often.they also have really strong velcro closure which was a plus.My only complains were that they are a little thin and I wish they was more of a variety in the colors( we didn't need three yellow bibs).I would buy them again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome Waterproof Bibs","review":"I have a little drooler & have looked & tried allot of bibs, but these are the best. They have the waterproof fabric inside with terry cloth on both front & back. The terry cloth absorbs allot, I can leave these bibs on the longest out of all of our bibs. They are cute colors, have strudy velcro & clean up great. They are also a great price too."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not so waterproof . . .","review":"We bought these bibs for our daughter who is teething and drooling constantly. Maybe the factory forgot the \\"waterproof\\" layer in the set we got but waterproof they are not. I would not buy again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't do the trick","review":"My darling baby has severe acid reflux and spits up a lot. I've searched high and low for a bib that could hold up to her spit up power. I had hoped these would do the trick but I found them only slightly for useful than a regular bib. If you baby is a light to moderate spitter upper these might work, but for heavy duty spit up....these were of no use at all. Even out daycare asked us to find something better because these did not do the trick."},{"rating":"1","title":"One dollar more for \\"GIRLS\\" bibs?????","review":"They're fine bibs. Great. It's 2013. Why are the \\"boys\\" bibs $13.99, and the \\"girls\\" bibs one dollar more? You must be kidding me. Instead of paying the extra dollar OR the cheaper price for the \\"boys\\" bibs, I'll just buy them elsewhere, thanks."},{"rating":"2","title":"These bibs are a staple in our home!","review":"I LOVE THESE BIBS! They are a perfect fit for my daughter; they aren't too snug around the neck but they fit well enough that they cover her shirt completely. They are thin (I think this is a plus) and soft but have an inside liner that keeps the moisture from soaking to the back, keeping her shirt dry while achieving maximum absorbency. The girls pack of 10 bibs has a lot of great colors; I can always find one that matches her outfit. And that's important, because these bibs have become a constant fixture in our daily lives. I love them, and use them, so much that I bought the boys-color pack too! We've gotten all sorts of food on them and the stains always come out. They also hold up very well in the wash. These are WAY better than the average terry cloth bib. I definitely recommend them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Waterproof and Extremely Thin","review":"I was looking for bibs with the waterproof liner because my baby is a big drooler and she also spits up quite a bit. I was excited to find these bibs because there was a variety of colors that would match her outfits and keep them dry.The bibs are extremely thin! My baby drooled through one of the bibs in less than 3 hours. The whole thing was soaking wet, and it wet through to her clothes. To me, it does not seem as though there is a waterproof liner present at all.I gave these bibs 2 stars just because of the colors. Other than that, if you're looking for a true waterproof bib, these are NOT the ones to buy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good bibs, keep baby dry","review":"I was looking for soft bibs that would be absorbent and protect my daughter's clothes as she learns to use a sippy cup. These certainly do the job well. They wash very well, and haven't stained from any of her food spills. I was hoping these would be larger than her current bibs so she could grow into them, but they are the same size as the rest of her baby bibs. But, I like these enough that I will buy more in the larger size as she gets older."},{"rating":"1","title":"DO NOT BUY","review":"After only a few months, threads from the course part of the velcro have poked through the seems, causing minor cuts / scratches to our babies neck. We thought our daycare provider wasn't matching up the fastener properly and we discussed the minor cuts / scratches with them at length. Perplexed, we looked over the bibs carefully. These threads are transparent and cannot be seen; only felt and they are sharp! Of the 10 we have, 7 are like this. We are incredibly disappointed with the inferior product quality for a line meant for babies."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good price, but VERY thin","review":"I thought these bibs would be great for my daughter since I was looking for a value pack of solid colors. Unfortunately, they are incredibly thin. When I read that the boys' version of these bibs were thin, I STILL didn't imagine they would be as thin as they are.The only slight positive is that the size is okay for my 11-week-old daughter. I bought a value pack of solid color feeder bibs as well (different brand) and they are just too big for her right now.I would NOT recommend these."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great","review":"My daughter is 3 1/2 months and has been going through about 4 bibs today since 2 months (spit up and drool). Since she is so young the bibs I had before (a 12 pack from babies r us) seemed to dangle down so she would still spit up on her shirt. They also had no lining and would still soak through. They also did not wash well (wrinkled, folded up, got some holes)! I also had a few with a crunch plastic liner that were more for feeding and were huge! These are great! They are soft, and do not crinkle, but the middle section prevents it from going through to shirt. I have washed most twice and they have held up well. I also like that they are solid color and not all pink!!! I will for sure buy these again!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Telling everyone I know with teething babies!","review":"A friend bought a pack of these to make a gift for us. I kept washing the one bib gift as fast as it got dirty because I liked it. It's the right size for my 13 pound baby with room to grow. It's too thick that it's bulky when she's playing or harnessed into things like her car seat. The trim is thin so it fits well around her neck (her actual neck is non-existant at 3 months old...) I love the price for a 10 pack... so much better than Carter's etc. similar bibs. A ton of colors which I love. And they catch everything from spit up to the NONSTOP drool that comes along with teething. They're also long enough because our daughter likes to flip them up and chew on them a little. I wash AND dry them... Just be sure to fasten the velcro together before they go in the wash since it likes to catch everything. I bought both boys and girls colors for fun. Will likely buy more since we go through about 8 bibs a day with our drooly bebe! Highly recommend."},{"rating":"2","title":"In need of bibs?","review":"So we were in need of bibs so I ordered these. They do the job. I much much much prefer the bibs with the snaps instead of velcro, but they seem much harder to find and much more expensive. The baby cant pull it off like they can with velcro, but the velcro irritates the back of her neck.So they work, great price, and do the job I needed them to do, just wish I had better options for the same price."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love these","review":"My DD drools tons of saliva everyday, I have to change her several times at day but these really hold everything"},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth The Extra Money","review":"The riffs and vocal melodies are very cool and make every song memorable. They blend together metal with regular rock and even a little punk and they play their instruments very well. The singer is very dynamic and can do a lot with his voice, as he does most of the screaming and all of the singing. This is serious music unlike a lot of the popular music today, plus they can play live. They are extremely catchy without changing their sound to do so and are arguably the best British/Welsh band today. Buy this or at least the regular music only version and you will be impressed I promise."},{"rating":"2","title":"I have \\"The Poison\\" inside of me!","review":"Bullet for My Valentine is awesome!!!

This reads like a friend of a blind man giving play by play of a movie they're watching. \\"This happened.. okay now they're doing this.. still doing this..\\" There is little description added to liven what is basically the movie the script in prose.

I don't even want to see the movie now."},{"rating":"1","title":"Way too many battle scenes!","review":"I was excited about reading this book, but it ended up being very disappointing. The story got off to a good start, but ended up going nowhere. There were way too many battle scenes and not enought development of character or plot. You ended up not caring much about the characters because you hardly knew them! Overall, I think the story had a lot of potential, but ended up being shallow and basically only battle scenes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing.","review":"All right, I may be one of the few people that fell in love with this movie, but I liked it a lot, despite the fact that it wasn't historically accurate. I was very excited to read the book, but was sorely disappointed. I know a movie's novelization isn't supposed to be exactly like the movie persay, but this was very poorly written. I will give him props for developing Lancelot's character, but that was it. The author took Dagonet, for example, (who was my favorite character from the film) and changed him from a quiet, brave warrior into this dumb, brute-like brainless idiot. The book had a few spots where the dialogue was sweet in its way, mostly in the parts dealing with Lucan, but all in all this novelization wasn't worth reading, in my opinion."},{"rating":"2","title":"I Don't Care What People Say","review":"I don't care what people say, this is a good book. Yes, the battles were in detail, and I did kinda cringe at some parts, but nonetheless it deserves as many stars as I gave it. I am a big fan of the movie and pretty much believe that how they based it is the true man king Arthur was. So don't let other reviews stop you from this book... it's worth your time!"},{"rating":"2","title":"An excellent read","review":"Contrary to what some other people say, this book is pretty faithful to the film.

I have most of his books, and will no doubt continue buying them.This one, sad to say, did not please me.This is the true-crime version of a Dave Barry book, a collection of previously written columns / stories from the author's days as a reporter, in South Florida and in Los Angeles. The stories are all well written; footnotes bring us up to date (whenever possible) on what has transpired in each case in the 15 - 20 years since they first appeared in print.But Lord, is it dry! If I wanted to spend a few hours reading a newspaper, I'd buy the NYTimes.Part of the problem is that many chapters consist of multiple stories, written a few weeks / months / years apart. Each subsequent story had to reiterate the important facts, so there is a *lot* of repetition.I'm not sorry I read it; I just wish I had waited for the paperback."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your time and money!!!","review":"Wish I had read the reviews. I bought it on the strength of the other books by Micheal Connelly that I thoroughly enjoyed and was very disappointed. Newspaper articles rehashed over and over. I tried to finish it but it just couldn't hold my interest. First book I have put down before finishing in years!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Cold Leftovers","review":"I'm a big Michael Connelly fan, reading everything I can find that's written by him. I expected this to contain stories of his experiences and their impact on him. Instead it was just rehashed newspaper articles, including mind-numbing repetitions. It's like sorting through old, old newspaper clippings that belonged to a dead relative.It's pretty much a rip-off for Connelly fans. Maybe his boat was about to sink and he urgently needed money for the repairs. Maybe the transmission went out in his Porsche. Whatever the motive it was an easy way to make some quick cash without doing any work. Hit \\"Control C\\" & \\"Control V\\" a few hundred times and the book's finished.I'll continue to read his novels, but I won't be buying any more of his memoirs. If you want a memoir try Road Work by Mark (Blackhawk Down) Bowden.HRColey"},{"rating":"1","title":"Stale and awful ...","review":"Unfortunately this book is not what it could have been.It could have been a collection of Connelly's journalism with some reflections from the author tying the pieces to his creative process in writing crime fiction or his personal reflections on each piece from his current position as a talented writer of crime fiction. It wasn't. It was, instead, a recycled collection of newspaper clippings. The stories, once so current and maybe even flashy, are now pretty stale and shopworn - your basic crime beat writing with nothing really to set it apart from other crime beat writing aside from its author's eventual fame.Don't bother."},{"rating":"1","title":"News","review":"If you want to read of yore news read this book. So, many cases were solved and some others are cold cases, the question is: Where's the plot? Maybe is the story of why MC became a writer but this book is an out and out waste of time, paper and ink. Here you'll find no plot. No thrilling parts. You'll find nothing at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"crime beat","review":"I have read every book by Michael Connelly and enjoyed them all so I decided to buy the true crime book that he had written. I have to say that i was most disappointed with it and find it difficult to believe that the fictional books and this true crime book were written by one and the same person. There was too much repetition in each and every story and not at all what I would have expected from the author.Tom Ahern."},{"rating":"2","title":"A journey to the Authors career","review":"This anthology of crime cases in Florida and L.A. shows the base from which the author worked to assemble his great series of crime novels. He has a gift if remembering or creating detail that show in this non-fiction work"},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your money AND your time!","review":"love, love, love all michael connelly books except \\"closers\\" (weak) but gave up on this fast! it reads like a 7th grade report. did someone else ghostwrite all the good ones?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Shame on you","review":"I have read everything that Micheal Connelly has written and I thought this would be another great read. Boring and a waste of money. Ill be more selective in the future."},{"rating":"1","title":"Slow","review":"It is difficult to get through the endless details of the book.. I appreciate the subject matter but would like something that keeps me interest a little better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the time","review":"This is a compilation of newspaper articles of crimes. Very boring and repetitious. I was not able to finish it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sometimes a little effort would be nice...","review":"Like Scott Adams' constant rehashing of old Dilbert strips, Connelly tries to get away with one here and the only ones to suffer are his fans. Taking old stories from his newspaper and collecting them without any attempt to follow-up, discuss the cases from a new perspective, or at least try to add something to mix is disrespectful to the readers that support his fiction. The only thing that keeps it from a one star for me is at least the cases were interesting and he's a good reporter, but with a little effort this could have been something much better."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a Rip Off","review":"I have read every single Connelly book - and loved each one - and was really looking forward to this one.So what it is, essentially is a collection of old newspaper articles he wrote (along with others) from his Florida and Los Angeles crime reporter days. By old I mean 1984-92.Not only that, it's a reprint of a book published earlier in 2004!No reflective insight to speak of; dull, repetitive passages; stilted newspaper writing, uninteresting politics. Major bore.I can't believe he stooped to this as a means of squeezing a few bucks out of loyal fans. What a travesty."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's a fake book!","review":"Michael Connelly is truly a great author. This book is a disgrace. He has done nothing more than paste together his scrapbook of newspaper articles on crimes. Sadly, because the articles repeat each time all of the details of the crimes, the repitition will drive you nuts!Worse yet the articles aren't updated, so when he say that somnethiong occurs last year, but the article is dated 1991 he means 1990. The reader is totally misled. The book is a sham playing on his good name; now tarnished."},{"rating":"1","title":"Exremely repetitive","review":"I checked the audio book out from the library. Couldn't get through it. After the 3rd CD, I returned it. The same information is repeated over and over and over and over.....for a second I thought my CD player was repeating the same tracks. Incredibly dull and annoying to hear the same articles about the same cases again and again with the same information and descriptions. How this got passed the editors, I have no idea.Unless you want to be bored to tears, skip this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save Your Money and Your Time.","review":"The flap description had me intrigued, as I have loved to read all things Connelly. I expected more of an analysis of his experiences and how they formed his work. The \\"Telling high school yearbook caption\\" was simply a reprint of the caption. Not anything more, not more about who the person was, etc. This is literally a reprint of newspaper articles, and each one repeats much of what the previous handful on each subject had said. A disappointment. Move on."},{"rating":"1","title":"A HUGE Disappointment","review":"Mr. Connelly is a gifted writer, and I'm a big fan of his novels (I've read all of them). That being said, I have to express my disgust with this \\"book\\".I bought it because it was by Connelly, and was hoping for some background on his writing life and perhaps to see the development of the writer I've come to love.Sadly, it's nothing but a mishmash of disconnected stories, most of which aren't even interesting. I used to hold the opinion that even mediocre Connelly would be better than the best of most other authors, and I've been proven wrong.This book is a ripoff, cashing in on Connelly's name and reputation, and he and the publisher should both be ashamed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Read the dust jacket","review":"This is the collected journalism written by Mr. Connelly before he became a successful crime writer. Fans of Harry Bosch will love reading the articles; which serve as a primer on how the character developed and evolved. The collection describes the life of a homicide detective in great detail. It is not the life we see portrayed on Law and Order. If you're waiting for the next Harry Bosch novel, ECHO PARK, which will be published in October, don't buy this book. If you love Michael Connelly's writing then buy it. To say Mr. Connelly wrote this for the money is an insult to his integrity. This book was originally published as a limited-edition collectors item. His fans wanted the book published, and here it is. Kacey Kowars"},{"rating":"1","title":"What Happened to the Editor?","review":"I guess if there had been an editor it wouldn't have been long enough for a book. The intro is great and it just falls apart after that. Each chapter is several columns about the same subject very clumsily stuck together so it comes across as redundant. I made it about halfway through & gave up. What was he thinking? I think he can write but I'm not checking further."},{"rating":"1","title":"What was this supposed to be?","review":"I've read everything Michael Connelly has written. I'm a huge fan. What was this? Apparently all the news articles he wrote as a reporter organized by criminal into chapters. The result is unending repetition of the facts, as newspaper articles are wont to do. When you're reading one article a day, that's fine. But when you're reading the articles in succession, it definitely is not fine."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Cut & Paste Job","review":"I suppose that either there's such a demand for Michael Connelly's books (and justifiably so), or he had some sort of contractual deadline which required that he submit something to his publisher, but this is nothing but a cut-and-paste job consisting merely of a collection of his old newspaper reporting. I suppose this would be fine reading if you live someplace where newspapers are not available, but most of the material this book is no better than any other old news stories.What next? A collection of Michael Connelly's grocery lists?Obviously, this book is not worth reading, but if you've a taste for truly superb reporting about LA homicide detectives, the books to get areThe Killing SeasonandHomicide Special: A Year with the LAPD's Elite Detective Unitboth by Miles Corwin, a fine writer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great disappointment","review":"As a fan of the Harry Bosch series, I thought a nonfiction background would prove interesting. Like other reader-reviewers, and unlike professional book reviewers, I concur with the former. This is a rehash of newspaper articles without cohesion or explanation. Much more intriguing would have been pointing out how unusual points in a case might lead to a fictional account. In spite of my interest in crime stories, I grew bored, frustrated with repetition, and decided to quit reading well before the end of the book. I wonder why professional reviewers thought the book was so great?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible-what a disappointment","review":"I have read everything Michael Connelly has written and am always checking the book sections for news of his next novel; something I do with only 2 other authors. I usually wait a number of months at the library for his books and had just seen this in the Library news section, so I ordered it and got it in 2 days. It is nothing but newspaper clippings; 368 pages of them. I put the book down at page 67. Please bring back Harry Bosch."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your money","review":"Don't waste your hard-earned cash on this one, folks. If you are a true fan of Michael Connelly (and I am-every single book!), you will be sorely disappointed. I bought this book from behind the counter based on his fine reputation. Had I realized that it was a collection of news stories, restricted in column inches and imagination, it would not have been purchased. This is a mish-mash masquerading as relevant work. It is nothing more than his \\"string book\\" as a cub crime reporter two decades ago. His publisher must have pressured him for something fast, as this was poorly conceived. I couldn't even finish it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rip-off by Connelly and publisher","review":"I bought this book expecting a \\"riveting collection of true stories that inspired and informed his novels\\". Instead, only his introduction is new; for the rest, we get a re-print of some articles he wrote for the \\"LA Times\\" and the \\"South Florida Sun-Sentinel.\\" And nowhere is this mentioned on the cover or the back of the book.I felt cheated. If only he had used those old articles to put some new perspective on them and the way they've influenced his crime-novels.Instead, we get this (not cheap) rip-off, intended to provide Connelly and his publisher with a quick buck. Sad things is, I wished I could only blame the publisher (from them we can expect things like this) but that Connelly would go along with this... Shame on you, Connelly!So, people, DON'T BUY THIS! Limit yourself to his crime-novels! Those at least are a lot of bang for your buck."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unfortunately, A Vanity Project for Connelly","review":"Michael Connelly is probably the best crime writer out there, having written many classic novels such as THE CONCRETE BLONDE, THE POET, and BLOOD WORK. But this book is pretty much just a collection of old newspaper articles he wrote over 20 years ago. Many of the articles are repetitive, and Connelly has not bothered to edit or organize them a fashion to allow for a coherent narrative of any kind.If you're an admirer of Connelly's fiction, there's not very much here to enjoy. This is certainly not worth paying a hardback price for.Instead of this book, I would recommend two first-rate non-fiction books about how homicide detectives do their jobs in the Los Angeles: HOMICIDE SPECIAL and THE KILLING SEASON by LA Times reporter Miles Corwin."},{"rating":"1","title":"Skip It!","review":"This book is just a publishing company's way of milking the fans of a gifted writer. I am so glad I checked this book out at the library. Disappointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointment","review":"I have read nearly everything he has written. I cannot finish this book because it is so difficult to read and boring."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rehased Newspaper Columns","review":"The book is a collection of newspaper columns Connelly wrote while a reporter. While interesting, the book could have benefited from a good editor to eliminate repetitiveness and provide continuity between related columns. Lacking this, the book comes across as a lazy attempt to make money by gathering some old columns together and getting them reprinted as a book. Sloppy, tedious and not worth your money or your time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible Book","review":"Although Connelly is one of my favorite writers and I greatly enjoy his books, Crime Beat is a joke.It is not a novel. It is purely a listing of crimes. I can think of no reason for anyone that likes to read to be entertained to but it.Shame on you Michael for doing something like this to your readers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Reads like Connelly just bundled his old articles","review":"I have totally enjoyed every Michael Connelly book I've every read (and I think I've read them all)...until this came along. It reads like Connelly simply collected a bunch of his old newpaper reports and bundled them into a book...and I suspect without even editing them. Most everything is written in the present tense (e.g. \\"next Tuesday....\\") make me suspect he didn't even reread them.Very disappointing, especially from such a fine author."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I expected","review":"Wanting a book for a trip and not having much time I picked up this book trusting that I knew Michael Connelly's work. Needless to say, I was sorely disappointed. I guess it's \\"buyer beware\\" but this is not anything near what I expected. I read the first few pages and put it up on the bookshelf when I got home. Not only is it just a collection of stories he wrote about in the beginning of his career, they were previously published. Only leads me to believe it was a money making ploy based on his recent success. I'll think twice before I buy his next book."},{"rating":"1","title":"BORING!","review":"The stories picked for this book are not at all interesting. On top of that the stories consist of nothing more than newspaper articles. Each article is printed in it's entirety, which means each article rehashes the same information disclosed in previous articles. No thought at all by the author went into this project. One of very few books that I had to stop reading because it was a complete waste of time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lots of nothing","review":"I opened this book at the bookstore (found one!)and asked why they only had the large print edition. Ha, this is the only edition! About 280 pages of print you won't need your glasses for. This is disappointing. If the content is short, publish a short book. Great content can stand up to small size. This content can't."},{"rating":"1","title":"Huge waste of time and money","review":"An unbelievable collection of redundant, repetitive, uninteresting (often unresolved) case histories from the author's days as a crime reporter. You can skim read this \\"book\\" in a half hour tops. No more Michael Connelly for me thank you."},{"rating":"1","title":"garbage","review":"This is a complete waste of time. Mr. connelly should stick to his great novels and not con us with this junk!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible","review":"I have never felt more ripped off my a book than this one. It was boring and seemed to have little effort put into it. I onlly wish I could get my time and money back."},{"rating":"1","title":"No quality control","review":"My sets arrived with numerous imperfections in the glazing. This is 99cent store sloppyness. I suspect that Pfaltzgraff has dumped low quality product on amazon and that earlier versions of these pieces may be better quality. One dinner plate actually has a knick in the the rim with glaze over it. I would never invest in anything by this company again. BUYER BEWARE."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy these dishes!","review":"I've had these dishes now for about 5 years and regret the day I purchased them.

Only 5 out of the 20 pieces manages to survive each time. It was very obvious upon arrival that the item could have been packaged better. I was not refunded my money or given any sort of store credit. I'm completely dissatisfied with this companys service.

I used it for three days before removing it from the closet and replacing it with wall hung shelving."},{"rating":"2","title":"For the price it is perfect","review":"It was a little burdensome putting it together, but not too bad. It is perfect for normal shoes, but I don't know if the girls would like it for their shoes. Your shoes sit on two 3/8 Diameter Rods so not enough surface for heels. If you are renting a place and don't care about the looks of your shoe organizer then buy this. All in all it is the best buy for holding 20 pair of shoes in a small closet."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'm glad I know how to jerry rig!!","review":"For 40.00 bucks I would expect alot better of any product, but alas that is NOT the case with my new shoe rack. I should have know something was up when I saw the directions tell me to \\"hammer\\" together this product. As soon as you finished hammering the first side and started hammering the second side the first side pops out. After an hour and a half I just gave up. Good thing my mom taught me how to jerry rig because I will be buying a bottle of monkey glue later on this week and put up this highly expensive and greatly aggravating shoe rack. Please understand that it's not the 40 bucks that upsets me, but the 40 bucks on a product I can't use. :o( I will be very leary of this company or should I say this \\"hustler\\" from now on."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unstable rack","review":"Although the shoe rack fits the space I had for it well and serves it's purpose, it is poorly made and doesn't hold together very well. The poles are hard to fit into the plastic end-pieces and often fall out, causing one or more shelves to collapse. I ended up duct-taping all the poles into their sockets, which helped some, but if any one slips out the whole thing will come apart. You also have to really pound the poles into the end-pieces to get them to be equal lengths, or the whole shelf wobbles. If you want a quick, cheap shoe solution, this probably will work, but you'll have to keep putting it back together and it won't last very long."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not quite sure what to think...","review":"This shoe rack is a good size, where it fits inside my front entrance closet nicely to hide all our shoes. The downside is you hammer the pieces together without screws or glue, so the bars fall out easily. Not as secure as I had hoped. Holds a decent amount of shoes, not sure if you can get 30 pairs of adult shoes...but for now its helping me stay organzed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Buy IT!","review":"I have tried several times to put this thing together. It is basically some pipes with plastic ends. The pipes are suppose to fit in holes in the plastic ends but they don't. I almost got it completely together once (only one pipe left to fit) and when I picked it up, the whole thing fell apart."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"Easy\\" Assembly?
