I was absolutely blown away! The music quality is superb and the voices are crystal clear. I also enjoy the London cast album, but Rex Smith makes this album stand out. His voice is expressive and magical. I personally prefer Patti LuPone as Norma Desmond. Diahann Carroll gives Norma Desmond a wonderfully dramatic quality.

Rex Smith stars as Joe Gillis, the screen-writer she lures into her trap. Carroll's performance is unique; she is prone to sing-speak in places, but her husky style is compelling.

It also comes with an excellent optical image stabilizer that will greatly minimize camera shake working under low light conditions or when panning a fast-moving subject. I've seen elsewhere some splendid pictures taken with this great little digital camera. Those who may find its image quality inferior to other digital cameras probably took poorly exposed pictures, or were unable to use effectively its fine image stabilizer.

After the first day of my trip, I almost wanted to smash it against the wall! The photos (taken at ISO 200 or 400 due to a rainy day) were extremely noisy - it's like nothing I have ever seen. I am no expert but it's just unacceptable! (When I first bought this it was just released so there was hardly any review; since I returned from my trip, I've seen quite a few reviews about this noise problem. Wish I knew it before!)

Apparently this happened somehow in my pocket and the lens bent and stuck.When I pointed out to customer service that no other camera has a switch that extends like that - and seemingly for a very good reason - they were not moved.On another note this camera is HORRIBLE in low light photography. Additionally the colors and photos were always kind of harsh without the nuance and \\"wysiwyg\\" quality I got with my old Canon point and shoot.I HIGHLY recommend getting a Canon instead of this.

However, I was HORRIBLY mistaken!! This has got to be the longest most boring movie I've ever seen. I actually skipped over most of the rehersal dinner and stopped it half way through to finish later. I had hoped the second half would be more worth while, but was not. I would have to say this is the most off-the-wall wedding I've ever seen. I think someone just took a bunch of fun ideas and smashed them all into one confusing mess of a movie. Parts of the movie would be interesting as a SMALL part of another movie. Quite seriously though, who has \\"dancers\\" at their reception? I can't imagine anything like that ever happening in reality.Anyway, I guess over all this was a huge let down.

It is not a documentary, it's a drama. It only distracts from the narrative.2) The small group dialogues were \\"actor's improvs\\". And not very good ones. It felt like watching an acting exercise.3)The wedding music scene that would not end. Ok, the world is full of a plethora of musical styles, but all at one wedding?! This scene went on far too long. And why is Robyn Hitchcock, (90's, quirky, alt. artist) performing at this wedding reception? Ah, friend of Demme's I presume.4)Anne Hathaway may be the, \\"It Girl\\", but she is not an actress. \\"Girl Interrupted\\" is a much better film dealing with recovery...and Wynona Ryder is much better at portraying the emotional ride.5)*The ONLY positive aspect of the film was the ordinary presentation of an interracial marriage, kudos for that."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tom","review":"Boring, Do not waste your money as I did as this movie is Boring.

Because we will all be more understanding of each others' foibles at movies' end? Or because Hollywood has its head so buried up its arse that observing the real world right now it just completely out of the question?Cinema always has been, and regrettably, always will be, the bankers' art form, which explains why the Hollywood dream machine has been pushing identity politic$ down our throats for going on 60 years now. Sorry Demme, but your edgy take on multiracial romantic pairings doesn't cut it; there is no reason to give a shit about these privileged characters and their over-the-top, implausible infighting... The only question worth asking is, who bankrolled this wedding, and who did they steal the money from to pay the florist?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Unwatchable","review":"Most of this movie consists of awkward wedding speeches, too-cute dialogue, annoying wedding guests, people who are way too happy, annoying minstrels randomly playing instruments and a memorably awful a capella version of Neil Young's Unknown Legend, which serves as the groom in the movie's vows.Avoid this movie at all costs. It is utterly a waste of time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money or time.","review":"This movie was so bad on every level. I was wishing everyone would overdose by the end. What a bunch of dreck and drivel. I can't believe this was an Oscar nominated movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your time and money","review":"A reviewer in The New Yorker lamented why this movie did not win an Oscar for the Best Picture of the year, even though Hathaway won one for the Best Actress. Reading that piqued my curiosity enough to watch this movie in Netflicks.What a mistake!, many of the reviewers here were right on the money; the movie is tedious, too long , and I am sure a tripod (or a steadicam) was never used in any of the scenes (and it shows). Some of the dialog was clever, witty and poignant- maybe a total of five lines in total-and all the scenes were way too long. Attending a dinner rehearsal such as this one would have put me to sleep in no time, the father was portrayed as a spineless doormat without anything to say, was always crying, however, the ones who truly shined through it all were the mother and Rachel. They were strong, in command, and they were well aware how dysfunctional this family truly was. Don't bother with this \\"feel good-poor Kym\\" movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"boring","review":"long, boring, depressing, and not worth time to watch. i had to as it had been a gift that i was going to be asked about!"},{"rating":"1","title":"2 stars to be generous","review":"The acting was great, but nothing extraordinary. I thought debra winger was the best of the bunch. i thought plenty of other actresses could've played Kim and done just as good if not better of a job than anne hathaway. the heavy black eye liner was a nice touch :) the most interesting thing about this movie is the suggestion that kim is not really the one at fault for her brother's death. i love that we don't know but it is only suggested during the exchange between kim and her mom before the wedding. overall, not a movie id recommend. did i absolutely hate it? no."},{"rating":"1","title":"So boring I couldn't get through it","review":"I'm afraid I can't give an in depth review for this movie because I couldn't stay interested long enough to keep watching it - still, that in itself is a very clear review in a way. I tried to get through the whole thing, I wanted to like the movie, I'm open minded to various kinds of movie experiences, but honestly this movie bored me to death. Apologies to those who liked it."},{"rating":"1","title":"The worst!","review":"This movie was awful. I watched 40 min of it and then shut it off. The whole idea of anne hathaway coming home and being thrown into this huge family event was promising. But it failed miserably. Why were all those people making toasts at the rehearsal dinner? Hathaway's went on and on bringly and then other people got up said stuff. ENOUGH. The music and hoopla was annoying and the whole interracial thing just seemed odd and forced.I saw Vicky Christina Barcelona the other night and wondered how Cruz could've won for best supporting actress because she was hardly in the movie that much. So when I sat down to watch Rachel Getting Married I was sure that perhaps Hathaway was robbed of the Oscar. Well, definitely NOT after watching this train wreck!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Addiction Sucks","review":"This is an excellent film about dealing with the repercussions from being an addict. The need for family is strong, and the need for love is there, but first you have to clean up your mess. Anyone interested in what its like for an addict and their family, this is a great example of such conflicts. And with that it is a well acted movie. Anne Hathaway was excellent, as well as the rest of the actors."},{"rating":"2","title":"I was sorry to see it end","review":"Director Jonathan Demme nails the pain of the dysfunctional family, taking you into the depth of it. Hand-held camera weaves us through the events surrounding Rachel's wedding, a colorful, homey extravaganza. The couple itself is colorful, Rachel's white to Sydney's black. The wedding theme is East Indian, with saris, ragas, belly dancers, and a blue elephant cake. But central to the celebration is that Rachel's sister Kym gets out of rehab to attend the event. If you know rehab, you know the main thing is to avoid triggers that might rekindle your dependency on alcohol, drugs, sex, you name it. High on Kym's trigger list are home and family, and here she is in the thick of both. In lesser hands, this might have turned into soap opera, but the script, direction and acting are excellent. I was sorry when the film ended."},{"rating":"1","title":"I wouldn't buy it","review":"The movie was not bad, but it was not too either. It was pretty boring to watch. There was no interesting scenery or anything. The story plot was good, but it was not executed in any way that would keep most people's attention. Some scenes were interesting, but not enough to make the movie watchable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Didn't you get it?","review":"To those who gave this movie a score of 1 through 3--you just didn't understand the depth of the movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"seriously?","review":"I'll go ahead and echo the sentiments of the previous 62 reviewers who gave this movie 1 star. Truly this movie is one of the very worst I've ever seen: painfully boring, completely unbelievable, and so overly-dramatic it's just excrutiating to watch. It is simply a series of one drawn-out cliche after another. If you are considering watching or purchasing this movie, don't."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible","review":"I can't remember seeing a movie as bad as this. The quality of the picture and the editing was almost amateurish. Can't believe the Oscars and Golden Globes even considered this for an award.

This is a film that marries a love of music with the power of family redemption without any contrived sentimental Hollywood endings. Messy, explosive, poignant and wonderfully open."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hugely Disappointing","review":"From the excellent reviews and decent movie commercial I was expecting something magnificent....but I got possibly the most dull and irritating movie I have ever watched. To be honest I didn't even watch the last half hour..maybe it got better,though I doubt it. This movie nevertheless does have great actors who perform well - but the characters they are playing are so utterly boring and pretentious that it just became an unbearable viewing experience. Treat with caution."},{"rating":"1","title":"Could not be worse.","review":"This movie is completely insufferable. The characters are ridiculous, loathesome and self-absorbed. The tedious dialogue is droning on as I type this. The scenes --including an incredibly bizarre skit about loading a dishwasher -- go on for far too long. This is truly the worst movie I have ever seen. I am actually angry and bewildered that I just suffered through an hour and a half of it. Somebody help me. Just when you think this two-hour cringe can't possibly get any worse, it does. Oh my lord--they are now, inexplicably, making me watch Anne Hathaway shave her armpit. Every scene should have been left on the cutting room floor. I simply can't believe this story even became a movie. This film should never have been made."},{"rating":"1","title":"Big Mess","review":"Where did I get the idea that this was a good movie? I was expecting another family wedding story with maybe a little humor amidst the angst but I guess I should have known better just by looking at Anne Hathaway. She looked like a refugee from a bad acid trip and was just about as appealing. In fact, by the time I struggled through this conglomeration of unattractive characters of the rainbow coalition, melodramatic plot, dreadful and constant wailing, whining music and boringly Bohemian touches, I was ready to gag. The wedding party (pre, post and during)scenes went on forever and the speeches were excrutiatingly boring, as were the people giving them. This is a dismal film.

The whole cross-cultural music, family and friends scene feels forged and pretentious. If you are in the no pain, no gain school of \\"film\\" watching, go ahead. Otherwise, rent and fast forward through the cornucopia of music and meandering toasts. Too many actors have to \\"prove\\" they can act by playing a damaged character - now that Anne Hathaway has paid her dues, she can move on. So should you."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Stinker.","review":"Despite the fine acting by Ann Hathaway, Jonathan Demme manages to destroy this movie ( I cannot bring myself to call it a film ) with his sad moviemaker's indulgence towards his characters and his story. His attempts to manipulate the viewer are laughably transparent and fall flat. There is a scene with the family watching a character load the dishwasher that is about as bad as a scene can be. What was Demme smoking when he made this? Bleech."},{"rating":"1","title":"Anne Hathaway is wonderful, Rachel Getting Married is horrible","review":"One of the films I was the most looking forward to seeing this past year, was \\"Rachel Getting Married\\". From the wonderful reviews, I couldn't wait to see it. And to my surprise it turned out to be a real turkey. Anne Hathaway is far and away the best thing about this film. It is a very slow moving film, that lacks a clear sense of direction."},{"rating":"1","title":"I wanted to shoot myself.","review":"This movie started off with promise, but quickly crashed and burned. If Bush was in office they would be showing this down in Guantanamo bay as the new form of torture. I would admit to anything to get out of watching that.

Wait for it to come out on cable, if you turn it off it cost you nothing if you like it great."},{"rating":"1","title":"GIVE ME MY 2 HOURS BACK!","review":"Since I can't have my 2 hours back, I must tell you to avoid this movie at all costs. It is a dreadfully directed (I know Demme is a respected diretor) tale of past family troubles that rear full force during a wedding. No matter how good Hathaway's performace was, the rest of the movie just made me want to shut off the DVD. I cannot believe that at pre-screening this movie by all involved, that someone didn't say \\"maybe we should cut out the - just shut up already speeches, pointless dancing sequences, more boring toasts and poems\\" to allow more time to dig deeper into the family problems. Seriously it was about 10% acting and 90% useless material. I HATED THIS MOVIE!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Movie Ever","review":"Please don't ever consider watching this movie.

This is an agonizing, interminable chick flick in which characters do little more than sit around and emote, shout, and process their emotions. Imagine visiting casual acquaintances and being trapped in the house with them for days while they fought and wept over a lifetime's worth of angst. That's what watching this movie is like. Some interesting camera work and fine performances can begin to make up for the debacle of the story.Here's a chick-flick moment from the film: When Rachel gets married, her affianced sings his vows!

Disappointment does not begin to describe it. This film was awful. Everything about the direction and the horrible camera angles is true. It was literally a pain to watch. As also brought out, I could not even keep up with how many cultures they were trying to convey. As for the storyline, there was little sympathy at all for Anne's character in spite of being so infused with personal guilt and pain she could have drained infection from her mouth with each word.

Everyone around her is so concerned with being totally groovy that the atmosphere reeks of falseness. It reminds me of The House of Mirth, different social prisons for different eras. And despite the unwavering allegiance to social norms, in this case, total hipness, no one will take real responsibility for one another. Kym is right, it is outrageous that she was left in charge of her brother, and she herself should have had the sense not to drive.

The acting here is top notch, the writing is wonderful. its funny at times, and gut wrenchingly honest and hartbreaking at others. Wonderful!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretentious","review":"This tries to be Cinema Verite, but It's not believable. So many of the emotional reactions are implausible and melodramatic: Rachel's hysterical reaction to Kym's dinner toast, Dad's nearly operatic reaction to seeing Ethan's plate, Rachel storming out of the beauty salon, Kym demanding to be maid of honor, etc. These are drama queens on steroids. It's annoying - not entertaining.As for the wedding, it has a constant aura of putting on airs. Look how untraditional, creative and supportive we are. Could we have at least one of the characters acknowledge how different this wedding is, rather than everyone acting like it's the most normal thing in the world? The film doesn't need to apologize for it, but it shouldn't pretend either. In trying too hard not to appear self-consciously eccentric, it comes off as false. And did it occur to anyone to ask how such a neurotic family could produce such a utopian wedding?I will say that Debra Winger is perfect in her small role."},{"rating":"2","title":"There's no accounting for taste.","review":"I was moved to tears by this sensitively observed, impeccably acted, unpredictable family drama. Demme's handheld digital camera suggested the intimacy of a home video. I spent time with this family, felt a part of the events, both traumatic and jubilant. Moments of raw anguish gave way to passages of nigh-unbearable embarrassment, which in turn metamorphosed into sequences of serene beauty and tenderness. A very true film. A very good film."},{"rating":"2","title":"Anne Hathaway Delivers a Stand-Out Performance","review":"First, I want to start this off by saying that this film is not for everyone. It's definitely not a mainstream film that will appeal to the mass audiences. However, if you're one who is into character driven films then this one is for you. Anne Hathaway gives the best performance of her career. She fully embraces not playing the normal pretty girl roles that she is usually offered, instead she portrays Kym, a troubled woman who leaves rehab to attend her sister's wedding.The film is shot in an almost documentary-style way which gives it a very raw look. I loved the film and the performances and applaud the cast and crew for this original film.Anne Hathaway proves she is more than just another pretty actress, I see a long career for her and while she didn't get an Oscar for this role, there's no doubt in my mind that she'll eventually bring an Academy Award home."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst movie of the year.. wow , disappointment","review":"boring movie, and absolutely terrible to watch. waste of money and time.

Hathaway proves she's more than a pretty face, she definitely deserved to be nominated for an Oscar for her fearless performance. Hathaway plays Kym, a drug-addicted model who returns home from a 9-month stay in rehab to attend her sister's wedding. Along the way, the truth of Kym's past is revealed as she must face the pain she has caused her emotionally distant family.

This well-acted but disturbing film was difficult to watch at times. It isan honest portrayal of a family dealing with unresolved issues, feelings and unspoken words as a result of addiction, that finally bubbles up at what is meant to be a joyful event. I think I would have liked to have known more of the back story and learned a little more about the characters, particularly Debra Winger's role as the mother. In so many stories, we always see the mother as the one trying to \\"make it all better\\". Here we see the father taking on that role.

I can't imagine Anne Hathaway, as good as she is, saw much potential in any anticipated amount of entertainment value in this final product.This is by far, one of the worst films I've seen in quite some time. One just might come away with the feeling that the director had some general mind set of a forced multi cultural indoctrination as being typical.

Home movie usually lasts 5-10 minutes and the jerking is acceptable. A motion picture like this lasts over an hour. The constant jerking, fast pan & scan, zooming too close, etc. makes me feel nauseous.A good director tells a story thru the movie. You do not need any camera tricks. Those jerking around becomes a major distraction.One way to watch this movie is to close your eyes occassionally and just listen to the dialogue... won't miss much.Too bad with such a strong cast and good story line, what could have been a good movie was spoiled by poor camera trick."},{"rating":"1","title":"Only part of item shipped","review":"The CD is great, but no where, in the description, or in reviews, was there mention of an accompanying book.

Although the DVD gives you the option of \\"playing just the music\\" , you just don't get much.

And, most unfortunately, so many of the entries were expressions that only my grandfather remembers anymore that it was more or less irrelevant to me.

Then on page 73 there is a sample XML document containing Xlink:type=\\"arc\\". So, I'm left wondering, if there are two types of Xlinks, where did \\"arc\\" come from. The answer, of course, is that there are not only two possible values for Xlink:type, but you won't find that explained in this book.

I found the book surprising as the author is a South Carolinian and something of an apologist for the Confederacy, not something you see in most modern Civil War histories. The book is as much about his post Civil War political career as the governor of South Carolina as it is about his war time exploits, although those were considerable. The author is clearly no fan of the Reconstruction period either, but he does make a valient effort to make Hampton into something of a racial moderate, at least in comparison to his contemporaries. However, given South Carolina's troubled racial history since the Civil War, I found it hard to admire Hampton's success in overcoming the Yankee occupation."},{"rating":"1","title":"Neo-Confederate Retelling","review":"With respect to the other reviewers in this forum, I must disagree with their positive impressions of this book. Cisco's book is strictly for the neo-Confederate reader. True, Hampton is in real need of a biography--there are basically three: Manly Wade Wellman, Giant in Gray, 1949; Ed Longacre's, Gentleman and Soldier, 2003; and Cisco's version. The best of the lot, Longacre's, is war heavy, and the other two are biased to a Confederate view. Indeed, Cisco's book can not be taken seriously by academics or even serious students of history with such outlandish comments that, \\"During the war many Southern blacks stood by their country--the Confederate States\\" (p. 170) Or, that Hampton \\"treated slaves as individuals and fellow human beings.\\" (p. 41).This book is poorly written and ignores Hampton's role as a Redeemer and slaveowner.

Secondly the child does not have any way of easily seeing through the costume once it's all assembled.

The costume part has a thin piece of see-thru material that covers the mask and we couldn't get it to stay up over the mask. And, there are blow-up shoulder pads that are connected with 1/4\\" elastic that were too tight under the arms and too big across the shoulders. The costume is cute in the pictures and the idea of it is great, just didn't all go together as well once we got it home.

The Krays is one of the most poorly directed films I've ever seen in my life. The scenes are so stupid that each of them had so little meaning into it and has no connection to the next one. Is the movie supposed to be about the women? Or about the twins? It doesn't make any sense to me. Originally, I thought I was going to see a hard hitting gangster film in a cold blooded fashion, but no...it's just a lot of women talking with a gratuitous violent scene interspersed throughout it. The story portrayed on the film is very inaccurate and glossed over. So, it becomes pointless. There isn't even a structure to why the twins became feared gangsters in England either.

From what I gathered of the film, The Krays were twin brothers who were very competitive and violent. Their mother spent her time praising them, bringing them food, and encouraging them to aim high. One brother is a homosexual, the other hetero. The wife of the hetero goes insane when she loses herself in the job of being a gangster's wife. She could not take the scrutiny from others. It does not pay to be with gangsters. All the important women in the Krays' lives died. The Krays are totally into human torture to show their precedence over everyone else.

Is the author that kind of lady who becomes very frightened when she meets with an intelligent woman with a sharp tongue - because she clearly can't stand Jane Austen's sense of humor. And, on top of it all, she has not done a good work when it comes to the research.

The book basically closes with a frenzy of activity, bringing in new characters, new concepts, and new story threads with little continuity. Basically, David Brin, who spent a large amount of time building characters in the first two books, rushes to end his story. And it doesn't really end. I would have liked to known more about the fate of the missing Searcher people, and the fate of Jijo is obviously left for a whole new book. No real answer to the question of \\"Herbie\\". A lot of dangling threads for what was to be the concluding book of a six-book story."},{"rating":"1","title":"An unsatisfying conclusion to an unsatisfying trilogy","review":"A contrived, childish plot inflicted upon annoying, shallow characters. Filled with endless repetition, failed metaphors and similes, that beg the question \\"Did anyone bother editing this book prior to publishing it?\\". Where almost every chapter ends in a mini-cliffhanger, and the same patterns repeat over and over and over, but just get bigger and bigger and bigger, trying to fill the reader with wonder, but going way over the top, failing miserably.

It lacks the energy and immagination of Startide Rising, The Uplift War, Brightness Reef, and Infinity's Shore. Character development ceases. The plot could be summarized in ten words or less (although I won't do that here in case you want to find out for yourself). Little is learned about the adventures of Thomas Orley and the others marooned on Kithrup. They, you probably remember, were the protagonists on the original story, and by far the most interesting characters. A few mysteries are resolved, but overall, reader's learn little more about the universe introduced in those earlier books.I was impatient with Brin and wanted him to finish telling the tale, but I would have willingly waited several more years for a better book with a captivating conclusion."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not all the answers? Life is like that.","review":"I actually wrote to the author after finishing this book and asked \\"hey, how come you didn't tie up all the loose ends...and tell us what happened to of the charactors?\\". The reply I got back was facinating (and to me, satisfying). He basically said that the story arch was more important than the fate of the individual charactors and that in a story spread out over the Five Galaxies one might not expect to find out the fates of all charactors.This reminded me a bit of the Babylon-5 episode where the Vorlons bring back Jack The Ripper to test Delen...'would you save the world even if the world never knew that you had saved it'? or words to that effect.There is something heroic in our main charactors being lost...even as the story concludes."},{"rating":"1","title":"That was an ending?","review":"Endings usually entail finishing the plot. This book just wanders off at the end. No explanation for whatever happened to many of the main characters (e.g. Tom Orley), or what Herbie was really all about, just a lot of vague allusions to possibilities. As others have noted, the literary ploy where you: 1) end each chapter at a moment of crisis, 2) pick up the next chapter with other characters at some other place, and 3) then come back several chapters later to the first set of characters already past the crisis, is getting really old by this third book (or 6th, if you count the earlier books). The fact that Brin continues to do it over and over feels a little amateur-ish, like it's his only trick. It makes me crave some good Asimov or Herbert. It's unfortunate because Brin is generally a good and creative writer, with interesting ideas. But like many authors, the finished product on paper does not live up to the potential."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disappointing","review":"David Brin is one of today's leading science fiction writers.

I found it annoying that almost every chapter contains several paragraphs recapping what has happened in previous chapters. Sometimes a chapter recaps what has happened in the immediately preceding chapter. Give us readers some credit, Mr. Brin!As his past books demonstrate, Mr. Brin is a very talented writer, and I look forward to his next book.

If you want the whole story you have to read that one first. Heaven's Reach is a vast complex story that could possibly be the end of the Uplift series. I have heard that Mr. Brin is going to keep writing Uplift stories but he could end it on this one if he wanted to. This is the best book in the whole trilogy. It has action, intrigue, chase scenes, LOTS and LOTS of aliens, and more philosophy than you can shake a stick at. When I finished it I went back and read Startide Rising again after many years, and saw how much Mr. Brin has grown. He is much better at building a picture in your head. He is better at character development without spending pages on a characters personal history. He has learned how to write a page turner.

Heaven's reach is not a total failure in itself. It took me a while to understand why I was so disappointed when I finished the book. I can only agree with reviews who say the ending is Grand. But that's not the point. The real problem of the book is, the ending has nothing to do with the rest of the uplift novels. With what's in this book, Brin could have written (should have written) another uplift line. The book just does not belong there. Everything Brin has ENTITLED us to expect from the previous books just isn't there. I wanted to read more about all the wonderful characters who had been so well developed that they had become my friends and my foes.

He was a mass of contradictions and portraying him would be a real challenge for the actor chosen to play the role."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely Hilarious!!","review":"I just recently stumbled upon Ken Davis, and I'm so glad I did! He is without a doubt one of the best comedians I've heard in a long time. His appeal crosses all age groups, and is probably one of the few I can listen to with my kids and be comfortable. Ken has a unique way of looking at life, as most comedians do, and I challenge anyone to listen to him and not laugh. And while he's weaving his tale of humor, he intermingles a message about God's love for us. I highly recommend this audio tape to anyone and everyone.

Some of the images arrive with a bit of history or family lore. The book is divided into three parts: July 1, July 2, and July 3. The images are arranged into alphabetical order and display the soldiers name, rank, unit, age(some)and the final result of the individual)survived,killed,wounded or captured.) Most of the images show amazing detail and I enjoyed studying the uniforms, weapons and gear that the soldiers actually carried onto the battlefield.

This is especially absurd since JP's films are for the most part completely mediocre and the product of a technically proficient, somewhat creative kid who's been given the best in filmmaking equipment by his parents. Ms. Gal's writing is acceptable but uninteresting to an amazing extent. She finds nothing insightful or fresh in her life, merely depicting the major events of JP's life as if he was already Steven Spielberg. Even were Spielberg himself the subject of this work, it would be a dull waste of paper. I'm sorry to be so brutal but the false modesty of this self-proclaimed \\"fool\\" and her son is grating.

It is cheaper but it doesn't have an LCD screen, and it has slower memory, a different generation of processor and much slower buses.I have yet to test one myself, but the only obvious criticism is that it should have FireWire 800, if Apple wants rapid adoption of this technology before a faster version of USB appears.Others have criticisms such as the relatively low spec graphics, but for a home machine, unless you want to be at the leading edge for gaming, it's a pretty good package. I tried to price something equivalent at Dell's web store and it came out more expensive, without even adding in software to match that Apple supplies.For those who think it won't be a hit: check out Amazon's computer top sellers list (go to desktops) and see where it's placed. You may be surprised."},{"rating":"1","title":"Switched to Apple, now I want to switch back","review":"I like how it looks, I liked OSX for the most part, but this computer isn't that great. The processor isn't that strong. My Athlon 2100 could process faster than this thing could and it was a fraction of the price.Here is my main concern though. I've had this iMac for about 3 months now and its been pretty good up until now. The screen randomly flickers now and every once in a while it hangs for about 5 seconds (nothing works, can't move mouse, sounds stops playing). The computer even freezes to the point where I have to shut it down and restart. I also turned it off thinking it overheated. Let it cool down for a few hours and started it up and it took about 8 restarts to actually let it boot up into OSX.I wouldn't recommend buying this product. I don't know how other macs are but thisi one, my first one, is not good at all. I plan to try and make apple take it back or sell it for as much as I can get. I want my PC back."},{"rating":"2","title":"Apple continues to up the ante.","review":"The new iMac is as different a machine as it's G3 and G4 ancestors were when they were introduced. Stunningly beautiful. Amazingly fast. Incredibly reliable.I have been a big fan of the iApps ever since they were released. Including the latest iLife suite on their new machines is a nice touch from Apple. iMovie, iDVD and iTunes are my hands-down favorites. GarageBand is a great, fun application if you have the time to play.The pictures don't do justice to the beauty of the new iMac. The clear plexiglass shell gets lost and really is the main attraction for this machine. With the faster processor speed of the G5, and the great SuperDrive to write DVDs/CDs, this is the easy choice for any Mac evangelist (remember them?).

Their awesome chain of hits continued with Young guns, Bad boys, Wake me up, Careless Whisper, Freedom, Everything she wants, I'm your man, Where did your heart go and the edge of heaven.Yepppp!!! I'm a die hard WHAM! fan. There has been some other wham compilations released since this one, None of them come close to the great selection of tracks on this one.Only small picking bone with this album is the drawn out version of \\"last christmas\\".

I was a teenager and thought they were the greatest things since sliced bread.I own all of the albums on vinyl...LOLSeriously, my musical tastes are a bit more sophisticated now but I love listening to these songs and singing at the top of my lungs. Careless Whisper was the best dramatic 80's ballad ever.My other favorite is the extended version of Everything She Wants. ( I would love for Maxwell to remake this song. His voice would really do it justice).While George went on to make Faith....another great album....you can immerse yourself in this compilation and relive the 80's when Neon and Tshirts with BIG BLACK WRITING were in!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Their Greatest!","review":"This is George Michael/Wham's greatest album. The tracks are chronologically listed, so you can see how George's songwriting and vocals improve with every song. The leather jacket bad-boys days were the first 4 songs. From \\"Wake Me Up\\" onwards, its their new clean look, and anyone can note the incredible change from disco to just brilliant pop tunes. Of course, Wake Me Up was the hit that launched their worldwide success, especially in US. This album includes a new different and improved version of the brilliant \\"Freedom\\", a real catchy tune that Abba would love to write and sing. Careless Whisper will blow you away as you see how talented George can be. \\"Last Christmas\\" is everyone's favourite Wham song I suppose, everybody I know has heard that one. Simply Briliant!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Say WHAM! Say BAM!","review":"This is the definitive greatest hits collection for fans of WHAM! You needn't buy their albums if you get this for all the hits are here. As a bonus you also get \\"Careless Whisper\\" and \\"A different Corner.\\" Two solo efforts on the part of George Michael. These songs will bring back memories of going to discos, first loves and first times. I personally fell in love with George , he was my first crush until I discovered Culture Club. At any rate highly recommended. Its great to listen to, to dance to and to work out with. I held back one star by the way for it would have been nice to add a never before released track or some updated version of an old one. Still, its great! Now say WHAM!

Very exciting and kept us wanting more every night."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I found this book incredibly disappointing. Although they had lovely illustrations, I thought that things came too easy for Prilla, Vidia, and Rani, the questers. They only had minor hardships on their quest. One was that when they stole Captain Hook's cigar, they were about to drown in the sea, but Neverland's shore magically appeared and saved them.I also thought that the talents were dim-witted. Prilla's talent is a mainland-visiting clapping talent, which is very dumb. She imagines she visits another place, and by that, she saves Mother Dove...Levine has written many good books, such as Ella Enchanted, so if you are thinking about reading this one, think again. Ella Enchanted would be a better choice. Fairy Dust and the Quest for the Egg is Levine's worst."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Disappointment","review":"I have to disagree with the three individuals who've posted reviews so far. I loved Ella Enchanted; I was very disappointed with this book. It seems to be written for a much younger audience, despite its length. While Levine has some cute ideas about how Never Land functions, I found the fairies' personalities to be so one-dimensional as to be almost non-existent and the art to be a hideous pastiche of icky-poo sweet ersatz Disney. The book might work well as a read-aloud for three or four year-olds with a good attention span; I would hesitate to give it to anyone older. Please, Ms. Levine, go back to letting your wit and intelligence and humor show!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Quite Right","review":"Something doesn't seem quite right about this book. Levine's story seems tired and unimaginative - nothing like her spunky, lively, earlier tales. It's fishy to me that Tinker Bell is a main character and that Disney Press published the book. This isn't Levine at her best, which is disappointing, though the abundant illustrations are definitely something to marvel at."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fairies of all kinds","review":"A story about the newest fairy in Never Land and her affinity for Clumsy (read Human) children. Prilla has no idea what her talent is, unlike other fairies, who know what their special gift is from the moment they arrive in Never Land . When a storm hits the island and cripples its inhabitants, Prilla and two other fairies are chosen for a dangerous quest that will pit them against sea people, Captain Hook, and a dragon! Engaging, with gorgeous color illustrations. This author is known for spinning out fairy tales in award-winning fashion."},{"rating":"2","title":"A wonderful book!","review":"I just finished this book a few minutes ago.

Please try this book and if you do, you will love it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Disappointing","review":"I was disappointed in both books of this series. If we hadn't gotten both books at once, we propbably would have stopped reading after this one. They read (to me) like a movie treatment, with plot and characters sketched in, but no real fantasy world created. There are lots of challenging vocabulary words, but the author fails to demonstrate what a rich vocabulary can do: paint a complex and compelling word picture. I know Gail Carson Levine can write better than this! I read this book aloud to my daughter, and it is NOT a good read aloud book because the author frequently has the speakers complete each others' sentences and doesn't denote who is speaking. My daughter and I both enjoyed the story - we just wish it was told better. I'm sure it will make a fine Disney movie.I gave an extra star because the illustrations are beyond beautiful."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fairy Dust and the Quest for the Egg","review":"Gorgeous illustrations suited for framing if posters of this artwork become available.

The real problem is that this is not an instructional video/yoga practice video at all. In fact, I'm not sure what the purpose of this is. It's just a low quality video of two women doing yoga, with a narrator that keeps repeating that what they're doing is dangerous and that you shouldn't try it without propper instruction. However, the moves in the main portion of the video really aren't that advanced. Since I had taken a yoga class before, I could just about follow along anyway except for two things: 1) I kept having to look up to see what they were doing, and 2) instead of relaxing, I kept thinking \\"will that narrator just shut up already?\\" Actually, that's the cleaned up version of what I was thinking...glad I rented it instead of buying."},{"rating":"2","title":"East Bay Greasy","review":"Like 99% of bands Tower of Power will never match their debut release \\"East Bay Grease.\\" But with Rocco and Dave back in the rythym section this is their best album, front-to-back, since the early seventies.

I had never heard of this group, and a little surfing revealed all. I promptly ordered \\"Oakland Zone\\" and listened to it with great anticipation. It was at this point that I realised why the radio station chose to play \\"Happy about that\\" - it is the only track on the CD worth listening to (settle down you soul experts, I am obviously a newbie here). Seriously though - the one track is very polished and pleasing to the ear, while the remainder of the tracks are nothing but a bunch of what I would class as \\"B\\" sides.

Now \\"Simply Napkins\\" has raised the bar. It's really different from anything on the market, or previously published. Not just napkin folding (although the folds are uniquely easy, even for those of us with two left thumbs), but innovative. I love the affordable rings for any occasion, the fast, fun finishing techniques, the fabulous fashions and furnishings, and the all-new \\"Quilt-Lovers\\" section (who knew you could do so much with little fabric squares)? Also worth the price of the book are the napkin care and stain removal tips. So helpful. If you don't do anything else today, buy this book.

Weber plays a fretless electric bass with that interesting \\"owOWWoo\\" timbre, typically with electric piano, soprano sax (another interesting timbre, like the oboe) and drum kit. Composed stuff with sections, counterpoint, transitions...like a lot of good ECM jazz.\\"Sand Glass\\" has a bass ostenato played with the lowest string and what must be very high on the top string, washed over and counterpointed against by the electric piano, moaned at with a low sliding synth, and then sung over by the sax...and at one point some crumhorn-like instrument--maybe a mute on the sax?\\"Left Turn\\" has a drifty acoustic piano solo that leads into a section in groups of five measures of 9/8. The beat is driving, almost frantic and yet soprano sax chords arch over the long measures making it almost stately.Sonically, rhythmically, melodically engaging and hypnotizing. Unhurried trips to large beautiful out-of-the-way places where interesting things are happening."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fabulous","review":"Yellow Fields is Eberhard Weber's best, by far.

I found out that this set was purchased after reading all the spectacular reviews on Amazon. After using the tools on my grill, I was not impressed with their quality. When I tried to use the tongs to pick up a small sausage, the metal bent at the point where they are reinforced for gripping. I ended up using some oxo tongs which do not bend and are much more comfortable. The knife included in the set is bulky and not well designed. When I used the knife and fork to cut up a rotisserie chicken, the knife was very awkward to use and not very sharp to boot. I do like the basting brush and the fork is pretty good at stabbing meat. While I haven't used the spatula yet, it looks satisfatory to flip burgers.

I and the times have changed, of course, and we have seen a lot of comedy since the 1950s, so that probably explains why I was disappointed. I kept thinking, watching these, how unfunny a lot of what he did, was. With a few exceptions, it's pretty weak stuff, humor-wise. But in the 1950s, I guess it was all new and fresh, and was funny then, compared to other stuff on TV. It is interesting to see how things were done on TV in the early days, and I'm donating my set of this to a film and TV library. Compared to comedy today, this is pretty weak stuff, but I'm repeating myself."},{"rating":"2","title":"Eugene meets the Nairobi Trio","review":"Ernie Kovacs was television's original genius. His innovative use of sound, imagery and outrageous sight gags made for incredibly funny viewing. His characters were priceless. \\"Percy Dovetonsils\\" was one of the very first pseudo-gay characters whose wonderful takes to the camera were a scream, especially that syrupy smirk he got on his face. Eugene was a character played entirely in pantomime. The Nairobi Trio is, perhaps Ernies' most famous contribution to comic lore with three band members in long coats, hairy ape masks and derbys playing in a band to the music of the Ray Charles Singers (why they made this recording will never be known) but it is perfect for Ernie's motives. I won't give away the shtick but you'll roll in the aisles (if you have aisles). Ernie left us before his time but today's television comedy owes much to Ernie Kovacs, especially Laugh-in and SNL."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pure Innovative Genius","review":"The cult following of Ernie's work is well deserved. Where so many other TV \\"pioneers\\" were adapting radio material for the screen, Mr. Kovacs treated TV like a totally new toy and created visually centered material that others have fed upon for decades. A Kaleidoscope dancing to the music? On black and white TV? What was he thinking of? Ernie's genius ideas are now commonplace entertainment fodder. These tapes give us a rare opportunity to glimpse comedy art at its crude and wonderful birth. Although its easier for baby boomers to put this material in context, creative younger folks will be able to watch Ernie and contrast him to the often seen scenes of Berle, Lucy, Gleason, etc. If you think Sid Caesar was innovative, Ernie will slay you."},{"rating":"2","title":"window deflector","review":"This was an easy purchase.

It has great graphics and a large assortment of mp3s. The playability and fun factor for this game are not that great. It's a great game for a bunch of friends to play for no more than 30 minutes. That is the only time I play it. The moves get kinda old and the fact that you can't go just anywhere around the mountain.. yes there are boundaries... The best game out on the XBox at this current time is Halo.

It rocks.","review":"Hey, I didn't even like snowboarding before I saw this game. But I love the game. There are a large number of different runs that you progress through, and lots of tricks to learn to really rack up points.The only thing I would warn people about is that it requires alot of practice and dexterity to get the controls down, since it uses nearly every button on the controller during normal play.Overall, I think it is great.. The graphics are very impressive, and I want to go ski every time I play it :), and the game play is something to keep you busy for quite awhile.-b"},{"rating":"2","title":"Amped","review":"This game is pretty cool. It uses the Xbox's soundtrack feature (lets you rip music cds and listen to them during the game) and has well over 15 places to go freestyle snowboarding. It has a multiplayer for up to four people (you don't even have to have four controllers to play four player. after you input the names you can all share a single controller or two, because it lets you board in turns, not at the same time).It also lets you customize your boarder with many many accessories such as DRAGON clothes.If you like snowboarding games this is a must have!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Oh Dude this one is a keeper","review":"Well I'm gonna be honest here.

Shes so bad she makes me want to stick a pencil in my ear and swirl it around so I won't have to listen to her. Along with her (or his, i can't decide) impossibly annoying voice there's the fact that she keeps saying things like \\"that was ill!\\" or \\"mad-tight\\" and also \\"if you broke your arm my brother gets your pass\\". No joke. Plus the task on that level is imposible. At first i got stuck a lot, but then i remembered i had the magical power to ride straight through stuff (rails, trees, pretty much anything).

There is none of that cheap manualing down the whole run or pulling 70,000 points of every jump it is just real tricks off real jumps on real mountains. I wouldn't say the multiplayer mode is the best but the Career mode is out satnding. The point in Career mode is to go from a world rank of 126 to a world rank of 1. To do this you need to impress sponsors, beat the pros, stoke the media, and even just get the classic high score.Some of the Cons to this game is again the multiplayer mode and there are some really annoying sound effects.My ratingsCareer mode-5Multiplayer Mode-2Gameplay-4Graphics-5"},{"rating":"2","title":"AWSOME GAME!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Too bad they never made a movie about the sequel. The Provence would have made a beautiful scenery for the movie location!My advice: read \\"Deceptions\\", the read \\"A Tangled Web\\" and finally get the movie \\"Deceptions\\" with Stefanie Powers who definitely was the best choice for playing Stephanie and Sabrina in the movie (mini TV series)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Outmoded and ill-informed review of the art","review":"This book contains many revelations including the authors theory on hypnosis and hair loss.

This book, which premises itself on the \\"choice\\" approach, exhibits the sub-conscious fears of homosexuality common to that point of view. When it is possible for a gay man to become straight, one must also open up to the possibility of a straight man becoming gay, the primal fear of those who are perhaps not as stalwart in their heterosexuality as they would have others assume.Although couched in positive terms, the author cannot escape the essential homophobia of his initial premises."},{"rating":"1","title":"You can't and shouldn't have to change your sexuality","review":"This book is offensive, bigoted and hateful, and Amazon should be ashamed to be selling it.

The handle is sturdy and easy to grip even if you need to whisk vigorously.While other whisks are fine and will get the job done, you'll really be unable to go back to a regular one after you use the Zyliss. The reason is that the tip where all the wires normally meet isn't connected, and it really makes cleanup a breeze, unlike a traditional whisk. If you use a whisk regularly, I definitely suggest upgrading to the Zyliss because it'll make cleaning up afterwards super easy."},{"rating":"2","title":"In Love with the Whisker!","review":"This is such a great and quality product.

Instead, he spent most of his time fantasizing about what Wittman felt, said, and did, that at best, he wrote a corny novel! \\"Write\\" however, is a far too generous description. The author hasn't a clue about how to use the English language. In fact, after two chapters, I assumed this was just a very bad translation from German. But with a surname \\"Simpson\\", I am afraid the author has adopted English as his native tongue. One suggestion...study the use of the language!! As for Schiffer, they REALLY let down the author and audience by not editing this book. I will certainly steer away from future Schiffer publications because of the lousy job on this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Maddening","review":"I wish I had read these reviews before I bought this awful book. The other reviewers are exactly right, it reads like a book translated out of German by first year German students. I couldn't even read 10 pages of it, even though I very much wanted to learn about the subject. You would think that with the extortionate prices Schiffer charges for their books, they could hire an editor."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poorly written and edited.","review":"The publisher has a poor reputation with me. Their books are characterized by several errors in spelling and editing on almost every page. The author of this book is also a very poor writer. The text is clumsy and wordy. The writing would fail a freshman high school class."},{"rating":"1","title":"Villers Bocage Fantasy","review":"I agree with the other reviews that Mr. Simpson's book is very poorly written. Its greatest failing, however, is the appalling inaccuracy of its description of the Villers Bocage battle. What Mr. Simpson has offered as \\"fact\\" (supported by a hilariously self-serving question-and-answer appendix) is so far of the mark that one has to question whether Mr. Simpson did even the most basic research. One only has to look at Michael Wittmann's own account of the battle (given in an interview conducted the day of the fighting) to see that Mr. Simpson's account is hopelessly in error. This book will no doubt contribute to the gobs of misinformation currently surrounding Wittmann and his exploits. Avoid this book and instead purchase Patrick Agte's book, \\"Michael Wittmann and the Tiger Commanders of the Liebstandarte.\\" Although it is three times the price of Simpson's book, it is sensibly translated (from German) and is the most comprehensive book on Wittmann available."},{"rating":"1","title":"DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK!!! A waste of money! ZERO STARS!!!","review":"This book starts with a great premise - the recounting of the career of the most successful German tank commander of WWII.That is where the great ends and misery begins. Most of the text is generalizations about either German military life or campaigns of the LAH, with little factual account of Wittman's specific actions.Beyond the weak narration, the spelling and grammar are horrid. This just compounds the feeling of frustration. I am (angry) that this book ever made its way into print. Where is quality control?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Good subject, poor editing","review":"I have not finished this book. It is very difficult to read, I must agree with another review. On reading, it appears to be a very poor translation, however it was written by an American. Sentence structures are atrocious and cumbersome. Furthermore, although the book is a biography of Michael Wittman, much of what is discussed in the chapters on Poland and France is not about Wittman, but his regiment. I did not buy the book for that purpose. I have read numerous books from Schiffer, many suffer from problems with translations and editing. This is the worst. What particularly bothers me is that Schiffer publishes titles and subjects not often found in mass print and I buy their books specifically for that purpose. They are expensive however, I may think twice in the future before purchasing if they cannot do a better job."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't deserve even a single star!","review":"The best thing that can be said about this book is the reviews it has generated below. Take the time to read them and not the book. I was bitterly disappointed when I started to read this book. After paying a packet for it I couldn't just throw it away, I read it all the way through. I agree with every aspect of the previous reviews. How this got past the editor is truly amazing! How could a publishing company like Schiffer publish this trash is another question. If you want to learn more about this fascinating tank ace I would advice you to try and locate a copy of 'Michael Wittmann and the Tiger Commanders of the Leibstandarte' by Patrick Agte, published in 1996 by Fedorowicz."},{"rating":"1","title":"Extensive grammatical errors make this book unreadable.","review":"I really wanted to read about Michael Wittman, I really did. But this book is so poorly written it is impossible to get through it. Just about every paragraph has a grammatical error and many have several errors. There are misspelled words, missing words, sentences that change tense....the list is endless. I wish I had read the reviews before I bought this book. Now I am stuck with an unreadable piece of [work]. Please do yourself a favor and avoid this book at all costs!"},{"rating":"1","title":"What a horrible book!","review":"I wish that there was a rating lower than one star for this book. I have tried to read this book two or three times but cannot force myself to endure the punishment associated with wading through so many grammatical errors and poorly written sentences. I honestly thought that it was a translated book (from German) than had lost something of the true meaning in the translation (you know how a translator will sometimes interprete something literally and it won't sound right in the translated language). It is however, written by someone whose \\"mother tongue\\" is English!! The bottom line - don't, under any circumstances, waste your money on this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"EIN SCHRECKLICHES BUCH!","review":"To say that the quality of this book is \\"uneven\\" is a mild understatement. Like the other reviewers of this book, I bought \\"TIGER ACE...\\" eagerly anticipating a well-written, well-researched book. NOT! Never have I been so thoroughly disgusted to read -- or rather, try to read -- such a HORRIBLY WRITTEN book!!! The photographs are the only good thing about this book. Yet, by themselves, they are not enough to redeem dieses Buch.BUY THIS BOOK AT YOUR OWN PERIL."},{"rating":"1","title":"Items looks different than what is pictured","review":"The photo of this item has 18 slots of beads, but the actual product only has 12 slots of beads (including 1 that is just filled with a a warning about choking hazards, not beads).

I find myself lucky to own this wonderful, loving book about a girl who has to face the hardships of going blind at the tender years of teenage-hood. Although it may be out of print, I urge you to find it at your local library and read it or try and find it somewhere! I know there was a sequel written for it, but I can not find the name anywhere. I hope to someday find the sequel as I have been looking for over 11 years."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ripped off!","review":"The item pictured is not what I received.

The design is unique and ingenius as far as the column and tilt setup for macro/closeup photography. Here's the design flaw though, the bushing that is on top of the head is not actually screwed onto the bolt. It slides up and down freely. The 9370 is rated at 22 pounds of support, so I tried to put an equivalent head on it. I screwed it on and then......gently.....snugged up the set screws and the bushing snapped off right at the base. This is not an easy repair. I wound up using a bushing for a Slik Monopod that I had to fix the issue. I have had two of these 9370 series because I liked the design, but have had issues with the heads. If Giottos would correct that problem, they'd have a real winner. I am not too comfortable with $5000 in camera equipment hanging off the head design with the current bushing set up though."},{"rating":"1","title":"misleading","review":"i purchased this book and read it.

It was written in the late 1940's and carries a folksy view of the island and it's inhabitants. Fun reading and entertaining."},{"rating":"2","title":"A prison camp and an opportunity","review":"This novel's one of those a reader finds himself wondering whether he'd have enjoyed it as much if he'd seen the movie first. Probably it's best not to wonder. Steve McQueen made a great hero of the prison camp in the movie, but something was lost. A young man, an entepreneur, finds his element in a Japanese POW camp in Southeast Asia. He's a scrounger, a bargainer, a person who can get whatever anyone needs, wants, yearns for. He charges for it in labor, in goods, in money. All the other prisoners dispise him for what he's able to do, but use him.This is a story of the human condition, of human weakness, human flaws and blame. Read the book, see the movie and allow yourself to feel the tragedy of a man who's doing what he does best, fills a needed function, earns the hatred and scorn of his betters, all in an environment that ends the day the Japanese surrender."},{"rating":"1","title":"More Disappointment from Snowy","review":"I bought this album for $3 in the 'get rid of it bin', which says most of it. Snowy has always had a lot of potiential which is frustratingly never reached. I believe he needs to: 1. Fire his producers (himself and Kuma Harada) and find someone to bring the best out of the songs. 2. Snowy is a talented guitarist, but on too many of the tracks, his guitar is relegated to the middle background. 3. Snowy's voice is not bad, but it seems to always intrude.So many of the tracks start off seeming not too bad, but never rise to the expected level. Chris Rea, Garry Moore and Dave Gilmour are all totally wasted on their appearances."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not the complete poems","review":"This book does not have all of his poems.

Not only does he malign the dead, who cannot defend themselves (and notice he waited to publish it until after Gene Roddenberry died), but he dwells in poison over events that happened thirty years ago.Further, a writer of Ellison's experience should know that in television a writer's scripts are not their own. He was paid to write a script, just as a mason is paid to build a wall in someone else's yard. In this case, Roddenberry's. I no longer respect Mr. Harlan Ellison the way I once did."},{"rating":"2","title":"Light shed on an old controversy","review":"I'm amazed that anyone who claims to have read the book can still really blame the controversy on budget-problems and keep a straight face. Ellison did more than produce an angry intro to the book; he produces fact after fact to combat the lies that have been told about him for decades. This is both compelling and sickening at the same time... very engaging reading. The scripts themselves were interesting, although it was difficult for me to read essentially the same script over and over. People interested in how scripts change over time will enjoy this, but I think you have to be in the right frame of mind to read multiple drafts of the same work.

The truly funny thing is that the script is so sparse that it's difficult for me to see how anybody could get so worked up over the changes which were made - we're talking about bare stage directions and a dozen or so pages of material here, not something that rises to the level of literature.The pats on the back administered with regularity by Ellison were bad enough, but the effusive sucking-up in the foreword and epilogue by other Star Trek \\"luminaries\\" made this book seriously painful to read.I came into this _wanting_ to like Harlan and his version of the script.

These activities include recruiting party activists, recruiting candidates, understanding the orientations of Southern partisans by religon, moralistic positions, and includes information on the roles played by county chairs and county committee persons.The book is short on specifics on individual states, other than Mississippi and Alabama, that could be helpful to a partisan using this book as an objective guidepost on how to persue winning strategies.A good buy, it allows partisans to better understand activist behavior from emperical data, rather than from conjecture."},{"rating":"1","title":"dissappointed","review":"i was happy that i received the product but was not happy with the amount i got in the bottle, It was supposed to be a 1oz bottle but when i got it the bottle was 1/2 full."},{"rating":"1","title":"Does not work well","review":"Ok, it did plump my lips a little bit, but it only lasted for about 10 minutes.

It has great tech. Videos & photos can be seen clearly in color, and the screen isn't that small. All the description Amazon fives explain what it does clear enough, but the only problem it has are the batteries. In a way, it'd be better to have a discman or cd player, for you can change when they expire, but with the Jukeboxes, you have to charge them. On the manual, it says you have to do it for 3hr, but it doesn't explain or tell how much they will last. I charged it for 2hr, and that was how long it lasted, but what if you go on an 8hr trip, and there is nowhere to charge the batteries? Try changing the batteries? that's a good idea, but you have to take the screws, and that ain't as easy. But besides this little defect, it id great.

Which was suprising given that it was hidden away in a corner of the Microsoft booth.

The premise is superb - a lone mage fighting hordes of enemies with a wide variety of spells. Unfortunately, the controls and gameplay kill this promising concept. Switching between the different spells that you need is cumbersome, and you can only save in designated spots. The graphics are probably the only redeeming features, as the spell effects are impressive and it is interesting to watch Arran age over the course of the game from a young boy into an old, wise wizard.Overall I can only recommend this game if you are a serious fan of spellcasting-based games and if you can get a cheap purchase/rental price."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy this game","review":"What a load of [junk]!

The blade has never broken or chipped. The weight is also good for their size. They are amazing with short distance fast speed half spin throws. They fly just as well when throwing full spin. If you're looking to learn to throw I would strongly recommend this knife. Of course it will take some time to find your grip and get a feel for distance and spins, but once you get a feel for throwing in general, this knife will not let you down."},{"rating":"2","title":"Throwing Knife","review":"Awesome knife, I got it only after two or three days, it was faster than they predicted it'd reach me.

When a loud electric goth-style band like The Gathering can put out a simplified, more skeletal CD like this one and have it hold together so beautifully, there is obviously talent to burn. The singing, playing and writing are beautiful.

In fact, I've bought it as presents to some of my friends who have not be introduced to him.

Yes I consider $24.49 high when many classics of good condition can be purchased for under $15.Maybe this is what Warner Bros is all about with their DVD on demand, only printing when required and not caring about the individual who wants to save it as a classic.

Lanza and the Director just couldn't get along and I can see why. The Director has poor Edmund walking his wooden way through this film while incongruously opening his mouth and emitting all of the unrestrained passion of Lanza's voice. Lanza wanted to play the Prince evolving from a disciplined Prussian into a passionate lover. The Director would not allow the metamorphosis. Lanza would have been great in this role, but he just couldn't tolerate what he thought (correctly, I believe) was the absurd juxtaposition of the sometimes sentimental other times pleading or romantic music/lyrics... with the Director's insistence that the lead be played almost devoid of emotion. It was Director vs. Mario and the result was that this is the film marks the beginning of the tragic end of Lanza's painfully brief career."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheap, out of focus, not synchronized","review":"This was advertised as as new. It's new in that it is a newly made cheap, poor copy from Korea. Korea makes many good things, but these extremely poor DVDs are not the good things. There's a company in Brazil who buys the copyright and then makes excellent copy DVDs of grand old movies. I have an old VHS of this movie that is demonstably better than this cheap, tawdry, bogus imitation. It was badly out of vocus, movements were choppy and out of synch, and the audio was fuzzy and chopped.It is an insult to the movie business and the artists to put out this cheap crap and call it \\"new.\\" It is patently dishonest -- not merely disingenous -- to advertise this as new.Let's all bug Turner to show this movie on TCM where a better copy may be downloaded that is far better in quality than these pirated excrement.But it WAS cheap.

Unfortunately, he gained a lot of weight and was replaced - not just directorial differences, but Lanza's eating/drinking were taking him over - a sad by-product of fame for some. Edmund Purdom is not Lanza but he does make a handsome prince. When I first saw the close-ups, I noticed that the synching wasn't quite in-synch...but one soon forgives and forgets.

Although some important scenes are either left out or just shown in passing, this video captures the spirit of Romberg's music quite well. The addition of \\"I'll Walk With God\\" seems to have been put in only to showcase Mario Lanza's talents; I think it is not a fitting adjunct to the accurate telling of Romberg's tale.I originally saw this film when it was new; I was 9 years old. My 11 year old sister and our Mother went along. After the show was over, my sister was perplexed. She asked Mother, \\"Which one was Mary O'Lanza?\\" We still laugh about that today!A good follow-up to this film would be \\"Deep in My Heart,\\" the Sigmund Romberg story, starring Jose Ferrar."},{"rating":"1","title":"Film good, DVD-R not","review":"In few words: the film is superb: great art direction, great costumes, nice songs, a beautiful singing voice of Mario Lanza and a wonderful Cast like Edmund Purdom, Ann Blyth, Richard Anderson (Buck Falmont in Season 7 of \\"Dynasty\\") and the wonderful S.

I first saw her in the Roswell series and fell in love with her and her character. I have already watched Life Unexpected through to the end and I am currently watching it again. This show has a great cast and the episodes are well written. I'm not normally into family dramas but I find this show to be captivating, I love the characters and look forward to re-watching it again many times in the future.

There is only one chapter on actually helping them talk yourself."},{"rating":"1","title":"Title is misleading","review":"The title suggests that the book will provide instructions on how to help a late talker in developing speech. Rather it sends you into a panic that your child has Apraxia. Allow me to save you 13 bucks, if your child isnt babbling by 18 months, just get your child to your doctor for an evaluation...simple!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Subtitle is should be What to Do if Your Child has Apraxia!","review":"This book is an excellent resource if you suspect your child might have apraxia. But its subtitle, \\"What to Do If Your Child Isn't Talking Yet\\" is misleading, since it implies that the variety of possible speech and language disorders will be addressed. Instead, 95% of the book is devoted to apraxia, a very specific disorder, with perhaps 5% relating to other speech disorders. Language disorders as such are barely touched upon.It's a fascinating book full of helpful information, certainly, and interesting in its own right. But for me, the mother of a child with a language disorder, it was $14 dollars largely wasted.For the next edition, the publishers should be encouraged to change the subtitle and give a clearer description of the book's subject on the back cover."},{"rating":"2","title":"hope for my 2 year old","review":"I bought the book, The Late Talker, and I am so happy with the results that we have gotten with my 2 year old. My son, was not saying a word, or communicating at all and was very independent. About a month ago I started a suggestion that they made in the book, and WOW have I seen results. He is no longer independent (meaning, not wanting to communicate) He is repeating words now that I ask him to repeat and his focus and attention span is amazing. All my friends and family thought that he may be autistic and after only 3 weeks of giving him this product that they suggest in the book, I have seen miraculous changes. I thank God first and then I thank the authors of this book. I would highly recommend this book if anyone has a child with speech problems or is even in doubt. This product that I am giving him is sooooo healthy for the whole family."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Resource for Parents","review":"My 2 year old was recently diagnosed with verbal apraxia. I have had no one to turn to for information (besides the web), because I've been on a wait list at a number of Speech Therapy Centers. This book has provided me with a sense of empowerment, to take some control of the situation, and help my daughter as best as I can while I wait for the Professional Therapists to guide us. After reading most of it in one sitting, I feel more educated, and optimistic about the diagnosis & prognosis for my daughter.

This book left me in tears. It's horrible, and frankly, I have a background working with children who have autism, specifically the non-verbal. The author spouts quite a bit of say so, with no documentation to mention.

Mine doesn't.

This book does not even address the possibility of a language delay being due to autism, and I find this inexcusable. If I had known back then that autism is a major cause of speech delay, I might have gotten him diagnosed earlier and therefore treated earlier.The book focuses on apraxia way too much, since the author happens to have a child with apraxia."},{"rating":"2","title":"Useful Developmental Checklists","review":"I agree that most of the information presented in this book pertains to apraxia, as others have noted. However, this book offers excellent developmental checklists which I completed and showed our pediatrician to convince her that our son had true developmental delays (not speaking at 20 months, etc). Our pediatrician finally took our concerns seriously and began the \\"early intervention\\" process with our state. At 7, our son is recovering (biomedical and nutritional interventions) from symptoms of high-functioning autism and ADHD."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not that helpful","review":"28 month old daughter with speech delay.

I get that companies don't want movies or programmes available in countries that haven't had them released in theatres or on networks yet but where its a show that's had its time, what's the point? If you're on the edge of the earth in region 4 and you buy this region 1 show, then your multi-region player will play it but it does something that distorts it and gives the flow of frames a jagged edge that wears on you after a while.

The booklet offers a lot of amazing advice.And they are amazingly accurate. I found that the best way to use these cards, for me, is to ask 2 questions of the same subjects. Because when I ask \\"should I do this?, it become very unclear to me. But when I ask for the answers of 2 opposite choices, the answers are pretty clear. For example, when I ask \\"should I work?\\" and \\"Should I continue studying?\\" The answers were exactly the opposite. And maybe it's not the cards can predict the future or what is best for you. But I think what they do is helping you get clearer about what you want in life. It's so hard to find out and concentrate on what you really want because we have millions of thoughts in our heads. I think using the cards is another way to get the message from your true self of what you really want. Try it!

One hundred different types of fabric are discussed alphabetically, from 'African Mud Cloth' to 'Woolens and Jerseys'. The book also has sections on how to determine fabric content, stain removal, working with linings, hems, closures and seams.

The author was not only directly involved in Watergate, but also planned the Bay of Pigs invasion, and was rumoured to be directly involved in the plot to assassinate Kennedy. What I'm getting at here is that the man knew first hand what he was writing about, because he'd done it, for years.The plot twists and turns from start to finish. The characters seem as if they were pulled out of real life.No stereotypes, no predictability. Even the ending is surprising.The book visits several cities across the world, all with seemingly intimate knowledge.That's all I'm going to say. It's not much, as reviews go.

I gave one to my grandson for Christmas. My son told me a short while later that the game had already broken and was not nearly as good quality as the original because the flippers that \\"throws\\" the ball are now made of PLASTIC instead of metal.The makers of the modern game ruined one of the best games ever made by using cheap plastic instead of durable metal.I could not have been more disappointed.

We had one when we were kids and we played for hours. The mechanism under the box to hurl the balls to the net was metal and worked very well. It was great fun.

From the foul line the only thing you could do was blast it over the backboard. My son and I used it for about 30 minutes before we got bored and frustrated.

She paints in acrylics, therefore the colors are bold and intense, yet the mood is somewhat ominous. The book is set outdoors at night, so it supposed to be dark. The illustrations may be too gloomy for say a 1-year old, but my son was three when I picked up this book, and he was delighted with the Mouse story.

They're pretty durable, I \\"introduced\\" one of mine to my real turtle (a 3 toe box turtle), and it still looked brand new. The food dish is magnetic, and when one of the turtles steps on it, it opens up to let them have some din din. The sunglasses are a odd, but cute, touch to this set.

The early portions of the book do present a view of the elite Naval Academy graduates in the context of academy life, career advancement and the Vietnam War. However, as time advances to the Reagan Presidency and Iran Contra, it becomes painfully obvious that the author is phobically predjudiced against Ronald Reagan and Oliver North. So much so that it is impossible to reliably understand the dynamics of the events of that time. What started out as well written and promising ended up as a big disappointment. However, those who have an idealogical hatred of Ronald Reagan and Oliver North will probably enjoy the book. Truth seekers will be disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"A stunning and mesmerizing account of modern day heroes","review":"As a Naval Academy Graduate and a huge admirer of Combat Vets and military heroes, I thought I would enjoy this book when several friends insisted I read it. But I was not prepared for the range of emotions I experienced, as well as the spellbinding way Timberg intertwined the lives of five honorable sailors/Marines. I absolutely loved it and couldn't put it down. It is a classic."},{"rating":"2","title":"Down Memory Lane","review":"As a classmate of the author I found it more than interesting to read his take on the influences of the academy, the war and the Reagan Years. The book generally rang true and although my individual experiences and attitudes were not the same I could recognize the author's and subjects' attitudes and responses. It was no small surprise to rediscover the emotions brought on by those influences. If the reader wants to make the most of the experience of the Nightingale's Song he or she must put aside personal opinions, biases and political leanings. You might neither like nor agree with what you read but listen and learn what can happen to the best of people with the best of intentions."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent book! Balanced and well-written.","review":"This is the best book I've read in quite awhile. It is objective, tells an honest story, and shows what happened behind the scenes of news events of recent years.

I feel as if I'm let in \\"behind the scenes\\" to the struggles of these five men for their voice to be heard. I plan to start rereading it the day I finish it.

But, in recent years, people have finally realized that the presidents were HUMAN and did things that we did not expect.The truth is, this book follows in the line of thinking that Jefferson was a demigod and that he could do no wrong. The evidence is overwhelming that 6 children resulted from the Jefferson-Hemings union. I say this as a Jefferson scholar, having written numerous research papers on the subject, including a masters' thesis (where this book was used as a source).What is really comes down to is what you believe. The evidence is there. And personally, I don't think it made Jefferson any less impressive as an inventor, writer, and president.

The personal hostility of the authors to such scholars as Annette Gordon-Reed, and to the leadership of the Thomas Jefferson Memorial Foundation, undermines any attempt to take their position seriously. They have assumed their conclusions and are determined to pound them home. They quote out of context, omit vital factual data, present sources as saying the opposite of what they say, and otherwise muddy the waters to the point of impenetrability.-- R. B.

The printer is very versatile with 2 or 3 automatic bays for paper and 2 manual entry paper bays for large papers or envelopes and such. It prints extremely fast, but takes about 5 minutes to warm up in the morning, or 2 minutes to warm up if it hasn't been used in a couple hours.

Oh, and the singer is a \\"warlock.\\" Soooooooooooooooo scary. Oooooh. Thank god that metal is making a comeback in the underground and above. Bands like Pelican actually try to make new sounds, use new compositional styles. And rock like mad!!! Mastodon adds free jazz drumming to the aggressive mix. More takers?

Everything started to sound exactly the same song aftersong. With the harmonica and slide guitar you get a hint of \\"Southern Rock\\". Hence I say hint.And the acoustic number is hauntingly reminiscent of Zeppelin. Now when you hear thecomment \\"A Diverse CD\\" or \\"A Broader Effort\\" you think \\"Boring and Soft\\". That's not thecase at all. I feel they've been able to expand themselves musically and still keep themselvesconnected to their existing fans.

Having owned no previous Godsmack albums, I picked up their latest and liked it even more than I thought I would.A good modern rock/metal album with a nice flow and some variety all the way through, with especially standout vocals and some interesting experimental textures and guitar...I also like the sequel to their breakout hit from '98 \\"Voodoo Too\\".

They are a truly talented band, and one of my top 5 favorite bands. However, I sure am glad that I only paid the special Amazon price of $8.96, instead of a normal CD price. 'IV' is a classic example of a popular band that has a magical musical formula for success, and that formula has worked for them on all of their past CD's, and then they decide, \\"Hey, let's experiment and try something different since we are famous and everyone will buy it, even if they don't care for it, we'll still make millions.\\" Of course, Sully's voice is awesome as always, and the musicianship is top notch. 'Speak' is classic killer Godsmack, and 'Temptation' runs a close second. However, they need 9 new tracks to complete the CD. I'll save 'Speak' and 'Temptation' to my computer and MP3 player, but the CD will get buried in some cabinet, and I will anxiously await their next release, which hopefully will revert back to the magic formula!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A perfect example of a freeloader in Heavy Metal.","review":"What I mean with the term \\"Freeloader\\" is a band that really does'nt bring anything to the party.

I believe that this little pocket-size tome is a glorified advertisement for several small select restaurants and stores in the historic centre. The maps are too general, not specific enough for a real walking tour. I left this little book in the hotel room. One would do better to go to a website on Brussels, then visit the tourist centre in the Grand Place for a map that is helpful.

The young actress can't recall her name she was amazing in her role and what a shame it had to be in this movie. The ending was pointless I did not get it, so he moves and decides to go to the desert? His daughter was so uncertain about what her future would be after camp, hello they could have given us an indication that he was going to be there for her and she would be the center of his life. They depicted what the life of a lonely actor in possibly real life is but he lived in a hotel and drove a porsche c'mon seriously im sure he had enough money to get a house and create a better environment for his daughter..... I did't get it and was mad as hell when the movie was over with but glad it was."},{"rating":"1","title":"Somewhere... but I can't find it","review":"I can't find the meaning of this movie. It's probably one of the worst I have seen. Painful to watch, uughhh. The film abuses long looooong takes and has no body, no message, no nothing, it's air. Author pretends to sell the movie to a public that relates to loneliness in a multi million dollar environment. BS! Sould have spend the money in a romantic comedy with dogs or donkeys, at least that will be entertaining.Worts movie I have seen in a while, since the crappening by the indian guy."},{"rating":"1","title":"worst. movie. ever.","review":"I anticipated seeing this movie for many months. What a total letdown! It is so boring and tries so hard to succeed in being 'artsy' that it just fails miserably. In fact, the only way my husband and I even got halfway through it was to watch it on fastforward! Even then it was not tolerable. Nothing in the film is original or even interesting. The opening scene is Stephen Dorff driving his Ferrari around in circles ... again ... and again ... and again. Okay, so we got the point after one lap, but minutes later the director still has him circling. It added nothing to the message except to infuriate me that I was wasting my time. The movie does not get any better from this point on. The movie's plot is like Groundhog's Day - the same scenes just keep happening - Stephen Dorff in the shower, twin pole dancers in his hotel room, etc. The filming tries so hard to be 'artsy' that instead the filming is awkward and noticeable. This film was an entire letdown. Don't waste your time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Drive to Nowhere","review":"I believe Sophia Coppola is riding on her name longer than Johnny Marco has been riding in his sports car - and according to the movie, that's a long time. I'm not saying she isn't accomplished in her own right, but her attributes and movies are so overrated, I can't help but wonder if her famous surname doesn't carry substantial weight among the elite circle of film makers, critics, and judges.As in Lost in Translation, the focus on this film is a bored actor, only this one is younger and his bonding companion is his 11-year old daughter rather than a young, equally bored wife of a cameraman. Alienation and isolation are engaging themes, but the problem is that in Somewhere, the audience can grow just as bored as the main character. You get the impression that Johnny should be going somewhere, but you don't know where. In the end, one can hope he is walking toward something rather than away from something, but by this point, the film took far too long to get nowhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nowhere","review":"An utterly pointless movie about a pathetic Hollywood loser and his black Ferrari. No storyline, no plot, miserable acting and cinematography that would fail Film 101. Hard to believe that this was executive produced by Francis Ford Coppola. He must have needed something for his daughter to do, as she is credited with writing and directing. A complete waste of time, except for Elle.So there's Elle Fanning, the incredibly beautiful and talented girl who plays the loser's daughter. She is the only bright spot in this otherwise depressing debacle. Her fresh smile warms the heart in every scene she is in. Nevertheless, I have to say that this film was a waste of her talents. All she really gets to do is look cute alongside her wanker dad. None of the facets of her life or her thoughts are given a chance to develop interest. You would think that Hollywood could come up with something better for her than this tripe.Five stars and Best Picture !? Unbelievable."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is the most boring film I have ever seen.","review":"Guy drives his Ferrari round in circles. Four times. Guy sits on bed. Guy watches pole dancers. Twice. Guy drives his Ferrari again. Guy is in shower. Guy is in a boring party and in boring conversations. Guy gives a boring press conference. Guy drives his Ferrari again. Guy falls asleep while giving cunnilingus to girlfriend (yes, even the sex scene is boring). Guy meets his daughter. Guy watches his daughter do ice-skating figures. For five minutes straight. Guy drives his Ferrari again. And so forth. And so forth.While I am writing this the film is still rolling. And still no improvement: Guy is on the telephone. Guy gets a massage. Guy is in shower again. Why am I watching this?There is one thing in which this film is extremely successful: Conveying a deep, unending and numbing feeling of being BORED.How did this film ever win a Golden Lion?For making you think about the many, many ways in which you could make better use of your time?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Excellent actors, mind-numbing film","review":"What a waste of talent this film was.

This is the latter. Pretentious and ponderous on an order of magnitude even this director's Kirsten Dunst movie about Versailles can't touch. What a sad path Sophia Coppola is on following her Lost in Translation triumph.I would be very wary of trusting anyone who liked this movie; it's not just a matter of opinion, it's a matter of knowing what a film must supply an audience. Do not take the recommendations from any reviewer who gave this film more than one star.

I feel so much more could have been done with it. While Elle and Stephen put in very repectable performances, I felt cheated with all the artsy crap. The storyline was good but there was to much trying to show Stephen's characters disenchantment with what his life had become. The car in the beginning going around and around, come on already. The twin strippers was weak the first time, I didn't need to see it again. Boring. I hope their bad pole work was part of the script.Like I said Elle and Stephen did the best they could under the circumstances. I don't think I will be buying anymore of Ms. Coppola's directing endeavors. I didn't like Sideways either."},{"rating":"1","title":"I Should've Walked Out of the Theater.","review":"As far back as I can remember, I have never been tempted to just get up and walk out of the theater because a movie was so bad. That is, until now.\\"Somewhere\\" is sooo boring. The car at the film's start that just goes around in circles, the noise of it's engine a numbing drone, sets the tone for the movie. There were at least two or three points where I almost stood up to yell \\"Omigod, will somebody just DO something!\\" at the screen.Don't get me wrong. I liked \\"Lost in Translation\\". But as far as I can see, the only thing that Sofia Coppola achieved with this film was to actually make a pole dancing scene boring. And that's saying something."},{"rating":"1","title":"Empty, trite movie","review":"I found virtually no redeeming qualities to this film. I should have been forewarned if I knew Sophia Coppola was also responsible for Lost in Translation, another abysmal film. She must think those who view her films are stupid, and maybe she has a point because I still watched this film after loathing Lost in Translation. The opening scene has you watching our anti-hero race around the track five times... I got it after the third time around the track. Here's a guy who is going nowhere. She beats you over the head with every point she tries to make. The ending is so predictable if not totally inane. Our anti-hero pulls his Ferrari to the side of the road, leaving his keys inside, and walks away with a bemusing smile on his face, as if telling us he is done with the life of Hollywood. Of course he's also apparently walking away from his daughter who seemed to give some meaning to his otherwise pathetic existence.

Themes such as isolation, loneliness. Existential questions such as why am I here, and is what I think important really that important? Stephen Dorff does a good job in portraying a rather miserable movie star in the prime of his career with money, a black Ferrari, room service and call girls. Johnny Marco has it all yet he has nothing. He is bored, burned out and unhappy. With no one who truly cares about him. Then steps in his often forgotten daughter played by Elle Fanning who he finds solace in. Sound familiar? It is but is done very well and in many ways is quite different from LIT. Worth renting or buying."},{"rating":"2","title":"This film reminded me of \\"The Brown Bunny\\"...","review":"Both movies are shot at a VERY relaxed pace, essentially a film-length series of random-seeming slices of one person's life. And the scenes come very close to mundane, yet they become quite captivating if the viewer is ready to slow down. \\"Somewhere\\" will likely be ignored by 99% of the movie-watching public who are so habituated now to face-paced movies of all genres.

I suggest watching this when you are slightly sleepy or stoned!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Poetic, but who cares?","review":"This is supposed to be Sophia Coppolla's attempt to translate poetry to the screen, but it ends up just silly and pointless. A major movie star is seen as empty and lonely and depressed. That's the whole thing. Only his 11 year old daughter cheers him up a bit. There's no dialogue at all for the first, I don't know, 15 minutes. That's the first clue that you are in for a bit of an ordeal here. We can't feel too sorry for this dude because he is rich, drives a fancy sports car, has naked women throwing themselves at him, and gets the best of everything wherever he goes. Still, he weeps into the phone to his estranged wife that he is a nothing. The scenes here are very pretty. The locations are interesting. It's just lacking substance. A noble failure."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Viewer Friendly","review":"A bittersweet, slow moving drama of an affable, wealthy, and well-meaning film star who is abandoned by his wife, discontented with his life, and anxious to provide his effervescent 11-year old daughter with some sort of parental relationship. The filming strategy is not viewer friendly however. It is characterised by brief snatches of dialogue, interspersed with long, indeterminable and tedious periods of inaction, where nothing much seems to be going on.

It is self-indulgent naval-gazing at it's worst. It's what gives \\"independent films\\" a bad name. In reality, this is at best a 15-minute short for YouTube.

The characters are far less compelling, elements that might be construed as a narrative are threadbare at best and the movie, despite its lethargic pacing, quickly begins to feel like a self-indulgent exercise in examining the emptiness and monotony of an actor's life. This actor (the character, not Stephen Dorff), unfortunately for the film, isn't one who's interesting, gifted, articulate or insightful upon self-reflection. By about a third of the way in, this movie began to feel more like \\"Nowhere with Nothing To Say.\\" This lame exercise disguised as minimalism signals that either the director has run out of inspiration or needs to get a taste of life outside of the self-absorbed self-fascination of Hollywood."},{"rating":"1","title":"Does it go somewhere?","review":"Nope! It goes Nowhere!I was expecting a more compelling character driven movie. It attempts to portray some sense of emotional realism but the main chAracter was too flat to care for.This seems to be a film which indulges the yearnings of an actor and a director. It is visually stark at times and something humorously mundane. This may have functioned well as a series of still photographs where the audience participates in creating their own narrative. But Somewhere as film offers no narrative structure, no plot, simply mood. Something which does not take 90 minutes to convey.I was looking forward to this film but was disappointed.

There's also a section on reproduction, complete with talk of eggs, sperm, the uterus, and fallopian tubes, and even a female reproductive diagram to go with it, but no vagina.

It was released on DVD February 2010. I had recorded the concert on the Dish Network's hard drive. Unfortunately, I erased it a day before the DVD arrived. Is it my imagination? Seems there has been additional material added to the concert I had watched on the HD NET.She is showing her age but still one of the best entertainers. I noticed she was changing her wigs too? One was much darker than the first one she had on stage. The first one looked real.The DVD says LIZA AT THE PALACE. But, it was the PALACE in Las Vegas, not the famous Palace in Times Square. That is where I saw her mother in person around 1956. Liza was on stage too, around four years old.Liza still gives her all and I really liked her performance that was really good in widescreen and digital sound. It's a true collectible and being sold on Amazon."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sad and disappointing . . .","review":"Liza, the legend. Avoid this performance if you want to remember her at her peak in the 60s, 70s & 80s. This concert showcases her decline. I can't imagine this performance winning a Tony. Sad & disappointing - to put it mildly."},{"rating":"2","title":"Liza is back in better form","review":"True, her voice is not what it used to be - due to age and \\"smoking\\" - but she is entertaining though always a little needy (like her Mom?)

It is one of the worst performances that I have ever seen by an acknowledged performer. She has completely lost it - voice, banter, dancing ability. She looked and acted as if she was sick - out of breath most of the time and looking like she was about to topple over. Sure she's 63 years old but she looked and acted as if she was a lot older. How on earth could this have won a Tony? The rest of the shows it was up against must have been even more awful."},{"rating":"1","title":"Thompson Tribute Trivial","review":"Very disappointed with this DVD that is more a tribute to Minelli than to Kay Thompson.

However, after reading the first few sections, it is dead on. I am married to a Russian judge and in his book he talks alot about the legal system and why it is the way it is. At first, as we discussed the book, she was offended but then through examples and explanations to my questions she said exactly what Maly did in his book....that laws are only for someone else.As well, I can't count the number of times I didn't understand something that was happening when I was in Russia but this book has explained almost everyone of those scenarios.

But pressing the middle button is much easier from the part of the wheel close to the center than the other.

I have never had a similar problem with any other mouse. Sorry Lenovo, but you need to fix this.I got this mouse at work, so I cannot tell from the technical details if it is exactly the same model (I wished there was something like the ISBN for books, but there is not).

It is also listed as a medium sized crate but it is more like for a chihuahua. Medium sized dogs, like Eskies, would never fit in this crate and it certainly wouldn't hold their weight.

Cute idea, poor execution.Plus, for this silver color, the package came WITHOUT a safety seal of any kind - just unscrew the white top and the stuff comes pouring out.

I couldn't wait for the movie to end. The acting was atrocious at best, the dialogue ...was there even a script? I could almost swear they ad-libbed most of the film. The movie is about these two guys that re-record famous movies with them as the main characters because the tapes at the video store were erased due to a magnetic charge. And everyone likes their versions.Cameos by Sigourney Weaver nor a performance by Danny Glover (horrible performance) could safe this movie. The entire thing was less than par. Jack Black was insufferable during the entire movie. This is possibly his worst performance. It was not even funny. If I had not been stuck in an airplane at the time, I would have turned it off."},{"rating":"1","title":"Be Kind Rewind","review":"\`Be Kind Rewind' is a film that looked great in the trailers and then failed to live up to it's promise. Following a VHS video rental shop that has all it's stock wiped and then re-records the films in their own unique style, this film was set up for plenty of laughs that didn't deliver. Jack Black was pretty nondescript this time around and from funny turns in films like \`School of Rock' it was a disappointment to see him tread water and under perform here. The ending fizzled out and left you with no feel good feeling or indeed any strong feeling either way. I don't mind a Hollywood cop out, cheesy, happy ending in the right context and genre, but this film didn't even deliver that! This is a comedy film with few laughs and is one you could quite easily miss without worrying about it. Only a film for huge fans of Jack Black.Feel free to check out my blog which can be found on my profile page."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Movie","review":"I love Jack Black, and he is great in this movie. The movie is hilarious. I don't want to ruin the ending, but I will tell you that the mood changes toward the end of the film."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I expected","review":"While sometimes not meeting prior expectations yields a real diamond in the rough; with Be Kind Rewind, it's more like finding a dollar on the sidewalk. It's nice but it won't do much for you. The premise is interesting but there are simply too many plot holes to make it seem believeable and not enough laughs to make you not care. What you have is a slow moving \\"little\\" movie, cute at times, with good intentions and a good turn by Mos Def, but not much else. There are some humorous moments in the sweded movies but the artificially sweet ending rang hollow and the rest of the cast were pretty average. View before buying, unlike what I did which was to impulse buy it with the predictable remorse. A movie like this will be selling for under five bucks before long so just wait it out."},{"rating":"1","title":"Far from classic Gondry","review":"I loved Eternal Sunshine and thought the Science of Sleep was really interesting and sweet but Be Kind Rewind tries way too hard to tug at the audiences heartstrings. Although the notions of nostalgia and community togetherness are noble, the script fails to make you truly feel for these characters and settles largely for plodding along with an insipid plot regarding Fats Waller. I left this film wondering if the whole experience was just an excuse for director Michel Gondry to make some zany props and outfits by using the pretext of remaking older films. Overall, very disappointing and to be honest, extremely boring. Don't believe all of the classic remarks on the DVD cover and other reviews. Approach with caution."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Waste Your Money On This!","review":"This was the worst movie I ever saw.

I guess I should have been warned by the descriptions of it as \\"quirky\\" and \\"daffy.\\" Uh...yeah...if by \\"quirky\\" you mean puzzling, and \\"daffy\\" you mean dopey.

Yuck."},{"rating":"1","title":"Be Kind Rewind AND TAKE IT BACK TO THE STORE!","review":"I have no idea what the meaning on this movie was. I am still itching my head over it. It was not very well placed and who ever wrote it was unreal. There was not very much comedy too it.Guy gets electrocuted and is now a giant walking magnet, and he erases all the movies in the store. Which I still can't get, is I would assume the store that had VHS ONLY would not be good at all. Maybe if they changed the time to maybe in the early 1990s I would buy it.The two actors are not my favorites, but Jack Black has grown on me over the years.It's just a movie that was not well-written and the ending was not even that good either.I say just rewind and take it back to the store you got it from. Leave it alone!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Watch only if you have a heart and an imagination","review":"I feel sorry for the people who wrote the one star review of this movie. It is a feel good movie that doesn't pretend to be an expensive Hollywood epic. Black and Mos Def have chemistry and the Fats Waller background story is interesting. The film has the feel of a documentary and I believe that was the director's intention.

I would venture to say that most filmmakers will recognize their own early attempts at special effects and \\"Hollywood\\" style shots with Mom and Dad's 8mm camera or camcorder. Although this starts as almost a slapstick comedy, the premise is unique and the characters have a depth usually not seen in today's movies. Mos Def does a great job as Jack Black's foil. But the wonderful thing about this film is the warmth and charm of its ending (which I would never have suspected based on its trailer).

Did the writers think it was a good idea for a storyline? I don't mean to sound extremely harsh but I've seen thousands of better movies than this one, and I'm not even much of a movie watcher to begin with. This was just... pointless to me.The film tried to tell a story but it didn't keep my interest. It tried to be funny and failed REALLY hard at that. In fact trying to think of a reason to even CARE about a story like this is a gigantic mind-blowing mystery to me. It's as bad as a story can possibly be.Jack Black and his movie buddies try to recreate certain parts from classic films out on the streets and in the movie store itself, and the results are horrible.

There were some other big names in this film so it must have started off well enough but something got lost upon the way. Slow start, too. It needed more gags or other funny moments or is it not a comedy?

I get the feeling that this movie was put together in about a week, with about one hour of that week dedicated to writing the script. I'm sure the only money they put into the movie was to get Jack Black and Danny Glover to agree to star in something so juvenile. The only reason this was ever in theaters is due to the market for anything with Jack Black. A huge waste of time, and an insult to anyone who spent money to see it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Bad You Can't Give Zero (0) Stars","review":"This movie had so much potential to be hilarious. It was never once hilarious, even with Jack Black in it, and I turned it off around three-quarters of the way into it.

I'm sure that was the intent, and very little more. It wasn't made to astound anyone or provide huge laughs. Yet, it has a lot of charm and subtle humor.It's a ludicrious story, so you just can't take anything seriously. The premise is unique: two guys converting a dying video rental store into a success by taking blank tapes of famous movies and making their own 20-minute versions! The new \\"movies\\" are so bad, they're good and the neighborhood starts making requests and renting them like hotcakes. Goofy? Sure. Tons of plot holes? You bet......but a nice movie.In additon, Jack Black, Mos Def, Danny Glover and Mia Farrow were all fun to watch.It's no award-winner, but you could do a lot worse."},{"rating":"2","title":"Delightful Film","review":"Story was really cute, shot well. Acting was FANTASTIC - the actors really expressed what the director was going for. I liked Mos Def before, but I REALLY liked him in this role. It was a different kind of film for Danny Glover, but he did well. Strange casting for Mia Farrow, but if I forget all the films she's done before then it works well. Really good choice for Jack Black - to stretch him out of the rut he was starting to dig - still similar to previous work, but enough different, and out of the primary roll to balance Mos Def's great performance.Rather inspiring for aspiring filmmakers. Like a fantasy that has become part of reality - the lights don't sparkle as brightly, and maybe the colors are a little dull, but it's REAL.

Im looking for a copy because the copy I bought maybe 10 years back, is falling to pieces. It contains, as promised on the cover, 10 projects that can be built in one to six hours.. It changed my whole oulook on building sand castles, something Id always enjoyed seeing, but never done. Amply illustrated with step by step instructions, it taught me an easy technique, essentially sculpting down, as opposed to building up.. that has kept me busy and happy on beaches all up and down the East Coast.. And gained me many admiring remarks:) I hope you can find me a new copy.."},{"rating":"2","title":"Meant for women who are slim","review":"The panties arrived on time and were well packaged.

I love spending my free time in bookstores, and if I lived in New York, Books & Co. would have been my home away from home. The quotes and ancedotes from the writers, and customers made the book that much more fun! I recommend this book to anyone who enjoys reading, or just wants to know the inside scoop about the bookselling process. I found myself writing down the titles of books mentioned in Bookstore to put on my \\"Books to Read List\\".

The problem is Jeanette K Watson Irwin, daughter of TJ Watson I, actually died in 1970, seven years before this Jeanette Watson opened this bookstore. I know this because I know Jeanette Watson's daughter. Something here doesn't add up."},{"rating":"1","title":"Self-Centered","review":"Although I enjoyed reading about the arc of a bookstore's life, I thought that this book was self-indulgent and self-centered in its view. A bookstore is a business, not a public service, and it is interesting that all of us here would be damned as the people who put this store out of business by choosing to buy our books from Amazon.com, rather than our local independent store.Perhaps my view is colored by my day-job, but I think that had Watson worked harder on the \\"store\\" half of the bookstore, she might still be in business."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hints From Will Shortz - Better Than Cheating!","review":"This is a terrific introduction to New York Times crosswords.The seventy-five daily crosswords here run the gamut of difficulty, beginning with the easiest and going all the way to the tough end-of-the-week puzzles. And for each crossword, there are a few asterisked clues with hints in the back of the book. These hints give us information that most of us had to figure out on our own the hard way, through trial and error (mostly error). For example, Shortz tells us that clues always agree in number and tense. Seems obvious now, but I didn't know that until I'd muscled through some puzzles. A question mark after a clue means a tricky (possibly punny) answer, NYTimes puzzles don't tell you if an answer consists of more than one word, well you get the idea.Even though New York Times Crosswords to Boost Your Brainpower is an excellent intro to Shortz-era NYTimes puzzles, it is also a lot of fun for old-timers, too."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Buy.","review":"I gave this two stars instead of one because it was sturdy and came with a glass shade. It is painted not plated. Not metalic. The paint was very very poor quality. Spots were missing paint. There was a scratch. Paint had rubbed off on the packing materials.

I decided to take a chance. When it was delivered I couldn't wait to try it out. I have pretty bad arthritis in my left shoulder and thought that if this worked it would be wonderful. Amazingly comfortable once I got it secured onto my shoulder, it was nice and taught all around.After trying the 3 levels of heat I was amazed at the lack of heat. I also noticed that down the middle of the heat pouch is a 3-inch wide seam. It feels like there are heating elements in there but there is little-to-no heat felt in that area. That is especially where I would like to apply heat.Absolutely, do not throw away your old flat heating pad, as they say in the Product Features section .. you will want it back after using this thing.Needless to say I'm sending it back. My disappointment in this product is giving off more heat than it does."},{"rating":"2","title":"Arthiritis relief","review":"I bought this contour heating pad for my mother who has had 2 rotator cuff surgeries in addition to arthritis.

Based on her reaction, I would recommend this pad for joints needing heat to relieve pain."},{"rating":"1","title":"Needs to go back ot the drawing board","review":"The removable strap that connects the pad to your body is not as illustrated, is poorly designed and does not work well. Also, I was led to believe that the heat control included a timer that would go off automatically after a set time. The heat control is very primitive and does not have any auto-off features. In this age of technology there is no excuse for this. Speaking from someone that has seriously burned my leg with a heating pad that took over a year to heal I would NEVER buy a heating pad that did not have a timing feature with auto-off presets."},{"rating":"1","title":"BAD saler","review":"This saler cancel my order without notice me, no matter what is their reason, no salers should be allowed to act like buyer, however, I didn't received any responce from Amazon after I report the saler's act."},{"rating":"2","title":"An idea to help keep the pieces together when playing","review":"We gave this building set to my son for his third birthday. I agree with another reviewer who said that this toy needs a carrying case. I have twin 7 month-olds who will soon be on the move, and I'll be nutso trying to keep up with the small pieces. To help alleviete this problem, I keep the pieces in the original box. When my 3 year-old wants to play with them, I put the pieces on a large cookie sheet with 1\\" sides. The rods stick to the sheet, and the sides of the cookie sheet keep the balls from rolling everywhere. Happy building!"},{"rating":"2","title":"fun for kids and adults","review":"A great toy for everyone. I spend as much time as my son playing with it. The only real complaint I have is the ratio of rods to balls. 70 pieces is great, but it breaks down into 40 rods and 30 balls or something. Well, rods are far more useful than the balls are, and I ALWAYS end up with alot of spare balls, wishing I had more rods instead. That we cannot purchase JUST rods is a shame."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not just for kids!","review":"My father has a set of these, supposedly for the grandkids, but the kids aren't the only ones that can't seem to put them down.

Although the manufacturer lists choking hazard, it does not list that swallowing the product could cause death! The magnets have a tendancy to come out of the rods with play and become only the size of peas, very easy to lose and get into the hands of a young child or pet. If the magnets are ingested in the body, they can connect together inside places such as the colon and cause a blockage that could kill an individual. This happened here in Seattle to a little boy. Do NOT purchase this product if you have young children or pets around at all."},{"rating":"2","title":"Birthday Blast","review":"I live in The Bahamas and for my nephews 8th birthday party he only invited 6 of his best friends from school. I bought him 2 boxes of magnetix and a toy motorcycle.

They even had a bouncing castle for fun outside but it was just monies wasted but the magnetix made up for that. This is a great item for kids, especially those who like to build!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This set is great fun!","review":"My daughter (8 years old) requested this set for her birthday, and ended up playing with it exclusively the whole day! Her 5 year old cousin loved it also, and they played quietly for hours. Even the adults took turns building something.The magnets are super strong, and the \\"creations\\" don't fall apart. They are easy to clean up, as they all stick together. The pieces are colorful, but I would like a set with more than four colors.

One of the sword either arrived with a leak or developed one in the first 30 minutes of play between our 5 and 7 year olds. I don't know if it is the extended construction of the \\"blade\\" or just a defect, but very disappointing.During play, the swords tend to be a little too \\"gentlemanly\\" compared to the boppers.If you have kids that want to hit each other, go with the regular socker boppers.

Some of the errors I can correct, because there are two choices and one doesn't sound right. But this is extremely complex music -- all of Iberia is -- and in some cases, it's difficult to know what Albeniz actually wrote. I bought this because I was frustrated by the difficulty these days of obtaining piano scores (Patelson's in New York and Yesterday Service in Cambridge, MA, two of my favorites, are now closed). A mistake. Now I will try a little harder and get myself a real edition. It makes no sense to devote the time and effort to learning music as difficult as this from a (very) substandard edition."},{"rating":"2","title":"Plastered from the master.","review":"Having had, as many people did, my first taste of Ralph via Hunter S Thompson's books, I found this to be a great introduction to the Hyperactive and frantic style of a dude who is probably my favourite artist. This has a forward by Hunter, gives great colour examples of his works in the realm of Gonzo, and also has many written, poetical works, and songs. My fave piece is 'Stand up and be counted.' IE: The maverick beast will ALWAYS raise his head in the crowd. A perfect definition of Gonzo."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"It never got too weird for me.\\"","review":"A strange look at the wildly furious and highly detailed works of Mr. Steadman.

In his (their) first book, Secret Fighting Arts Of The World, Gilbey (Smith) gave a very good narrative of useful and real techniques although experience and a good deal of thought were required to fill in the gaps of information needed to make most of the techniques work. In this second book the author has done a formidable job of saying next to nothing. The work is filled with inconsistencies as well as typographical, syntaxique and spelling errors and has a rather boring and awkward style.

It also announces its name(\\"Hooked On Phonics Smart Sticks\\") every time you turn it off or on, whichcan get annoying.

If you want something like this just watch Kenshin...And if you're looking for a worthy substitute for RK I am dissapointed to say that this isn't it. *But I would like to take this time to recommend three really good anime shows that you must see if you haven't already - Berserk(fantasy/sorcery), Paranoia Agent(psychological/suspense) and as far as the robotic series go I would highly recommend Bubble Gum Crisis.

In my opinion, Aesop Rock and Hangar 18 really make up Def Jux, with RJD2, Mr. Lif, and El-P being merely groupies. Of course, that leaves eveyone else to not even be mentioned. Overall, this CD almost makes you not want to pick it up, it seems so distant, like it doesn't want you included. Just as the cover reads: \\"'Cause Motherf*@$ers are Bored\\", it seems as though this compliation wasn't all that well thought out, even Aes' original track isn't his 'best'.

It is a brilliant period piece with all of the Victorian and British imperial social and class conflicts beautifully architected. Having read all of The Palliser novels, one gets a real appreciation of the art of the screen writer who has taken the richness of the many plot lines and woven them into a sequential story line that is a delight to watch."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good but with major faults","review":"This is a great series but the liberties that they take with the characters are very irritating and keep me from giving it a 5 star rating.The first story in the series is Can You Forgive Her? and it is about Alice, not Glencora. Glencora doesn't enter the novel till over 100 pages into it but the video series focuses on Glencora and Plantagenet from the opening.My second large objection is the preposterous idea that Phineas Finn gets Mary pregnant and is forced to marry her. Trollope is clear that he only kisses her once (behind a door) and Finn finally goes back to her at the end of the second novel, Phineas Finn, because he keeps remembering 'his Mary', and he longs for her and all that she represents.I do like how odiously Lizzie Eustace is portrayed in the section devoted to the third book. I had to assure my boys that she definitely gets hers in the end!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Let's Get Something Straight...","review":"Everyone who claims to be a poet is not a poet. Jewel and Ashanti should stick to singing. Derek Alexander is a pop and R&B songwriter at best. I agree with the reviewer who said that these are basically good, clean lyrics. Not RAP, though. Does Ricki Lake have a book club? if she does, it would be right up there near the top. This book is hardly ready for Oprah and too clean for Jerry. Derek, you are not a poet.

If you love American architecture, this has just about every type of American style home scetched with precision, each architectural detail explained. Each home is identified by its style, and where exactly it is located, with interesting tidbits about the owners or location added. Being from NJ, it was interesting to see that there is one specific style seen only in Salem County, NJ, which is right around the corner from me.

This animus takes things so far as to rewrite the facts as fiction. Rewarding history can also be found in the 700-page tome, The Siege by Conor Cruise, O Jerusalem by Larry Collins and Dominque LaPierre and From Time Immemorial by Joan Peters. Anything on Israel by Bernard Lewis, Anita Shapira, or Efraim Karsh is likewise leagues ahead of this nonsense."},{"rating":"1","title":"informative but off the mark","review":"Mr. Segev has written yet another history of Israel. THis time the topic is Israels first year in existence. He touches on such topics as; secularism vs. religion, settling the territories, arab lands, immigration. His argument is simple. THe Jews, having defeated the Arab in the 48 war, treat their neighboors badly while at the same time creating a theocratic state and encouraging Jews(who according to him were living peacefully with their arab neighboors) to emigrate to Israel. This book is very informative and well written but its argument is wrong. For a less biased account I would recommend \\"From time immemorial\\". For an account of the war read 'O Jerusaleum'. Segev does no justice to the heroics of the early Jews who built a strong state in the face of enemies, but he does try and substantiate Arab claims that they were forced off their lands(after murdering thier Jewish neighboors of course). Be careful with this book it is biased."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh PLEASE!! Bland and boring doesn't begin to describe","review":"I almost can't believe I read this book to completion. The only saving grace was the subplot with the twins. I also read Twin Peril, and wish I had read it first, and skipped this one entirely. The heroine in this novel was the most insipid character I have ever, EVER imagined. She was like a caricature of every vaporish ton female that the other books make fun of. Good grief, when she meets her future husband's family, they all like her and approve of her, but she faints at the table anyway because of the \\"strain\\". I have ordered other books from this author, and am now wondering why in the world I did that. I sure hope better things are to come."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bland and Boring","review":"I am not a fan of regencies that devote almost the entire story to a couple solving the \\"big misunderstanding\\" concept that usually could have been solved in one conversation. That being said, however, SOMETHING needs to happen to make a story interesting. Lady Sarah Mallory, the Welsh beauty, and Lord Dunnelly, while attractive, were, well, boring. I have to agree that there is really no way outside of Sarah being an idiot, that she would not have realized that her nervous trembling reaction to Dunnelly was attraction. Yes, I know, some girls were quite shelted but her cluelessness was silly. The evil twin and the brother were the only interesting people in this story.

This line of toys are very durable are cute, and are excellent for birthdays & holidays--these smaller sets would make great stocking stuffers. The set I bought did not come with the carrots, but that's a nice touch, I think. The LPS toys are cute & inoffensive (well PETA may have a problem with them, I guess...), and the magnet in the bunny works with other magents in other LPS sets.

This collection of concerts was amazing. The Fort Lauderdale concert was so well done and so reflective of her magical voice. For those who have never heard her sing, it shows what a phenom really is. For those of us who grew up with her work, it can bring a tear to your eye as you go down memory lane. She takes time to talk to laugh with the audience between songs. It's a nice way of letting new and old listeners get to know her. This could be the best and last \\"Barbara\\" concert ever recorded so I recommend getting this collection. I liked it so much I bought one for my mother.

Here are the reasons: First of all, it is over stuffed, way too hard and heavy. I tried several ways to use it for nursing, but none of the position is comfortable for me and my baby. Secondly, if you want to use the wedge for the reflux baby, forget this one. Baby will fell off the wedge all the time. You just can't keep her in position for more than 3 minute. Third, the pillow cover can't be removed for washing. Lastly, you can not return this pillow and get refund, the cozyme company just offer \\"repair\\" or \\"replace\\"!! How can they repair a pillow due to the poor product design?!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointingly HARD","review":"I reviewed TONS of baby pillows prior to purchasing this one. Boy did I make a bad decision! Primarily I wanted to buy a pillow for nursing, and I thought this one had added benefits of multiple uses (with the removable wedge and roll) and the price. I brought this to the hospital for my first breastfeeding session with my newborn, and it was absolutely terrible! The pillow is too overstuffed and awkward to position. If you want this pillow for nursing, look elsewhere (since then I have bought both the Brestfriend and Boppy -- LOVED the breastfriend for nursing, and the Boppy is good for tummy time & sitting up, good for BFing but not as good as Brestfriend).However this pillow is good to use with the wedge and support your little one sitting up. However I'd rather have the Boppy for that -- more uses and better looking, although pricier.I guess for these products, you really do get what you pay for."},{"rating":"1","title":"never used it","review":"it just wasn't real user friendly. kinda bulky and inefficient. way to big for a newborn to be propped up on."},{"rating":"1","title":"Product OK, Shipping was bad","review":"I ordered this item ten days before the baby shower, on the Thursday before MLK day.

No one got back with me until after I had complained with Amazon several days later. The item finally arrived the day after the baby shower. It was embarrassing to not have the gift at the shower (which I was helping to host!). I am still trying, three weeks later, to coordinate with the mom-to-be to get the pillows to her. It is late in her pregnancy and she has lots more things to worry about than trying to find a time to meet up with me to get the pillows she should have been able to get at her shower.I will never again use an online registry for a baby/wedding shower.

As other reviewers have said, Mills uses a spare, deadpan approach; his humor is dry. The comedy is black and not all will find the events depicted here funny. I had an idea who Tam and Richie(two laborers building an extremely long fence)were, but it was mostly in my own imagination because Mills doesn't give us much character description.I thought this was a witty and captivating tale with an eerie sense of impending doom hanging over the proceedings. I recommend this book to fans of offbeat literature."},{"rating":"1","title":"Insipid book","review":"If you want a story that goes nowhere with glacier-like character development, this is it.

It is a dull read with one dimensional characters, bad dialogue and a hackneyed job of plot construction. As to comments that this book is Kafkaeque due to its \\"dark\\" noirish overtones. Wrong. Kafka's works inspired fear and dread about society's compassionless bureaucracy and inhuman conspiracy to sacrifice certain members. The Restraint of Beats inspires nothing, except a desire to read real writers like Kafka."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it or hate it - I love it!","review":"This seems to be a 'love it' or 'hate it' book. The friend who gave it to me told me I could burn it when I was finished. I loved it!! Like a couple of other reviewers I laughed aloud while reading (not something I'm prone to do).Enjoyment of this book obviously depends on the type of humour you appreciate.

The characters were good but the ending was abrupt and without closure. I was even wondering whether the last pages were missing (unfortunately, no). It is a quick read so I don't feel it was a waste. Take from it what you can and then pick up All Quiet on the Orient Express."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Restraint of Readers","review":"This is a story of three men who built high-tension fences for the restraint of beasts but found themselves under the restraint in the end. Editorial review speaks about black humor and promises that \\"readers will remember this book and laugh, long after they have finished reading it\\". Some events of the novel are rather black but it is a real slog to find any humor and I do not even smile during reading.

As I grow older and return to reread books from my youth, I often find myself wondering why I found the book in question so captivating.

This is not worth it!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A must read book that you can't wait to share with others.","review":"I Love time travel, and this was very unique. It did not jump right in with the time travel like most of time travel books, and that was a very refreshing change. If you love suspence,and the magic of time travel, this book is a must. The story of Grace, combined with the tragic death of her brother and husband, and the quick thinking she does to keep on with her research in finding out why they were murdered. The feeling of desperation and not being able to trust anyone but herself and a young friend is so realistic. Though most of the book in placed in the present time, the way she finally unravels the mystery of time to call on Black Niall is worth the wait in this book. And of course the ending was a happy one. This is a very well written book with action, suspence, the magic of time travel, and romance all mixed into one. It is a MUST read"},{"rating":"2","title":"Engaging book - fun read!","review":"I really enjoyed reading this book - it was a quick read and very engaging. I think the comparison to Outlander is unfair - what, no one is allowed to ever again write another book about time travel or kilts? The book actually reminded me more of The Fugitive than anything else.I liked the heroine and her story - really interesting to see her ordeal unravel and watch her make decisions and research the past, tying it to the present. The one thing that was missing for me was the romantic connection...I'm not sure I would call it a love story...it was more of a lust story. I never really saw the love connection, especially from Black Niall's viewpoint. It seemed like he was always ditching her, and then later when he got a little horny, he would miss her and wish he hadn't left her behind. All in all, it was a great read and I'd recommend it for anyone who wants to read a romantic novel with a little bit of history, sci-fi, and suspense rolled in."},{"rating":"2","title":"Filled w/history, romance & sensualtiy.","review":"This type of book is out of character for LH, but she should seriously consider doing more time travel. It was fantastic. BTW, to the reader from san diego, ca who bashed this book. do a little research yourself, you'll find that not just the ancient israelites, but many other peoples worshipped the male & female aspect of god. and of course, many people continue to do so today. get over your religious hang-ups & maybe you would have enjoyed this book more."},{"rating":"2","title":"My favorite book from Linda Howard!!!","review":"This book was absolutely outstanding. I know a great deal of her work ends up in the \\"Romance\\" section but I can't say that's particularly accurate. Her fiction (this book in particular) is a unique blend of thriller, intense relationships and the supernatural. The sensual content is often stunning with only occasional vulgarity (which I believe is more an aspect of a character, than an expression of the writer.) Son of the Morning kept me enthralled as I wondered how the heroine would cope with the incredible turn her life had taken. I enjoyed her transformation and I appreciate the care Ms. Howard took in letting the story unfold. \\"Romance\\" is too sticky sweet a generalization of her writing style and content. They should have a special section for writers like this called, \\"Passion\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hot and Historical","review":"Hot--so hot it burns your fingers. Thrilling--characters that get into your bloodstream and overtake your life. Filled with all the delicious minutia that set the hearts of Brit-niks and Histormaniacs a-flutter. And a nice dolop of mystery too. I don't know how many times I re-read the last few chapters of this book, because I could not bear to let go of the characters and their story. After reading the book all day, I found myself dreaming about it at night. And don't even get me started on how much in love I am with Black Niall....Read it--you won't be disappointed. ...Now what was the percentage of salt in that solution..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cannot Force Myself to Finish It !!","review":"This is the worse book I've read in years !!!

In fact it started my love of the topic. It was a brilliant combination of action on the edge of your seat and steamy romance.

Can't wait to read the next one!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"All time favorite book!!","review":"Linda Howard is a truly gifted writer.

Black Niall, Knight of the Templar has haunted me in dreams, just as he did the heroine Grace St John. It's a heart wrenching, yet fun and exciting read.I highly recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Kept me on the chair edge...","review":"I'm not usually into the \\"fierce Scottish Highlander\\" romance books so I was surprised that I liked this book a lot. Of course Black Niall doesn't really make an appearance until a ways into the book. Grace is a very likeable character. I could admire her for the courage it took to run successfully the way she did after seeing her husband and brother murdered. Linda Howard made her a smart heroine to be able to survive the way she did for nearly a year all the while translating the documents her loved ones were killed for. The time travel aspect also was an added bonus as was the premise of the Knights Templar treasure being hidden in Scotland. I've heard that theory before so it was most interesting that Linda Howard chose to tie it into this novel. All in all it was a good and exciting read."},{"rating":"1","title":"WHAT HAPPENED HERE???!!!---","review":"OMGosh! How stupid can one woman be??? But first, know that this book was 95 percent repeated ramblings of the heroine's inner thoughts. It became teeth-grinding to get through most of it as boring doesn't come close to describing it. The other 5 percent mainly takes place at the end and is very, very rushed. I CANNOT BELIEVE this was written by the same author who wrote HEART OF FIRE and AFTER THE NIGHT--both very enjoyable and well spaced tales."},{"rating":"1","title":"Son of the Morning","review":"As a long time Linda Howard fan, this is the first book I have ever wanted for it to actually end. This book, in my opinion, was hard to follow, hard to focus on, and really confusing. I would NOT reccomend this book. I will remain a Linda Howard fan, but this book will not remain in my large collection."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as Good as I thought it Would Be.","review":"I was really looking forward to reading this book. It sounded very interesting. The two stars is for the beginning. The start of the book was not bad. I felt for Grace and the loss of her husband and brother. Her life on the run was well written and exciting. The book took a nose dive when she decided to time travel. The whole experience was very unbelievable. I would not call Grace and Niall's relationship love, I would call it lust! Most women I know would never choose to go back to the 14th century to have their baby. Very unbelievable!!! If you want time travel, romance, adventure, and hunky Scotsmen read Diana Gabaldon's Oulander series. You will not be disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a good story,","review":"I did not like this book at all altho I am (as a rule) a Linda Howard fan. The story was stupid and I had trouble making myself finish it. Time TraveL Romance quite simply is not Linda Howard's edge (in my opinion), she should stick at what she does best and leave this genre to Roberts or another writer on the this topic."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Rip Off About Rape","review":"This is a direct and unmistakeable imitation of the far superior \\"Outlander\\" by Diana Gabaldon. For that alone, it deserves the lowest rating. But the romance between the protagonists is quite disturbing. Their first sexual encounter is one in which the heroine, Grace St. John, is fully expecting to be killed by the hero, Black Niall. While she waits for a fatal sword stab, Niall gets her on her knees and rapes her. I'm sure others will quibble about the term, but when the woman is literally expecting to be gutted and is forcefully put into a position for penetration without her consent, it is rape. Forced climax does NOT absolve it of that term, any more than it would for a man. Suffice it to say, I did not think this book was good."},{"rating":"1","title":"Last Linda Howard I Buy","review":"I thought this book was absolutely dreadful.Grace loses the love of her life but immediately (days, weeks...) is having 'dream sex' with someone else? Oh wait - she did cry once, at the end.The whole reason Parrish is after Grace is moronic. You wait through almost the entire book and your still shaking your head. What? He wanted the 'knowledge'? Hitler makes an appearance? Satan?Where was the scene involving the kitchen sink? Then the great reveal of what the 'power' is.I found the answer so totally offensive that I couldn't believe what I read. Would the author feel she could use one of her books to grievously offend Muslims? Buddhists? Anyone else? Is it only Christianity that you can offend?Ms Howard is a Romance novelist. She should keep religion out of it.I have been on a Linda Howard kick. I have 2 more of her books coming in today, this makes 14. I'll be sending those back unopened. I'll be trashing the others.Too bad..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Her best ever","review":"This is the best book Howard has written so far. I have read all of her books and none compare to this one. Some have been downright disappointing. This is a definite must read. I've read it several times already."},{"rating":"1","title":"*yawn*","review":"Quite honestly, this was the only LH novel I had to FORCE myself to finish reading. The beginning dragged on with repetitive info that really didnt seem all that important to the plot. I've read some of the glowing reviews here, I don't agree with most. Yes, it IS a soso read ( not great ) compared to other romance-thriller authors but it is not up to par with LH's talent in this genre. In no way would I consider this book a romance novel ( not even small amount ) so compare a normal thriller author with this... then I would consider this book \\"horrible\\", since it never through out the book capture my attention with anything but boredom. Frankly, it was dull... *sigh* The romance I looked forward to didnt come til the last 100pg ( or less) of the book. It seemed rushed, not very emotional... so, overall.. if you're grabbing this book for romance, grab something else, if you're looking for heart pounding action... this book isnt for you either."},{"rating":"2","title":"Son Of The Morning","review":"I will never be able to say enough about the books that Linda Howard writes! I picked this up and 1 day later set it down wishing for more. Linda you should write more time travels this story was fantastic!

Makes me want to read more of her books!","review":"I loved this book. The funny thing is I was putting off reading it. I just didnt know if I would really like it. I could kick myself. It was great. It was totally different than I thought it would be though. I have been going through a historical romance stage and I thought thats what this was. In a way it is but it is more other stuff than romance. The heroine doesnt even meet the hero until more than half way through the book except in dreams. Hot dreams for sure, but dreams none the less. Even so, I have to say this book makes me want to read all Mrs. Howards other books. I dont think anyone can be disappointed they spent many hours with this keeper!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Son of morning - memorable, complete, sets the bar high !!","review":"I read this book years ago. It is one you can read over again and again. Howard created a fantastic fantasy hero and heroine. Grace starts life soft, and developes into a strong,tough women. Black Niall is strong, reliable and sexy all over! What Howard does so well with this novel is blend the historical romance aspect with the modern day suspense, action romance. There is tragedy, suspense, intelligence and romance, that keeps this novel moving through time at a page turning rate, Even the peripheral characters are well developed. This book leaves you wanting to see these characters again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Prepared to be captured!!","review":"Once again, Linda Howard has outdone herself. The build up in this story is so stimulating...you will not be able to put it down!! So, make sure you have a night to read it!! It was sexy, exciting, suspenseful, and romantic.

Although the romance took second place in this book (the hero & heroine didn't meet until hundreds of pages later), I fell in love with Grace, the heroine. Linda Howard really fleshed out Grace's character to the max. We saw Grace's change from a sheltered scholar / wife / sister living in a small town, to a street smart woman on the run who must be able to defend herself from a bunch of murderous group who killed her husband and brother. I have rarely read a romance book with a female character so well developed, so strong, yet so vulnerable which made her so real. In the end, this is definitely Grace's story and I couldn't help but cheered for her when she got her just ending."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow!","review":"I loved this book.

This is a good album, but it is ruined by silly filler (\\"Tommy Can You Hear Me\\", \\"There's A Doctor\\"), simply there to get the story across. I think that it would have been possible to make REAL songs to fill these ideas. However, there are enough fantastic songs on this record to make up for it. Many songs on this could have been singles easily enough, although most of them (\\"Pinball Wizard\\", \\"We're Not Gonna Take It\\") make sense only in the context of the album. There are no actual songs on this album that are truly bad: if you don't like the melody, read the lyrics, and vise versa. I think that this album (for me at least) places the Who as the 2nd best artists of all time, and Pete Townsend the 2nd best songwriter."},{"rating":"2","title":"FANTASTIC","review":"I tip my hat to Peter Townsend, great songs, great album, great group.

I know some of you will say Who's Next or Quadrephenia. I could accept arguments for Who's Next, but I still give Tommy the nod because of its ambition and abundance of good melodies and good playing. Quad is way too ambitious to be enjoyable. It is as exhausting to listen to as it must have been to make. Tommy signals the end of the 60's ethos. The hippie thing had become commercialized and enlightenment would have to be pursued individually, not en masse. For the youngsters who don't get it, well, we're gonna leave you behind with the kids are alright!! You had to be there and if you weren't, this is as close as you'll ever get.

However, when I listen to it now the whole thing seems kind of sluggish. When you listen to 'Live at Leeds' you realize how much the visceral energy improves the music, especially on numbers like 'Christmas' and 'Go to the Mirror.' While there are certain numbers in which the studio polish helps out (usually involving the singers being on pitch), on the whole the 'Live at Leeds' recording is infinitely superior to the studio production (also, the program of the live performance is more streamlined).To recap: If you want the best performance of 'Tommy' available, stick with 'Live at Leeds.'

The story of Tommy is not even the Who's. While the music of Tommy is great, and some of the Who's best, the album itself is a crime. The real first rock opera is S.F. Sorrow by the Pretty Things, a psychedelic band from San Franciso, released in 1968.The album is a rock opera and tells virtually the exact same story as Tommy, except the protaganist;s name is S.F. Sorrow, not Tommy. For some reason, The Who not only gets the credit for making the first rock opera, but also for a story they didn't even think of. I like the Who a lot, but this album is a complete slap in the face to The Pretty Things. Townsend even admitted that most of his influence for Tommy came from S.F. Sorrow, but forgot to say the reason was its the same story and concept of Tommy."},{"rating":"1","title":"the real \\"who sell out album\\"","review":"Believe your ears people.

It's that clear.) Even a classic like \\"Pinball Wizard\\" reveals all new details, including an extended ending with pinball sounds. The bonus disc is revealing as well, and satisfies even those who needed \\"Dogs Pt. 2\\" in stunning surround sound.

Pinball Wizard really impressed me though. You could really hear Townsend on that one and I could imagine him in my living room windmilling. The 5.1 mix is definately worth the price of this CD. I don't have a review of the other tracks, because I'm listening to them right now, but they aren't bad.Anyways, with releases like this, I am hoping this means that SACD will beat out DVD Audio.

Pero lo que salva y por lo que le doy 4 estrellas, son las interpretaciones de Jordan Officer, simplemente soberbias.

This, along with a few others that have been recently released, turned out to be a big disappointment. I couldn't enjoy a single minute of this the extremely outdated and kitsch show. The music is terrible. Everything has a ridiculous 80s edge that completely kills any aesthetic qualities that I'd associated with CdS. Before I've seen this I had thought that all of their shows were timeless. Apparently, the earlier ones are not.

She nevertheless can tell me, by title which one she wants to watch and we agree that Saltimbanco, Allegria and Quidam are our favourites. So when I popped this one into the machine you can't imagine our disappointment. Pathetic and amateurish and a DVD which should never be seen by anyone, let alone sold to an audience.

My only regret is there isn't one of National League players for the same time period."},{"rating":"2","title":"Encouraging","review":"Watchman Nee gives so much insight in this book, that it is hard to read in one setting. There is so much revelation to be gleaned. The chapters each seem like they could be separate books. The most significant revelation came from the chapter on pressure. He says without pressure there is no power. Great word illustrations accompany his profound teaching. If you've ever experienced pressure to the point where you thought you were going to burst, then this book is for you. I do reccomend this book to people who are tired of fluff reading. Although , I greatly disagree with his opinions on water baptism, this book is a must read. The last chapter was a perfect way to end the book, leaving you with hope and an increased awareness of the awesomeness of the God."},{"rating":"2","title":"A fun little romp in the dungeon.","review":"The Savage Caves by T.H. Lain is a quick and fun return to what gaming should be and can be. Lain does an excellent job of giving the reader a solid little story that has re-kindled my intrest in gaming. The characters (based on D&D 3rd's ICON Characters) are fleshed out and stay true to the character class they represent. Now I am not going to say that this new series is Dragonlance or The Forgotten Realms, its a little stripped down. But thats ok. This little novel is action packed and predictable, but its so FUN. The dialog is pretty funny and a bit hokey, but he only had 182 pages. Hopefully as the series continues, Lain will give us a little more seasoning and depth, but for now enjoy a quick fun read. Forget the grand morality plays, let Lain place a torch in your hand and a mace in the other. Explore the Savage Caves, and still be back in time for bed. A good start to a new book line. Looking forward to the Living Dead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bland, Unintersting, but thankfully short.","review":"The story from this book is like reading an actual Dungeons and Dragons game. It's very straightfoward and reads like a D&D adventure. I enjoyed it for the most part because I play D&D and just like to read anything about it.However, T.H. Lain has got some real work to do if he ever wants to be a real author. The story is not written well at all. Some of the conversations between the characters are laughable - and not the ones that are supposed to be humorous. There are parts where I had to re-read paragraphs because his writing style just lost me. It's not really a writing style, more of a lack of writing skills.If you want a fair quick read, go ahead and pick it up... otherwise there are tons of other great fantasy books to read that are much much better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great job","review":"This was a gift for my sister - it arrived quickly, well-packed so no damage during shipping, and she really likes it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ahhhh","review":"This is my very very favorite tea.

The whole thing is made terribly. It barely stands upright, and the little plastic chains that suspend the one set of platforms keep coming off the little plastic hooks.

This is an interesting attempt, but the English chamber choir approach does NOT work with Slavic church music. The basses are too polite, the baritones too clear, the tenors too swan-like, the altos too modest, the sopranos too bright. The different sections have varying success with the Church Slavonic/Russian \\"oo\\" vowel -- none of them produces it far back in the mouth enough to be convincing. After ten seconds of listening to this, and finding it intriguing to hear the different parts of the pieces articulated more specifically than a real Russian or Slavic choir would do, I lost interest and just found it sad and thin. Like hearing the Mormon Tabernacle Choir do Negro spirituals. If you want to hear more precision in this kind of music -- if real Russian choirs are too \\"heavy\\" for you -- try the Estonian Philharmonic Chamber Choir. At least they get the spirit and pronunciation right."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best book on this subject (category: ever)","review":"It is a crime that this indispensable book is out of print."},{"rating":"2","title":"repetitive","review":"Boring, there is no need to read past the first few chapters, all of the main points are repeated in the second half."},{"rating":"1","title":"Know-it-alls...","review":"Jesus said \\"He that does not 'know' says...He that 'knows' does not say...\\"These fellow authors and reviewers who categorically rip drugs fail to recognize the fact that chemical imbalances DO occur; drugs DO have a place.

This fear mongering has continued unabated for 50 years despite a complete absence of any solid evidence that mental and emotional problems are caused by brain pathology. Valenstein argues convincingly that psychiatric chemical imbalance theories are seriously flawed and reveals the marketing and hype behind the push to convince us that life is essentially a disease. Psychiatric treatment leads invariably and inevitably to diminishing mental and physical health. Read Valenstein's book and you'll gain a great deal of insight into why that is true."},{"rating":"2","title":"Psychicatric Madness","review":"Elliot Valenstein's book is at the same time informative, provocative and disturbing. He has analyzed a dense literature and distilled from it key ideas that run counter to the current dogma of psychiatry and other \\"helping professions,\\" the currently fashionable view that so-called mental illnesses of many types are brain disorders. Valenstein prepares the reader with a well-crafted history of biological psychiatry, followed by a knoweldgable and intelligent critical analysis of the literature. This is a book that deserves a wide readership but, alas, will probably not receive it. The juggernaut of the brain psychiatrists and their sympathizers is just too overwhelming to give Valenstein's book the careful reading it deserves. I look forward to his next work, which I hope would examine the related claims for a biological basis of ADHD, homosexuality, alcoholism, and the like."},{"rating":"1","title":"Typical Belkin Junk","review":"I wasted a couple hours of life on this JUNK.Decides for itself when you want to change inputs.If you push the button, 50% of time it fails to correctly hold new signal after user button press, swapping you back to other machine.

So I can't speak to any software issues -- all I'm trying to do is plug the thing in and try to press the button to switch from one computer to the other.The product behaves erratically, switching between computers at random while I'm working.

The technique is there, but its primary function is to facilitate Stowell's thinking as he plays life into these traditional forms. There is no flash; nothing aims to impress. Stowell is simply trying -- with consistent success -- to do something interestingly new and musical with each of these standards. Each of these improvisations is a pleasure to contemplate."},{"rating":"2","title":"Inspirational","review":"This book by Henry Fernandez is a motivational tool that will get anyone off there butts and do what they have been dreaming of doing there whole lives. He gives real life examples of how faith is the key to success in everyones life and your daily life in general. This book has given me that spark that has been missing, to get back into my field which I had went to school for and will be opening my business very soon. As well as motivating, it encourages you to focus on your goals in life that there is nothing to hard if you have faith in yourself as well as in God. Even though I had past failures he tells you to still keep the faith alive and keep believing that you can do all things if you have faith.

Lora Roberts does an excellent job portraying the edgier side of life in her Liz Sullivan series, where money isn't always available and sometimes the Thrift Shop is a necessity. Yet, she also manages to lighten this with some wonderful and sly humor and engaging friends. Liz's friends (including her dog) bring her much needed support and enrich the stories though they take a backseat in this book (except for a couple of memorable and surprisingly funny scenes at gunpoint). This particular book in the series was mesmerizing.

It got onto the \\"Singles\\" collection, so I wish it - as well as a couple others - had been kept off the \\"Greatest Hits\\". Some much better choices would have been some of Hynde's own compositions like \\"Show Me\\", or \\"My Baby\\", or perhaps \\"Never Do That\\" from the much-over-looked \\"Packed\\" album. If there were to be covers included on this album (CD), I think the band's rendition of 10CC's \\"I'm Not In Love\\", from the \\"Indecent Proposal\\" sound track, would have been a much better choice.But, all in all, an excellent collection from one of my all-time favorite bands and singer/songwriter."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Complete Collection","review":"Chrissie Hyndes is a rock goddess!

I will probably pick it up later, but right now, I am eager to start Power Play."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Thriller!","review":"This book keeps you on the edge of your seat from beginning to end! You find yourself wanting everything to work out for the main character, Nick Conover, but at the same time, feel for the cop who is relentlessly trying to prove his guilt. With the story's twists and turns, you can't wait to get to the next chapter. By the last few chapters, I was a nervous wreck! Highly recommended if you like a good thriller!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Every character is cardboard but the brainless protag","review":"This novel would have better served its audience as a made-for-TV movie that haunted the nether regions of the dial and clock. As compelling as the plot aims to be, the idea that a CFO and a board member could successfully conspire to sell a giant global corporation out from under the CEO suggests the protagonist is too brainless for readers to care about and certainly incapable of pulling off the Disneyishly convenient resolution to all his business and criminal problems. I'll try another novel by Finder to see where all his positive reviews come from, but this one is filled with trite dialogue emerging from non-credible situations encountered by a protag who stumbles through far too many crises with the assistance of a sexy child prodigy rather than his own brain and spine."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good but not great","review":"After reading Paranoia I couldn't wait to get my hands on Company Man, but found myself a bit disappointed. It just didn't have the suspense or originality of Paranoia, and there were times that I thought it was totally predictable. It does hold your interest, however, but if I had to do it again I'd wait until it came out in paperback."},{"rating":"1","title":"Predictable, ridiculous and a waste of time","review":"I predicted the outcome in the first 1/6 of the book. It was silly and so exaggerated that any reader of mysteries would easily predict the outcome. The use of \\"business jargon\\" is especially silly - business buzz words just tossed in here and there as if the author had a list of them he just had to use before he ended the book. Silly, and unimaginative - I am so sorry I spent the money and actually read the book - I hardly ever stop reading a book once I have started since I always expect to get something out of any book - this book - no - nothing. Don't waste your money or time. This author is not for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very entertaining!","review":"I usually dont read this type of book but I must say that I couldnt put it down.

It drags for a few pages in the middle, but the last 100 or so are real page turners, had a hard time putting it down."},{"rating":"2","title":"not as good as paranoia but still worth it","review":"Obviously Paranoia is 'the' book by Joseph Finder, however COmpany Man is a very entertaining read. Little slow at first but picks up speed about half way."},{"rating":"2","title":"4 1/2 Stars- Company Man ,Another Hit From The Thriller Man!","review":"While not quite as good as Paranoia, Finder's latest is another of his thrillers that you'll find hard to put down. Without going into a lot of detail, Company Man is about Nick Conover, CEO of a leading office furniture manufacturer, who is facing major problems at work and even bigger threats to his personal life. In typical Finder fashion, he weaves a plot of non-stop suspense and develops characters that are credible and interesting, but not without flaws. The only reason I haven't given Company Man a five star rating is that I felt the ending was somewhat predictable. Nonetheless, Finder's latest thriller is well worth the investment, both in time and money. Enjoy!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Are we talking about the same book here ???","review":"I my opinion Paranoia was a winner and the reason I gave Company Man a shot without thinking twice about it. In hindsight that might have been a bit naive but I never figured anyone who could put together a well written and entertaining thriller as that could put out a piece of junk as Company Man. The main character is one of the whimpiest \\"heroes\\" I have ever had the misfortune to come across. I mean, the guy has no spine at all and all he ever do is irritate the reader with his stupid, irrational decisions and cowardly actions. The plot is just plain stupid and only reason to finish the book is trying to postpone the realisation that you have been screwed. I can't believe all the positive reviews. This is pure garbage and there only right place for that is in the bin."},{"rating":"1","title":"Going through the motions","review":"I'm a big Joseph Finder fan and I have to say that I was very disappointed in his latest novel. I took this book with me on vacation and I have to say it was a chore to get though. The story could have been written in about 200 pages, not this 500 + behemoth. It appears that Mr. Finder was just going through the motions to satisfy his booking agent. The story was so cookie cutter written. It was like some one gave him a formula to follow. The twists and \\"surprise\\" ending was so predictable that you had it figured out 50 pages before it happened. Luckily, I had other books with me on the trip to remind me of the magic of reading. Let's hope that Mr. Finder spends a little more time on his next book or he will soon be on his way to the bargain bin."},{"rating":"2","title":"company man","review":"This author is a true genius in many ways.

He is placed in and kept in his CEO position because he was incompetent; wouldn't be a threat to either his old boss' reputation or the new owners. Of course, as a narcissist, he's completely unaware. The characters and settings are shallow and trite, including the business environment. The supporting character, a black female police officer is justification for out of place and shallow religious commentary. By the end, the hero is responsible for three unnecessary deaths and hasn't learned anything new, including anything about his children. Dark and depressing. Tough to finish; wouldn't have if I'd had something else with me. The author can write, but my guess is the mid-western business world isn't something he's familiar with so this was an awkward stretch."},{"rating":"1","title":"Maybe the moon was in the wrong place when I tried . . .","review":"I've seen glowing reviews of Joseph Finder's work, including this novel.

I used it daily for about six months with no trouble other than cleaning. Then, without overheating or other accident, it developed a crack in the safety valve under the lid. It is made of some sort of weak pot metal. This is the valve which seals in the steam and raises the safety button. Unfortunately it cannot be purchased alone. You must buy the handle and other parts as a kit--all of which costs nearly as much as a new pressure cooker. I had expected nothing would need replacement but the gasket.Between the weakness of the part and the lack of economical access to a replacement, I would say Fagor is selling a throw-away product, unfortunately, because it really does work well--at first."},{"rating":"2","title":"AH!

Windaria is a very melancholy story and the soundtrack follows suit. Action sequence music makes about a third of the tracks while the other two thirds are mood and songs.

It's true that even with a 10\\" thermometer stem the response time is too slow and a medium hot fire will not allow you to hold this bare-handed. It also means that you are waiting 30 seconds to get a temperature reading, which means you are always 30 seconds behind the curve. That's too long on a even a medium hot fire. Also got some mixed readings and it seemed that on the second try the alarm quit working. Lastly, the poultry setting (does not have a range) means that a whole bird is overdone by 10 degrees before you take it off the grill. Returned this thermometer and returned to simply monitoring cooking times for smaller meat and poultry. Works just as well if not better and certainly less aggravating."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not instant read!","review":"This thermometer is not instant read! It may be as instant as less expensive thermometers get, but that isn't necessarily saying much. If you want a thermometer that's instant enough to make it worth having a hand-held thermometer, go with the Thermapen thermometers. They're more expensive but they are the actual instant read thermometers. If your \\"instant read\\" thermometer involves you either holding your hand in the oven/grill for 15-20 seconds, or removing the food from the oven anyway, why not just use a regular old meat thermometer?We returned this thermometer, so I can't review how it holds up."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sweet design...useless thermometer","review":"The main reason I bought this item was for the design.

This is the only digital instant read that has a truly long stem. I purchased it for winemaking so I could reach below the cap while the grapes were fermenting and this was the only one with a long enough probe. I have since also used it for cooking. It has been accurate. I frequently test the accoracy by putting it into a glass filled with cruhed ice, water, and salt (32 degrees) and boiling water 212 degrees and it remains accourate today. Say it reads 208 at boiling, then assume your meat will be at 3-4 degrees higher than reading and go with that. The one drawback I find is it does take 30 seconds for the final accurate reading, 5 seconds you are within 5 degrees of where it stops. For the price this is acceptable for me and because of quality to price ratio and LONG stem I give it 4 stars!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great","review":"My gift was great my cook house has been brought into the 20th first century.

We are studying it at our parish, and I ordered the series so I could see the episodes again. This is a beautiful exposition of the Catholic Church and its beliefs. I would think most Catholics would find the production enjoyable, informative and interesting. Others who may be interested in what Catholicism is all about would enjoy it as well. I'm very glad I made this purchase."},{"rating":"2","title":"FANTASTIC","review":"It's Great that we can hear the story of our Catholic Faith on these dvd's... and from such a learned priest. Thank-you Father Barron. It is great to have you tell all who will listen, about our treasure.. our faith. The Catholic Church (as promised) is going to last to the end of time and is doctrinally sound; although we can't say the same for all its' many members. The Church is a hospital for sinners and saints, martyrs and persecutors. Watch these dvd's and learn.. as I pray you are enticed to study further. I'm sure after this labor of love, Father Barron can expect to hear these words, \\"\`Well done, good and faithful servant\\".."},{"rating":"1","title":"Grandiose","review":"This is a well-received series with serious positive endorsements. I know people impressed by it. I expected much and was disappointed. Neither my wife nor I liked it, thus two stars: \\"I don't like it.\\" So, I feel like the \\"odd man out\\" among reviewers.Entitling this series \\"Catholicism\\" is grandiose. It does not come near to presenting the faith in its fullness. The scenery and settings are often stunning, but often the presentation of the faith is not particularly deep. Sometimes it's unctuous. The blurb for the the final CD says \\"Father Barron presents the Catholic vision of death, judgment, heaven, hell and purgatory as he journeys to Florence, Ireland and Rome.\\" Really? I watched the CD but somehow missed his in depth treatment of The Four Last Things."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible! They did not deliver the product.

Everyone is enjoying the DVD but it sparks some great open conversations and learning moments.I would recommend this to every person that whats to experience the beginning, history and daily life of the Catholic Church. Father Barren speaks to everyone he does not use \\"churcheze\\" he simply is speaking to the viewer as if on a journey together.I have found it to be a wonderful tool for people that are Catholic and a great discussion opener to those who are looking into becoming Catholic. It is also great for evangelization as it is easy to pick and choose exactly what is watched for those who are Catholic but don't go to Mass regularly."},{"rating":"2","title":"Catholic Worldview","review":"This 10 part DVD series is about as comprehensive a view of what Catholicism is all about as you could imagine. The author is a well-known priest who puts things clearly and simply. The artworks and scenery are stunning. Many famous shrines and cathedrals are viewed as theological topics are explored. Fr Barron is entertaining without trying to be funny. Our youth have used this for short 20mins viewings followed by discussions as they prepare for World Youth Day.

The quality of the CD is not good, i can see bubbles in the disc, which i suspect the root cause of the problem. In addition, the media copy quality doesn't seem to be an excellent one.Those who have been selling the copies of these excellent series should make sure that they have the best quality media copy burn in a high quality disc.

I've never seen them present themselves and their faith in this way before. Immensely interesting, intelligent and beautiful to watch. Particularly for those who, like me, fall asleep at the slightest hint of an impending sermon or dogma. I can see it sparking a renewed interest in the faith, and perhaps draw many of the \\"lapsed\\" back to the fold. I even bought the workbook, that's how impressed I was!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A great learning tool, and entertaining","review":"Some of my ultra-conservative, traditional Catholic friends did not have kind things to say about this series. So, I had mixed feelings when I received the series as a birthday present from my husband. Given that I had it, and did not want to make my husband feel bad, I started watching it with him. I guess perhaps I did not know as much about my faith as I thought because I learned new and wonderful things about Catholicism every single time I watched. I recommend this series not only to Catholics, but to anyone who has a sincere desire to learn the deep wonders of the Catholic Faith."},{"rating":"1","title":"I want 6 hours of my life back","review":"Very disapointed.

I found that you definitely need to regulate the pressure going into this tool -- my best luck has been with 90lbs (or a bit less, though that's out of spec). Drives nails VERY accurately.Mine came with nails, so I'm pretty happy! I've bought plenty of refurbished tools... without any problems ever.

You meet these Special Ops characters up close and personal. You go with these guys and follow their story from the streets of Iraq and the deserts of Afghanistan to their secret headquarters. What's particularly great is that they are often far from what you'd expect. But it makes you feel better to know they're there. This film also traces the history of Special Forces.

I feel that I am better prepared for my trip to Tenerife because of this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not helpful for the experienced","review":"I have three years experience in graphic and motion design for the web. This book offered very very simplistic and, sometimes, downright ugly examples of layouts. They all looked like the hideous templates from any desktop publishing program - good for neighborhood flyers and family websites but useless to professionals. The book sometimes even re-used layouts for different sections. If you find yourself more inspired by very vivid complex design examples, not by overly simplistic ones, then this book is not for you. Also please be aware that the book is small, 6 inches high by 4.5 inches wide, with a plastic cover, reminiscent of a pocket trail map."},{"rating":"2","title":"Flint for the brain..","review":"When you need that creative spark, this book is enough to get those synapses firing. Good design is good design... whether you are trying to come up with a good layout for a small black and white ad in the paper or an annual report, the hundreds of designs break the rectangular barriers in your head and get you thinking in different design modes.The Web design section is a little dated in that the designs were limited by the technology available at the time the screenshots were made, but a Web designer today can borrow the clever designs for the newsletters and brochures and transfer those ideas to the Web.No designer should be without this on their reference shelf."},{"rating":"1","title":"I wasn't inspired...","review":"This book seems like a good idea when you first open it. Oh wow! A ton of layouts that I can adjust to my own project! I bought the book second hand a bookstore and when I actually opened it to work with a client, I found that this book was really not helpful at all.All the layouts only work with the graphics given. They also don't really work with standard sizes on most of them. There's no guidance on how to present the information or how the user will percieve the information. There are little snippits here and there called \\"Focus On...\\" where they tell you a little about a specific layout, but they didn't really seem all that helpful.I was really disappointed with this book.

The examples are pretty hideous and didn't offer the kind of inspiration I wanted. I rated the color book much better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Exactly What I Needed","review":"First things first: this book was clearly designed for beginners. It would probably not be particularly helpful to someone with a graphic design background.But as someone who has no professional design experience at all and is faced with creating and producing a newsletter for the first time and possibly a brochure as well, this book has been a tremendous help. It answered all my most basic questions, as well as ones I was too ignorant to know I should have (grid? what's that?) The book helpfully assumes that I know more or less nothing, and quickly and economically escorts me through a series of possibilities. I didn't like all the design ideas or layouts, but I wouldn't expect to. Many of the layouts were quite nice, though, and one of them has already been selected to serve as a jumping-off point for me. This won't be the last book I consult, but I'm grateful it was the first."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting Inspirations","review":"This book provides a host of inspiring layout ideas for the graphic/web designer looking for a fresh approach. Well categorized and illustrated. Larger illustrations would be more helpful."},{"rating":"1","title":"Definitely a sequel.","review":"While Idea Index provides actual ides for nice graphical renderings, the layout index is very simple and very scarce when it comes to layout ideas. It has a limited number of sample ideas which only look good due to the images present in the layout. The layouts provided don't really add much to the presentation of the information in the examples. Also, the web layouts are especially horrendous - despite looking semi-pretty, they do not consider at all the medium (e.g. giant images take longer to load, etc.). I was pretty disappointed by this book after liking Idea Index so much.Overall, the book is so-so. Going through it at a library will give you all the layout ideas this book could ever provide - there's no need to keep it on your shelf for future reference. If you're looking for good, or at least original print layout ideas, you better look elsewhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a disappointment!","review":"I love Idea Index. You can flip to any random page and get some creative solutions that hadn't occurred to you. Layout Index, however, is not nearly as useful, innovative or even interesting, unless vintage 1994 design is your idea of \\"cutting edge\\". I think the author had these ideas sitting in his desk drawer a little too long.Unlike Idea Index, which is a hodgepodge of design ideas that are far from finished, Layout Index walks the reader through some solutions. Instead of ideas, you get second-rate finished pieces that won't spark your own ideas. The beauty of the nonlinear index is lost.I guess this book might be useful for those who need help with their church newsletter or flyers for the kids' birthday party. Will professionals get any use out of this? Nope. I'll give it two stars just because it might come in handy for the soccer moms.I hate to dog the book... his first one was so good, but I guess that's why this one is such a dud. My expectations were not met."},{"rating":"2","title":"I recommend it","review":"I recommend having this whole series. They are nice little books to flip through when you are ready to start a new project. I agree that the design elements appear a little stale and dated, but when I look past the actual examples they use and envision my own layouts, they still give me ideas to expand upon.A good deal for the money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good Series, Weakest of the Set","review":"This is part of a three book set, which is a great addition to any design library. Unfortunately, this is the weakest of the set - there are a few tidbits, but nothing much. If you buy the other two (Color Index & Idea Index) you will be set. This one I don't recommend to often."},{"rating":"1","title":"beginner's design and small","review":"Read carefully, this book can fit in your pocket and the layout recommendations are for beginners only. If you are a professional designer, don't waste your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sad leftovers from the dark ages...","review":"This book is at first appearance, visually interesting and consuming. But upon closer look (as in opening it) it's not worth the time, money or breath sadly. The concepts and ideas within this book can be inspiring to thoses who have the time and energy, but overall this book is just a display of bad, kitsch design. My advice? Don't bother."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrendous!","review":"I have been slowly building my Design Library, and this book made me laugh right out loud! Just by looking at the sample page excerpts offered, one can tell that this book is a total waste of money to anyone with a fine arts-based design degree. But, if you do not have any idea about design, and enjoy cookie-cutter, bland, out-dated design, or if you don't need much to inspire you, then this book would probably be just fine for your library."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wishbone Ash In Geneva","review":"I have been a Wishbone Ash fan from the very first album. This Live cd is no doubt is some great stuff. The recording and mix is an A+ for a live cd. Yes it has only Andy Powell from the original band, but it still sounds like the the boys of old. The double lead guitars don't miss a beat and is very clean. There is a Wishbone Ash melody that is great also that includes part of the song Phoenix from the first album. Sometime World is another of my favorites with a sweet sounding solo's from the boys. This is there best live album that they have out. A must buy. This has to be a part of every Wishbone Ash fans collection.Bruce H"},{"rating":"2","title":"Get it now","review":"This is a truly great \\"live\\" Wishbone Ash cd. The sound quality and the vocals are perfect and of course, the guitars sing beautifully. The sound quality rivals the best live cd's I have ever heard, great mix and very clear. The performance isn't quite as raucous as some of the older live performances, but it's very tight, professional and has plenty of passion. Just get it and you will love it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good, but not great end to a wonderful series","review":"Though it has many flaws (in terms of plot-holes and timing issues), this series is not to be missed. The story is intricate and complex, and though it is at times confusing, it's very exciting and it holds your interest.The story of Coral and Jace is beautiful, and at times, frustrating. You simply can't wait until they're together at last! You'll laugh, you'll cheer, and yes, you'll be so frustrated that you'll throw the book across the room, but in the end, you'll be satisfied.

Of course, after reading the author info blurb and discovering that she is part of a \\"church-planting\\" group working in Kerala, I should have realised that the author would have a skewed view of any non-evangelical Christian religion.As an earlier reviewer noted, the author mis-uses Hindi honorifics, and none of the Hindu/Indian characters are particularly admirable in their behavior. The only \\"good\\" Indians in the series seemed to be \\"Gem\\" the adopted child of Coral and \\"Jemani\\", Gem's mother, who had converted too Christianity.Historical inaccuracies abound as well...the metric system wasn't adopted in France until 1795, and wasn't made compulsory in France until the 1840s. So the use of the metric units of measure by the male lead was incorrect, as the British used the Imperial standard of measure until well into the 19th and 20th century.I had a hard time reading this book, as the opinions and the inaccuracies of the author kept pulling me out of the story."},{"rating":"2","title":"Incurable inflation?","review":"By the late 1970s, inflation in Britain seemed like an incurable affliction. This book was written in 1978 and its chapters tend to reflect this.Here are technical papers in economics that try to model in a quantifiable way the inflation. The classic Phillips curve appears, as a suggestion that one can trade off between inflation and unemployment. There is discussion about why this may have been inadequate in an open economy.Other chapters delve into the price expectations of consumers and producers and how this can contribute to a ratcheting up of inflation."},{"rating":"1","title":"no ring","review":"I have had this phone for less than one month, and the ringer no longer rings.

This title is one of the best overviews of Massachusetts history. It begins with the Norse exploration of the coast and follows through to the birth of the high tech industries in the 20th Century. Howe is a doctor by trade whose avocation is local history. His books, particularly this one, are well written,informative and in general a joy to read. This book would, I believe, be of interest to both current residents, students and to others who may want a good orientation to the people, places,and culture of the Bay State."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful and challenging!","review":"For a 550 piece puzzle this one was definitely a challenge, even moreso than some of the 1000 piece puzzles I have done.

I was happy to be done with it when I was finished because it was such a challenge - but it was SO worth it as it turned out so beautiful.

A must have of '05","review":"They had been talking about this album for years. And now it is finally here. The last Accused album in 1992 was okay, but interest in the \\"splattercore\\" sound of the Accused (Hardcore Punk peppered with some Thrash metal) wained alot. Come to 2005 and we have one of the most original releases of the year -not to mention one of the most high energy.Not too many songs are longer than 3:00, and some of the best are under 2:00. This has some of the best guitar riffs of any Accused album, it beckons back to the days of \\"More Fun Than...\\" ('87) but faster and with better backing vocals. The first ten or twelve songs rule. I don't think you'll find yourself changing the tracks on this CD.Favorite Songs: Filthy Hounds of Hades, N.E.S., and the second track. If you want a high energy punk/metal album this is it. Totally original and really rockin'.

This is a biography of a ship and takes it from iron plates to its last days. In the journey, the reader gets a great tour of the contemporary merchant marine, its mores, and values. There are heartbreaking portrayals of families of the lost men, and overriding search for the truth. I investigated the loss of the Poet as a journalist for a major newspaper and learned there was still much to be learned from this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just OK","review":"This was the first Elzabeth Chadwick book that I've ever read. I chose this one because according to many reviews it seemed pretty good. I have to say that I really didn't enjoy it. I think it should have been two different books because it involves two very different, but entangled, couples. I felt like the first half of the book was pretty good and I really liked the lead female character Ailith. But then in the second half, which primarily centers around her daughter, suddenly the characters from the first half that had been the main focus are practically non existent. Also, the pilgrimage storyline was completely ridiculous. I found myself skimming over most of the last 75 pages. I borrowed this book from the library and thank goodness because I'll never read this one again."},{"rating":"2","title":"The sweeping turmoil of a time long past.","review":"Set during the tumultuous times of the hostile Norman invasion of England, \\"The Conquest\\" paints a dramatic picture of what it would have been like to live through the end of the Saxons' reign in England. This story gives the reader insights into the thoughts of both Norman and Saxon characters. Chadwick does this through the intertwined actions of Rolf, a Norman lord given a fiefdom in England; and Ailith, a wealthy but strong Saxon woman who's life is greatly effected by the war. All in all, \\"The Conquest\\" is a medieval masterpiece that epitomizes the conflicts and oppressions that the Saxon people endured as a result of Norman aspirations."},{"rating":"2","title":"A superior Historical Romance","review":"This was my first enounter with Elizabeth Chadwick, and I look forward to taking on the rest of her prolific collection. This book was so far superior to most books that are categorized as Historical Romance. I delighted in the domestic historical detail, especially the descriptions of food preparation and laundering. Steamy loves scenes are tempered with the brutal reality of existence during the time of William the Conquerer. This is an effortless history lesson."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice blend of romance with historical background","review":"This is the first novel I have read by this author. I normally prefer to read historical novels based on historical figures, mainly the English monarchs - however, I still really enjoyed this novel even though the actual historical figures of the time, William the Conqueror and his sons, were barely mentioned in this book. Good storytelling, and interesting characters, was ingrossed in this story, and read it within a few days. Only minor complaint was the ending, too 'tidy' and unrealistic way for the characters to have their 'happy ending'. Looking forward to reading more of this author - if only I could find some of the out-of-print ones reasonably priced."},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic F&S","review":"For those who have seen the 1990 French & Saunders Live Show, the New Show from 2000 is considerably more satisfying. Their success during the '90s is very evident in this show - they're at the top of their game and their confidence leaps off the stage with crisp comic timing and more humorous, often self-effacing bits. This show has just enough of the classic characters from their TV Series, funny references to their solo ventures, and spectacular effects with a massive rear-screen projection (how does Jennifer walk up that wall - backwards?). It's not often that I laugh out loud when watching television, but I kept finding myself giggling until my cat started staring at me wondering what was wrong. I'm not sure that it deserves a 5-star rating of perfection, but it's better that 4 stars, and 4 1/2 stars was not an option. F&S and AbFab fans definitely need to add this to their collections."},{"rating":"2","title":"Funny show, bad transfer","review":"While this is an NTSC DVD, it obviously originated from a PAL source.

I did not agree with the mentality of the characters, nor did I agree with everyone in my 8th grade class liking Lennie. Although he is sweet and has the sense of a young child, he still is a destrucitve force in the world and, although he is slighty retarted, he is insane. Steinbeck shows us this when Lennie waits for George in the brush and starts talking to his dead Aunt Clara and a huge rabbit. I have nothing against retared or insane people, but how could you like him? He kills things, wether on accident or not. Also, I found the \\"Locker Room\\" mentality kind of distrubing. Yes, people in locker rooms do talk that way, but, I think that is was wrong for the book. All the swearing and talking of whorehouses were all alittle too real. When I read I want to get away from the world, not read about it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretty good if you don't mind cussing.","review":"Of Mice and Men has an excellent plot - I didn't want to put it down once I got started. It is the story of two farmers in California in the 1930's, George and Lennie. Lennie doesn't know his own strength and consequently, it gets him a lot of trouble. The only problem I found with this book was the foul language. I was forced to read this book for school, and was shocked to discover the schooling system apparently encourages cussing, otherwise I would not have been forced to read it. A book containing murder, prositution, and extreme foul language such as that included in Of Mice and Men should, in my mind, not be a cumpulsory reading text for school. Once I learned to ignore the language problem, I found that I rather enjoyed the plot and the style in which it was written. George and Lennie's personalities are so well drawn out, it's hard to believe they are mere characters in a book of fiction. All bad content aside, Of Mice and Men was quite entertaining."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rather misleading title...","review":"I'd pulled up \\"Of Mice and Men\\" titles, compared all the prices, and selected the one that was the most economical.

I got it because I needed to measure some jig dimensions that needed to be accurate to .001. This tool is certainly capable of doing that. Since then, I've used it for everything. It helps me determine inside and outside diameters of pipe, thread pitches, and most recently, drill bit sizes. The plastic case is very sturdy and protective.The battery lasted over a year. That's probably about 40 hours of use. Probably the year that it sat caused more drain than the usage. The battery is an SR44, also called a 357. Might want to pick one up so you have it around.Complaints: no auto-on/auto-off, and it doesn't have a fractional mode. For inch metrics, it'd be nice to have fractional measurements."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is worth the money!","review":"For months I have been struggling with a dial caliper that measures in thousandths of an inch and whose dial is small and hard to read accurately. As many have noted, calipers that read in thousandths are great for metal working but leave a lot to be desired for woodworking.This inexpensive digital caliper is the solution! I bought mine at a recent woodworking show and I could not be happier with it. The auto zero allows you to instantly calibrate a baseline measurement and the large led display is easy to read. Best of all, it measures in standard inches so there is no calculation necessary.I have found this thing to be accurate and worth every penny. Granted it is not Starrett quality, but for the price it cannot be beat. Speaking of price, I landed mine for 26.99 at a woodworking show, so look out for better deals than this one!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Performance matches price","review":"The Avenger MC0006 6\\" Digital Caliper is a handy tool at a very reasonable price. My only complaint is that the fine adjustment knob is a little sloppy but on a sub-$100 pair of calipers I think I can deal with it. It comes with a sturdy case that leaves me comfortable enough to toss it into my tool box without worry. An all around good buy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Measuring Device Review","review":"I don't know how I've gotten along over 15 years workingwith wood, making furniture, all types of twisted legs, goblets,etc. without one of these. Though, it does take getting used to the 1000ths of an inch with no fractional equivalency. The only thing I found was not good was the glass over the digital readout. I have been extremely careful not to drop this device, however, I may have dropped something on top of it. The other day I looked down at it and was very upset to see multiple cracks across the readout. It is very thin glass (maybe should have used lexan!)Overall, for the money it is an excellent measuring device."},{"rating":"2","title":"works good","review":"works good and has been very useful. they ship it with a dead battery(?) so be prepared to replace it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Avenger MC0006 is a STEAL for the money","review":"ALL of the reviews that I read complimented the operation of this product.

What's not to like?I feel like this disc fits well with the mood of the whole series, and the tragic conclusion is an indication that the Japanese understand that not everything turns out all warm and fuzzy in the end, and generally things are more interesting when they go wrong.

Especially noteworth is the episode \\"John Quixote\\" with is reminiscent of the fantastic \\"Won't Get Fooled Again\\" from season 2.

Some parts of the biographical introductions are omitted, in some games the notes are brutally mutilated. In the match with Tschigorin- the best part of the book- some games are reduced to a joke.Well, the book gives access to a classic book to people who does not understand german. I would not object if the reduction of the original material was advertised at the front page. Abridged and adapted by Sol Schwarz. Then you would know what you were buying. As it is, it's a fraud."},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic book, poor binding","review":"I have to disagree with another reviewer who praised the high qualify of this Hays Publishing edition. The printing and diagrams are nice -- not those old, faded ones you see from Dover -- but the binding is glued, and the Walbrodt match pages have fallen out in my copy.Substance wise, this is very good. The annotations aren't move-by-move for beginners, but are precise and word-oriented. The openings are often dated, but a club player can still play them, and it's really the middle and end games that count. Not all of the games are memorable, of course, which is nice, because you get a taste of all kinds of games the way chess is actually played."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great book and a great man","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed this book.

It is my opinion that the useful information in this book could be held on five pages and tends to be very basic in nature (things like, hand out lots of business cards). Even the best advice the book offers could most likely be obtained in an evening on google if you tried. If you can't think of the ideas in this book on your own, then you probably don't need to be running your own business anyhow!!!That being said, if you are interested in starting a dog wash, you have ZERO business knowledge, and you flat out do not know where to start, then I guess this could be helpful for giving you a point in the right direction ... but that is all it will give you."},{"rating":"2","title":"How To Start Your Own Dog Wash Business","review":"This product came nicely packaged and is totally informative and useful.

The thickness is comparable to a report cover. They are expandable to allow you to store plenty of paperwork within each folder. I like the dividers within the folder to help group papers, but still keep in one folder. If you punch holes in the tops of your papers and use the fasteners, the papers will be secure in your folder. However, I didn't realize the sides were open, so unless you are keeping the folders in a file drawer or box, you will need to use the fastener to keep the papers from falling out.

Upon assembly the on/off switch wouldn't work, so it had to be unplugged to turn it off.In my case suction was very poor whether I used the accessories or not. Noise didn't bother me, it's as loud as any other vacuum out there, and I couldn't find any issues with the container other than it didn't lock very well and it felt rather \\"loose\\" as if the locking mechanism was badly worn out.Really disappointed as the only reason I bought was to replace my 4 years old $48 vacuum, but they perform very similarly with the hoover having to do as many passes as my old vacuum to cleanup any dirt.The picture does not match the unit I received, however the model number did. So the picture in this listing is not accurate."},{"rating":"1","title":"2 years later BROKE!","review":"My wife and i recieved the hoover windtunnel bagless upright as a wedding gift about 21 months ago and was used only to vacuum a small apartment. The problem is a poor design in how the bagless container attaches to the vacuum. At the begining it created a good seal but after cleaning the bagless container out reguarly for 21 months (and remeber this is a small apartment im talking about 850 sq. ft. and thats is including the kitchen and bathroom) the connection became more and more loose each time i removed the bagless to clean it, now the connection wont even hold the conntainer in .it just falls out and without a secure connection suction is completely lost. my reconmendation is to save your money and buy somthing else."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT AS PICTURED!","review":"I have never written a review before, but I am very disappointed, so here goes.

I love it!","review":"I bought this reconditioned Hoover on a Thursday and Amazon had it at my door on Monday - no shipping charge!! I assembled the handle on the vacuum immediately and used it asap. It is the best vacuum I've ever used and looks brand new. I have a cat and it's incredible how much cat hair was in my rug. Previously I used a Dirt Devil cheapy kind of vacuum, and apparently it wasn't working at all. This vacuum went deep into my rug and picked up so much. I'm so pleased and wish I bought this sooner. A couple people complained about removing the bagless container with the dirt in it - they said it was messy. I did it twice so far and it was fine. I just emptied it into a bag and had no problem. To me the vacuum wasn't loud - obviously it's going to have some noise, but no complaints from me. I'm actually going to buy another one of these vacuums for a family member.

About 2 weeks ago, the darn thing totally craps out on us. For the first 6 months it was really great, but then the suction started to die out. Toward the end, you could barely feel any suction through the hose. When you buy a vacuum, you'd expect it to last at least a few years, not a few months. Not worth the money in my opinion, but if you're tight on cash and expecting a big paycheck in the foreseeable future, this one will work until you can afford a better one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as shown.","review":"The good prompt shipping, I received the vacuums within four days of purchasing them.*Both of the vacuum cleaners the original and replacements appear to have had features removed when refurbished.

The U57009RM appears to have had the Embedded Dirt finder removed and replaced with a sticker.*Amazons misleading on this vacuum and customer service representative assuring this is a one time problem and this problem would be addressed before second would be shipped.*Vary, vary loud.*Short hose with vary little to no suction.*Extremely heavy.Bottom line I returned both units.

The Fuccons, which I thought would be funny was utterly stupid! In the 2nd scene we watch to scantly dressed women poke other women in their bottom with toy hypodermic needles... then watch them scream, and they all put this to a dance tune.Anyways, you might like this if you're 13 or grew up in Japan where you can understand this humor. I found 'Jackass' to be much more entertaining, at least with Jack I was able to wonder just how stupid the participants were, with this DVD, I just can't figure out who was drinking more, the writers, the director or the whole entre cast has too much saki!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good book for beginners, but not what I wanted","review":"This book is like a photography 101 class, with a little bit of information on DSLR's , digital file formats, and digital enhancement. If you already understand aperture, ISO, shutter speeds, basic composition principles, depth of field, etc, you do not need this book. I would get this book for a novice photographer who wanted to generally improve their understanding of basic photography principles.That being said, the book is easy to read with pretty good images to demonstrate the lessons, and it presents all concepts well. I do think it would be beneficial to someone who has n ever used a camera in manual mode. The \\"assignments\\" at the end of each lesson would be especially useful for getting more comfortable with the camera.Just not what I needed; still a good book for the right level of user."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well Explained and Simple Reading","review":"The boook is wonderful, it is written in everyday language with examples made easy.

This book did not disappoint, it is concise, easy to read/understand and assumes the reader knows zip about photography.The best primer I've ever seen and it doesn't matter whether you use a point & shoot or plan to move up to a top of the line Nikon or Canon DSLR someday, the fundamentals are the same and the book covers the features and limitations of all kinds of gear.If there were six stars available for this I would have given it six.Paul StewartHendersonville, Tennessee"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent resource for learning to be a better photographer","review":"This is a wonderful book for someone looking to learn the basics, or increase their knowledge of digital photography.

While some things/skills transferred easily, I found the choices and technology confusing or disorienting. I bought this book based upon reviews, and it has been quite helpful. It was a bit disconcerting to find that my camera, Cannon's PowerShot A650IS, didn't fit well into the three basic types reviewed, but that was not a deal breaker. This book, along with lots of practice, has helped me adjust to digital, and now I'm not sure I'd ever go back to film.

If you don't take good photos to begin with, the end-result will not be good not matter how much post-precessing you do on your computer. This book actually talks about photography techiques in a very accessible fashion.

It's not necessary to understand the storyline, but its a nice when you can compare how they changed some of the characters...the paper quality could be just a LITTLE better, but nevertheless its a great start off for Del Ray.

I'm usually open minded but this story was not to my taste."},{"rating":"2","title":"MY OPINION MOSTLY ( ONT READ IF U ONT WANT OPINION!)","review":"i disdainfully read this manga when it first came out, which was in japanese. And my Japanese is just as rusty as my Filipino, which is pretty bad to start with. But other than that i just flipped throught the wonderful graphics of CLAMP's extremely detailed artwork and without even knowing the storyline I quickly followed the story through only with my eyes. I began to enjoy the storyline even if I did not get the whole point of the story. Which for me was an advantage and a disadvantage. But all in all this story is a true classic of CLAMP. Mixing many of their other manga characters in with this story and making new ones as well. CLAMP is one of my favorite manga temas and artists, besides from Yu Watase, Yukiru Sugisaki, Oh!Great, etc. But this manga is one of CLAMP's more confusing ones.

The art is obviously amazing. The story is creative, and really draws you into it. It's interesting. I know CLAMP is known for incorporating their previous characters into their new mangas as they go and I can honestly say I love it. It's not cheesy at all. It gives you this nostalgic feeling. I was really upset after finishing every single one of their series like Chobits, Rayearth, and CCS for example which I enjoyed very much, and to just see those characters again made me really happy. It's like a \\"running into a good old friend\\" feeling.I'm so happy that it's 28 books. So much fun! :3I also just ordered all of xxxHolic.

I became a huge fan of XXXHolic after Amazon Vine gave me a copy of the DVD to review and now I've read 11 volumes of the books. I bought this series because they bump into each other in some scenes and thought why not? I'm sure it will get easier and better. I was told I should start with Cardcaptor Sukura first but she seemed a bit young and wasn't sure if I'd like it or not. I should have tried.

What happened to the cutesy little characters?This sweetly drawn series has been disrupted into this roughly drawn full-on \\"action\\" thing.However, for those like myself who really enjoy this series, I continue to sadly plow on through, wishing that someone else could share my opinion and have someone from CLAMP draw the whole series into that cutesy \\"Anyone\\"-rated series."},{"rating":"1","title":"not THAT good","review":"Hi my name is nick I'm a new fan of manga i have only read about 7 so far and I already love them and will keep reading the till the day i die lol.

The answer is that the book drills these facts into your head through repetition over 500 pages.

Also, the CD cover art is some of the worst I have ever seen...ever.Other than that this is an intoxicating debut from this San Francisco foursome. \\"Some Somewhere Now\\" is one of the strongest songs which starts of as a simple picking pattern which turns into a simpler 2 chord progression led by Tim Mitchell's ever catchy melodies and backed by a solid rhythm section. Obvious comparisons will be made to Mogwai, especially on the last track, \\"Christmas With The Matador\\". Hell, the name even suggests that.

Graham (and his disciple Warren Buffet) does not talk about -- or believe in -- get-rich-quick schemes (those are speculation), but in sound principles of looking for solid, well-run companies, and buying their stock when the price dips. (The market gets hysterical and goes up or down in ways that have nothing to do with the intrinsic value of the company.)

Also, the mice live in an antique clock in an antique shop, and the ship they sail is also on display in the antique shop. There is also a little box with the initials HS in the antique shop, which I assume refer to the person in the book's dedication. My son loves the book too and we've had lots to discuss. I actually found myself looking at the book myself without my son, and I looked up more information about it only to find that the author was also author of a book I loved as a child: The Mystery of the Missing Red Mitten.

The layout is characterized by full page and many double-paged spreads which allow Kellogg to fill both pages with cute mice and appealing scenery. Some pages show the perspective of the mice in the hole juxtaposed with the tall stairs for people in the house. The sailing ship and the mice on the island show life size mice and the skog who is a similar size. The colors are watercolor and muted.

The message was clearly, \\"Non-Hispanic people in California are inept morons that cannot perform any simple functions without the help of Mexicans.\\"I think the Producers of this movie really wanted to make a film with a strong socio-political statement but decided that they should throw in a few gags to get somebody to watch it.

They also don't mention that the cost of running the school system would drop, as they would no longer have to run many bilingual schools.

Don't even get me started on the white characters. If this movie hadn't been made by a Hispanic person, this would have been called out a lot more.The writing was TERRIBLE. NOBODY talks that way! NOBODY ever says stuff like that. The fact that the acting was even worse didn't help this fact.The facts presented in the film were interesting, but I hate being clubbed over the head with stuff like that. They were all presented with the subtlety of an 18 wheeler speeding down a crowded sidewalk. Way too preachy.It's a shame this movie was so bad.

For example, FCP means \\"front circle punch.\\" And he lays out the combinations with easy to follow notations like FCP, FSP....and takes the speed bag out of boxing-only applications and puts it into the realm of rhythm eye-hand coordination mastery. And by implication makes it relevant to everything from swinging a golf club to hitting a tennis ball. No, he does not mention these things per se, but the implication is that master the mind and the rhythm and relax and you'll learn the secret of excelling at sports because all sports are played in the head. And working out with the bag is simply great fun. One of the best how-to books I've ever used."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another Great Book by this Author","review":"I am an avid reader of Elizabeth Chadwick's books. Her ability to present Mediaeval history in the form of entertaining and informative reading is par excellence. The Champion is another story set in the Royal Court in the 13th century Normandy and England. It was shortlisted for the Best Romantic Novel of the Year Award. The term Romantic Novel does not do her work justice as her books are so well researched and her later works became more biographical/historical. I have read almost all of her books. Elizabeth Chadwick is an excellent writer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Written in Crayon","review":"I knew I was in trouble after the first five pages when a camp follower is termed \\"a minx\\" and a few lines later we hear about her \\"undulating bosom.\\" OK. So this is not going to be a serious work of historical fiction. That expectation being out of the way, I was still able to enjoy what is a very plot-driven narrative for the sheer pace of it. Forget about character development; that is not a matter of interest for Ms. Chadwick, at least not in this work. If I were 16, I would have loved this book. It has all the standard romantic fiction stereotypes, no more poorly drawn than in any other book of its ilk. What it does not have is anything resembling a depiction of real people, of that time or any other. We are dealing with the cartoonish here. If that works for you, by all means read this book. If you are looking for historical fiction for grown ups - this is not it."},{"rating":"2","title":"great extras","review":"Any fan of the band could tell you that 'Run to the Water' is one of the most finished sounding songs that Live has ever written. It is beautiful to say the least. Take that and add 4 bonus tracks and this is one incredible single. Track 2 is an acoustic version of 'Dolphin's Cry'--an interesting take on the song--that is worth a listen. It is hard to find a bad version of 'I Alone' and this particular version is nothing to be sad about--one of the better versions out there. Then you get the radio version of 'Dolphin's Cry' which is arguably better than the album version. And finally 'Turn my Head' which is one of the most beautiful songs I've ever heard. This is a must have for a true fan, and worth having if you aren't a true fan."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Chalky Tasting, yuck!","review":"My nutritionist recently put me on a protein shake meal replacement diet, so I've been trying a lot of different protein powders lately.

I thought this book might be one I loved but I found it boring. It took me days to read it and I had to force myelf to get through it. The characters didn't really have much interest in each other. The hero didn't seem like there was much passion in him at all. The passion that supposedly drove them apart in the first place seemed like it never exsisted. I found the characters boring and without much depth. I'm sorry but I just didn't like this book at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Was I reading the same book?","review":"Honestly, this was the worst book I've read in years. Possibly the worst ever. The hero was an utter boor, unsympathetic and uncaring. At no point did I truly believe he loved the heroine, and his lack of care for her on their wedding night was simply inexcusable. On the other hand, the heroine was not someone I could respect. This, along with her inexplicable behavior through the book, made it impossible to enjoy her either.

The book dragged and dragged until I could take it no longer - it was absolutely BORING and it made no sense most of the time.

Camilla loves lima beans, but doesn't eat them because the other kids don't like them. She doesn't want to be different. Unfortunately she wakes up for the first day of school with a bad case of the stripes. She goes to school where she is teased. Camilla was always worried about being different and having people dislike her. There are little lessons about being yourself interspersed subtly throughout the book. And of course at the end Camilla realizes she likes her lima beans so why not eat them!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Good message, but not a book for younger children","review":"My 4-year old daughter had this book read to her at preschool and has been having nightmares about it.

It scared my daughter so bad that she cannot sleep at night and has been crying throughout the day for two weeks now. She is totally traumatized. I can't believe that Scholastic would recommend this book for 4 to 8 year olds. The premise of the story is too sophisticated for kids of this age and I am appalled that you recommend it for such ages. I can tell you that we were getting ready to order a bunch of scholastic books through school for our daughter, but after this experience, I will never them you a penny.

It is so important to teach girls (and boys) to be confident in who they are and not worried about what other people will think of them. This book gives girls the idea that other peoples' opinions are extremely important and should be considered at long lengths before doing, saying, eating or wearing ANYTHING. The drawings in this book are scary and the scenes where children are laughing at the little girl are heart-breaking. The hidden lesson in the book is way over a child's head."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hidden gay agenda","review":"Just read this to my 7 year old son that found the pictures interesting. This book is about a girl that is sick because she is trying to deny that she likes something wierd (Lima Beans). While the general message itself is fine this book has clear homosexual undertones. She gets a case of the stripes (Gay Symbol/Flag) that make her conform to whatever people tell her to be but she just gets worse until she embraces her weird (but harmless) predilections. The first and the last page have clear homosexual imagery; first page she is in the closet and the last page happy and wearing a gay stripped bow in her hair out in the park. This book is also promoted by homosexual advocay groups (see link below). I just wanted to let people know as this book is widely read in schools and I did not see any reviews addressing the gay undertones.(...)"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Bad Case of Stripes","review":"This book is really great!

I would share this with any child who may be feeling some pressure or desire to fit in. Perfect for kindergarteners or first-graders; great for any age."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Bad Case of Stripes","review":"I thoroughly enjoy this page-turning children's book as much now as I did when I first read the story at the age of four. The key character, Camilla Cream, adores lima beans, which is extremely unusual for children at her school. Because she wants to fit in, Camilla gave up this one thing that she loves dearly just to be normal. When Camilla begins turning into a rainbow of colors, doctors, specialists, and experts have no idea why Camilla's body goes wild. Miserable from taunting and reporters outside her home, Camilla starts changing shades and grows sprouts here and there and everywhere! I rate this story a five out of five stars for children of the ages 4-8. When anyone reads this story, their eyes will be entertained along with their own imagination from the vibrant words that match their visual counterparts.

Before the first day of school, Camilla Cream is trying on outfits (forty-two to be exact) and catching a glimpse of herself in the mirror, lets out a terrible scream. Her skin is completely covered in rainbow stripes. The brilliant full-color artwork that spreads across the pages captures not only the hilarious changes that Camilla Cream's stripes take at the prompting of her schoolmates (Let's see some purple polka dots! Checkerboard! The American flag!) but also the curious cures of the various doctors who come to inspect this peculiar case as her condition turns from bad to worse.

But if you're using it for re-touches only like I do (the kit says it's enough for two re-touches) you may run out of product, like I did. A quarter of my head is still poofy right now b/c it wasn't enough relaxer left to finish. Oh well, this will have to do for the next 6 weeks. But I will definitely use it again b/c I can't ignore the fact that it doesn't burn me.

The switch lets you use 1, 2 or 3 of the smaller bulbs, while a separate switch controls the 3-way bulb independently.This is the second one of these I have bought - one for a friend's somewhat dark room in a retirement home, and now for a big room in our house that needs several lamps. This one does a great job of lighting it up, now that the days are short and it gets dark so early. I am using 3 compact fluorescent bulbs in place of the 60-watters - altho I stuck with a conventional 3-way, since I have had problems with the lifespans of 3-way CFL's.

However, don't go for the whole package of the lightbulbs with it. The 3-way was 1.99 but shipping was nearly $5. Not worth it at all. I expected the $101 to be one shipment-lamp and bulb-and it obviously wasn't. Buy your own bulb at Walmart and save the shipping. Love the lamp though!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheap construction","review":"This lamp fell apart right away - cheap materials.

Unfortunately the quality did not meet my expectation. After putting the lamp together, it was never straight. The lamp wobbled on the base and the pole leaned.

The first constellation was The Virgin, sometimes referred to as \\"the virgin who will conceive.\\" (Remember that Mary was a virgin when she gave birth to Jesus.) The second constellation was sometimes called The Desire of Nations. It showed a young male child being held by the Virgin. The ancient Jews and Arabs said that the meaning of the original 48 constellations were explained by Enoch, and that they told the story of God's plan for mankind from beginning to end.

These \\"Gospel in the Stars\\" books presume to find Biblical meaning in the constellations.In our efforts to \\"prove all things, hold fast to that which is true,\\" we should be very wary of the notion that a 19th century scholar, using Medieval sources, discovered an antedeluvian prophecy of Jesus in the constellations known to Aratus in 275 B.C.

No heroes here. Lots of bashing of the symbol of capitalism too, being Margaret Thatcher. The main character, a boy who wants to become a ballet dancer, is no pleasant person either. He even knocks down one of his innocent ballet dance competitors, without any consequences to him. The motives that move the main characters are also wholly unclear, if known at all. The singing is more like screeching and totally 'unmemorable. This is a 'pseudo-musical reality show'."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dull","review":"It is charitable to call this show mediocre. The music isn't the usual Sir Elton theatrical music dreck. I guess that's a plus. The lyrics are awful. The same words are repeated over and over and over, so the pointed is quickly made, the song goes nowhere. Most of the lyrics are generic. Most of the songs give the impression of being the same length. I hope the show never makes it to Broadway.

Because the handle is fixed on one side, the grating plane is not an open cylinder, unlike the Mouli (and the Cuisinpro, which I'm now using) When grating a slightly soft cheese--a sharp cheddar--the drum quickly became clogged with cheese shred and it was almost impossible to clean them out."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fabulous title for the little ones","review":"My 3 year old was recently given this book as a birthday present and has not put it down since.

First, they won't take it back unless it is \\"pristine.\\" Assembling the rack inevitably causes minor scratches in the screws - no longer pristine.

It wasn't difficult to assemble and put up (although I didn't actually do either, I did watch...though I will grant from the ground, everything looks easy) and it will blend with any decor. My favorite feature is the grid that sits in the middle, where I keep my Pyrex/casserole dishes and pressure cooker. What a space saver! About 25 pots, etc that don't have to be in a cabinet, on a kitchen counter, on the stove or when you're really in a bind for space...in the oven. We get compliments on it constantly.

The many characters introduced are more baffling. Some of them play small parts in the whole yarn yet they are emphasized with an abundance of details. The first three-quarter of the story reads like a soap opera spiced up with puppy love. Most of the dialogues are intriguing and a handful of them are quite hilarious. The mystery itself lacks intensity and suspense. Some oversimplified aspects of crimes involving computers elaborated in the tale might scare part of the technology challenged population. When put into context with identity theft, the uncomplicated procedures involved that are portrayed in the book would easily worry anybody. Nonetheless, the ending is predictably satisfying.

I used to feel like I was part of a team now I just feel like I'm being used, especially after I went to her site and saw they only offer clothing up to a size XL. Why is that she is willing to make a living off people who are above an XL but they aren't good enough to provide clothing for?This is not a new video, it's a repackaged one and that is a cheap move in my eyes."},{"rating":"1","title":"TrailORGranny","review":"I would suggest that you DO NOT purchase this product.

With all the products Sansone sells and all the DVDs, I wonder how desperate she is for money. I have about 10 of her workouts and after buying the latest one -- 3 Mega Miles -- I don't know if I'll buy another. It's sloppy, you can barely hear the music and feels like she threw it together without much thought. I use 4 other aerobics instructor's DVDs and they are by far superior. They are more challenging, much better produced and their workouts are clean and flawless. Also they don't do all that annoying chatting. I still get a decent workout from Sansone.

What a shame.Don't erase those old tapes!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Deserves Criterion Collection re-issue treatment!","review":"This is a gem of a movie. You have to respect Altman's movie making to really love it but it's a fun 70's look at gambling and it's grasp on folks. This is a seedy side of America that most people don't see without the typical hollywood dramatical elements of drugs, guns, and criminals. You could call Segal and Gould low-lifes but this story is just a wild ride that shows the how people get sucked into gambling. Segal and Gould are great together and this movie is certainly worth watching (or streaming...as it's hard to find). This is one of my favorite movie's as i'm a fan of low stakes gambling and Altman. I really want to see this re-issued by Criterion Collection as it easily fits into what they do and they have celebrated some Altman previously."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love to Gamble","review":"Amen I love to gamble. Gambling thrives on the fine line between intellect & superstition. Chronic gamblers know the odds. At the same time they believe the next hand of cards will be better than it should be.

No one has any class; a thoroughly seedy atmosphere. You can feel degraded merely by watching it. A big flaw is the lack of motivation for the change in attitude, at the end of the movie, of the George Segal character. At least Gould is as obnoxious as ever.

Except two!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A good introduction to the land battles of the first years of the Second World War in Europe","review":"Books on the history of World War II for young people are by necessity somewhat lacking in depth or limited in scope. The origins of the war were extremely complex and are strongly debated to this day. Furthermore, there are still significant disputes over the role of the major figures and why they did what they did.This book is limited to the major battles of the first four years of the war in the European theater and is restricted to base overviews of the action. In that sense and within the logical restrictions to the young reader, this is a quality book. It exposes the reader to the main events, some of the reasons for the tactics used and the major outcomes and consequences of the battle.If your interest is exposing young people to the basics of the primary European battles in the early years of World War II in Europe, then this book will serve your interests."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointed","review":"I will not recommend this book for a child age 11-13.I found it very boring.It does not flow and capture the interest or imagination.

I wish had read the reviews first. I agree that there is little information, little plot, and on the whole very dull. There are almost no facts but lots of meandering, lifeless stories. It did not teach any real historical facts and seemed to be poorly structured. The end result was having to go to the library to scrape together enough information to even do a basic book report.

Bought by Lucius Opimius, Atticus became his favored servant, and so-called spy.I read this book for school, hoping it had some interesting facts on Rome. I do not think this book is worth reading. It was very boring and had no plot what-so-ever. Every few pages I made excuses to myself to get up and leave to book on my dresser. During the story, you don't feel attached to any of the characters as you would in your favorite novel, and could care less what happened to them.

And, still, he's a teenager in 30 B.C.? Again, how?!?), little dialogue, multiple plot holes, and choppy narrative all work to scuttle this story.

Granted, it is not as exhaustive as Kittel's Old Testament Theological Dictionary; but, it is extremely helpful at summarizing the most pertinent facts regarding key O.T. words, and it is written from a much more theologically-conservative perspective than Kittel's. Being a one-volume work, it also is much more practical for busy pastors and Bible teachers/students, without sacrificing important information.

The New Mexico setting, the way of life and the terms used (e.g. outfitter and custodian) made it a fascinating comedy. I wanted the brothers to succeed - at anything.

Top secret scientists and government in hush hush branches going to the bottom of the ocean to make the discovery of mankind. That's all I am going to say.

The plot has a few interesting aspects, such as the notion that aliens visited earth long ago and left something sinister behind (remember the John W. Campbell short novel \\"Who Goes There?\\"), but overall this book just falls flat. There is way too much psuedo-scientific astrophysics jargon for my taste (and I have an aeronautical/astronautical engineering degree).

The central mystery here and its explanation are very interesting, but the characters are two-dimensional and so chichéd that at times I wondered if I was reading a novelization of The Abyss. Even in his own previous works, Child has long since overplayed the tired old taciturn-security-type-becomes-paranoid-and-threatening character. Here, it's like he took the security guy from Mount Dragon or the treasure hunter from Riptide or the obsessed meteorite-extraction guy from The Ice Limit and put him in uniform and stuck him underwater. The story arc was predictable, and the whole thing had a very paint-by-numbers kind of feel to it. Child could have done -- and has done -- better."},{"rating":"2","title":"plan to lose some sleep","review":"I think I ordered this on the 1st of February.....every waking moment of this past weekend was taken up reading...warning!!!!!

That night I picked the book up and, although I was very busy, finished it within a week.My favorites are mystery and intrigue, however, I was able to accept the Sci-Fi element because of the way Child blended good characterization and discriptive setting.

It was fantasy that could not have a relationship to the ordinary or even extraordinary world."},{"rating":"2","title":"Couldn't put the book down","review":"As usual with anything written by Lincoln Child, I couldn't put this book down. I had just finished a Michael Crichton book that took me a month to finish when this book arrived. I was done with it in two days! Child's writing keeps getting better & better. If you like medical mysteries, you'll love this story. And I found the surprise ending, the cause of the medical problems that bring hero Peter Crane to the site, to be chillingly plausible. Peter Crane is a great protagonist, worthy of even Agent Pendergast, and I look forward to more stories involving him."},{"rating":"2","title":"Incredible Ride!","review":"Ok... so I started reading this and said \\"been there...done that\\" then suddenly the story started to morph and one of the wildest and most exciting rides I've been on for a quite a while unfolded!

Words cannot even begin to describe how bad this book is. I was drawn in by the undersea aspect of this fictional \\"thriller\\" and the premise is interesting enough, but I couldn't get past the wooden protagonist and the stereotypical portrayal of all of the military characters as deranged, maniacal sadists bent on destroying the planet. The dialogue was utterly hokey, and I would think that Mr. Child could at least have run his manuscript by someone on active duty or at least formerly in the military who could have corrected such idiocy, such as the repeated use of \\"Over and out,\\" \\"Get here on the double\\" and the numerous inane militaryspeak/jargon that nobody in uniform uses.

The characters aren't sketched out much, but in a thriller like this that doesn't really matter. The lean plot and tight narrative drive this book quickly, and make it easy to polish off."},{"rating":"2","title":"Glad I didn't read the synopsis!","review":"I went into this one dark, sometimes the less I know the better (I'm looking at you movie trailers!). All I knew was this was some type of deep sea mystery - I was easily sold on this premise as I'm already in love withThe Abyss (Special Edition)andSphere.The deep ocean is like space, if anything goes wrong you're dead, there's built-in tension. Add in some mystery with sinister overtones and I couldn't be happier.

Unfortunately I am one of those people who expect you to get your facts straight when you write about a subject and Mr Child was way out of his field of expertise in when he wrote about mental health and military protocol. That ruined it for me right then and there.

After finishing it, I was left at a total loss and a desire to read a similar book. This book was one of the few that I discovered in hopes to enjoy this as much. And yes, it does share some similarities, but those similarities simply fall short of making this book be as enjoyable, gripping or fun as Schatzing's. Maybe because it was a lot more masculine...the cast is very dominated by males here, and the females aren't really very convincing... I think I mostly didn't like it because the plot turned away from the very exciting Atlantis set-up. Also, there were some holes in the plot that were rather troublesome. I'm going to give this one to my dad to read because I think he'll enjoy it, or at least more than I did.UPDATE: And my prediction was accurate - my dad ended up liking it WAY more than I did!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Would make a good movie, but . . .","review":"If you've seen The Abyss then don't bother.

The lining around the ankle of my shoes ripped after about a week of wearing them. The shoes are very comfortable, if you like a loose to medium-snug fit, but it is difficult to keep these shoes feeling medium-to-tight on your feet with this elastic pull system. The MAJOR concern/warning I have about these shoes is that they are very slippery when it is wet outside!! I expected an outdoor/hiking shoe like these to have a good grip...and they do on dry surfaces...but they are very slippery when it is wet outside.

The author deals with the subject in the context of the everlasting gospel found in Revelation 14:6-12 and shows how the view that Christ took upon Himself our fallen human nature, yet remaining sinless, and therefore being our substitute, is an intricate part of this message. Throughout the book, the author makes an appeal for readers to carefully study the subject and discuss it with other members of the SDA Church in Christian love and courtesy. While views on the humanity of Christ may vary from member to member, it should not mean that there should be a lack of Christlikeness while it is being discussed.

This is common to all new copper products to prevent them from tarnishing. If you are just going to use the bowl for display, you can leave the finish on. (Unless you want it to develop a nice patina.) Otherwise it is very easy to remove using a solvent which costs a few dollars at your local discount store or home improvement store if you do not have it already.

I would not use any other conventional diapers because of the toxic chemicals such as dioxin from the chlorine, fragrance and gel. Since we adults wear cotton underwears, why shouldn't our child be wearing the same thing?One thing I would like to see is that Tushies offers more sizes.

Today, it would be almost impossible to produce passable forgeries of most I.D. documents.\\" I expect that this book was really written with a different title and different pitch, focusing on WWII POW history, but that the publisher persuaded the author to add a paragraph here and there about modern prisons and change the title, so that it could be marketed as a prison escape technique book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as expected","review":"The book was interesting reading, but most of it seemed informational and entertaining rather than practical.

Have no problems with the Altec Lansing AVS300 2.1 system on my other son's computer or any of my stereo or electric guitar equip. The AVS300 runs off an AC adapter while this set gets its juice straight from the wall outlet.

Also, when someone calls, it begins humming even before i hear the ring. As i was looking at the other reviews, i believe that its because of the air waves - transmissions.

These small pads work great when you have very limited space. Think airplanes and some hotel spaces. If I close my laptop and the pad is on my keyboard, it is thin enough that it does not damage my screen. The pads adhere well to some surfaces, but not as well to others. If the desk surface is very smooth, the pad does not stick as well, but if the desk is smooth, but not glassy, then I have had no problems.

In under a year I have sent it back to them twice and I am about to do so for a third time. The problem is with the volume, it goes from low to loud randomly. The volume problem appears to be a defect with the X5 itself. I know this because two of my friends deceided to buy it when they saw mine and they have both had the same problem. The difference is that they got tired of sending it back and to be honest with you if they can't fix it this time I won't either. I think I'll be done with this company.

This is the third, or maybe now it's the 4th?, time that the sound on my 20 GB iAudio X5 has cut out. Cowon just returned it to me again a couple of weeks or so ago. The screen shows that the song is playing - it's just that no sound comes out. Besides this problem it also has an annoying problem of repeating songs when the setting is set not to repeat. This is a quibble, however, that one can live with.

I not only have music on this thing, but I have also recorded my lectures with no problem and the playback is quite fine...all this done without an external attachment, which is great! The line in recording option makes recording podcast files without a problem and file transfers are no problem.I can't forget to mention the Picture viewing option. The quality isn't too bad when you take into consideration the size of the screen. Perhaps a zoom option would have made this feature a bit more worthwhile.Overall I'm quite pleased with the purchase and would definitely recommend purchase of the product, especially when compared to the Apple counterpart."},{"rating":"1","title":"I love this so much, it hurts me to give it only 2 stars","review":"I've had my X5 for about 15 months now. In that time, I have used it mostly around the house and at the gym. I charge it regularly and use it gently. I chose the X5 because I like the way I have my music organized in folders, and I don't like the way itunes organizes my music. I found the X5 to be very intuitive and user friendly.However, at about 12 months old (just after the warranty expired), my battery life went from 10-15 hours to 2-3 hours (and sometimes less). The unit hasn't been through any trauma to warrant this drop in battery life, and now I am faced with the decision to spend 80 or more dollars to replace it, or to just put that money towards another player.Iaudio states on their website that the battery should be at about 80% at 2 years old. I made my decision based on this information, and I might have gone with another player if I had known my unit would be fairly useless in a year."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best mp3 out there","review":"I am very pleased with the performance of this product.

Way Better than and Ipod no question."},{"rating":"2","title":"Don't pay for marketing","review":"First of all, I give AAPL props for the iPod but it is an overpriced device compared with the excellent iAudio. The iAudio supports more CODECS than most of the other players, including the excellent Ogg Vorbis which in my opinion is much better than MP3 and WMA. I am converting my whole MP3 library to OGG with the excellent Jet Audio player that comes included. Battery life is good, I use the iAudio in the car and lasts for about 2-3 weeks before I need to recharge it.My only complain is the built in interface for the player itself but I am used to it now. Other than that, this is an extremely capable audio player that does more than iPods and competing players. The metal casing is also great. I feel like I made a good investment. Oh, and BTW you can use it as a portable hard drive since any PC will see it as an external USB device without any complicated setup routine.

It seems that switch thread was a cheap piece with no threads, so the switch just turns around and around.Also, the lamp head cannot stand up on its own-- the bolts to tighten it do not go far enough to keep it in place, so the head just droops. I at one point super-glued the hinge to keep it in place, but it's pretty ridiculous.If you are in the market for a piano lamp, look elsewhere before coming back to this one. It is simply not worth the price."},{"rating":"1","title":"Aladdin Gives This Lamp Thumbs Down","review":"I am a piano teacher.

Some of the science was interesting, but it wasn't worth it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Frightfully believable","review":"Some reviewers seem to find the first part of the book nonbelievable. Being a professional historian, I am painfully aware how a civilized society can descend into ignorance, superstition, and barbarism in a surprisingly short time, for reasons even historians do not yet understand fully,( see Germany under Hitler, Russia inder Lenin and Stalin, Cambodia under Pol Pot, and China during the Cultural Revolution. ) I am also painfully aware of what happens when one political or religious group, be it Red, Brown, Black or Green, gains complete control over society, and as a result gets intoxicated by its power. I therefor e regard the first part of TITAN as a strong warning to be heeded, or ignored at our peril. The rest of the book I consider a good example of hardcore, near-future SF, the accuracy of which will be determined in 2004, when Cassini will reach Saturn."},{"rating":"1","title":"2001: A Bowel Odyssey","review":"One of the worst SF books I have ever read. The author displays the mentality of a 14 year old in constructing his future - the entire western world is collapsing because of lack of interest in the manned space program. Okay. Then we have to somehow believe in his cobbled-together scheme of flying a space shuttle to Titan (gee, the astronauts go crazy!! Who would have thought??) The last part of the book is pretty much the same as \\"Into Thin Air\\" as the explorers go on a pointless slog through Titan slush to find... something to do with chemistry. The descriptions of every bowel movement and pus-filled blister are given more detail than any of the scenes on Titan or the space voayge.Oh yeah, and in keeping with the adolescent spirit there are also two lesbian astronauts. By the time Baxter introduces them you can almost hear the porn-movie soundtrack in the background...Amazon.com needs an \\"no-stars\\" option. This book certainly deserves it."},{"rating":"1","title":"A horrible book","review":"I wouldn't recommend this book to anyone. The mood was well developed but too pessimistic and the politics were exaggerated but chillingly close to some people's rhetoric. The characters were undeveloped and unlikeable.

Most of all I hated the book's infectious pessimism, fatalism, and grotesqueness."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor and crass, pass on this one","review":"The highly detailed descriptions of shuttle operations at the beginning hint of an enjoyable read to come. The \\"reviews\\" likening the author to Clarke or Asimov are luring...Forget it. This repetitive (how many times must we use silver stubble as a stand in for old man or the texture or Titan slush at each footstep) and crass (is it truly necessary to detail human defecation and urination dozens if not hundreds of times?).

The characters were real, the events both in space and on Earth were riveting, and the climax was very emotional. I cannot recommend this book more strongly."},{"rating":"1","title":"Really awful","review":"I suppose the best way to summarize my feelings for this book is to note that I am an avid reader who saves everything I read (well over one thousand books in my library) --- but I threw this one in the trash as soon as I deplaned from my flight.The reasons have been adeqautely described in the other reviews: the laughable (but not, I assume, on purpose), stereotypical cardboard cut-out characters, leaden prose, wild jumps in the narrative, over-the-top implausible events (among the many ridiculous items: the US Air Force tries to shoot down the Space Shuttle at launch!), really silly ending and the de rigeur Leftish sneering at American culture and politics.I like sci-fi and wanted to like this book. But I couldn't. It's just very bad."},{"rating":"1","title":"Kept thinking it would get better.","review":"A co-worker lent me this book years ago. To this day, it is singularly unique in that it is the most depressing science fiction book I have ever read.

Save yourself the pain of reading this book and do anything else. It would be better for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Proof read???","review":"I am amazed at how bad the spelling is in this book. There is not one page where I haven't seen a spelling error. Shuttle is not spelled Shutde. I worked for the shuttle program for 8 years.

I wish our county's leaders had some vision."},{"rating":"2","title":"Titan","review":"This is the first book I've read by Mr. Baxter, and I did enjoy it very much. Very Imaginative, and descriptions of space programs and the SATURN V in particular, I found to be excellent.The overall pessimism and lack of faith in the ability of America to stay focused as free people was a distraction to me, but he is entitled to his own view points(and predictive [not] history). I would still recommend this book to anyone as it is well written and jam packed with fascinating aspects of life on a shuttle, various tidbits of chemistry, physics, not to mention a description of a pre-biotic Titan."},{"rating":"2","title":"If you're a space novel reader, Here's one for you","review":"This was my first Baxter book. I'm an avid sci fi reader leaning heavily towards space novels. This one started off slow, but showed promise, so I kept on reading. Lots of original thought with a mixture of what could truly come to be if we're not careful. I was afraid for the world after reading this one. Lots of good science which I understand he's known for. For me, a worthy book is one which makes me truly feel as I turn the last page, and this one was one I'd put on that list."},{"rating":"2","title":"TITAN a compelling read","review":"TITAN is a book that likely will appeal to only the truly HARD science-fiction fans. His style is wordy and very detailed, and this book will not be turned into the feel-good movie of the summer. For fans of Bova, I would imagine you would find this book equally compelling. Some parts of this work drag; however, I could actually feel the loneliness and fear of the characters. He does not use the stereotypical mix of races, intellects, sexes, etc.; rather, none of this matters in telling this story. Again, a great read if you're in the mood for a slow-moving yet intriguing story."},{"rating":"1","title":"An Obvious Rush to Publish Job","review":"This is the first and only book I've read by this author. This book had so much promise but Baxter ruined it with poor character development and a hasty plot. Did anybody really care about Paula?The beginning third of the book was excellent. Great commentary on the socio-political landscape that we live in. Baxter pushed the politics of today to its extreme but logic conclusion. But then it seemed that Baxter started rushing - was he on a tight deadline? The pace went so fast that I was wondering \\"how did we get here?\\"The only reason that I give this book 2 stars, is the imagination that the author has. The ending was bizarre but imaginative. This book is such as obvious sloppy rush job, I don't how anyone can rate it above 3 stars let alone the highest rating of 5 stars. A 5 star rating is a classic such as Dune, not this hastily written book.Next time Baxter needs to spend more time on writing his books. I hate to see such talent go to waste."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't like the characters, plot absurd, worthwhile science","review":"Baxter works out the science. You have to give him that. But I don't think I would want to spend an hour with any of the characters. Add death, desperation and decay, and you don't have a fun read. A five page science article would have been fine. If you like the \\"great ending,\\" and the way he works out the science, try Hal Clement. All the pluses, none of the minuses."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointment?","review":"After reading Voyager I was eagerly awaiting the Titan paperback, boy was I disappointed. The beginning was good, with the Columbia Shuttle crash, the middle: boring and fragmented detail. And what was that ending all about? brought back to life? billions of years into the future?I like Baxter's writing style and was a big fan of Voyager but this was way short of the expectations I had set for this book. Maybe I'm being too critical but I had expected so much more from this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"If you liked Chem 101, you'll love this book","review":"If you liked Chem 101 in college, and want it reborn as fiction, you'll love this book. Otherwise ...I avoided Chem 101, and this is the first Stephen Baxter book I read, so that gives you some background. Development of characters is horribly thin. Even the main character is more of a narrator than a personality. Physics and chemistry, though, are explained to the point of monotony. Bodily functions in zero-gravity or on an alien planet get more than their due, also. To his credit, Baxter takes the plot to a bold conclusion and then one step beyond, which surprised and pleased me. Unfortunately, the reincarnation segue to get past the apparent ending will disappoint even his most avid fans with its pure illogic. Novel ending; if only he could have gotten there reasonably..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Intriguing science, unrelentingly bleak epic","review":"Baxter is the master of this emerging genre--brilliant and endlessly surprising science welded into a sealed tomb of a story. What irritates me are the highly misleading reviews that speak about the \\"Grand Tradition\\" of Asimov, Heinlein, and Clark because those masters were all driven fundamentally by hope and optimism whereas Baxter's ethos in both Titan and Moonseed is thoroughly postmodern. In fact Titan documents the collapse of modernism in a just-around-the-bend America that must reach back to the massive, creaking technology of abandoned NASA mega-machines with an achingingly detailed noble attempt to save humanity that ends, quite literally, with a lump of human feces as the seed of a ominous future. Brilliant... but I think that the tool of creative science is only a chimera here. Then again, perhaps it's all an excercise in postmodern irony. If so, I want my money back."},{"rating":"1","title":"Excellent science in a depressing book","review":"The science in this book is the only thing that deserves any rating at all. The politics shows a penchant toward the absurd. The characters and plot are all depressing and not very realistic. The most realistic part of the book is the consequences that follow from the characters incredibly stupid actions."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good texture, dismal tone","review":"The texture, that is the feel of the experiences described in this book, as well as the powerful sweep of events stayed with me. A strong effect. The plot and character relationships and attitude about human fate is depressing and unrealistic.

I turned 50 this year and his treatment of the decline of general interest in the great adventure of space exploration struck a very responsive note. But what happened at the end of the book? It seems as if what should be a sequel has been compressed into a vague, hastily written last chapter. Please, Mr. Baxter, after the exhilarating, wondrous yarn that you weave until the death of the last character, why did you let us down? Your \\"resurrection\\" scenario had me saying, \\"Huh?\\" How does it happen? Where's the speculative science? How are they going to build that log cabin without a Home Depot nearby?

Then it dragged itself along the ground, it's fingernails breaking as it left a trail of blood along the path.

One cannot fault the author's bleak predictions for the future of the space program and NASA, most of which is unfortunately proving to be factually accurate, but there is absolutely nothing inspirational or uplifting about the book at all, even though the last astronauts survive a six year trip to Titan in believable fashion! No character is developed beyond the most negative aspect of his or her personality, and the hyperspace jump from sound scientific and technical discussion into utter fantasy (when, in the space of about ten pages,two of the characters are resurrected billions of years after they die on Titan---whoa!)provides only a jarring discord and fatally injures the credibility of the book.

Even after one day it goes down to 1.1 volt. After 3-4 days they are useless. Heck the energizer batts I have from over a year ago work far better than these. If I leave them for a couple weeks they go down to 0. I mean ZERO, no charge left at all. And I use the Maha charger on slow charge, every time.

The last disappointment was a set of 4 Powerex AAA 1000 mAh one year old: 2 of them died after 3 charges and none of those 4 batteries ever reached more than 800 mAH. This is the second fault of MAHA batteries: they typically reach at most somewhere between 60 and 80% of their declared capacity after only the first 4 or 5 charges.After 4 years of using MAHA batteries and chargers, I'm soooo disapointed that I'll switch to Duracell. I still have a set of 4 AA Duracell batteries 1700 mAH that still charges to 1500 mAH after 6 years.

I even fully dis-charged the batteries and re-charged them slowly over a 20 hr period and the batteries still wouldn't fully charge.Bottom line: It's not the cost that is my concern but the PERFORMANCE.

Each unit uses 4 batteries in series to bring the voltage up to about 5 volts. Using 3 different chargers to see if it made a difference, I couldn't get these to last more than about 3 1/2 hours. I then tried Sanyo eneloop batteries that are rated at 2000 mAh and they lasted 4 1/2 hours. If these actually provide 2700 mAh, then they do so while dropping in voltage to a point that equipment that requires the batteries to be near full voltage won't work for very long.Since rechargeables are supposed to remain at near their rated voltage for most of a charge (in this case 2700 mAh), I think these batteries are low quality. Since this happened with two different sets of 4 batteries, I don't think I just got unlucky and got a bad battery.Due to the expectation of high quality, and the high price, I justify 1 star for their performance."},{"rating":"1","title":"Batteries work but not for the item advertised!","review":"I bought 2 Pkgs. of these super duper AA rechargeable batteries that were advertised as an accessory to the Magic Flight vaporizer.

The only objection I have is that they do not have enough sizing options (which is why we had to and will have to use other brands). We did not use Tushies for my son when he was a newborn because size S was too big for him at that time and they are a bit stiff so we were not able to fold them under my son's bellybutton.

Her proper name is Barbara: she is actually the well-educated fiancee of Lord Milford Rintoul, but she makes Dishart believe she is indeed a brazen, bewitched gypsy.....Contrary to what a previous reviewer noted, Hepburn was a full 26 years old when this was filmed - NOT a teen-ager! Barrie's original novel dates from 1891. Maude Adams played Babbie on the stage with great success. Margaret Sullavan badly wanted to play Hepburn's coveted role of Babbie.

In my opinion, a third edition in this price range should not have so many errors and clumsily written explanations."},{"rating":"2","title":"Take the Lead","review":"It is an excellent book to teach graduate courses. While the students find this book too dry and technical, at the end of the course they see themselves with the basic skills for this growing field. For the IS practitioner, the book is an ideal resource. It gives exactly the level of detail needed to understand projects related to data communication technology.I have read the 2nd, 3rd, and 4th editions. I find the authors to progressively focus on new technology and issues of current interest. I recommend this book to someone wanting to learn fundamental concepts in data and TCP/IP communications."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for beginners","review":"I was asked to teach a class using this book. Unfortunately, the book is over the heads of most of the students. It is not the best job of presenting the information either. None of the students like the book. I do not recommend it as a class textbook, but as a reference for someone who already is in the data comm field. It does have some good technical information, but is not presented in a way that you can read the book from cover to cover."},{"rating":"1","title":"How Did This Ever Get to a Sixth Edition?","review":"This the worst text book ever!

The book is well written, easily understandable, & one of the more up-to-date texts I've read. (not an easy feat in the IT field)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not at all what I expected","review":"Although this book differed from any notions I may have entertained prior to opening the cover, it is a journey to be undertaken by those who really want to deepen their connection with the mineral kingdom. Much of this information is really about an experience... a journey. The book reads as though it is a single, giant guided meditation, and I feel that it is a lesson in \\"beingness\\" if nothing more.That alone may be why it is out there for us to enjoy.All of that aside, I erally tried to take the messages to heart. A lot of the material presented just didn't click. It is very New Agey, very \\"airy-fairy,\\" or the like. It is written as a series of lessons with key phrases intended to appeal to our inner selves, but it just didn't seem to light that spark for me. I don't expect this to become an overnight success or a favoured book in most crystal libraries, but it is still a neat and imaginative view into the mysteries of the crystalline community."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't be fooled by this pseudo-science","review":"This book tries to convince readers of its superiority to other titles in the same new-age genre by using complicated terminology. Although some of the visualizations are helpful, the amount of thought behind them is minimal. Beware of terms used such as \\"higher\\" and \\"more pure\\". This book perpetuates stereotypes of superior Christianity and denigrates the solid body and earth. There are much better books on the same subject. Avoid this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Book","review":"This is my first book about sushi. It is well organized, with lots of nice pictures. It is good for beginners (like me).

We then went around picking out the fish, rice and other items we would need to make sushi using the recipes found inside.

Using S&M and bondage as entertainment in this way is not good and not useful. I read all the reviews of this book and thought that with so many gals saying the book was a winner that it had to be, but maybe I will be the one voice of warning. This book is disturbing, and the characters are disturbed, so disturbed that there is no way the ending would be like the author has written it. I could not believe for one minute that someone who liked being beaten within an inch of her live would reform from it in this way. True \\"love\\" does not heal people the way this book tries to pretend. If you like erotic stories or romance, this is not for you. This one is seriously messed up and psychologically unrealistic. Try some of the other Radclyffe stories if you want something halfway believable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Radical","review":"I have read many of Radclyffe's works and I am a huge fan. Shadowland was dark, imaginative, sexy, heartbreaking, and fantastic. Radclyffe is phenomenal with imagery. Not a story for the weak but if you like living on the edge vicariously then you'll enjoy Shadowland. It heightens the senses and allows the reader to become part of the sexual adventure, a voyeur hidden in the shadows."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pivotal","review":"The best thing about this novel is that is makes one think about their own definition of love and intimacy. Kyle and Dane are likeable characters, but the way they express their love for one another is considered outside the \\"normal\\" realm of sexual expression (this always causes me to smile, since lesbian sex is considered \\"unnatural\\" for so many ignorant people, perhaps we should be more tolerant of other \\"fringe groups\\"). Bottom Line-Radcylffe takes a taboo subject and demystifies it enough for the reader to see it for what it really is: Another way people love."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"This book wasn't all bad. It brought an interesting perspective to the subject matter, and made some intriguing points. Overall, however, it was just rather boring, which is not at all what I'm accustomed to from this author. There was a ton of talk, and long stretches of time where the characters didn't progress at all, and when they did it seemed either forced or less than three dimensional. Don't hesitate to check out the author's other books, however.As an aside, I'm hardly experienced, but I've enjoyed much better lesbian S/M fiction from Penumbra's \\"Kink\\" series on the internet, or alternatively (no pun intended) Michal Salat's and Joann Muscolo's \\"Speed of the Beat of My Heart.\\" These series seem to bring out the pleasure, love and trust side of the life more than the self-torture and pain that seemed to be over-emphasized in this book for my taste."},{"rating":"1","title":"A good effort, but alas unsuccessful","review":"I tried to listen to this CD several times and I found myself falling asleep.

The rather fast and melodic \\"Don't stop running\\" together with the captivating \\"Lipstick and leather\\" are the best tracks. Songs as \\"She's a liar\\" and \\"Your love is driving me crazy\\" are also above average. The opener \\"Rock & roll's gonna save the world\\" is alright if you're not paying any attention to the lyrics. I have always had a hard time hearing Dave Meniketti singing love ballads, and \\"This time\\" is not an exception - just boring! If I were asked to give advise, I'd say that you should get \\"Black tiger\\" and \\"Mean streak\\" before this one. But the more you listen to \\"In rock we trust\\", the better it gets.

I can't tell the difference."},{"rating":"2","title":"Exactly what I wanted!","review":"I recently received a new 14 piece Calphalon cookware set and was in need of a place to store it. I had seen many different types of organizers and was not looking to install anything permanently on the wall or ceiling of my apartment. Having read some of the product reviews about the smaller top shelves I ordered some hanging hooks as well. I have to say that after receiving it I found this product to meet all my needs and was so thrilled that with the additional purchase of the Cuisinart CRMBKH-6 Chef's classic cookware universal pot rack hooks(6)in matte blk, which matched perfectly, I was able to fit the entire set on the stand. So very happy with this purchase."},{"rating":"2","title":"Easy to Assemble","review":"This stand went together easily and provides adequate support for display and storage of cooking pots.

This was the cheapest I could find. Putting it together was easy enough; you did have to jiggle some of the pieces around to be able to fit all of them together, however, but otherwise there was no problem. I would advise not to tighten the screws all the way before the stand is assembled. It is sturdy enough for several Le Creuset pots, and it stands firmly.

It runs so narrow on the top, and I could only utilize the bottom two shelves for my pots. It's no only narrow but short. Well, it's kind of my bad that I didn't really read the dimensions before i bought it. It's only 60 inches. I would expect it's taller than me. The whole purpose of buying a pot stand is to save the space, but for such a short and narrow stand, you can't do much.

I rushed to put it together to display my iron cookware. I followed the instructions carefully, to no avail did the item stabilize. I tried again thinking I had missed something.... NO. It wiggles and leans no matter what I do. The nuts with caps are fake, if you tighten to much the cap pops off. I think the attempt to reduce shipping cost by cutting the uprights in half caused the piece to be less stable. I have chosen to keep it only due to cost, but I contacted my local iron shop and I am having the whole thing welded. The cost will still keep me under the high priced ones that apparently are made well. No wonder in the instructions no less than 4 times does it say to keep away from traffic areas or not to touch it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Don't follow the manufactures instruction!

The other screws are loose so it is not a problem with the lack of flexibility prior to full assembly. The holes are definitely off kilter. I am sending this back to Amazon. Also, the graphite is a powdery paint that came off and I was not rough with these parts at all. Rereading these glowing reviews, I went back to look at my stand and I have assembled plenty of deep discount metal, graphite looking pieces of furniture before and the holes on the stand are definitely off.

I got used to it, but I still wish that thong was more narrow/thin. I got a size 8 and I wear a size 7.5 - 8 and the 8 fits perfect. They run true-to-size.

I was concerned because the price seemed low compared to the next available option which was a $1200 rack that was rectangular and copper plated over steel. I was pleasantly surprised when this arrived and I inspected the rack. The fit and finish is outstanding and of course it is very sturdy. My Copper kitchenware looks very much at home hanging from this rack."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tastes like a Sherbert Smoothie","review":"Great product. It tastes sweet and has great absorption.

I'm not a huge fan of eating seafood and the thought of liquid fish oil really grossed me out, but I tried this product and there was NO fishy taste and NO aftertaste.

I hightly recommend this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Supplement That I Take","review":"I cannot say enough positive things about this product. The orange flavor is fantastic, however it is initally rather strong and unexpected. It completely masks the fish oil and has very little after-taste. The whole family takes one packet a day which includes my 5 year old son. He has been taking the Coromega product for about 2 years now and initally we masked it in yogurt. Now he takes it \\"straight\\" and enjoys the flavor; we consider it a morning treat. Compared to fish oil tablets, you will not experience \\"fish burps\\" and other undesireable side effects.The benefits of Omega-3 are well documented, but personally speaking I experienced less up/down minor depression cycles over the long term and it has helped with my knees and overall joint health. My son has moderate ADHD, and Omega-3 is one of the best natural supplements you can give your child if he is diagnosed with this spectrum disorder."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Thing Since Sliced Bread","review":"I started taking this as recommended by my Doctor for high cholesterol (not this particular brand, just fish oil). I tried this because of the positive comments such as no fish burps and easy to take.

It is gone.Softer skin.More alert.I recommend this to anyone who will listen. I had no expectations when I starting taking this. I will never be without it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for Kids, Not so much for Adults","review":"This product is great for kids who are too young to take capsules. It is sickeningly sweet and I personally couldn't take it myself. If your child is over 5, I think they could take a capsule.

Not suspecting this as the cause, I wondered why but kept taking it for about a week, until it dawned on me that this supplement might be the cause. I stopped taking it, and the issue went away the day after. Hoping my body may get used to the ingredients, I started taking it again and the problem returned the same day. This repeated about 4 times after I stopped taking it altogether..Since most reviewers are not having any issue with it, either I got a bad batch or somehow it does not go well with certain people.. FYI, I am lactose intolerant, but I don't know if this has anything to do with the issue I was experiencing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Expensive but the kids love the taste","review":"These are pricey, but our kids love the taste (even our 2yr old).A great way to get especially young or picky kids to down their Omega-3s."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best product","review":"Even my kids will take this fish oil.

My child's behavior has really stabilized with this. It also tastes good. We tried some other gummy stuff and he gummied it to death and and still had some to spit out.

I cannot comment on the effectivness but I cannot comment on the capsules either."},{"rating":"2","title":"If I can do it....","review":"I have more than just a dislike of fish. I would classify it as an aversion. I can't stand to even LOOK at fish in the market. I know the benefits of fish oil, but simply could not abide taking it. Fish burps will send me running to the bathroom. So after reading the reviews about Coromega, I decided, with great trepidation to try it. I am happy to say that all the reviews are right. It tastes like an orange dreamsicle. I cannot taste fish at all and if I burp, it's just orangy tasting. (That may be gross, but I want to be honest here.)I am thrilled to find this product so that I can finally take fish oil supplement.Don't hesitate to buy it. If I can take it, so can you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Quick and easy and love that it absorbs better!","review":"Okay, is this stuff the most tasty thing in the world? No. But, you only take a teeny bit of it. It tastes kind of orangey-blah. It isn't BAD either though just not something you are going to want to eat heaps of. However, that aside, this is how I will take my omegas from now on. It is so easy and I really LOVE that the absorption rate is 300% more than capsules. That's what I'm talking about. I highly HIGHLY recommend this product. We all need omegas and this is the best way to get them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fish oil without the fishy smell!","review":"My son has been on fish oil supplement for years and this is by far the best option! The pills all leave him with fishy breath, burps, etc. Not fun! With these I just squeeze it in a spoon and he feels like he is getting a treat, like a spoonful of orange flavored pudding! This also has the correct amount of omega 3's (at least according to my son's doctor). These also travel really well, if you are going away for a week just grab 7 packets and go instead of a whole bottle of pills! The price might be slightly more than buying pills but is well worth the convenience, great taste and no fishy burps! I highly recommend this product."},{"rating":"2","title":"This stuff works!","review":"So glad I bought this. I've been taking it for almost a month and I've seen a change in myself. I find it much easier to focus and I even feel better! I know this is exactly what my body needed and I'm glad I went for it. Do not second guess this stuff it is amazing and it does taste pretty good. The orange flavor is kind of strong but who cares? It's better than that disgusting fishy taste and I'm pregnant so don't mind me my taste buds might just be a bit sensitive."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tasty!","review":"Delicious.

It came very quickly. I Will be back soon.."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disgusting!!!","review":"The aftertaste is HORRIBLE!!! After reading all of the other reviews I thought it was worth a try. I have been trying to find a great source of Omega Fatty Acids for the family. This is not the one! The initial taste isn't bad but the aftertaste really is horrendous. It is worse than the worst diet soda aftertaste that you can imagine. I didn't like it but had other members of my family try it independently (without me sharing my opinion, as I had hoped not to have wasted the money) No one liked it. (46, 40, 8 years, 4 years, and 2 years.) The little ones wouldn't take more than a tiny taste and made wretching faces and noises. I'm back to using the Gummy Vites Omegas for the little ones and the Nordic horse pills for the adults. They might not be as effective but at least we can actually eat/take them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bought this product because of the reviews.","review":"I have had trouble trying to get my boy to eat fish oil. I tried these because they got great reviews. I was very disappointed. He wouldn't eat it. I ate it after he wouldn't and it made me gag. I could taste the fish oil strongly. Not sure how others thought these were tasty. It was a waste of money!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good for people who can't swallow pills","review":"This is great for people who can't swallow pills. I was taking a tuna oil capsule prescribed by my doctor and only sold thru medical professional's office. This works almost as well. I can always tell how effective the omega3's I take are by the condition of my fingernails. This gives me nice nails but they are not quite as strong as with the capsules from the dr's office. I may just have to up the dosage of these. I found the taste to be very palatable with no fish aftertaste at all. Even if I burp this up it still tastes like orange and not fish. I just squeeze 2 packets right into my mouth and swallow all at once. I usually take this w/ breakfast so I can eat something to help get the orange taste out of my mouth. The flavor reminds me of a strong orange sherbet...not bad at all. I would definetely buy these again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Finally...a supplement that's easy to take!","review":"I actually got this for my son, but he says he doesn't like the orange flavor. Apparently he'd prefer to take liquid fish oil, which tasted gross to me and was messy so I thought I'd try this instead. I'm going to use this for myself because I love the flavor and it's super easy to take. Maybe I'll try the lemon-lime flavor next time to see if my son will eat it. For now it's back to the Nordic Naturals for Mr. Pickypants. For me this stuff gets five stars!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Surprisingly Great","review":"This is the only supplement that I can honestly say I notice an immediate difference. It clears away the mental fog and increases my alertness. And it tastes good! I give this to my son and husband also. Since we don't like fish, this is the perfect product for us. I highly recommend it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Coromega Omega-3 Supplement","review":"This produce arrived earlier than the estimated delivery date. I love the orange flavor squeeze packets - makes it enjoyable to take every morning and with great ease."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great concept, horrible taste","review":"I am really disappointed in this product. I found these on amazon after seeing an ad for them in my Whole Living magazine. I thought it would be a great way to get more Omega 3's into my families diet. Well, the concept is great & we would be thrilled if we could get past the taste. I'm surprised to see so many positive comments about the taste, all 5 of us thought it was sickly sweet & also had an artificial sweetener aftertaste. (& It's pretty crazy when my kids think something is too sweet!) Blech, not at all what we were expecting. I may try adding it to a smoothie but I'm a little leery b/c I'd hate to ruin a perfectly good smoothie!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best stuff ever invented","review":"I have been using this for a long, long time.

I take one in the morning and one at night and it shows in my blood work!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Tastes horrifying.","review":"These things are absolutely disgusting and makes me gag. My boyfriend got them for me, so I tried to eat one everyday, but it took at least twenty minutes for me to eat just one, because I had to alternate between tiny amounts of fish oil and gulps of water. I can't believe there are so many people who love these things."},{"rating":"2","title":"Are we tasting the same thing?!","review":"Everyone gave this tasty reviews and so I was expecting yumminess. >.> It tastes like orange oil, a sugar substitute, and fish. It's not intolerable. The fish flavor doesn't stay as an aftertaste in your mouth, but it does taste a bit fishy when you're eating it and if you burp it will taste a bit fishy, too. It's not really bad, but it's not really good like everyone said!! Is the lemon lime one any better?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Use for dog with lupus","review":"The vet prescribed Omega-3 for our German Shepard that has a form of lupus.

Hmm. :\\\\"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great way to get omega 3","review":"I'm glad I'd received a free sample of this Coromega supplement, as I'm not sure I would have paid to try it. But I'd have been wrong to think I'd probably not like it. It's palatable to the point of my actually looking forward to taking it each day. I'm thinking of trying the chocolate-orange flavor next.Also, I take a number of meds and supplements, and it's nice to have one less pill or capsule to swallow each day."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mary Poppins would highly recommend!","review":"The flavor (like an orange Creamsicle) truly makes the medicine go down. :) I recommend these to everyone I know!

And when taken with vitamin C (which it contains as well and with which most health conscious individuals supplement) produces benzine which is thoroughly dangerous. Talk about a toxic blend!

The instruction is clear and easy to follow. The poses focus on beginner to advanced moves, with a great pace. This isn't a \\"very beginner - never taken a yoga class\\" type of video. I think it's helpful if you know yoga first, before purchasing this video. There is no \\"what is yoga\\" teaching at all.

I was so surprised to find this book to be exactly what it claimed to be--A pictorial tour of college football stadiums. (Makes me think the negative comments were from readers who didn't read the words in the title --\\"Pictorial\\" and \\"Stadiums\\" etc.) There are many books already in existence on the teams, games, and schools, but none that give you a summary view of all the stadiums.Thank you for producing such a wonderful undertaking--and also for keeping the text as short as possible."},{"rating":"2","title":"Collins Cobuild Dictionary Excellent Source!","review":"I found the Collins Cobuild Dictionary to be an excellent source.

Then again, she breathes amazing life into Chuva, Empty Faces, and Like a Lover. I'm sorry that Jobim allowed \\"Se Todos Fossem...\\" (If Everyone Could Be Like You) to transmogrify into \\"Someone to Light Up My Life.\\" Although Sarah does a nice enough job on the English torch-song version on this album (accompanied by Jobim), to hear the best version of this song, as a love song (not a torch song), check out Gal Costa's live performance on \\"Jobim and Friends,\\" which is a great concert from beginning to end."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wouldn't purchase from them AGAIN!","review":"Took forever to get the product after it was shipped to the wrong address and I was then forced to pay for shipping again or paying a restocking fee.

Not worth the hassle!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Too small to be more than a collectable.","review":"I bought this bag for my son to use for school but it is to small to fit anything in it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good deal on In-Ear Headphones","review":"Got these Opus In-Ear Headphones just before taking a trip to Europe to replace the original iPod earphones that are OK for normal use but terrible in an airplane because of all the engine background noise. The Opus performed very well, they do block a fair amount of noise which allowed to hear the music without having to crank up the volume to the max like I had to do with the original iPod earphones. I found them comfortable and ended up wearing them pretty much non stop for 10 + hours on each fligth. The music quality is good for the price of this unit. If you don't want to spend a fortune for a good overall in ear headphone, I do recommend this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great reference on mic techniques, as has a CD!","review":"Who would think a book on mics would be a page-turner? But this one was. It has a clear and unaffected style. The book covers both professional and affordable (my kind) mics, describing the attributes, pros and cons of different types, and techniques of placement to get a desired effect. The CD that comes with it demonstrates different mics and mic placements on a number of different instruments. A valuable reference for anybody who records."},{"rating":"1","title":"Professional? I expected more.","review":"I expected more from a book titled \\"Professional Microphone Techiques\\". This book would be usefull for someone just starting to record music, but if you have even a modest level of experience with mics and mic techniques don't look here for any insights. Topics include basic mic types, 3:1 rule, prox effect, freq. response, an almost too expansive list of suggested mic positions of various insturments, eq suggestions, basic compression uses. CD included with the book is a nice touch."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing Professional About This Book","review":"This book should be avoided. There is nothing in this book that cannot be easily accessed in a few minutes on the internet, for free. Indeed, the only way the publisher of this book could justify its printing is if it came with Crayons for coloring the pages. Seriously, I was shocked and disappointed with the lack of information."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the best, by far.","review":"To make a long review short: You would be much better off playing Old Timer (Motor City), or even Detroit. This game is like a shoddy remake with flashier graphics."},{"rating":"1","title":"Car Tycoon a few trucks short of a full delivery","review":"While I was expecting an average car simulation game, I have been deeply dissappointed by the Car tycoon. I expected something close to Roller Coaster Tycoon. This game is not even close. I enjoy the potential of building different car models and research, buying other parts form suppliers, I dislike the bugs that continue to plague the system. Too many times the sound cliches or system stops in the middle of something for about 30 seconds. The map is pretty. But it is useles. No markers for the outsourceing of components on the map and no way to measure your success other than the weak graph that sinks as you borrow money. The manual is useless and the WEbsite is yet to be completed. All from a game released 2 months ago. I agree with the reveiw below.SOme german needs to do his homework."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible Game!","review":"This game is horrible! It has no point whatsoever and things take forever to do! I sometimes leave it there for hours so it can do something, and when I come back, POOF! All my money has gome down the drain! Sheesh!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Game; Awesome","review":"The cool parts about it is that you can have a lot of different cars and if you are a car fan you should get this game. you are a Car dealership thats wants to sell your cars, you control the prices of the cars, and the parts of the car."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy this game","review":"I bought this game because I loved cars. When I loaded it I found messages kept coming up in German. I returned the game for a new one. This seemed to work fine. I then noticed that the woman in the bottom right hand corner of the screen sometimes speaks German. I then discovered that sometimes when trying to sell off models, they get stuck and you can't remove them. The biggest problem I found though was that I put in 7 hours of work into a supposed \\"open ended game\\" to find that once saved, and I was the leading manufacturer, when reloading the game it comes up with a message saying \\"Time has expired\\" and then a message saying \\"competitor has attained goal\\". I would never but this game again, or anything from this supplier. I would never recommend them and if there were a similar game around by another supplier I would buy it because I don't think it could be any worse than Car Tycoon."},{"rating":"1","title":"convoluted piece of [junk]","review":"Don't bother. I love cars. I love business simulations, but just looking at the official website for the game turned me off to the whole thing. They INSIST you watch all their elaborate graphic animations, virtually guaranteed to waste your time unless you have a T1 hardwired to their server. I didn't even get past them to learn anything else about the actual game. ..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Game I have Ever Played","review":"I own a bunch of sleezy car places and found that this was just like the real thing. I loved his game and it reminded me of when i cheat my customers. I reccomend everyone in the world buy this.Peace out"},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the Best Ever","review":"This is one of my Top Ten movies ever. I saw it when it first came out, and it made a huge impression on me that I never forgot. When VHS came out, I was thrilled that I could find it and see it again. Then later, looking for it in DVD format, I was able to find it via Amazon. I am thrilled. However, I still haven't received my order (it's been about a month), so I am now having to research for it. For those of you who haven't seen the movie, the movie will not feel dated whatsoever and its dramatic power is as strong today as it was then. It continues to be a one-of-a-kind drama concerning sibling rivalry, choices, those who never married, being stuck in your job, death, kindness, courage, mountain climbing in the Alps, and even has diversity - an East Indian woman is a supporting actress. This movie is a classic and timeless."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mountain Climbing is not for the faint of heart","review":"I enjoyed this movie and saw it years ago. I decided to buy it because of the mountain climbing episodes and the interaction between climbers(brothers)."},{"rating":"1","title":"This Import of The Mountain is transfer from VHS","review":"The movie to me is a five star & one of Spencer Tracy's finest performances. The edition with Korean & Chinese subtitles [THE MOUNTAIN with Spencer Tracy (Import Edition)(Adventure) (1956)], as shown in the cover image of this product has been transferred from VHS - probably the same edition sold by Paramount in VHS 20 years ago. I was very disappointed as i already had a copy from the same VHS edition--(the screen noise & dust specks make me think it IS the same NTSC VHS Paramount edition), & I think, the one i already have is a hair better in image crispness, thus a slightly better transfer made by Euro International DVDs. A wonderful movie & hope it will receive a proper digital transfer, if not from Paramount, from the company that is now doing some of the old Paramount pics. I apologize for disappointing anyone who believes they are getting a genuine transfer from other than VHS source."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sound Not Synchronized","review":"The movie is great but the sound is typical of an early Japanese monster or Kung Fu movie. A movie that shows the actors lips moving then the sound comes out several frames later. Is there not some company out there that can reproduce this great classic Spencer Tracy movie with better quality than this foreign attempt?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Poorly Designed Game","review":"The game is very poorly designed. The pegs are very flimsy and don't fit into the holes tightly. They keep dropping off at every slight touch. Its very annoying."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not recommended","review":"I concur with the other reviews. In concept, the game is pretty cool. In execution, it completely fails. The pegs falling out drives you nuts really quick. I'd like to know if anyone had the patience to actually finish a game. Re-designing the pegs is a must for Milton Bradley."},{"rating":"1","title":"So disappointed!","review":"I agree with the other review. It's a cheaply made game, and the instructions didn't make sense that one ship could fire 8 times per turn. It was very frustrating when the pegs kept falling out and it was difficult to see the grid to determine if it should be a hit or miss. What a rip off."},{"rating":"1","title":"Works great till you change the bulb.","review":"I like the style of these but they are definitely not built to last. When I have attempted to change out the burned out bulb (which is a real challenge in itself) the device doesn't last much longer . Not a good track record for something so expensive. I do not like throwing things like this in the trash when it could be made to last for many years."},{"rating":"1","title":"Junk","review":"These lights looked really great, as described by many of the more positive reviews. Unfortunately, the bad reviews were also accurate. The bulbs burned out in less than a month of using them about 4 hours per night on a timer. And they didn’t just burn out. One got noticeably dimmer and more yellow that the other for days before finally dying. Looked really bad. So after they both burned out I tried to replace them with the extra bulbs that were included. Everything went fine, but it turns out it wasn’t that the second bulb had burned out. It was actually the transformer. After one month this P.O.S. doesn’t have any current going to the lights. Garbage. Don’t buy or you’ll be sorry."},{"rating":"1","title":"Broke after a year","review":"Not worth it, and the wires are unattractive and cumbersome.

So this is a massive FAIL.Hello!? LED!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great decorative plant lights","review":"I have purchased four of these over the years. The first set still works. I have given a set to my mom and to my daughter and they are both happy with them. Because they are halogen lights they burn hotter than regular bulbs, but I am partial to the intensity of halogen, therefore I only use these lights with a tree-type plant such as a ficus or fiddle leaf fig so the lights are not too close to the leaves. I would buy these again."},{"rating":"2","title":"LOVE, LOVE, LOVE. My butt and thighs thank you.","review":"In a nutshell: 30 Minutes, beginner and advanced levels.

It's fast, tasty, and best of all - no fats, oils, or shortening needs to be used, so it's good for those watching their fat intake. Yes stoves vary, and I had to add a little time (or more water) to some of the recipes, but overall, I'd recommend this to anyone. To those who've complained - give it another chance - it's worth it!! The only thing we didn't like was the pasta dishes. I haven't had any problems with pan surface flaking off, no rust (what are they talking about??), it's very easy to clean - basically just rinse it with hot soapy water and clean it with a sponge. It is a HUGE pan - yes it takes up a lot of room, but I still wouldn't give it up for ANYTHING!

It did not do what they said AT ALL! I mostly bought it because I wanted to be able to cook meat from frozen as I tend to forget to lay something out and end up eating out which gets expensive for a family of four. Well, with this I end up throwing out the food and eating out anyways. It will NOT cook your food from frozen without leaving the center frozen and the outside charred. I have regular pans that aren't the size of my stove that I can cook thawed meals in I was hoping for something I could cook frozen meals in. It is also very big and time comsuming with having to add water, open/shut valves, and turn food over every couple of minutes.

True, the stacking steam rack can be handy on occasion, but the ability to cook multiple foods in one pan is a bit of a gimmick. I'm perfectly happy to dirty a separate cake pan rather than have my cake \\"steam baked\\" (and flavored) by the vapors of my entree.If you don't already have any large cooking pans, the Turbo Cooker may be an inexpensive multi-use item. (Could be great for someone living on their own for the first time.) But if you already have a full set of cookware, there's really no reason to buy it. It's HUGE and takes up a ton of space in your cabinet.The Turbo Cooker seems to be cheaply made, but I can't vouch for how it holds up over time since I returned it within a month of receiving it as a gift."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good for steamed veggies, not much else...","review":"The cookbook cards recipes were totally useless, I don't know where they pulled out those miraculously short cooking times. Ours turned out to be a good 2-3 times longer, and cooking meat on it is OK if you like to eat steamed/boiled meat.The only thing it does well is steam vegetables, where it finally did live up to its \\"turbo\\" name.
