Jolie looks great - as always. I can watch this movie just to catch THAT dress at the end. Oh boy.Why did the movie producers change Jolie's character from Jewish to the daughter-of-an-Oirish cop? Sachs to Donaghy? Did they think an ex-model Jewish beat cop was what, too incredible? Surely in whatever movie she is in, Ms Jolie stretches credibility just because people as beautiful as her don't exist in real life doing menial jobs like the rest of us. So why change her character? If I remember rightly ( and I may not ) isn't Sachs' Jewishness very useful in at least one of Rhymes later cases?"},{"rating":"1","title":"!

The killer was obvious just from watching the credits (or if you had previously read the book), the camerawork was awful, with too many lingering close-ups and idiotics POV shots that I assume were supposed to make the audience 'relate' to Denzel Washington. The acting was hammy, the characters one-dimensional - especially Amelia and the 'scary' scenes were laughable. I found myself cringing - not due to the 'scary' scenes - but due to the awful acting, bad dialogue and dull set pieces that we have all seen before. Barely watchable."},{"rating":"1","title":"LAME ( Both Denzel's character & movie ), wait for it on HBO","review":"I saw an Academy Awards screenining tape, the movie is only so-so.

We only see the killer in dark dank places, we only see him with a mask over his face. Angelina Jolie is cast against type as a woman cop, but unfortunately even that is now becoming a cliche in an overdone attempt at something different. This is strictly formula, been done a thousand times, with flat direction and an utterely boring script.

NO BONES ABOUT IT!","review":"It's hard to believe I never saw this film before now. This movie held my interest from beginning to end even if there are the usual plot holes.

Of course, you don't find that out until the end. Washington is a forensic detective that is permanently disabled. Jolie is a junior officer that accidentally gets the opportunity to work with the one time expert. She becomes Washington's eyes and ears (and hands) at the crime scenes.All the scenes appear to be set up so that only the best of the best forensic experts can possibly decipher what is going on. Enough of that....The acting is well done. Both Washington and Jolie do their parts well. The film is entertaining. Not quite edge of your seat, but worth watching."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great performances from Washington, O'Neill, and Latifah . . . and that's about it","review":"This movie could have been so much better, but they just had to ruin it, didn't they? With the exception of very fine performances from Denzel Washington, Ed O'Neill, and Queen Latifah, the rest of the film just falls flat. The plot seems so ridiculous that I can't help but look away. Angelina Jolie's acting is below average, but she did her best. The twist ending wasn't very disappointing, but it did fall flat because of its exaggerated (or lack of) suspense. I didn't really enjoy watching this thriller. There are better ones like Se7en, and The Usual Suspects. Watch those two, and you'll see how a real thriller should be.Grade: D+"},{"rating":"1","title":"Almost unwatchable","review":"This movie was bad. It was so bad that it made the good actors in it look bad by proxy. The plot was simplistic, dull and forced. The suspense was found in spots that must have read on the script as \\"(Insert suspense here)\\". Denzel Washington acted like Denzel washington acting as a cop. The tired 'foil' detective they tried to use as a red herring was so obvious it was painful to watch. The identity of the serial killer was so pathetic that it made me throw stuff at my TV. The clues left behind by the killer weren't all that subtle, I've seen smarter clues in Encyclopedia Brown mysteries. It's a boring predictable hollywood hack job. bad bad bad. Don't waste your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ridiculously Non-Believable","review":"This movie is just so tragically non-believable, that it irritates the viewer and you have to quit on it.Good cast, but what stupidity in the script. Are they serious letting us believe that a serial killer is re-enacting crimes from an almost 100-year old novel.And so Angelina Jolie goes to a decades abandoned meatpacking storehouse and can still smell the manure??????Duhhh --- the place has been abandoned for decades. More non-believably, you mean to tell me a real estate developer hasn't snatched up the property and razed the building. That it has sat undisturbed so that even the manure is intact decades later?I'm sorry -- when movies use plot devices so amateursishly like this, I bail on the whole project."},{"rating":"1","title":"two stars is generous","review":"A rookie cop teams up with a legendary (and paralyzed) detective to solve a Saw-meets-Se7en serial killer.This film is bad on almost every level. The worst part is the plot, which even if you turn your brain off still produces a bunch of \\"huh? you're kidding...\\" moments. No joke: documenting the plot holes, deux ex machina contrivance, and just plain inanity of it all would be a Unabomber-length manifesto. Moving past that, however, the performances are wooden enough to make a thousand toothpicks, and the cinematography tries to go for \\"dark and creepy\\" but just manages to make things to dim to see.I came close to giving this turkey one star, but couldn't quite bring myself to do it.

It had great actors, and an okay story line, but not scary at all, which was oh-so-disappionting to me and my husband. We were hoping it was as good as the previews."},{"rating":"1","title":"What an American ending!","review":"It was a nice script that went sour (or very sweet for that matter!), with performers too big for this movie. Everything was packed in a 2-hour duration, people went back and forth, with no actual coherence, the plot was pretty thick but so, so shallow and the final scene was ...frustrating, to say the least (compared only to the waving flag in \\"Private Ryan\\"). It's a great pitty, though, because the senario had every element to make a great movie, if seen from a more serious, \\"somber\\" point of view."},{"rating":"1","title":"It isn't Se7en by far","review":"I got drawn into seeing this movie because it's a creation of the same director as Se7en. Se7en was a brilliant movie that, if you haven't seen it, you should really go see. This movie actually has one big flaw: it never gets exciting. It's not at all scary, the plot is predictable and I personally think Angelina Jolie isn't a very good actress. It's basically a movie like Se7en, with one exception; everything what Se7en does right this movie does wrong."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not real pleased","review":"I had read the book like 3-4 years ago and I had been waiting for the movie ever since. I veiwed the movie this last year on the big screen finally. I was rather disapointed, with the actors they used and the back ground of the book, they had completely lost the grasp of keeping your attention. As the book, one almost had the feel he/she was right there with the killer, or his victims. they left out some of the best parts that would of made this movie better than Seven!. But, no, I could of made this into a killer movie if I could of had the actors and the money to do the film!."},{"rating":"1","title":"Eh.","review":"One word comes to mind when I try to descibe this movie: Formulaic. While perfomances by Jolie and Washington were good, there wasn't enough here to keep me that interested. It wasn't horribly scary, nor was it very suspenseful. Mildly entertaining at best. I think most people should be able to pick out the killer halfway through. I've seen worse, but I've DEFINITELY seen better."},{"rating":"2","title":"bone collector","review":"It came in sooner then promised and my wife was very happy.

It was good to see Luis Guzman in a \\"good\\" role."},{"rating":"1","title":"SORRY.. .THIS \\"THRILLER\\" backfired...","review":"It's a shame. This thriller is so unconvincing that you end not believing that Washington is in it. THe plot is a shame, nobody even gets a little bit scared. THere is a coward attempt to mislead the public to believe that every character may be the killer. IN the end, the ridiculous cliche scene that shows the killer ready to kill the heroe, but then our female heroe (Jolie) appears out of the blue delivering fatal shots into the grotesqly stylized villain. Sad.."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mish-mash of horror films doesn't equal scary movie.","review":"\\"The Bone Collector\\" mimics the camerawork of \\"Silence of the Lambs\\", and the plots of \\"Copycat\\" and \\"Seven\\". This makes for an interesting movie with Denzel Washington as the bed-ridden detective who shows mobile detective Angelina Jolie the ropes in forensics. There are some flaws in the logic of the story, and it tries too hard to fit too many issues--the hardships of paralysis, the relationship between Washington and Jolie, Washington's estranged family, the gruesomeness of forensics--that the other aspects of the story suffer. Despite this, those who are looking for a scare, might enjoy this. Washington is fine as always, and Jolie is a promising newcomer. Two stars. Josh Bob says check this out at night."},{"rating":"1","title":"To hear the producer talk about the book...","review":"In the BONUS section of the DVD, The producer tells that as soon as he read the book, it would be a fantastic movie, He is right.Then WHY DID YOU CHANGE THE BOOK SO MUCH TO MAKE A MOVIE?.

I feel like Angelina has a little too much energy for a role like that."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dissappointed","review":"I expected quite much more when I rented this film... First of all, I found Angelina Jolie isn't anything more than another Catherine Zeta-Jones! No significant acting, face solid as a rock. Even Denzel Washington acted more and better than she did! The story was very common, and the clue-gathering rather boring. And of course, the ending reminded me of about a gazillion other movies, where the bad guy gets killed before he can kill the good guy, by the good guy's partner!

I havo not read it, but I guess it must be better than this turkey."},{"rating":"2","title":"A brainy thriller","review":"The Bone Collector is an intelligent thriller about a serial-killer on the loose in New York City. The plot would be your typical \\"solve the case\\" mystery if it weren't for the utterly intelligent script and talented cast. Denzel Washington plays a paraplegic ex-cop with a main assett: his brain. With the help of a cop (Angelina Jolie), he is able to gather small clues left by the criminal and is able to solve the case. But there are a few surprises and plot twists that make this film very interesting.If you love smart and well-written thrillers, then \\"The Bone Collector\\" should be on your DVD shelf."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pathetic Programmer masquerading as a movie","review":"This would have been good as a Showtime original, even a HBO Guilty Pleasure. It might even have worked as a syndicated series starring Carl Weathers and Heather Medway. Alas, it is a mega-budget Hollywood movie with name actors. The ending of this film is as cowardly and candy-ass as any film ever made, and the brilliant decision on director Noyce's part to have another actor who you think might be the killer masquerade as the killer in certain scenes makes it even more lame. Pathetic."},{"rating":"1","title":"No stars.. It really was too much of a waste","review":"This movie was really stupid. First of all, there are too many themes here which never get pursued...Jolie's relationship with her father, the overbearing officer in charge, Washington's wish to die...it all is rather left on the surface. The plot itself is senseless...you never feel a sense of coherence. The ending is very anticlimactic. I refuse to waste any more typing on this incredibly stupid movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"CHEAP THRILLER","review":"The mediocrity of this production is so great that I almost couldn't believe it when I first saw it, taken by the presence of Washington in it.

The end seems like a comedy, so absurd it is."},{"rating":"2","title":"Above-average Thriller","review":"Denzel Washington puts in one of his finest performances, quite convincing as an injured, bed-ridden forensic detective extraordinaire. Angelina Jolie is quite good, too, in a role that demands some subtelties.I see every darn thriller Hollywood churns out, and this one is firmly above-average. Very good cat-and-mouse tension, some real mystery, and more than adequate suspense.A warning: Some rather effective off-screen violence and gruesome crime scenes."},{"rating":"2","title":"All good and so, except for one minor detail.","review":"The Bone Collector was suspenseful, and great, the movie rocked. Keeped you guessing through out the whole movie. A little gory but that is what serial killer movies are like if you don't like gory movies i recomeend you don't see this one.

Give this one a wide berth."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Worth Watching Unless You Feel You Deserve To Suffer","review":"Denzel Washington has that kind of screen appearance that makes me want to smell my own armpit. This movie was really, really, really, really boring. I was so bored that I took a jar of Cheez Whiz and poured it into my belly button and stuck one of those miniature Mexican flags that some restaurants put in their margaritas. Then I declared myself the Emperor of Mount Mexico until the Cheez Whiz started running down my stomach in sort of a lava flow way. This made some of the time pass quicker while watching this dreadful film, but mostly I just wanted to go to a turtle party."},{"rating":"1","title":"An Ugly Mess of a Movie","review":"Denzel Washington and Angelina Jolie star in this cheap\\"Se7en\\" knockoff that should've been shelved. Terrible script gives way to bad acting, and some of the worst direction in recent memory. The ending seems as if the writers made it up on the spot; illogical and laughably stupid. The film tries for shock value, via a series of gruesome murders, but all suspense and horror is killed by the atrocious acting and direction."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love this one!","review":"I love to watch this movie! I am a huge Angie fan and this is enjoyable because it is before Agalina was known as the hardcore action hero she is now. Some of the best acting in this movie is done in the silent moments(by both Jolie and Washington).Very complex acting and even though it is suspenseful it is heartfelt as well. A keeper."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh my god!!! This movie sucked!","review":"I hated this movie, and it just wasn't because I read the book first. They changed nearly every aspect of the book. I can't believe that Jeffrey Deaver allowed them to butcher his great, gripping, sometimes scary novel the way they did. This movie wasn't scary in the least bit. I ended up fast forwarding to the end cause I wanted to see how they ended it... I hated it so much I ranted and raved for like the next week. Oh my god it was horrible. Movie NEEDS to be redone the way the book reads, with a very gay Thom, the romantic relationship evolving between Rhyme and SACHS, the UN Conference going on. And it damn better be sit on the edge of your seat what is going on...."},{"rating":"2","title":"What a trip","review":"Every Keneally disc is an experience - an eclectic blend of rock, pop, jazz, experimental, and weird stuff played by primo musicians. Not dance music, but grooving somewhat melodic tunes for those who seek out something original. On this release Mike utilizes five drummers, various backup vocalists and the incredible Bryan Beller plays bass on most of the songs. In my opinion, Mike is one the greatest guitar players ever. He's also a tasty keyboardist and a great composer, which is clearly heard throughout this disc. Unfortunately, this album is currently out of print, but since \\"Hat\\" and \\"Boil That Dust Speck\\" were remastered this year it may just be a matter of time before this gem is available again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shut up and play!","review":"I bought this album a few days ago and I must say I'm disappointed.

As I listened to the album, all I could think was \\"When is he going to blow me away on the guitar?\\" That never happened. He is a good piano player, though. The bottom line is; if you want a good guitar album, avoid this.

There are several common weak points of his books -- confusing symbols, lack of explanations on those necessary issues and lengthy B.S. on those simple issues. Numerous typing errors make the matter worse. This book spend a chapter talking about old fashion of moving averages, such as Spencer 7-point and 15-point. It almost goes into the field of graduation. What's the point? The chapters on ARIMA are also rubbish. My feeling is that the author lacks sense in statistics, all he saw are just mathematics.

The basket is very solid and sturdy, and has plenty of room to carry all kinds of stuff. It does add weight, as others have noted, probably about 10#s (don't quote me on that). My bike has eyelets and screw holes for a mount such as this. I was able to use some of them, but I still had to bend the basket slightly (my frame was too wide) and makeshift my own solution. It was not easy, and it left some scratches on the frame. Once installed, however, the basket is great.

If you can tolerate some slow parts, and ignore the sophomoric and silly dream sequences that clutter up the movie, it's very well acted by Silverstone and Dillon. Bottom line: it's a one hour movie wrapped in a 94 minute package, but the one hour inside is pretty darn good."},{"rating":"2","title":"Above average thriller","review":"This is a good thriller despite the fact many critics panned it. Alicia Silverstone is excellent as the virginal Mary Giordano who wants to follow in her dead father's footsteps and become a police officer. Secretly investigating some recent teenage murders Alicia finds herself in mortal danger from a madman who knows more about her than she realizes. Billy Nunn is great as a cynical older Cop who knew Alicia's father and tries to tell the eager young woman she shouldn't romanticize crime. Aided and abetted by a sexy young cop played well by Kevin Dillon, Alicia is drawn into a web of deceit and desire that just might kill her if she is not careful. There is a wonderful sting in the tale that will shock you (if you don't work it out first) and the plot and acting is first rate. Another underrated film that deserves more merit than it is given."},{"rating":"1","title":"True Crime? Really?","review":"I couldn't believe this piece of dumbness. The Kevin Dillon character escaped from a max security prison and is now about to be given a police job? Really? Most of the dramatic entertainment consisted of him deflowering the Catholic School teenage Alicia Silverstone character. Dunno, my wife is a long time fan of real true crime novels and movies (i.e. \\"The Stranger Beside Me\\", etc.). Maybe this flick just needs a new name. \\"Lame Crime\\", or some such."},{"rating":"1","title":"Crime Caper","review":"The ending has always stuck with me.

This is useless for the most part and is only worth getting if you're a compulsive NIN-collector. The upside to this release is that it encompases what you get on the Down In It single and the Head Like A Hole Opal import single, so you don't have to waste the money on those by getting this. The remixes on this are horrible as far as creativity goes as compared to later remix albums around the Downward Spiral and The Fragile era remixes. This only exists because Trent Reznor wants your money so he can continue using it to go Jet-Skiing and wasting his time playing video games instead of working on a new album."},{"rating":"1","title":"why did they rerelease this?","review":"Why did they rerelease this.

On the one hand, I like the way Treant Reznor keeps his work fluid. On the other hand, I'd like to see new work as well.\\"Head Like a Hole\\" offers some very good versions of hot songs from Nine Inch Nails' first full album, \\"Pretty Hate Machine.\\" The only trick is, if you don't like the originals, you're not likely to like the remixes muxh either.I am not partial to the \\"Down In It\\" portion of this album, but like the rest very much. The \\"HLAH\\" remixes can get tedious if played back to back, but they are cool versions nontheless.I recommend this album if you are a fan of earlier Nine Inch Nails."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fact as (poorly written) Fiction","review":"Needs an index, chapter listings, footnotes, and a bibliography. Author claims to have interviewed two hundred people, but does not list their names. If this is non-fiction, he needs to remember Joe Friday's (Jack Webb's) famous quote \\"Just the facts ma'am.\\"If a reader is serious about history or the events of the explosion at Texas City, and chooses this volume, I would hope he is good at speed reading, otherwise it may be a long haul."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Writing, More Soap Opera than History","review":"The story of the long-ago explosion at Texas City has the elements for a good non-fiction narrative. But this book fails the test. In the hands of this author, a potentially interesting story is all soap opera and purple prose. No cliche is left behind. Bill Minutaglio uses an irritating present tense apparently designed to gin up reader interest. But the characters are cardboard. And his reach for pathos is more likely to bring laughter than tears.The biggest problem is that the line between fact and fiction is blurred with impunity. What's real? What's not? In the the hands of a better writer or a more disciplined historian, this book might been good. But there's little here to recommed."},{"rating":"2","title":"City on Fire","review":"I came to amazon to order a couple of copies for friends even though I haven't yet finished City on Fire. I loved this book -- it's gripping, and the author puts a real human face on a tragedy that hasn't gotten enough attention.Even more amazing is that the technical and political details flow seamlessly with the rest of the story. You'll care about the issues as much as the people who lost their lives."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Well Written","review":"\\"City on Fire\\" purports to be a work of history, but it is so poorly written that it loses whatever historical value it might have. Much of it is written in the present tense, rarely ever appropriate in a historical work. Additionally, the book contains no notes or bibliography, another major warning sign in a work of history. Given how it is constructed, one has to wonder if the author intended for his work to read like a historical novel, but it fails on that level as well.It's a pity, because the subject itself is quite interesting and deserves a much better treatment."},{"rating":"2","title":"TOUGH KID, BRILLIANT WRITING","review":"YOUNG LONIGAN, the short novel that introduces the STUDS LONIGAN trilogy, is the brilliant evocation of the tough youth of a tough kid in pre-WWI Chicago. The prose is tour-de-force stream-of-consciousness. It seeps into the mind of a smart, flawed, hilarious kid (imagine Max Fisher without the scholarship, or Stephen Dedalus without the educated abracadabra) and it takes you right into the depths of your own conflicted youth.

He rivals the best pop artists in lyrics and melodies. With \\"Sanctuary\\" he proves that he is of Steven Curtis Chapman caliber. It is clear that his eyes are on the Lord and what his will is for us in this life. There is no \\"fence riding\\" on this CD. This is not crossover music. This is flat out, God-inspired music. I am so impressed with the pouring of out of loyalty to the Lord in \\"An Audience of One.\\" This music inspires me to be a better Christian every time I hear it. I loaned it to a friend. When I got it back and played it, I was blown away all over again. I am blessed to have an opportunity to have insight into Jonathan Pierce's relationship with Christ.

Highly recommended!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting","review":"Is this all-time classic, impeccable rhymes? Is this the best album ever recorded? Of course not. But, with Kanye West's \\"College Dropout,\\" it is the latest in a gradual shift of hip-hop culture to a more positive, mature, substantial set of values. This is exciting, to see rap shifting from the iced-out thuggery of today (personified in the G-Unit) to an intelligent form of art. And on top of it, it's a pretty good album. No matter what you say about Puffy, he's a good producer, and it shows here. Some notable tracks are \\"Welcome Back,\\" \\"Wasting my Time,\\" and \\"Do You Remember.\\" Positive and fun without being overly pop. In twenty years, we may point to 2004 as the year rap changed, and this album is certainly a part of it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Album","review":"Mase's new album is a hot one.

It's just great."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nothing Deep, but Fun","review":"This CD is no Harlem World, that's for sure, but we'll probably never see that kind of CD from Mase ever again.

Hip-hop is definitely in need of more positive messages.Instead, this album is nothing more than just another P-Diddy influenced commercial for the bling-bling generation.

For one thing this is so confusing because for one thing, I thought he was with Bad Boy Records, he's been with Diddy for like 10 years and he just switched to fake A** crew like G-Unit.

Sure, he went into the spirit thing, but man what happened? Not only has he changed spiritually, but vocally and in style. Ma$e used to be a regular rap artist, just one of the best around. Who could forget his wonderful part in the song, \\"Mo Money Mo Problems\\"? And that was just a part of a song! Now, after 5 years, everything changed. His vocals sound extremly weak in every song. And what is with his style? On his \\"Welcome Back\\" vid, he wears what? What was that? A dollar store T-Shirt and cheap partially ripped jeans? Really, something happened to this guy, and I know it had absoultely nothing to do with him being spiritual. But the main question is if you should buy or not. If you own any Ma$e CD, just throw this in with your collection. If you don't, forget it.

Mase, go back to the ministry. 50 Cent, start doing good rap like you did on \\"Get Rich Or Die Tryin\`\\",not bubblegum rap like you\`re doing on \\"The Massacre\\". Anyway,in a nutshell,don\`t buy this cd. I would recommend \\"The Documentary\\",\\"Get Rich Or Die Tryin\`\\",and \\"The Marshall Mathers LP\\" over this mess. Also, don\`t buy \\"The Massacre\\".

His first single \\"Welcome Back\\" was the perfect re-introduction to Mase coming back to the game. His second single \\"Breathe Stretch Shake\\" is a club banger and is hot to death at the club scene. \\"Money Comes and Goes\\" is the perfect illustration of what the reality of the music business is and what he went through.

But, I'm really salty that he was so extremely rude on the MTV Video Music Awards by walking in front of the camer when Black Eyed Peas were on the Red Carpet. If Puffy wants to be the annoying, childish, gawdy little boy that he is, that's his business. But did Mase have to be an (...) too?

He doesn't just show off his rapping name.If you ever want great rap without the worry that parents will get mad at profanity, this is it right here.

It seemed that the author was sympathetic to the South and anti North. Even more so, it seemed to be anti Lincoln in that over and over again Lincoln was referred to in various deragatory manners by people of the south as presented by the author. I came away with the feeling that the author was presenting the South as noble and in a favorable light while the North in a less than favorable light in that they were usurping the free men of the South the right to keep people in slavery. Furthermore, the wife on one Southern naval officer being held by the North is raped by another Southern naval officer and totally gets away with this.

Of course, it doesn't sell, but it is the pure reality.I like most of the tunes, although Michael Franks' and Bobby McFerrin's appearances are not at their best.

I cannot even find the CDs now. They must be out of print. At any rate, do NOT waste your money on this CD. I just bought the disk today and it is bound for the nearest used record store as soon as I have time to unload it. This band totally sold out to so-called smooth jazz (a misnomer for yuppie elevator muzak) and it simply is not worth the money. How sad. At this point, my only hope is that they've disbanded.

It's a very random, uneventful death.\\" And for that reason (among a few others) it is an unimportant tale to tell and a waste of time to read. But it is that reason - that it is an unexciting death, random, uneventful - that it is worth reading because it paints a detailed picture of all of us. You don't read Tolstoy for the fantastic; its not Harry Potter after all. But what Tolstoy has a great talent for is to take a single event, a single life, and turn into all of humanity. How many of us are Ivan Ilych, rushing headlong into eternity with no sense that at any moment we may cease to be? So, in a sense, it is a very existential novella because it speaks to the purpose of existence and to the right way that one should live. And the story, like life, is random, but very eventful if you take the time to step back a moment see it for what it is."},{"rating":"1","title":"Expected More","review":"The story is excellent. When I buy a book for my shelf, I expect quality. This appeared to be public domain open-source material plopped into a cover.

Seemed like a free ebook product with a cover."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Fascinating","review":"I was fairly young when I first read the Death of Ivan Ilyich, and the man's story fascinated me. It is a book in itself, not a siderunner to Tolstoy's enormous (and more than a little tedious) and more famous works such as War and Peace. The way Ivan Ilyich's thoughts swing from hopeful to despondent is interesting and reflects fundamental human psychology. Tolstoy is indeed a great author."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tolstoy is better in his native tongue","review":"I can't read Russian, but I have to imagine that it's better than this garbage translation of \\"The Death of Ivan Ilych.\\"Do yourself a favor and buy a more expensive copy, otherwise you'll lose the story and become angry with the translators."},{"rating":"1","title":"Um....","review":"I chose to read this novella for a school project.

Unfortunately, most if not all of this books contents were dull and uninteresting. This is MY personal opinion of this book.

This novella is an absolute masterpiece. It made me think about things my jaded self had long since given up on, like God, purpose of life, death, fear. Tolstoy has an absolute deadpan sense of humor, which was so subtle it took me a while to catch on (for example, Ivan's fatal injury occurs while he is hanging expensive drapery out to impress his friends--what a beautifully ironic, even funny way to point out the meaninglessness of his life?).If you're like me, and don't have the time to slog through \\"War and Peace\\" but are interested in Tolstoy, try this book. It's outstanding."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great story but don't buy this version (typos, etc)","review":"I love the story but agree with the other reviewers that this version seems to be some strange open-access version created with autocorrect and plopped between two covers.

I would say this would be an awesome book for anyone dealing with death and dying in their professions or daily life.

I'll admit the first listen through wasn't as captivating as I'd hope, but after repeated listens it grew on me.

Still, her ideas regarding women's self image left me startled. Encouraging a woman to get a nose job or breast augmentation \\"if she needs it...\\" is not biblical truth. According to the true bible beauty should be sought from within not without. There is nothing wrong with wanting to keep the \\"spark\\" in your marriage. But Marabel Morgan's entire theme is how to dote on your husband 24 hours a day. Who are these women who have the time? Doesn't the husband have any responsibility? The wife is nothing but a plaything, a barbie doll. This is not a biblical book. In fact, the book makes a mockery of the true sanctity of marriage, and teaches women if they are not \\"cute or cuddly enough\\" their husbands may leave them, and \\"seek shelter in the arms of another woman.\\"ps: I would love to know what medication Marable is taking, Prozac perhaps?"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Total Woman, by Marabel Morgan","review":"I read this book some 18 years ago and it was very refreshing being a newly married mother with small children.

Most of the advice is just as useful as it was when the book was written. I doubt that husbands today don't care anymore if their wives are poorly groomed, for example. And men and women still believe that great sex for both of them is important in marriage, right?What I found most interesting is that the book stressed organization. If your life is organized, it is less stressful, and your if life is less stressful, you are a lot nicer to be around and your home is a lot nicer place to be. All that is good for a marriage!

No relationship relies of the efforts of just one person-two people must be actively involved. The fact that Mrs. Morgan portrays this book as Christian is false as well. Since when did Jesus ever tell a person to reduce themselves to mere sex kittens (not to mention lying to your husband about his sex appeal!). Mrs. Morgan reduces men to helpless, pathetic victims who should be manipulted. I wasn't aware that manipulation and lying are Christian virtues.

This is an excellent book on the SF earthquake and fire in almost all respects. The photos and drawings are probably the best one can find anywhere and the work is well researched. I would not hesitate to recommend this book to anyone even remotely interested in the subject.The reason I gave the book four stars instead of five is that it is written very mechanically. The authors spend much of the book telling us about the fate of individual buildings and so fail to tell the story of the disaster fully.

Last week he had to read and memorize the 23rd Psalm. He knew most of it, but we could not use his bible we had to use mine.

Two dance scenes would have been worth watching IF they hadn't been interrupted by flashback/dream scene/ODD interruptions. The lyrics, when they existed at all were trite and painful.

This movie has an insanely dull talk/sing/talk/sing pattern that never deviates and quickly creates a sense of dread and compulsive clock watching. The songs and story here are not overly compelling and you won't walk away humming any tunes.As for performances, the lady who played the wife did a stunning job despite her obviously limited vocal range. Daniel Day Louis gives a stunning performance -- too bad he has to play such a pathetic and uninteresting character.

Great cast, great performances, great director, visually interesting, sexy, provocative. Yet, all that is not enough to make it particularly good. One of the problems is that as a musical, the music isn't particularly good. Marion Cotillard gives another great performance and Penelope Cruz spends the majority of her time on screen in a sexy corset and garters, which explains the Oscar nomination. Oscar likes his corsets. The garters alone are almost enough to get three stars from me. . . almost.

Whom is it trying to reach, and how? Did the filmmakers ever ask these questions? They sure didn't answer them. (How fitting that a film about a director struggling with a script shouln't have one.)Assuming this was a musical -- was it? -- I doubt there has ever been one with such non-catchy songs: banal music, grade-school lyrics. If ever a musical could use a huge shot of Steven Soundheim this is it. Leonard Bernstein wouldn't hurt either.Judi Dench gives a solid performance, as does Marion Cotillard. Otherwise, nothing.

I think some of the critics judged it harshly because of its stellar cast, as though they would sound more profound by doing so. I saw the musical on stage several years ago, and they did a great job of tweaking the story for film. Nicole Kidman may not have a great voice, but boy oh boy does Marion Cotillard--her perfomance is SO MOVING!!--and Penelope Cruz is simply a knockout (who knew she could sing so well?). I liked Nine way better than Rob Marshall's earlier film, Chicago; the themes are much deeper, and I was thinking about the story long afterward (in other words, Nine is more than just some \\"entertaining musical\\"; it is honestly thought-provoking). I highly, highly recommend this film!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely Brilliant.","review":"Even though many people have reviewed this movie saying that it is not very interesting or good, I found the movie amazing, and I couldn't imagine how anyone could not fall in love with Guido Contini's story.

I know... Chicago won all those awards! As in Chicago all female performances are done by actresses who really dont sing and dance that well. In Chicago every dance scene is cut after 10 seconds and editted together. In this film, Penelope Cruz is afraid of looking into the camera, and all the dance scenes are filmed from Row M in the back of the theater. I guess this is done because Cruz and others cant give a believable closeup, just as Zelweigger couldn't in Chicago. It takes a special kind of talent to be able to do the \\"Vamp\\" thing and look right into the camera lens. I don't know who's the bigger incompetent here, Marshal or Cruz, but to waste DD Lewis and have him sitting around grinning convincingly is a shame, and we are never treated to experience any real \\"spirit\\" or guts. It's all a showy spectacle that lacks the heat the play within the play is supposed to be so full of."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unwatchable","review":"If you are familiar with Fellini, 8 1/2, or Nine, avoid this movie. Should you not heed this warning, see this movie on an empty stomach. Yes it is that bad. Colorful yes but empty. They redid the Broadway score and turned it into music for a cheap strip club. I don't know what Lewis was doing but it was not acting. He was just going around \\"emoting\\" all the time in a way that made him look silly. Horrid accent as well. I could not make it through this film. I heard it was bad but figured I would give it a chance...nope...it is that bad."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretty awful","review":"I ran to the theater to see this movie, largely because of the cast - especially Mr. Day-Lewis. I am not a big fan of musicals, but somewhere in my mind I was expecting a smart, sophisticated and entertaining movie like Chicago or Cabaret. I don't recall exactly how long it took, but sometime during the first half hour I realized I hated the movie and began considering the merits of leaving early. I give it two stars, one for each of the things I liked: looking at the cast and all the nifty sixties design. Otherwise, I would agree with pretty much everything in the negative reviews. Except I would add that the music is especially awful. Not a melody in sight and some of the most uninteresting and predictable lyrics I've ever heard. The play might have been better, but I can't imagine anyone breathing life into those dreary songs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Minus Nine","review":"Well, lighting did not strike twice with Rob Marshall's direction of the screen adaptation of\\"Nine.\\" Yes, \\"Chicago\\" was an immensely great achievement. Was it luck? That is arguable. Anyway, what we have here is a bastardized version of the brilliant stage show. Yes, the screen is a completely different medium and adjustments have to be made. However 3/4 of the wonderful Maury Yeston score is gone and the addeded numbers are atrocious. Without going into morbid detail, I believe when you have a piece that is so theatrical, transfering to the screen is a losing battle. The thrill of \\"Nine\\" on the stage was Tommy Tune's masterful direction and choreography and the perfect cast. The plot took a back seat. In the screen version, most are miscast and use of star power obviously did not work. The most beautiful song in the show, \\"Unusual Way\\" is destroyed by Nicole Kidman. The film is a mess from beginning to end and my guess is Rob Marshall's reign as a film director is over."},{"rating":"1","title":"Flat, lackluster film full of amazingly talented people.","review":"What a waste of this marvelous cast. Each one of the ladies is mesmerizing onscreen, but just like in the plot for the film, they really have nothing to work with.

What a waste of time to watch this flat, lackluster film full of amazingly talented people."},{"rating":"1","title":"No bubbles in this champagne","review":"This film reminds me of an old saying: \\"a triumph of never-mind over doesn't matter.\\" A very unmusical musical - there is literally not a single memorable song in its 2 hour running time - this film wastes the considerable talents of its all-star cast (best is Marion Cotillard, who generates considerable warmth in an otherwise cold, synthetic film) with a story so indifferent and a leading man so completely devoid of sympathy or interest, I was reduced to fast-forwarding my way through the second hour, which I almost never do. There wasn't even any good dancing to rouse interest, as it was all done in chop-chop MTV style - very disturbing in a musical that boasts a director who is a Tony-nominated choreographer. I'm glad I was dissuaded from paying to see this in the theaters last winter - I would've been forced to regard it in an even more negative light. *1/2 out of *****"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not your old-fashioned musical","review":"Perhaps I don't have the right background to appreciate this performance.

I'm not...and I didn't."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cinematic Dullsville","review":"\\"Nine\\" features an impressive star-studded cast with all the technical elements up to par. So why is director Rob Marshall's rendering of the overrated Broadway hit astonishingly dull? Perhaps the answer lies in the fact that Fellini's \\"8\\" does not lend itself to musical treatment. The songs and characterizations remain stunningly forgettable. Kate Hudson's \\"Cinema Italiano\\" number, in particular, looks like a self-contained music video that belongs on MTV. Oscar winners Daniel Day-Lewis, Judi Dench, Penélope Cruz and Marion Cotillard valiantly attempt to breathe life into a lifeless story. In stark contrast, Nicole Kidman, Fergie and the eternally glamorous Sophia Loren are badly misused in glorified cameos. Judging by the spectacular box-office failure, it's easy to see why moviegoers stayed away in droves."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brief review from a casual viewer","review":"After reading everyone else's thoughts, I think it not out of play to join in... I watched this last night with a friend, and was quite entertained. I did not think too deeply on the message of the filme, for I did not feel there was much of a message but to tell a story and amuse you the viewer. The plot line was a little confused, simply because it was not clear this was going anywhere... however, I found the performances quite enjoyable, some of the song/dance numbers captivating enough to go back and see a second time, and my girl Kate Hudson leapt off the screen in a performance I never thought one might associate with her. Penelope Cruz heated up our living room, and I counted myself glad not to have any kids to wisk out of the room.So, concluding my opinion, a fun movie and worth the rental (I bought mine), and worth a second viewing or more... but not for you if you need something more cerebral or soberly serious."},{"rating":"2","title":"magnificent in parts","review":"This book points out an all too often ignored point: that arguments over sprawl and transportation are really arguments about race and class, because when government provides roads to accelerate suburban sprawl but does not create transit to reach highway-created suburbs, it essentially freezes the carless poor, elderly and disabled out of employment and civic life.Some of the essays in this book are a bit dull and bureaucratic--but the best make it worth reading. I especially recommend David Oedel's essay on Macon, where after desegregation the city wrecked its small bus system by investing heavily in suburban areas without bus service. The result: in a city where 14% of the households (mostly African-Americans) don't have cars, bus service stops running at 6ish. After reading this I couldn't help wondering: \\"have they [the governing elites in places like Macon] no shame?\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Poorly made and cheap material","review":"I got this for my 3 year old and the size was fine but the dress was extremely uncomfortable.

A pity it foretold with such a weak voice.Nince Inch Nails is a great acts, and the first album, \\"Pretty Hate Machine\\" showed off quite a bit of talent. IT is my opinion, hwever, that \\"Down In It\\" was a passable track at best, perhaps the weakest on the album. With that in mind, the remixes do not impress me much at all.Being a collector, I do own the \\"Down in it\\" single--But that is pretty much the only reason I own it. If you simply must have it for collecting purposes, by all means, buy it. If you wish to hear what the remixes are like, I would recommend the \\"Head Like A Hole\\" Maxi-Single, as it has quality remixes of \\"Head Like a Hole\\" and \\"Terrible Lie,\\" so you will not feel gipped for buying it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Really awful.","review":"If this is the one that 'started it all', its a shame it didn't finish it.This is a really dreadful song, like an anti-drugs rap, or the anti-suicide rap from the popular move \\"Heathers\\".Bad songs can't be saved by remix-remix-remix- burning more money in the studio.It sounds puerile, cheesy, almost laughable when compared to anything else ever recorded in the 'industrial' canon.I mean, at the time this was released 'industrial' was at its peak. I advise you to buy 'Thaw' by Foetus, its only slightly more expensive than this, and you wont feel cheated.'Broken' is the only worthwhile purchase by this ,err, \\"artist\\".Its a shame to think the youth of today actually respect and listen tp this fluff.If you like Christian anti-drugs rap, which sounds somewhat more than marginally cheesier than ACID-HOUSE, buy this.

Well, that song _is_ included here in the form that also appears on the album. An entertaining song to say the least. I am just as big of a NIN fan as anyone else out there, but the TVT singles were really nothing to sneeze at. Especially \\"Down in It\\"'s single.What makes this not worth owning? Well, others have explained that already. Besides, the remixes are boring, repetitive, and too long. If you are a halo collector, I guess you can get this. If you like the original \\"Down in It\\" and don't know if you want to get \\"Pretty Hate Machine\\" (a highly recommended album), I guess this too.

This album contains hard core riffs, rap, hip hop, and a lot of that unique ETC sound that's a really relaxed (or badass) guitar lead. As much as I love E.

He's introduced a whole new style to very serious fiction, making it light and engaging. Very clever. And in this book, he's true to himself, as always giving us a light, engaging, fun read. Pity it's outdated, which I why I can't give it 5 stars. It really is incomplete and there are many aspects of contemporary art that are not properly taken into consideration. The fundamental variance between Picasso and Duchamp is missing, body art is not included as are many other current forms of contemporary art. Perhaps this is not so surprising considering he wrote this essay back in the 1970s...And it still manages to be highly relevant which is why it fully deserves its 4 stars!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Bigotted and ignorant perspective on modern art","review":"I was raised in a blue collar family so I certainly am not high-falluting.

Just because Wolfe doesn't understand it and it doesn't speak to him does not make it bad art. It speaks to my soul and I am thrilled that artists created art that became known as Abstract Expressionism -- and indeed that abstract art still is being created in 2012!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Archie Bunker on Art.","review":"While this book is not without its moments of humor, it is obvious to art lovers that Wolfe has little idea what he is talking about. He lumps any kind of art he doesn't like into a single category of \\"modern\\" and thus bad--no matter that Abstract Expressionism and Pop Art are nearly absolute opposites; to him they are the same because they differ from what he considers the historic Western tradition of realism. Wolfe's contempt for any kind of innovation in the visual arts leaps off the page. He has no ability to appreciate what the artists he bashes are trying to express--the storms and fury of the Expressionists, the playfullness of the Pop Artists or the cold, elegant purity of the Minimalists. They deserve better critics than this."},{"rating":"1","title":"An uneducated critic","review":"This is an unpersuasive essay about the failure of modern art and about how we are all caught up in the falsity and ugliness of modern art.

Has the latest firmware, etc. I called Samsung and after trying a couple of \\"fixes\\" was advised to send it in for repair at a cost of $110. I don't think so! Shopping for a different brand now. A Samsung TV I bought failed a couple of weeks before warranty expired. They had to replace the whole thing, a piece at a time. I love my Sharp TVs, and various Sony components - no reliability issues with any of those. Samsung can't make it much over a year - two for two now."},{"rating":"2","title":"does what it should 100%, extras on the other hand...","review":"I'm usually a Sony kind of guy, but it is an excellent bd player, does what is should, plays discs! As for extras, Samsung has a very limited and poor selection of addons. It doesn't seem like they care to provide more in the future either. As for the unit, it has very limited add-on memory, is very slow to load and run apps, but overall they do work at least! Very nice power-saving options... I.e. turn off panel leds and display after timeout (hey 20ma per led adds up!), etc.. It's a bit needlessly big, not sure why people still think bigger is better. Touch panel works like a charm. Remote is okay, was hoping I would only need one remote since my tv is also a Samsung with similar remote, but navigation can be a pain, even with Samsung bd-wise anynet+ system linkup. Overall, if you are not tech-savvy, you will like it. If you're a geek, you'll wanna hack it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Network Blu Ray player!","review":"I bought this mainly to receive Netflix movies, but it is a great player for Blu Ray as well as standard definbition DVDs.

Tried a few of the display and audio settings to see if they would cajole it into playing anything at all. Still no luck. I've had good experiences with some Samsung monitors and televisions, so I'm pretty disappointed that the player is just flat out dead. Reading around I've seen some complaints about the laser failing out and preventing discs from being read after a bit so I'll probably avoid a replacement and just look for a different player."},{"rating":"2","title":"Now with search!","review":"I was looking at many blu ray players, but wanted one that could search netflix instead of just using the instant queue. The latest firmware (not software) update provided this ability. You can browse by genre, recommended, new and the usual comedy, drama, etc. The search option uses a simple text box and the remote cursor to select your letters. The player is fairly cheap and the video quality seems just fine. The only other service I used was pandora and that went just fine. The only downside is that when you use the built in update feature it doesn't check for firmware updates, which you download from the Samsung website and burn to disc or USB drive."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Performance","review":"I bought this player the end of December and it worked great out of the box.

I have about 20 brand new blue rays and the device has trouble with most of them.The online software and menus are ok, not great.

I think that makes it about the same as getting a new player, which I plan to do. Why invest more time on top of everything I've already done which has made no difference. The player often freezes completely, many times at the \\"FBI Warning\\", but when it is working it is so slow that you're never sure whether it will run or not. Unbelievably, it never remembers or holds the last place you were on the disc - it always starts over at the beginning so you get to go through all the warnings, credits, menu, etc. every time you turn it on. I'm very sorry I bought this on the Cnet recommendation - it is just junk. My very old Oppo has none of these problems when using the same discs."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very pleased","review":"While looking over other reviews for this Blu-ray player, some said it loaded very slowly.

Sure it plays blu-rays but the internet connection is pitiful. The picture quality of blu-ray is only part of the experience. The streaming media is really more of the experience these days. First, you have to buy their wifi adapter--another $40. Then it reverts back to wired internet every 5 minutes.

I was initially disappointed by the fact that the wireless adapter was not included. After spending another $70 on the adapter, the player would not connect to the internet. Support had little to offer in regards to help. They get paid top bucks to tell you to reset the player, unplug the player or to call tier 2 support. After 2 weeks of troubleshooting, I finally was able to get the player to connect to internet on my own (had to unplug the adapter, reset my router/modem and reset the player.) After a day of being pleasantly surprised that it was working, it stopped working making me yet again reset to the factory defaults.I also was in shock at how Samsung completely ignored usability standards, making the interface difficult to navigate, full of bugs and overall an unpleasant experience.However, when this works, it works well.

Obviously not broadband.) The disc did not work to upgrade the player and customer service told me to try a flash drive. Another couple hours trying to download that version and it worked.The worst part is that the player stops in the middle of a movie and will not move on unless I turn off the player, turn it back on, wait for the movie to load and move to the last scene it played. It must be some kind of memory issue, if there is such a thing connected with blu-ray players.I'm on my 3rd software update and none of them have helped."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hard to skip previews","review":"The player works ok if you never ever want to skip the previews.

No help.I got conflicting statements from Samsung techs. Strangely, you have to enable this device for the internet through Samsung's own server.

My computer-savvy son and wife followed the directions explicitly, but the update didn't work. When I called Samsung, the customer service representative told me two ways to fix it. Neither worked. She stated that sometimes it takes up to two minutes to get it to work, and then she refused to stay on the line with me for those two minutes to see if it would fix the problem. She told me I would have to call back if it didn't work. This is some of the worst customer service I had ever received. Guess what? It did NOT work!

I had to configure the player in order to play DVDs, a feature that should have been set before I opened the box. Worked fine for a few months after that, but then started acting up. The player makes a whining noise while playing many DVDs and BDs, but not all. It also beeps and makes awful noises through the speakers when the disc tray is open. And it started turning subtitles on by itself and the only way I could turn it off is by shutting down the player then opening and closing the disc tray.Samsung in general has been going down in quality over the past few years. If I were you, I would buy a different brand."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible Device","review":"This is the first review that I have written and I only do it to save others from the mistake of buying this device. If you want to watch DVDs, prepare to be frustrated across the board. DVDs don't eject, so you have to power off device and power back on and hit eject button immmediately, often times you have to do this several times before it works. It also never remembers your last place on the DVD. I had an Onkyo DVD from about 10 years ago that was way better than this one. This has to be one of the worst devices I have ever bought.Only positive is that streaming works fairly well, although frustrating that you don't have access to Hulu."},{"rating":"1","title":"Remote didn't work out of the box!","review":"The remote didn't work right out of the box.

I will never buy a Samsung product again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Freezes up frequently","review":"This player is fairly inexpensive, but it shows.

ALSO, the included BluRay Remote works on my Samsung TV... with NO programming needed! Quite amazing technology picked up at Best Buy for just $99.For all - the quality for bluray is perfect for 1080i (my TV's max capacity) but the DVD upscale leads something to be desired.

Unfortunately I missed the hundreds of please for help online from people who were trying to have a wired Ethernet connection from their wireless router to their blu-ray player. There really are complaints after complaints from people who say their internet provider won't give them the manual network install information after the blu-ray player's auto detection of the settings only provides information that can't let them access Netflix, firmware updates, etc. I had the same issue, contacted cable internet provider and they said reboot the modem. I called Samsung support twice and they said just buy the Samsung LAN adapter, the lowest price for which I found was $60. Plus tax, the entire setup would be around $170 and not the $99 price you are seeing here. I lodged a complaint."},{"rating":"1","title":"Audio sync issues","review":"As a cheap blu-ray player I was not hoping for much. Been having issues with the audio being out of sync with the video.

I have just a small network and need to extend it to the TV room. I DO NOT like wireless connections and this unit needs an adapter to connect wireless.30DEC11, I have tried other DVD movies but few of of my older DVDs will play.

I waited patiently for the next update. It arrive this week over the internet - at least one thing worked.

Not to mention they were sued over their crap blu-ray players before. I wish I had known that before I bought this one. (i didn't buy from amazon).This is unacceptable and I will avoid samsung from here on out.So here I sit with my new shiny copy of Expenables 2 and I can't watch it until I go out and spend more money on a new blu-ray player worth a damn."},{"rating":"1","title":"Loud pops whle playing, seen in 2 units","review":"There is a problem with this unit and its interaction with my Samsung LCD TV. I have every reason to belive the problem is in the player. There are intermittently loud pops and cracks while watching discs, as well as streaming via Netflix. I returned my first unit and a second one demonstrates the same problem. I went through all reasonable debug steps, including swapping HDMI cables, using different HDMI inputs on my TV, applying all available firmware updates, etc. Other HDMI sources into my TV do not have this issue.Another gripe... the Netflix user interface is primitive. My major complaint is that you can only watch movies that are already in your queue, meaning you have to go to your PC to find new movies. Alternatively, the Wii interface has the ability to search and select movies beyond your preselected queue. I assume Netflix develops the application, not Samsung. Regardless, the solution is substandard."},{"rating":"1","title":"did not work","review":"This blu ray player did not work for me at all.

WAKE UP! Both movies are movies of the mind, \\"The smell of the green Papaya\\" is a nostalgic, romanticed picture of Vietnam, \\"Cyclo\\" is Vietnam as Hung experienced it upon returning - but still a Vietnam of his Mind.The movie is great - the characters are great, their missing expressions are intentional, the distance between the viewer and them intentional as well.

The images left with me are of squalor, filth, gore, emotional void, boredom. The story is without coherence or meaning. The scenes are dark and depressing. The actors have no soul. They don't convey anything, they don't touch you. This is not to say that their acting wasn't good, but they remain removed from the viewer. I was not able to be touched by their misery. Not even by the beautiful main actress, her shiny white silk pants always spotless despite the garbage she has to walk through every moment.

Most of the content was derived from other sources. As a compilation it was quite thourough. The print was extremely small 8 point font for the most part. When put against a gray background the text was almost impossible for me to read. I noticed a typo on pg 37 and the book shown by the adult portayed on the cover graphic appears to be a religious hymnal of some sort an odd choice for a book about reading text. At over 500 pages of 8 point text this book needed an editor very badly. About half the useless material should be cut and the font should be raised to 10 or 12 point.

It's still interesting and although Trent's vocals almost ruin the song - the song is saved due to Al's top production skills ( something Trent could use a hand with )"},{"rating":"1","title":"Why Trent, why?","review":"By far the worst of the Pretty Hate Machine era remix albums, the Sin single is basically three bad versions of the best song on Pretty Hate Machine with a mediocre cover of the Queen song \\"Get Down Make Love\\" for good measure. These remixes are horrible and extremely redundant. Imagine Sin. Okay, now image Sin if it were really bad. Okay, now imagine Sin if it were really bad being remixed by Gloria Estefan and the Miami Sound Machine. That about sums up what this release sounds like.

The Short version of sin is superb and holds true with the original version with a catchy 4/4 beat. The Long version is very off from the albulm version, but includes interesting ambience and loops that add another dimesion to Sin. The Dub version of Sin defies the boundries of industrial music and even crosses over into reggae here, with Trent's best bass line ever. Also on this CD is a cover of Queen's \\"get down, make love\\" which simply blows the original out of the water. The intro of \\"Get Down...\\" consists of splices of cable show interviews and porno movies which is worth the cost of the CD alone. I highly recommend getting the import version, as it comes with a glossy black digipak, as opposed to the ugly red and blue colours of the domestic jewel case. This is the best halo from the best NIN song, period!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I've changed my mind...","review":"Okay, so the release of the Fragile blew everything out of the water.

So it would have been slanted if I hadn't of moved it up a hole. So only one bolt is holding it up and not 2. The boards that go right under the mattress were suppose to be screwed in, but they didnt even budge with an electric screw driver. It just made dings in the wood. It looks as though it is already cracking where one of the bolts is screwed in. I emailed the company and have heard nothing back. We shall see how it holds up. I wouldn't pick this again even if it is really cute! I gave it 2 stars because at the moment it is working, and maybe I was un lucky and just got a badly made one.

Spice: THoaT stands out among both popular and academic style books on spices with its colourful diction, its intense focus and most of all with its exhaustive research. Turner's bibliography was just as helpful as his other content. For the majority of readers, those who aren't doing research, I still recommend it heartily. Spices are absolutely fascinating, and Turner chows down on their history without using phrases like I have in the title of this review. Another strong work in the same vein is Nathaniel's Nutmeg by Giles Milton. Unlike THoaT, NN has a central story and a narrow focus, but it covers similar ground and is also a good read. I got an A on my paper, and Spice: The History of a Temptation gets an A+. Turner is thorough in his research, and deft in his presentation."},{"rating":"1","title":"The not so tempting history of spices","review":"Jack Turner's book has been showered with unusual advance praise ('a brilliant, original history of the spice trade'), but its content is of rather mixed quality. The Introduction alone contains numerous errors, beginning with a reference to cloves in Syria 3,700 years (briefly published 20 years ago, but never substantiated) and an incorrect description of a nutmeg (the author failed to notice that nutmeg is not 'surrounded' by the mace, but sits inside a shell). For all the hard work the author put into this, too often he falls for the spectacular and exaggerated in a 'sex-sells' history of spices. While it makes for entertaining reading, it cannot be relied on as a balanced or scholarly piece of work. In contrast, I would recommend Andrew Dalby's 'Dangerous Tastes - The history of spices' - maybe a trifle less thrilling, but written with far greater competence."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fascinating","review":"A thorough account of the history of the spice trade, by which the age of exploration was fueled and through which many of today's established countries came to power.Though Christio-centric at times to the exclusion of alternative rival explanations (yes, it actually does come up often enough for me to bemoan it), Spice is a great read for anyone looking to discover the lost magic in their kitchen spice rack."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful research, interesting stories","review":"The brilliance of this book is not just in the research, which is considerable, but in the fascinating stories told about spices and the spice-trade throughout history. From the mummification of Pharaoh Ramesses II who was found with peppercorns in his nose (a spice not grown in Egypt - so how did it get there?) to the descriptions of different spices valued in different places, this is an unusual book you will find yourself returning to until it's done.I especially liked learning the strange tidbits of history associated with spices, like the fact that they were considered to come from the East where the Garden of Eden was!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A page-turner","review":"This is a marvellous book. Two parts cultural history, one part travelogue, and one part culinary guide -- stirred together gently. This is a very engaging chronicle of the history of spices, and the mercantile system that brought them to all corners of the world. The book is witty and informative. Turner does for spices what Mark Kurlanksy did for cod and salt."},{"rating":"2","title":"All about conspicuous consumption......","review":"I highly recommend this book for any foodies who are into the Big Picture. Why *should* spices have been such a big deal that people were willing to spend huge sums of money and/or years of their lives to attain them? This book attempts to answer this question along social, spiritual, and culinary dimensions. Some of what you learn may be surprising - Cloves came, originally, from one place on Earth and had somehow managed to be imported from a tiny Pacific island to Mesopotamia over 3,000 years ago! Some of the arguments seem kind of hand-wavy however - while the argument is made repeatedly that spices were the scent of heaven, the \\"why\\" never really comes across clearly. Nevertheless, the book is an excellent read and *spicy* food for thought."},{"rating":"1","title":"That's a wrap...","review":"The first one had me pounding carpet in the theater from their inspired set ups.

Based purely on the design and sound, I would recommend these speakers to others.But I cannot recommend these speakers since they have a \\"fatal flaw\\". JBL really messed up when they made the volume buttons touch sensitive. Interesting concept, except that they don't work AT ALL. I can't raise or lower the volume, or mute the speakers. I'm stuck listening to everything at the default volume level. In reading some blogs, it turns out that others are experiencing the same problem that I am.

I went online to read the reviews. I bought them because i saw they were on sale and for the price, they were exactly what I needed. They have great sound and amazing volume for the size of the speakers. I can't complain about the subwoofer since it's perfect for my needs. However, my only complaint is the positioning of the input jacks and bass control. with all the wires where they are supposed to go, it is very difficult to adjust the bass. Also, the way it's set up, the control is right next the rest of the jacks in the BACK... or the jacks are in the FRONT depending on how you look at it.

They are not the same movie, so by rights they should not be the same score. Still, with so many of SHAWSHANK'S crew (including Thomas Newman) returning for this one, I suppose comparison is inevitable... so for what it's worth, GREEN MILE's score IS considerably more restrained than SHAWSHANK. But all the same, it is fantastic. Contemplative and somber, emotional and eerie. If SHAWSHANK was all about hope, GREEN MILE is its dark cousin, sadder and much more tragic.

There are a number of segways and subplots that slow it down, and are really unnecessary. Whereas Black River had its moments off the main plot (e.g. the Cambodian man's story), it never seemed to detract from the core story.ABE was still an entertaining read.

I have added some pictures of the camera and case to illustrate the relative size.Otherwise it is a very nice case ... but whats the point of a compact camera if the package winds up being the size of a super zoom ??"},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible, ugly, uncomfortable, poorly constructed","review":"These were a big disappointment.a) they look very tacky (pix on amazon just don't give enough detail to have judged this prior to purchase) and poorly made. I felt like a female pimp wearing these garish shoes, yuck!b) they are not at all comfortable. The fit is very odd in that when not walking, it seems to be the right size i.e. in terms of where the toes fit in the shoe, heel etc. but when walking it seems to get loose in the back/heel area.c) the lining is hard and unyielding.Horrible shoes! If I could give less than 1 star I would. I would not purchase this or any other shoes from this company b/c the quality and fit just aren't up to par.Before I could even wear them, and was just (gently BTW) unzipping it, a tear happened just like that, so I'm not at all optimistic about how long these shoes are gonna last which is just as well since they suck anyway.I'm not a curmudgeon, u can check out my other reviews, it's just these bl**dy shoes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Quality Rock Returns!","review":"Without a doubt, this is the best TNT recording in years. Tony has been my favorite vocalist of all time and he just continues to impress and improve. Ronny's innovative guitar work has returned with a vengence and his solos bring a smile on every song. How does he come up with those ideas? Morty keeps thumping away and I welcome Mr. Dahl back to the fold. I can only hope that TNT generate enough sales in the US to afford them the opportunity to do a few shows on this side of Atlantic."},{"rating":"2","title":"TNT explode back into action!","review":"My Religion marked the explosive return of Norway's finest hard rock band and was one of the best melodic rock albums of the year. Lead by the powerful vocals of Tony Harnell and the wicked guitar playing of Ronni Le Tekro, My Religion combines great songwriting with massive production to produce a very memorable rock album. Mixing was handled by the legendary Tommy Hansen whose skills are undisputed. Highlights include the heavy groove of \\"She Needs Me\\", the awesome chorus of \\"Give Me A Sign\\", the killer guitar riffs of \\"My Religion\\", the amazing ballad \\"Perfectly\\", and the massive power ballad \\"Hey Love\\". TNT were really at the top of their game on this album and they even followed it up barely 2 years later with another great rock album in the same style called All The Way To The Sun. This album is highly recommended to fans of melodic hard rock and is a showcase of Tony Harnell's awesome vocal performance - a solid 4.5 stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"Retoration Guide for Jaguar XK series cars","review":"Book is in like new condition.

Wyatt got to do the vocal music he wanted to do as a soloist, while Soft Machine became more accomplished instrumentally. The real unsung hero on Six is bassist Hugh Hopper. While not playing anything overly complex, he provides a solid foundation and groove for the soloists to play over top of. One of my favorite 70's fusion albums."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is good Softs","review":"This is a good Soft Machine record. The most notable piece is Chloe and the Pirates. Really a triumph for 1973. Michael Ratledge's best piece ever. The album is a mixed bag really, with the last cuts being some of the best Softs and the earlier cuts being some of the most boring.

Unfortunately, I didn't find what I was looking for. The book does have some good charts about what spells require which ingrediants and what it takes to do a spell right and takes you for an overview of the game, but there weren't any helpful tips except for one or two. And everything I read in there I had already figured out just by playing the game. There also aren't any cheats in this book like there are for the rest of the books (on the rest of the expansion packs). Overall, I found this to be a bit of a disappointment. If you are buying it with the game then I guess it'd be alright, but if you already bought the game and played around with it for a few hours then you know all this book can tell you."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a waste of my money and time","review":"I played the game for about five hours and I made notes on spells and charms.

The Prima Strategy Guides are always some of the most complete books for any game, and this is no exception. Even though the beginning is exactly the same as all previous books, the Makin Magic chapters give you everything you'll ever want to know, including how to cheat ;). I bought the entire collection of these books and have read them all. Thank God for Amazon!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't buy the book . . . YET","review":"In my opinion, I don't know wether to get because it is usefull, or not to get it because it isn't usefull. I have been dying to get the Sims Makin Magic since the time my friend told me about it. I own every Sims Expansion pack that there is. The original Sims, The Sims Livin Large, The Sims House Party, The Sims Hot Date, The Sims Unleashed, and The Sims Superstar. I was actually VERY disappointed in the Sims Superstar, but that's what I get for getting it just to spend my hard earned money. I thought that the book would be usefull, but when I heard that there are 240 pages and only 111 are devoted to The Sims Makin Magic, I was kinda bumed.

The biggest hit however was 'Hollaback Girl', a Neptunes-produced, hip-hop inspired jam.Apparently Stefani thought it would be prudent to put out another album basically full of 'Hollaback Girls'. What a mistake. 'The Sweet Escape' is an almost endless nightmare of misplaced hip hop and Stefani posturing like a rapper. What made \\"LAMB\\" so charming is totally absent on an album full of derivitive beats and 'featuring' rappers. Stefani is not a rapper nor should she pretend to be one; she only comes off as incredibly commercial, fake and ultimately a huge let down as this album sounds exactly like all other Top 40 music in 2006, instead of being different and quirky like her previous album.So much for being the next Madonna. What a shame, what a disappointment Stefani turned out to be."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not good.","review":"Enough of the generic hip hop stuff. And she keeps on dropping the \\"LAMB\\" stuff...I know it's her clothing line but this materialistic stuff is just disgusting now. And for a 30-something woman to behave this way is pathetic.

I loved that band!I gave L.A.M.B. a chance and thought is was meager at best. There was no direction WHATSOEVER. It sounded exactly like what it was - Gwen working with multiple producers.The Sweet Escape is downright awful! I listened to this cd on AOL and was mortified at how generic this is. 'Wind It Up' sounds almost exactly like 'Hollaback Girl', while 'Orange County Girl' could not sound anymore bland. The only song I remotely liked was 'Early Winter'...although it does sound eerily familiar to a particular '80's song - I'll let you figure out which ;)On another note, what is up with her wig and the bling. Talk about sellout!Again, I USED to be a fan. No longer. End of story."},{"rating":"2","title":"More of her style if you like it","review":"This is more of Gwen as she is and if you like her say it as it is style then you will enjoy this CD. The use of one profane word on one song is a gimick that they could have done without, just to get an explicit rating. If you like how she uses her voice and promotes her feminity then for the price I suggest adding it to your collection. If you expect earth shaking changes from her lasst CD then borrow a copy and listen to it once as those changes are not on this CD."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where's the music?","review":"I love gwen stefani and her music she has opened new doors to music creativity, and i dearly repect her. But this albulm dissapointed me from put up the volume from the last albulm to put down the volume from her current. Her single \\"Wind it UP\\" sounded like a high school chant and the beats were way off course. I didn't get what the song was trying to pursue with \\"wind it up\\" singing every 5 seconds. She has a gorgeous voice but the beats were covering her voice with \\"what are you trying to say in your song\\" lyrics. So if your into a bubbly go out with girl's mood this albulm is for you.

Like Boy George, Cyndi Lauper et al her cartoon persona and run away slave to fashion status have become greater than her musical output. It's interesting that the record company is promoting this recording like it's new material and accompanying it's release with a tour -- when in fact this B rate materail would have been better served as a L.A.M.B. extras disc. Sad to see artists get consumed with their own hype. This is a low point in her career. And how old is this woman anyway???"},{"rating":"1","title":"Why Gwen, why?","review":"I love Love Angel Music Baby-I still listen to it all the time.

When I firstly heard the Wordi it Up single (with some friends) we all remained astonished!! What is that?!??! The new Heide cartoon soundtrack or what??? I said to myself, listen to the album more than a couple of times and give it more chances. Well, at the end I can say I only like Wonderful Life. No way out for the other tracks. What is that? a mix of beats and R&B...but; no melodies, no disco sound as in LAMB.

A missed chance.Enrico"},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad - just bad","review":"I was seriously disappointed by Gwen Stefani's new album, I who had been a hude fan of \\"Love.Angel.Music.Baby\\". To me, she just took all the (few) bad things about her first solo album and just developped and focused on them. Songs like \\"Harajuku Girls\\" or \\"Hollaback Girl\\" weren't my favorites but the rest of the album was so good they just seem to enhance the other songs. Here I counted only three good songs: \\"The Sweet Escape\\", \\"Early Winter\\" and \\"Wonderful Life\\". All the others are only moderate rip-offs of \\"Hollaback Girls\\", they focuse on the beat and Gwen's rapping (or more talking) makes me want to gag. The whole album just basically gives me a headache (I absolutely LOATHE \\"Yummy\\" - how ridiculous is Pharell?). Download those three songs if you want the best from her but I do not recomend buying this album for yourself or offering it to any die-hard Gwen Stefani fan."},{"rating":"1","title":"I really really wanted to like it....","review":"I was very excited about getting this CD. I wanted to like it so bad but it just does not sound good to me. I listened to it again and again hoping that the third, fourth, maybe fifth time would be the charm.

I gave 2 stars in instead of 1 because I do respect that she at least tried something different in trying to keep up with the ever changing trend in music, it just didn't work."},{"rating":"1","title":"The *Sweet* Escape - **Baff","review":"Gwen Stefani opened up as an artist with huge talent on LAMB, but here she wastes it all and loses all credibility.The terrible opening single \\"Wind It Up\\" is terrible; a combonation of erotic rap, The Sound Of Music and yodelling...GROSS!!! The rest isn't any better; like the vanilla-Kelis of \\"Yummy\\", the lame J.Lo wanna-be \\"Orange County Girl\\" and \\"Don't Get It Twisted\\".This disc does have someredeming moments but they don't save the record; the Madonna-esque \\"The Sweet Escape\\", \\"4 In The Morning\\" which sounds like a Kylie Minogue or Madonna down-tempo moment, \\"Fluorescent\\" which reminds me of Nelly Furtado's \\"Glow\\", the indie-rock-ish \\"Early Winter\\" & \\"Breakin' Up\\" the only good club single.This album is a massive step down from LAMB and has no appeal to any of her No Doubt fans and only some of her most loyal fans would mildly enjoy this.

It's that bad. I don't think the lyrics are clever at all.

The debut single serves as a preview of how irksome the tracks are. \\"Breakin' Up\\" wins the top prize and \\"Yummy\\" is so vexing, it makes you forget everything good the Neptunes have put on the pop plate.The only redeeming factors are the Keane-penned \\"Early Winter,\\" even with Stefani's limited vocal delivery, and \\"4 In The Morning.\\" The rest sound like rejected b-sides off her debut sessions, which they probably are considering the quick follow-up.It's highly recommended that Stefani return to No Doubt and to put her solo efforts to rest."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't wind it up","review":"I can't even stand the hit songs from the CD wind it up, and sweet escape.

Other than that there are a few 80's dance sounding songs on here that I like, similiar to her first album. Otherwise, it's a futilie attempt to attract 14 year olds, and lacks any depth or growth.

That song is terrible and on it's merit alone I would never buy this album. Having heard a burned copy, I decided to pass on this faux hip-pop train wreck. Lyrics have taken four steps back and sound like something Paris Hilton would pen and the music is only somewhat saved by the Neptunes and the track by Martin Gore. But even their music can't save this mind numbing trip into nowhere land..otherwise known as the the bargin bins for pop artists."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Bad","review":"Gwen Stefani wears her 80's influences on her sleeves which is cool at times,but then it becomes one big cliche. that is the problem with this album which is basically the cutting room floor material that wasn't good enough to make it on her debut album. I wasn't that fond of her debut album&this album is a set below that one. vocally she sounds like she is trying to channel 80's era Madonna, Cyndi Lauper,Deborah Harry with mixed results. the Production is a dime a dozen&the songwriting is just bland. Gwen needs to go back to No doubt like Yesterday."},{"rating":"1","title":"Simply Insulting","review":"This album is an insult to all of Gwen's fans. I have been a fan of her work for as long as I can remember, and the \\"thrown together\\" noises, may easily slip through the cracks of not so musically inclined pop culture, however it is simply a marketing effort, with absolutely no structure. The last song on the album, besides wind it up, are by far the only good songs on this record. Hopefully she'll see a decline in album sales and realize that in order to actually sell music, you really have to TRY making some."},{"rating":"1","title":"What Happened?!?!?","review":"I am so disappointed...this has to be the worst material she has ever put out. I love No Doubt and and really loved her first solo cd but this is just silly. \\"Wind It Up\\" is utterly ridiculous as is almost every song on this cd. I am such a big fan of hers and for this junk to come out has really made me doubt her as an artist. Gwen, You Need To Go Back To No Doubt Or Put Out A CD Worth Listening To!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Lost in Translation","review":"Stefani's career is built on image: the platinum blonde pop/ska icon in earlier years to Harajuku girl later on. From her early recordings with former bands to her solo career, it's no surprise the Queen-Of-Make-Overs needs a Do-Over in that second solo album that comes off as a compilation of confusion than an actual concrete piece of art.It's time to focusing on work -- not the image."},{"rating":"1","title":"Let the mofo BURN!!!!!!!!!!!!","review":"I would not buy the album. However, you could burn it on the computer for free and skip Wind It Up since that's the worst song on the internet!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"You can go far if you have no talent.","review":"The Sweet Escape by Gwen Stefani is unoriginal, shallow, and the most pathetic album of 2006. First of all, she can't sing, she can't write and she needs to go back to where she came from, No Doubt. When she was with that band, the songs were halfway decent and the guys in the band rocked, not her. The only reason she got famous because she liked to show her nasty looking stomach off and she was dating a popular musician at the time who would later become her husband. Well honey, you are a nobody and hopefully people will come to their senses and realize the same thing as well. Don't waste your money on this garbage, if you want a real singer then check-out some real Garbage, Shirley Manson instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sad....","review":"1 star for 1 decent track on the album--the title track. The rest of the album is a disgrace to music. I have been a ND fan since I was a kid and been to several concerts, own all of ND's albums; but this Gwen solo album, will be going in the trash.I am also shocked because of the very reputable producers that worked on this album that it turned out so horrible.Gwen--I love ya, but this album sucks."},{"rating":"1","title":"A memo to Ms. Stefani","review":"You are not \\"ghetto', you are not \\"down\\", you're not crunk, bling-bling or whatever mumbling derelict phrases are popular nowadays among a crowd whose collective IQ is 2.

By that I mean I wouldn't automatically change the station if it came on the radio, but I've never been compelled to buy a CD. So, when she appeared on SNL last week, I thought, \\"Well, I guess I can wait until the commercial break to go to the bathroom.\\" Mistake. Big mistake. I, too, am unable to explain my feelings about her performance of \\"Wind It Up\\" (and a quick listen to the album version didn't really clear things up for me). It's almost as if she and Fergie are playing some sort of crappy music poker, and Gwen has just upped the ante. The drums alone might have been kind of cool, but then she had to shriek throughout the entire song. It was an audio (and visual) trainwreck. They say having kids changes you, but it's not always for the better. When did music get to be so stupid?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Gwen jumps the shark","review":"Either Gwen has started to believe her own hype or she surrounded herself with the wrong people. THis CD is a horrible mess; while i appreciate pop artists that try to be hip and stylish, gwen just doesnt pull it off; her aspirations dont match her talent. -And Gwen is now giving off a stanky self important diva vibe that kills her charisma. too bad, her last CD seemed to be a step in a good direction."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where's the singing?","review":"This album is the furthest departure from where Stefani began her ride to pop stardom. After spending some time with the album - I'm just wondering... where's the singing? If I would have wanted to buy some inane hip hop, two words together to a cheese beat, I would have bought the Fergie CD... If you're expecting her previous effort - you're in the wrong place. It sounds like Justin Timberlake and Gwen wrote and recorded their music together but in the end JT got slicker production.On a pass/fail - this album doesn't work for me. Anyone want to buy my copy?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Big Disappointment","review":"Don't you hate it when you hear a great song on the radio or at a club so you take a gamble and buy the CD? That is what happened with me purchasing this one. The title track is very good and sure to put you in a good mood, with its classic pop sound. However, like many pop artists its one of only a few good songs on the CD. It is as though the producer decided to focus on one or two songs and the rest are just fillers. Besides the title track and a handful of others Gwen sounds like she is in 7th grade trying to cross the lines of trying to be cool and be a cheerleader. The music is stiff (for lack of better words) for the most part, and the yodel she incorporates is very irritating. However, if you like high school cheerleading and want to put it to music you may like it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad bad bad to awful bad bad bad.","review":"Wow....what is this album.....the crappy leftovers from Love,Angel,Music,Baby?! I expected more from an artist with such amazing vision. L.A.M.B was so different, so new...this is just all bad. Still a huge fan of Gwen but I cannot waste my hard earned money on this album. Its just horrible. Better luck on the next one Gwen. May be its time for a No Doubt reunion?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Is the the kind of music that sets a good example? Remember the effects and influences,","review":"I'm not sure what is happening to the music nowadays; it seems like instead of heading forward and better, it's going backwards and worser. Good music as a good example to people should have meaningful, positive and moral raising lyrics etc. I hate writting negative reviews but it's a concrete fact. Did I mention how music moulds minds? Let's think..."},{"rating":"1","title":"This album stinks!","review":"Gwen's last album was fantastic but, this album really stinks! I have only listened to it once and that is one time too many.

Gwen needs to get back to her roots. Many of the tracks felt like they were just thrown together. The songs were also aimed specifically at dance clubs, which leaves her old fans hanging out to dry. Only 3 tracks were tolerable, \\"Sweet Escape,\\" \\"4 AM,\\" and \\"Wonderful Life.\\" I think it is wonderful Gwen is trying to find new sounds, however, it should not be at the cost of alienating the fans who have been with her from the beginning. Maybe the next CD should go through a focus group before hitting the store shelves."},{"rating":"1","title":"Average","review":"No Doubt, Gwen's old band, admittingly was a wonderful band that excelled to a degree that met the demands of people and their liking. Now that Gwen has released her solo albums, she isn't making the same music anymore..she really changed. If you've heard her first solo (LAMB) and enjoyed it, you'll probably like this album also. But for me, eclectic, bopsy genre music just isn't my thing. The only good songs on this album (to me) are Early Winter, 4 In The Morning, and Wonderful Life. The rest are just too immature, even though you'd guess a 13 year old like me would take this music and call it \\"some of the best\\". This album just doesn't touch all the areas required to be considered quality. Try No Doubt, because if you do, you won't be let down by Gwen if you're like me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hated it the first time, now I can't stop listening to it.","review":"It really, really grows on you. Wonderful Life, Yummy and 4 in the Morning make the entire album. I can't stop listening to it - it's great for the gym."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wind It Up?","review":"Gwen Stefani has lost her mind. Wind it up is the most onboxious song I have ever had the misfortune to hear. Her first solo album was hit and miss with me. This one is all miss. I'm devastated. When we lost No Doubt, I thought we would be getting something better. I was wrong."},{"rating":"1","title":"Weak Sophomore Effort","review":"This CD is a big disappointment. I really liked her last CD but this one falls short. It doesn't flow well and some songs have sounds that you would make if you were cooing a baby. She talks about liking to ride, but I wouldn't be caught dead ridin' to this CD. Less motherhood, more rock please."},{"rating":"1","title":"I expect better from Gwen","review":"it's cute, catchy, but not what Gwen's capable of. I'd like to see more... just more."},{"rating":"1","title":"Escape from The Sweet Escape","review":"I am a big fan of Gwens work and her first solo album was great. But I must say this album is bad...real bad.The first time I listened I thought...I love her work...give it another chance.I tried a second time and quickly repackaged it and put it in the pile of CD's I never want to listen again.So..bottom line..if you live in a cave and never heard her first solo album...ignore this album and buy her first solo album.Members of No Doubt..it is time to regroup and save this great singer from any future disasters!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A+ - Great transaction.

It does have a good baseline throughout so if you like that sound, you might like the album."},{"rating":"1","title":"And you though the first solo CD was bad...","review":"This might be the worst album of all time. \\"Wind It Up\\" may have surpassed \\"Hollaback Girl\\" as most annoying song of all time. At this point, it's hard to tell whether this music is all a joke or not. The only problem is that no one's laughing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it!","review":"I love this Cd. I like this one better than LOVE ANGEL MUSIC BABY. I only really liked a few of songs on LAMB like Hollaback Girl, Rich Girl and What U Waiting for, this one I like almost all of them. Very catchy! Cute lyrics. Would make a good workout cd. A must for any Gwen fan. Love Wind It Up, Sweet Escape!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I long for the days of No Doubt","review":"Aside from \\"Wind It Up\\", this album, as much as it hurts me to say this, is horrible.

The track \\"The Sweet Escape\\" makes me think of smiling dancing teddy bears with balloons and giant lollipops. The yodeling in the first track is unforgivable. The song should not be played under any circumstances. I wish she would put out a new album with No Doubt - some ska-ish tunes would be nice."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another One??? *sigh*","review":"This is another Gwen Stefani album that I had to somewhat sit through.

A lot of these songs are completely pointless, and make absolutely no sense. And some of her vocals are almost painful to listen to. One of my friends burned this album for me, incase anyone is wondering how I obtained it. Do yourself a favor and save yourself an hour and some change, or like me nineteen minutes skimming through the tracks and end up throwing the CD out your window while driving.

It fell short to me. While the performances from Nicholson and Lange are both good, I thought the story just didn't back them up. Basically Nicholson, a con, wanders into this gas station/resturant where Lange is working, he thinks she is hot so he hangs around. Her husband is the owner and a good provider, but he and Lange don't have much in common. She hooks up with Jack(who is now working for them), things start to go wrong, and they end up on the wrong side of the law. To it's credit the end of the picture did surprise me. Nicholson can put a picture on his back and carry it, but in this case there is just not enough going on for him to do it. The movie is painfully slow and the characters while well acted are really not very interesting. Two stars for the two stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your time","review":"Why this movie was re-made I have no idea. The 1946 version is far superior to this nonsense.

I actually borrowed a copy from a friend of mine who purchased it. The album features beats that are refreshing. It has a full sound and makes you want to dance.

The title tune Renaissance Man would make an excellent theme song for a movie. I don't think anyone else could sing it like Michael does.

It's fine for straight reading of the main text, but there are some serious shortcomings for any other use.Pros:-typeface is nicely rendered-all images are includedCons:-OCR is not perfect---seems to have had particular issues with italics and numbers---so text is not 100% searchable-does NOT have page numbers (just location numbers)-endnotes are NOT linked (and the notes are organized by chapter, so hunting for the right note #33 is a real pain)"},{"rating":"2","title":"More great stuff from P & C","review":"I own their entire small canon... hope they don't stop anytime soon!

They released another version in 2001 with extra 'unplugged' tracks (and an mpeg video in English of Vamos a Bailar). They also replaced Viva el Amor with a dance version (the version on this album is better IMHO, gets inet radio airplay and is what drew my family to them).Either version is worth getting and if you don't speak Italian or Spanish, well, guess what: IT DOESN'T MATTER! You get to enjoy the music of their voices without passing judgement on the lyrics (BTW, the English versions out there aren't the same as the Italian; they'll be a letdown).Now go and buy this CD before it's gone and you kick yourself for letting it get away."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fabulous!!","review":"While in Italy this past November, I saw Paula & Chiara on tv singing \\"Amoremidai\\" and said to my fiance' \\"I HAVE to get this CD!\\" Once I returned to the states, he sent it to me and WOW... the whole CD if favoloso!!

Monroe has a small but very amusing and memorable role in the picture. 2) \\"The Marilyn Monroe Story\\" is one of the best documentaries about the legendary sex goddess ever put together. John Huston, who directed Marilyn in her first really well-known film(THE ASPHALT JUNGLE) as well as her last film(THE MISFITS), takes us on an incredible journey through this remarkable woman's life."},{"rating":"2","title":"My daughter began with collecting Marilyn Monroe quotes!","review":"My 17 year old daughter began collecting Marilyn Monroe quotes and pictures for her walls then books written about her and finally movies!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Regret Purchase","review":"I bought this movie because its one of the last few Monroe movies I have seen.

It's totally obscure, based on Michael Moorcock's virtually forgotten Jerry Cornelius novels (which are actually quite different), but epitomizes a certain 70's Eurotrash style of film. The cast is perfect -- Jon Finch should have been a huge star. Music, script, and direction are all brilliant. If you liked The Wicker Man, The Avengers (the TV show, obviously), or weird lesbian vampire movies, this one's for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Movie (if you havn't read the book)","review":"You could call me a Michael Moorcock fanatic. I own over 65 of his novels...Although this was a good movie. It strayed from the original work far too much. There where several parts of the book that where skipped or edited to the point of obscurity....One thing is for sure. Moorcock was not close at hand during the creation of the film.Perhaps broadcast and media limitations at the time prevented him from creating the image he wanted. Or perhaps he simply didn't read the book. I don't know...All in all the story is basically the same. And the movie is a fine piece if work. Especially for those of us who enjoy the 70's genre.

I thought the Author has done a right proper job telling us about one of the turning points of History. When the Armies of Islam had reached the height of their power as a convential military power. This siege was to prove the last time that they could completely defeat an entrenched & determined European power. Soon after they would be stopped cold at the Gates of Vienna and at Malta.I also thought that the Author did a very good job describing the various facts and Characters of this battle. Especially those of the Sultan and his great drive to reduce the last bastion of the Roman Empire. (He was also one hard character that I would not want to met in a dark alley unless I was heavily armed and not alone!) Altogether I just wish I had this book with me when I was at Istanbul last."},{"rating":"2","title":"I hate reading, loved this book.","review":"I can count the number of books I've read on purpose, and not forced by school, on one hand.

If you like history, Romans, Turks, medieval themes, or just general badassery I recommend you read this."},{"rating":"2","title":"1453: The Holy War for Constantinople and the Clash of Islam and the West","review":"Fantastic account of an amazing event in world history. Not only does this book cover the pure history of the events that took place, it paints many colorful pictures of the participants on both sides. Prior history of the region, technology of the siege weapons, and biographies of many of the major players are weaved throughout. Considering that the events played out 550 years ago, it is astonishing that there are actual day by day (and sometimes hour by hour) accounts of individual battles, naval attacks, and other fascinating events. Granted there was a lot of material to build from, this book does a great job in tying all of the pieces together in a very entertaining and informative rendition."},{"rating":"2","title":"The strategy of war in 1453","review":"I enjoyed this book, and learned from it as well. The description of the siege was excellent: sufficient detail to provide context, not so much detail that the tempo was lost.Some fascinating facts about fortifications and arms, as well as some of the people involved.While as the title suggests this was a holy war for Constantinople, and a clash between Islam and the West, it was also a battle for a strategic trading port and a significant cultural jewel.Alas, much of the latter was lost in pursuit of the former.Highly recommended to anyone who seeks more knowledge about both the city we now know as Istanbul and 15th century power struggles.Jennifer Cameron-Smith"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book on Subject of Constantinople and the year 1453","review":"I have read this book from cover to cover and found it to be accurate, insightful and well researched. I did not see any bias as some reviewers have stated. I believe the author has approached this very sensitive subject (especially to Greeks) with the aim to tell the story \\"as it was\\" without the usual Turkish/Greek propaganda.I will not go into every single detail of this book as other reviewers have done a good job in pointing out the specifics of the book. Where they believe the author has either done a good job or where he has failed. I will simply say that as a person of Greek heritage i did not find this book at all offensive or onesided as some have accused the author of being.I would recommend this book without any hesitation to anyone who is interested in learning more about the fall of the Byzantine Empire and the campaign to take Constantinople by the Ottoman Turks."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good read","review":"Book was interesting provided a good amount of information on a historical event that I wanted to know more about."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great read","review":"Well written history book.

My only complaint is that it felt too short, though that may be because it read so well. At only a few hundred pages, I'm sure much more could have been added to the narrative, but the preciseness of the book made it that much better.

There are a few good songs here like Rock and Roll with Method Man and Redman, which manages to somewhat keep this album alive (suprisingly giving this album 2 stars and not 1), and I'm feeling the song with Pink, but the other songs are just swings and misses. I miss the Naughty By Nature's: 19 Naughty 3 and their self titled album.

That is the spirit of this book. it connects the basics of guitar playing to spiritual development. Start with the basics, play what you enjoy, do what you are good at. Such easy advice, yet so difficult to embrace. To really understand the book the reader needs to go through it several times, and really ponder what the author means. All chapters start with a quote from famous guitarists, people who know, and is worth listening to."},{"rating":"2","title":"My guitar playing has improved!","review":"My first reaction was to laugh out loud at how Zen has become a way to make anything seem mystical. However, I forced myself to keep reading and soon found myself caught up in the flow. I soon found myself picking up my guitar with \\"intention\\" and paying much more attention to what sounds were coming out. Looking back about a year after reading this book I suddenly realize that my playing has improved, I now practice 1-2 hours a day on average instead of 1-2 hours a week. I have a deeper emotional connection to my music than ever before. Just read this book and do what it says. Don't think about it because it will just make you laugh."},{"rating":"2","title":"Get in-tune with your inner guitarist.","review":"I really dug this book. It inspired me to get an old guitar out of the closet and start plucking away again. It is really an approach on life in general but applied to guitar. It makes you want to play guitar, not for the glory but the love of music and a spiritual connection to the music within."},{"rating":"2","title":"Claims to be no more than it is","review":"I like this book quite a bit. Some find it lacking as a zen text, which it doesn't really claim to be. Others find it comes short as a guitar instructional, which is also not its intent. To me it seems like a book which tries to place a guitarist ina relatively zen state of mind. It does so without going into the type of rigor that would require the reader to be a student of philosophy, religion, or zen itself to understand.Its greatest triumph is its ability to focus a guitarists on self-expression and fulfillment through guitar. There's no competitive, flashy workout mentality, no boistrous 'do everything the way I do' bullying. Sudo comes right out and says that you'll need other resources for the nuts and bolts.In short, this is a great book to help a guitarists get into a good guitar state of mind."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great read to inspire you to keep practicing and living!","review":"I recommend this book even if you don't play guitar as each chapter offers great advice on how to live! It is basically Zen teachings applied to learning to play guitar , but the principles will apply to anything you want to accomplish n your life.Much like the \\"Zen of Motorcycle Maintenance\\" did not require you to own a Harley. It is a 'easy ' read n the sense that the chapters are short and the author speaks in a easy to digest friendly manner which makes the reading very enjoyable. It is the type of book you will want to highlight and return to again and again, so throw it n your gig bag for inspiration on the road!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Easy way to Nirvana","review":"I like books that simplify things in an interesting way and this book delivers. You really can learn the basics of Zen by playing the guitar. But the lessons don't stop with the guitar, it applies to all facets of life. So even if you don't play the guitar, you can learn about zen. And likewise, if you play the guitar but don't really care about zen philosophy, it will still apply to you. But I think those who are just a little interested in either topic will find this a simple and easy read, but packed with wisdom. It makes me long to wear the white belt."},{"rating":"2","title":"zen guitar","review":"This is a great little book for musicians or music enthusiastswho enjoy metaphysical inspiration.Don't just read it, live it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Taoist","review":"PROS: a sentimental, warm fuzzy, encouraging, inspirational read.CONS: unlikely to make one a better guitarist or deeper person, and often reverts to Taoist cliches.RECOMMENDATION: If you have a contemplative personality and play guitar, by all means, read this book. You will enjoy it. If you are more of the pragmatic sort, let it pass. Whether or not you get much out of this book will be determined more by your own personality than the quality of the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"For any musician of any level.","review":"I'm a keyboardist, but I found myself entranced by this book while browsing the music section in Borders. It may not be entirely accurate to Zen teachings; I'm not qualified to say. But it inspired me to take on my playing with a whole new attitude. It's honestly changed the way I look at things. Because it's fairly short, I wasn't intimidated by it in the store. But every page seems to mean something. I'm not exactly sure how to describe it, but I've tried.Go to a bookstore, and read a bit of it. You'll probably know whether you like it or not within the first ten pages.

So to get to the song I want, I pretty much have to search for it using the search tool. Looking at the table of content only helps you know that the song exists. You cannot touch the song title to go to that song. GO TO Page number is not available, so I can't \\"go to\\" the song I want to get to unless I type it into the search. A physical version of this would be much more useful than this useless Kindle version that I pretty much can't use unless I have 10 minutes to spare each time I want to get to a song."},{"rating":"1","title":"Useless","review":"It had no music, just words, it was not what I thouight I was getting.

Stone: Confirmed Communist Spy and Traitor to America","review":"The Venona decrypts of Soviet cable prove beyond any doubt that I.F. Stone was a paid Communist spy. If you don't believe me, read the decrypts yourself (do a search here on \\"Venona\\"). He worked to spread propaganda in America for a brutal Soviet regime that killed tens of millions, and he was paid to do it. When he died, his family burned all his private papers to conceal the truth, but ultimately he was exposed by Venona in 1994.I read this book with morbid fascination at how the liberal media touted this guy as \\"a Gibraltar of journalistic integrity\\" and \\"The most honest reporter in America\\" even as he worked to destroy our country. It's sad that even today few people are aware of the truth about this evil man who hated our American democratic, free-market values but embraced the monstrous totalitarianism of the Soviets."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good but not for me","review":"I really wanted to like this movie, I heard alot of great things about it and the trailers I have seen for it really made it look good. Going to warn you gorehounds ahead of time, there is no gore or death here, I wouldn't even really consider the movie a horror movie, maybe more suspense had there been a little more horror elements it could have suceeded (in my opinion). The Story is very well put together, a couple of times you see holes in the plot but other than that it keeps your attention and its a pretty fast paced movie that keeps your intrest.

Anyway, the woman sets up shop in this creepy old house, that has supposedly been taken care of for 30 years by a cantankerous old lawyer. One scare after another (mild at that) keeps our heroine on the run...boy can she get into that red car FAST. Odd blend of satanic references and creepy music. Some of the scenes are laugh-out-loud funny....especially the first time she is smashed up in her car on the way to the house. Fun to have running in the background of a halloween party...

Now, 22 years later, I've finally re-found this book and can't wait to read it again from a new perspective.My point is, sometimes things we don't like initially can still teach us something and give us something valuable we won't even recognize until later in life.

Since it was too horrible to get released in a movie theater (at least not in the NY area) I had to wait until \\"Dangerous Game\\" went to video to see it.

I made a huge mistake.Everything that the bad reviews say it true. This vaporizer is a piece of junk. It is loud and clunky. It gets dangerously hot. The water burns off very quickly, then it just makes a horrible noise.Not to mention that it has no way to adjust the amount of steam it produces. The first time I turned it on, steam immediatly came pouring out. Within two minutes, everything in my daughters room was soaking wet, including her baby moniter and lamp, causing a fire hazard!If you are going to buy a vaporizer/humidifier, cough up the extra $15-$20 and get a good one.

I have to take it apart (with a hex wrench) twice a week to scrape off the electrodes just so I can get another few hours of quiet use out of it. The water does not come out easily for cleaning. Puts way to much moisture in the air at a time. Using good old fashion Vicks vapor rub in this is a mess, and with the liquid Vicks that goes into it, it's to costly. Avoid this product at all costs.

WHAT A DIFFERENCE! the cool mist gives the added moisture needed without adding the warmth to the air that can cause for greater congestion. i mean really, think about it. in the warm of summer when the humidity is high, it is harder to breathe, right?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't understand the positive reviews","review":"I'm giving up on this product -- that's why I'm on Amazon at the crack of dawn!I'll repeat what a lot of the negative reviews said:--after two hours, enough water has burned off that it start making disturbing and loud sputtering and gurgling sounds--needs to have water added to it around three times a night--the vapor oil receptacle burns off about half of the oil but leaves the rest, resulting in a greasy mess--the steam vent is disturbingly hot and is absolutely NOT safe for toddlers that have the remotest chance of touching it--finally, the product feels cheap and shoddy -- I wish I had invested the $20 in a better product to begin withI feel cheated. The Vicks company needs to take a long hard look at this product.

This humidifier is designed to sit on the floor of a room and it has a light on top of it so it is attractive to little ones--watch out! Shame on vicks for selling a product designed to be in the nursery that is this dangerous. It seems like a protective cover could have been added.

First of all, in contrast to the vast majority of Perl books out there (including \\"Learning Perl\\" by Randal Schwartz), this book covers Perl for both Windows and the Mac, not just Unix.Secondly, the book does not hold itself out to be a complete Perl book. Instead, the author's stated goal is to provide a gentle introduction to Perl to get you to an intermediate level and the book definitely does do that.In going through the typos of this book, I realize that most of the code typos are in the Regular Expressions section where errors are very easy to miss.Finally, when I wrote my first review, the website for the book was not fully operational, but I visited the site again and it now appears to be working fine."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Stuff","review":"My dog was suffering from IBS or at least had very bad poops at least once a week.

Some of the poetry is morbid. And we wonder why there are nursing shortages?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Small and overpriced","review":"I was disappointed by these mugs.

I had enjoy the CD, but had not had the opportunity to watch and enjoy the old timers in the video. Compay Segundo has been a Cuban legend since he first appeared in the scene in the '30s. I had no idea he was still alive. Thanks to Mr. Cooder for giving him a few days of happiness, and sharing him with us one more time. The greates revelations for me though was Rubén González at the piano who seemed to have not lost one ounce of his brilliance after all these years even with arthritis and little practice, and Ibrahim Ferrer whose voice kept as fresh as when he was a teenager.

Not only is the music wonderful; the simplicity, the way in which these interesting and talented people were brought together, and the insight into contemporary Cuba, are outstanding. What a treat!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Favorite Music Documentary Ever","review":"The music in this film is spectacular and the stories told by these musical marvels is even more amazing. These men and women are over 80 years old and yet they are performing and traveling throughout the world to showcase their music. Above all, it's a humbling story of life growing up in Cuba. It illustrates how financial wealth comes last in the waterfall of the important things in life. Making music and enjoying friendship is what it's all about. It's impossible not to be enchanted by the scenery in Cuba. This is definitely worth owning and if you like their music there are several musical albums worth owning as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Cultural Experience","review":"I found this to be a delightful trip into Cuban music from the oldtimers. A great cultural experience."},{"rating":"2","title":"Exciting musical documentary","review":"This documentary presents the rediscovery and reunion of a number of masterful Cuban musicians, all of whom are aged and many of whom have not performed for many years. It is inspiring to watch how seemingly effortlessly they return to the stage, as well as their respect and affection both for their craft and for each other. They tell their own stories during interesting interviews. Although the film is packed with wonderful music, it is unfortunate that director Win Wenders cuts away from so many songs before they have concluded. Nevertheless, this remains a vital document that led me to contemplate the many incredible talents that must exist in obscurity all over the world."},{"rating":"1","title":"Que Lástima!!","review":"Que Lástima ver a los maestros de la música cubana teniendo que aguantar a un músico tan mediocre como Ry Cooder, a quien se le ocurrió que una guitarra electrica (pobremente tocada con slide de blues además) va bien con el mas puro son de Cuba?. Es muy triste ver lo que músicos tan consagrados y legendarios tienen que hacer, aceptar y soportar por un poco de difusión fuera de la isla.Si busca un verdadero documental sobre la musica afro cubana busque \\"Calle 54\\", es en verdad excelente !!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Music video or amateur travelogue?","review":"OK .....caveat emptor .....but I did place some reliance on the number of stars in your rating for this CD. Your rating was 5 stars, I gave it one because there was no provision for a zero."},{"rating":"2","title":"What a treat!","review":"Ry Cooder does the latin music world a great service by visiting and then revisiting in film these great Cuban musicians who would have been all but forgotten in the political struggles of the times. To be sure, the music is excellent (though the recording quality on the DVD is far from concert-quality), played with the passion one expects of artists who know that music is their best form of free expression. But the DVD provides more: the trip to NYC of these gentlemen and the chance to watch them watch us is priceless. They are projected into a time-warp, and find the world they have been told is so corrupt is really a treasure trove of good things, good musicians and good people. This is a wonderful work of art and I will enjoy watching it and listening to it again and again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"I'm sorry but I found the movie dull. The music was kind of dull and repetitive, most of the musicians, although clearly extremely talented, were past their prime (Would you go see an athlete who was in his 80s) and Ry Cooder comes off as alternately condescending and hero-worshiping."},{"rating":"2","title":"moving","review":"This is a beautiful documentary of some superb (and mostly forgotten) Cuban musicians. Ry Cooder has outdone himself with this project. I truly enjoyed getting a glimpse into these people's lives through their music and their country.

I found myself completely transported by this film. Don't miss it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Music and Real-Life Stories","review":"It's amazing how little most of us know about Cuba or its people. The news gives us only part of the story, and most films look at either the past or are purely political in nature. Wim Wenders' \\"The Buena Vista Social Club\\" provides a wonderful view of not only life in Cuba today, but the glorious musical history of Cuba's past. Forgotten musicians and vocalists are shown at home, in the recording studio, and in concert outside of Cuba, performing music that the people know, but apparently don't (or can't) acknowledge publicly in their own country. This is a wonderful slice of life and culture that most Americans have no idea exists. Credit should go to Ry Cooder and his son, who comment on what the music and experience means to them. An enjoyable documentary."},{"rating":"2","title":"Buena Vista Social Club","review":"I have seen \\"Lisbon Story\\" by Win Wenders four or five years ago, and when I was visiting Europe this winter I got really excited when I found out he came out with a new movie - \\"Buena Vista Social Club\\". Just like with other Wenders's movies, it is hard to define what \\"Buena Vista\\" is really about. Is it about Cuba and its lifestyle? Yes, but not only that. Is it about Cuban music? Of course, but there is something more to it. It is the atmosphere in the movie that I absolutely loved. The music, also the players and singers of the \\"son de Cuba\\" are alive. Thier dedication to each other and, maybe more importantly, to the music is unique. \\"Buena Vista Social Club\\" is real, and you have to see it and feel it to truely understand. There are no words that could explain the experience of this movie. \\"Buena Vista\\" was beautiful and watching it a pure joy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful, entertaining introduction to this music","review":"I first saw this documentary on PBS and was blown away. I was previously unaware of this beautiful music, but as a result of seeing the show, I rushed right out and bought the CD which then played nearly continuously on the CD player in my car. The music draws you in and doesn't let go. There is such an easy, upbeat feel to it, without it being at all like the \\"easy listening\\" genre. This documentary captures the essence of the genesis of the music , as well as being just down right entertaining. This viewer came away feeling that I really know these musicians.

The Buena Vista Social club is the Cuba Super-Group! It features the greatest musicians of the 60s and 70s together on one stage playing the songs that they themselves made popular.

A month later we went for another sperm analysis and the Doctor told us his sperm count had increased dramatically and we should have no trouble with trying to conceive again.

I watched it with Pedro, my special friend, and we haven't been seen out of our bedroom since. I believe that this film should be seen by all, homosexual or heterosexual. The joy of being with a man...there are no words for it. None. Watching this work of art was one of the most fulfilling experiences I have ever had watching a video. If you want to see a beautiful and profound connection occur between two men, WATCH & ENJOY."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unfulfilling - on several levels","review":"For a title that promises to improve your sex life, I found the actual practical advice very basic. We are reminded that improved emotional intimacy can lead to more fulfilling sexual relationships but I was very disappointed with the lack of ideas or guidelines on how to achieve deeper emotional or physical bonding. I also found the visual and narrative style clichéd and unappealing."},{"rating":"1","title":"A text book rather than a reference guide","review":"Having read this book I feel that the author has over emphasised certain aspects, e.g. the theory at the expense of applications. The impression is that the series editors have encouraged the writing of a text book, filling many pages with information that is not readily useful to the researcher or industrial scientist"},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disappointing","review":"Far too much of EVERY chapter devoted to repeating essentially \\"I know what you're going through\\", \\"You feel this, you've tried that\\" on and on and on. A single well-written glossy magazine article would cover more useful information than you get in this whole book. Find good medical and health sites online instead and save your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"this book is a terrible idea .... might as well give up and enjoy your pudgy self","review":"I am a doctoral level medical professional, and I have to warn women - if you are serious about losing the extra weight at midlife, do not do what this book says. It's okay if you need some help with your self-acceptance at this moment, and it's good for understanding what has happened at midlife, and how your body changes. However, if you want something to motivate you and teach you a successful strategy to decrease the weight and keep it off, this is NOT the book ! Very disappointing on that measure. You don't learn to outsmart or win this way."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just give up and get fat!!","review":"That is the bottom line for this author. She spends way too much time telling us to \\"embrace\\" our new, thick waistlines, and too little time on any real information or help. Don't bother exercising. just give up and eat smaller amounts of whatever it is that made you fat in the first place, get 9 hours of sleep every night (good luck with that!) and eliminate all stress from your life. According to Waterhouse that's all you have to do, and then you'll ONLY gain 10 pounds during menopause instead of 20 or 30. Save your money and keep looking. The truth is out there."},{"rating":"2","title":"An easy \\"Must Read\\" for women over 40","review":"I'm 45 and exercise regularly and was dieting yet continued to gain weight.

The book has a very positive approach to the menopause experience."},{"rating":"2","title":"Finally, the answer to my problem!","review":"After having read only half way through the book so far, I felt that I needed to write a review because what Debra Waterhouse says makes so much sense! She has answered the question to my problems. I have experienced the hysterectomy, the dieting, the weight gain, stress, hair thinning, hot flashes, etc. I have seen doctors who can't seem to tell me tell me much. One doctor even insinuated that it was all in my head! I couldn't figure out why I gained so much weight when I hardly eat. The way I run around at work with the combination of the high stress, you would think that I would be as thin as a stick. It didn't make sense until now. I am so thankful for Debra's book, because I was really feeling like my body was falling apart. Every woman should read this book. I highly recommend it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Readers digest version--save your money","review":"Here is a synopsis of the book so you may spend your money elsewhere:1) Don't diet2) Get used to your \\"new\\" menopausal figure--ie. learn to love it.3) Exercise 4 times a week for at least an hour so you feel better--but don't expect miracles in the weight-loss department.Well. duh! I really felt the book rambled on about the obvious and in the end, I just ended up feeling depressed. What the book did manage to do was to thoroughly explain the biological process of why your body is changing. That, I already knew!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A lot of repetition","review":"There was some interesting information in the book, but there was also a LOT of repetition used to drive home a point. While it did explain menopause weight gain, it didn't offer me any new solutions to loosing weight like the title suggests. It could have been condensed into a brochure!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Optimistic, No Real Weight Loss Strategies","review":"This book doesn't contain concrete, proven methods for weight loss in midlife. Instead, it says ANY attempts to diet will cause greater weight gain. The takeaway: give up and accept you'll never get your 20 year old waistline back and good luck growing old. Redundant in every chapter. Not a worthwhile read. There are some great books out there that have actual suggestions to outsmart menopause fat cells that actually work. I've lost 5 pounds on Bob Harper's The Skinny Rules and have been reading Dr. Oz website for additional strategies. His demographic is middle aged women like me. Ladies, we do NOT have to accept getting fat."},{"rating":"2","title":"AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH","review":"Finally a book I can relate to!!! I finished reading yesterday and already finding myself re-reading it!!! I put my scale away and continue to exercise but now do not worry about wrong food vs. right foods. I eat 5-6 small meals a day and after one week I can actually feel and see a change!!! What a relief to know that fad diets, stressing about what to eat and what not to eat and crying over the numbers on a scale no longer have to be a part of my life!!!! Thank you Debra Waterhouse!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"It's a very reassuring book for perimenoupausers!","review":"I have found it very frustrating the last 2 years to lose weight. I am perimenopausal and for the last 8 months I have lost and gained the same pound. I couldn't figure out what I was doing wrong. Once I read Outsmarting the Midlife Fat Cell, I understood what my body is doing and what I can do to get the weight loss going again. Thank you, Debra Waterhouse!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than I had dared hope for!!","review":"I haven't even FINISHED the book yet, and already I can say that it is a real find! I feel excited about working WITH instead of AGAINST nature. Ms. Waterhouse knows how to engage the reader while imparting little-known and liberating facts about menopause. She aptly uses the term \\"meno-positive\\" because the positive is what she focuses on. A fabulous book!!!

There's not even a menu screen or scene selection. I'm not kidding, the film just automatically plays.Second of all, Chun Li's shower scene is shortened.

By far the most disappointing translation yet. And god....the soundtrack. ugh....KMFDM, Alice in Chains? It just doesn't work for it in this movie. If only a true translation would come out.

And they didn't bog down the dialogue with stuff like \\"one, two, THREE strikes YOU'RE OUT!!\\"I have but one request: release a DVD version that has the original dialogue and music tracks.

This cartoon shows the good guys always winning and learning morals while the bad guys like the vil leader bison loose easily and look like whimps, like every common thug.If you are a street fighter fan do not buy this dvdPERFECT FOR KIDS BETWEEN THE AGES 6-11 OR POSSIBLY 12"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good for SF fans, and those that like focus on action.","review":"When I saw this movie 10 years ago I thought it was amazing how they captured the essence of streetfighter characters from our favorite video game so well in an anime. Especially how the 2D animated moves from the video game made it into the movie without looking too weird or \\"fake\\" compared to the game I and many others loved so dearly in our youth.There have been no other streetfighter animes that have captured the essence of the characters so well as in this classic SF movie. I've seen other SF anime's and none have capture the classic street fighter \\"feel\\" as well as this one has. The characters are how you'd imagine them to be from the video game adn this is the best thing about this movie is that it captures the essence of street figher 2, the characters and the awesome and excitement of the fights."},{"rating":"2","title":"My Street Fighter II night...","review":"All I have to say is that the scene where Chung Lee fights with that psycho Vega, is absolutely incredible! I first saw this movie after I came back from a very fun night on the town. I sure enjoyed this movie! Afterwards I passed out on my friend's couch and woke up just with my pants off. Woohoo!!!

I'm sure there are rock fans out there who will disagree with me on this, but if you've ever heard the original soundtrack, you'd see just how much more inspiring this film could've been. Also, the dubbing just doesn't quite cut it when Ken or Ryu shout out their attacks. Voice actors aren't as enthused in yelling out the special attacks as the Japanese voice actors did."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Movie is Fantastic BUT There is no Extras.","review":"Where is the menu, and the japanise translation WHERE? The only thing inside the dvd is the movie and that's it. No nothing, I would've bought the VHS if I knew the dvd was going to be the same. It was a waste of time making this into a dvd with nothing on it."},{"rating":"2","title":"BEST Street Fighter Movie in existence!!","review":"Pure action, awesome animation, truly captures the essence of what is Street Fighter. I've heard complaints of it having 'no story' .. well NEWSFLASH! STREET FIGHTER IS NOT ABOUT THE STORY! If you are true to the original video games you know just as well that Street Fighter is a simple action title about pure fighting and THATS where this movie shines. We can all see what happens when you try to integrate a story into Street Fighter, you get the horrible PoS that is Street Fighter Alpha: The Movie.The only downside to this DVD is its lack of Extra's or even a movie menu, otherwise this DVD is a must buy for Street Fighter Fans and Action-Anime fans alike."},{"rating":"1","title":"SCRIPT SCREW UP","review":"THE ANIMATION IS TRULY AWESOME, HOWEVER THE SCRIPT IS NOT TRUE TO THE JAPANESE TRANSLATION. THE SCRIPT IS TOTALLY ORIENTATED FOR 12 AND UNDER. THEY SHOULD REDO THIS WITH THE ORIGINAL SCRIPT OR SUBTITLES. I SAW THE SUBTITLED VERSION WITH THE ORIGINAL SCORE AND THOUGHT IT WAS AMAZING!

It's without-a-doubt the best anime I've seen. I'm a devoted Street Fighter fan and truely enjoyed seeing a story-line and characterizations fit to serve Street Fighter. The only drawback was the lack of DVD features. Wait, maybe I should rephrase that...There are no DVD features. The DVD has no menu and begins like a VHS would. The only feature it has is that it allows you to skip scenes. I have not seen the Japanese version but from what I hear, this edition is an edited version of that one.

It has a plot, follows the video game closely, and has great action scenes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Widescreen and Not Remastered","review":"The uncut version of the movie gets about 3.5 stars. The 2 star rating is for this DVD. My biggest gripe with this DVD is that it is not truly widescreen. It looks \\"widescreen\\" but signal output is in 4:3 ratio, meaning the black bars are part of the image and you can never get rid of it, even on a 16x9 TV. This DVD is designed for those still watching on SD TV sets. The picture also does not look remastered, IMO. About the same as the old DVD that came out back in the 90s.Other than that, it has the uncut Chun Li shower scene on the Japanese side, and this is the first time an official US release included a Japanese language track (to my knowledge). These are probably the biggest reasons to get this version over the others. If you don't own this movie in any other format, by all means pick up this one.I'm hoping there will be a bluray later, that is truly widescreen, remastered, and completely un-cut."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best SF anime movies ever made","review":"This is one of the best Street Fighter movies ever made, in my opinion. I especially love the fighting scene- Chun Li vs. Vega The fighting scenes are awesome, and the music is great! I haven't checked out SF Alpha yet, but I've heard it's not as good as this. Ryu's shoryuken kicked ... when he used it against Sagat, lol. Well I highly recommend this for action packed, fighting, Street Fighter Fans!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The GOOD anime based off of a video game","review":"The animation is good. The fight scenes are some of the best ever put on tape. Dubbing is fine and the fight scenes are some of the best ever put on tape (I know, I know, I've already mentioned that but I'd like to mention it again). Okay, the storyline may not be the best but it's entertaining none the less. Highlight of this film is the Vega vs. Chun-Li fight. Now that's entertainment!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Insightful & enjoyable mix of travel & cultural reportage.","review":"This book truly brings the world of Latin baseball to life. Mixing history, travel writing, sports enthusiasm & politics, Krich documents the (declining) importance of baseball in the Latin American countries closest to the US & its influence. He struggles on occasion because he alternately refutes & repeats stereotypes about Latinos, players & nonplayers alike. Some reference material (e.g. a reading list, maps, etc.) would make the book more useful, but overall it is both amusing & insightful, notably on the politics of baseball in US-Nicaraguan relations. Students in my Latin American history class have shown a keen interest in it. It should be brought back into print!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A true strikeout","review":"An attempt to find symbiosis between baseball, latino politics, and his personal journey.

This is an excellent reference for the certified diver. I'd definitely have it in my \\"sport diving\\" home library, if you do any kind of diving at all.Divers who have long been out of certification classes or who are planning refresher training will especially benefit.The variety of topics include these: The Truth About Decompression Sickness; Tides, Waves, and Currents and how to read them; 18 Keys to Scuba Diving Excellence; What to Look For in Diving Equipment; Fitness and Training--How You Can Do It; Underwater Photography; Spearfishing; TREASURE DIVING; Safety...Includes lots of photos and is one of my all-time favorite sport/hobby books."},{"rating":"2","title":"Houston Proud","review":"Unfortunately, one of the best books about this wonderful city is based on a murder!!!!

Since that time, I have read many, many books, some good and many bad...This was one book I will never forget. Being from Texas as I am, I read about a wealthy family from my home state that was embroiled in a scandalous murder investigation. How John Hill killed his wife (I'm not giving anything away saying this..it was in the news)was nothing short of horrific.In the book, there were parts that seemed to drag on, although all parts of the investigation must be considered to understand how the murder was committed. It has its surprises!!! Once you get into the relationships in this book, you won't want to put it down! If you like a good mystery, you won't be dissappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"grossly unfair to Dr. Hill","review":"A good friend of mine worked closely with Dr. Hill and reports that this book is grossly unfair to Dr. Hill. Modern thought is that his wife Joan died from Toxic Shock Syndrome, an illness not known or described at the time of her death. The time course, refractory nature, symptoms and fulminant course all fit quite well. Having treated septic shock in the ICU, I can also say with authority that with the available treatments at the time it is unlikely she would have survived in any case. Dr. Hill took her to the hospital where he was known since he would reasonalby expect his wife to receive the best treatment since he was personally known there. And it is absurd to think he planned to kill his wife with an illness that was not known or understood at the time.making Dr. Hill the villian makes for a more commercial story, but I ask you to consider that if he did not murder his wife how cruel his death was, to be murdered in the view of his mother and son."},{"rating":"1","title":"Blood and Money","review":"Supposed to be a classic true crime story.

The story is so amazing you really cannot believe this really happened, but shockingly it did, the Hill mansion in River Oaks still sits on its corner, astride to Kirby Drive.

It covers an incredible amount of information (albeit not in the depth some might want)-But the thing that allows it to rise above in my opinion is the high quality, HUGE range of photographs, some very rare. As games are a visual medium, this is important to me. Home games or arcade games, both are covered well, and the beautiful layout will have you returning to this book again and again.The 'Ultimate Guide to video games' (Also available) goes into greater details, but has very few photos-I prefer this, but I would recommend both to any game fan, as both are excellent, and together they make a fantastic companion set."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not just the games","review":"A beautiful, magnificent book chock full of sumptious photographs, not just of the games, but of the surrounding artifacts, too: advertisements, sell sheets, internal documents, Atari's trademark registration certificate, Ed Logg's design sketches for Asteroids, bits of design documents of unreleased games, Al Alcorn's hand-wired home Pong protoype...There are also plenty of behind-the-scenes anecdotes.Of course, text-wise, there's not as much detail here as you would find in books like Game Over or The Last Quarter, but it's a terrific (essential, even) visual companion to those two excellent books. Plus, it covers more of the *computer* gaming side of the industry than the other videogame history books I've read.The authors' love of the subject material shines brightly on every page.

At even the most exorbitantly extortionist price, the person who sold it to you is still getting the short end of the stick.The eponymous first track will someday make the cut on classical music compilations alongside Beethoven, Mozart, Bach, Chopin, and Autechre."},{"rating":"2","title":"RDJ, love him or hate him....","review":"\\"~Well, I love him!\\"~ repetative beat, but just enough alteration of sound to keep it interresting... by the end of the song, it's something completely new. got enough of them)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as it states","review":"\\"I think there might have been a mistake.

These first chapters are a helpful guide to any company looking into setting up a corporate education program. Perhaps the most interesting sections of the book are the sections on leadership development firms and corporate universities, in that these sections reveal an alternative route to executive development.

Young, whose first book Most Way Home was impressive if uneven, has taken quite a leap forward in his poetic life. Basquiat morphs into something other than his paintings, he becomes Young's poems, he becomes a monster and a genius, he becomes something close to mythic.This is not a picture book, you can't read poetry expecting to see images of the dead man's paintings, if you only want to read a description go and get a gallery catalogue!Instead, here, immerse yourself in Kevin Young, a poet who imagines America through the prism of a single, talented young man. A masterful work (that I was lucky enough to see just before its publication, lucky me!). Cheers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Peruvian Maid?","review":"I wanted to enjoy \\"To Repel Ghosts\\" so much.

Although Kevin Young is a fine writer whom I've favored in the past. There seems to be no growth or honesty in his writing. There are passages that are riddled with the voice of someone elses soul. It is not that of artist Jean Michele Basquiat. It is of Young trying to capture himself as something more than Young. I have seen many young writers fall into this dilema. It is unfortunate that Kevin Young try to romantazise a troubled artists life. Maybe because his own was such a privileged one."},{"rating":"1","title":"MORE GOOD WRITING?","review":"WOW, I have read all the previous reviews on Kevin Youngs' To Repel Ghosts and I hear two etremely different views. I read the book. I did not buy it and thought it was not worth buying. I agree that it is pretentious and nothing more than a romantic way of looking at Basquiat. I also agree that one doesn't need to be poor to write about the poor but the flip side to that is to understand more and not simply romanticise or exploit. Like painter, Julian Schnabels' film adaption of Basquiat(titled the same! I apploud those who champion Youngs' work. They are fighting for a voice that repels more than ghosts."},{"rating":"1","title":"STREET ROMANCE ??????","review":"I read to Repel Ghosts and thought it was okay. It is a bit phony for someone like Kevin Young who comes from such a privileged life to write about street life as if he had ever experienced it.

This book simply gives you a safe and untrue moment that is in a way enough for many, but not sincere enough for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Norton Ghost 2003 ate my RAID array","review":"I have used Norton products for the past few years and most are generally pretty useful (with the exception of the infamous crashguard, but we can all forgive).

If you email a question to their tech support, they simply refer you back to their commonly asked questions (FAQ's) on their website. After becoming thoroughly disguisted with their products, I tried to uninstall them from my computer. That too, is next to impossible as it often requires going into the system registry. If you want to upgrade a Symmantec product, you must completely uninstall and remove any previous version(s).

They do not even bother to keep a record of what they have already tried. I have not bothered to pay the $30 to call technical support for more useless suggestions.

I bought several Norton softwares during last December, and submitted the upgrade rebates right away with required items, Guess what, until today I got only one of them, and it has been almost 6 months.

His rediscovery of the piano begins with his own story but fear not, the book moves briskly away from the personal and captures the reader's attention and interest as Carhart writes of the wonderful complexity of this commonplace thing: the piano. The descriptions of the master classes and the visit to the Fazioli piano factory are brilliant concluding pieces to this very well-crafted volume. In essence the book embodies much of what Carhart has to tell us about the piano. As well he treats Paris and the French with due consideration and appreciation and never condescends to his reader. A delightful read that gains momentum."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Piano Shop on the Left Bank","review":"A thoroughly delightful story from the reluctant beginning when the main character is rejected from the back room; to hauling the piano up the stairs; to stacking pianos on their sides in the back room; to how poplar wood makes the best sounding board but my favorite is how he disliked recitals....that brought back memories of my childhood when I \\"hated\\" going to piano recitals.Cannot recommend this book highly enough....I have purchased four copies for friends."},{"rating":"2","title":"If you love pianos","review":"Wonderful book about an adult rediscovering his love for pianos, both playing them and understanding them as a complex mechanical instrument.

Delightful too. Light,easy to read, and yes, possibly boring if you're not into piano or music. If you are, I think this really conveys the passion and devotion an instrument can inspire. Kind of made me want to hug a piano.To be fair, it did get a little long, but I really enjoyed it."},{"rating":"1","title":"What are people reading here?","review":"This book is terrible. It is a poorly written plotless vanity project only held together by the very obvious device of incorporating the historical information about the Piano. The characters are all caricatures, two dimensional stereotypes. Jos the drunk but well meaning loser, Luc the reserved understated sage. Nothing more to them. What was Jos' back story? Luc's? The narrators wife and children are ghosts, mere placeholders. The author talks about discovery but presents none. The character does not grow or experience anything beyond perhaps improving his playing. Even here we get no sense of what that experience must have been like. We are told, but we do not feel. I wasted my time with this do not waste yours.

The story in this book seemed analogous to a story about a guy searching for his dream car and recalling personal and \\"deep\\" anecdotes along the way. Yes, a piano is unique in many ways, but I don't think Carhart writing 268 pages about this uniqueness was justified. It could have been rewritten as a short story, with all of the interesting facts about tuning, piano history, etc. in an appendix.Again, the entire time I was reading this, I was anxious to finish it because it was so boring."},{"rating":"1","title":"Following in a worn out tradition.","review":"One of the longest 242-page books ever published.

He soon discovers no one can just visit the store, indeed, the owner seems adverse to new customers. One must be referred by an established patron. Carhart works hard at it and finally gets in, meeting the wine-loving, piano-loving owner, and his adventures in piano buying and playing begin. This all sounds like a mystery tale, and it is, but when the music starts and the Beaujolais begins to flow, Paris takes on a new look and feel.I read the work twice, and loved it even better the second time."},{"rating":"2","title":"I too loved this book...","review":"I found this book to be charming and it constantly made me smile.

The only problem was we had just bought a Regency box piano and, though we are not exactly talented pianists, after reading this book we felt that we wanted to rush out and buy more pianos! Seeing as we couldn't afford to and it wouldn't be practical anyhow, space-wise, I think this book should come with health warning! We made sure we didn't come in contact with any pianos for sale for a few months till the effect wore off!

Finally, add a fascination with (or even merely an interest in) pianos, and you have an authentic winner. Well--and lovingly--written, this book is a delightful read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Interesting and informative...initially","review":"The book started out on an interesting premise: the mysterious piano workshop. The first chapters are quite charming and entertaining as we get to know the main characters and their appreciation for the piano and some of its history in Western Europe, which satisfies the piano enthusiast in me. The introduction of the piano's mechanism is adequate but not very engaging, as the nature of topic, perhaps. After the focus shifted essentially to the author's social life in Paris, however, the book becomes a tiresome series of journal entries and seeming existential profundities. The characters become progressively less interesting as they're examined, but not quite human enough to induce empathy. Overall, I'm disappointed by this book's failure to deliver on its promise (to me, at least), and resorting to the formula of let's examine the Europeans and their quaint ways..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beyond boring","review":"The only reason I read the whole book ---- a dear friend gave it to me.

The anachronistic use of footage is also extremely annoying, although fairly common in WWII documentaries, such as showing Tiger tanks or Henschel 129s while talking about Barbarossa.

Penned by one of the greatest writers in history, \\"A Confession...\\" by Leo Tolstoy provided me with great insight into his life, work, and relationships. I read this for a religion class in college and ended up keeping it. It is rather short and easy to read. Of interest to those who are seeking truth and those who have found it. It is fascinating to follow him thru his early religious experience, falling away from the church, and coming back to a unique faith in the end.

This book serves more or less as a summary of over fifty years of Chamberlain's efforts and works published in numerous books, which are now highly sought after.

It contains so much more than a play-by-play of the movie, but it also delves into tremendous characterization.. In the novel, Peter Preston Engineer's Mate is so much more. The reader also becomes aware that the young cadet is also the son of Scotty's sister. This revelation gives so much added meaning to the scene in which the chief engineer brings in the young man's charred remains after Khan's surprise attack. The theatrical release gives little more than Bones' heart-felt apology. The network television showing (which would appear from time to time on ABC) added scenes which did bring out this important plot point, but this has not been shown for many years. Why not issue a Director's Cut of this a la the original Motion Picture DVD. It would bring so much added meaning to this already classic film."},{"rating":"2","title":"LOVE","review":"I loveee these shoes!! alot cheaper than in the store and fit perfect on my baby girls feet!!They are going to look great with her birthday outfit!!:)"},{"rating":"1","title":"VIETNAM GARBAGE","review":"I did not know that Converse stooped that low to get their products made in Vietnam or else I would never have bought them for my young nephew."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Choice","review":"My 4 yr old son needed black shoes for a play he was in.

Something is really smelly about the harmonies, they clash all over the place (maybe they didn't know exactly how to use them back then), and the lead guitar lines are pretty rank.Only recommended for the most devoted Fall Out Boy fans.

Since neither Samsung or Best Buy (where I bought them) care about this decidedly negative customer experience (and apparently seem to think that 1 year of usage is about par for the course) I have decided to no longer buy their products (including their splendid monitors).

It'll play previously recorded tapes, but in camera (record or standby mode), the image is either totally black or horizontal white streaks (when a bright light is in the scene). I'll be contacting Samsung on Monday, and we'll see how they stand by their product.

After using it repetitively it does require a very good cleaning. Especially at the intake section where the sensor is located. Times that i neglected cleaning with fresh water made the dry part of the snorkel not function for the next outing.

The thing that makes this book work is the character development. Personally my favorite person in the movie was Stamper because he was sick and twisted and funny to watch. Well in the book he is even more sick and twisted, for example, instead of just giving the tape of the gunned down men from the devonshire to Elliot he actually gives a naration of it, and at one point he says \\"look at that one, he tried to get away,oop got 'em\\" Me and my friend joke about that all the time. well enough about Stamper.

Sure, novelizations are typically a waste of time, with the treatment done so simply and with no style, no extra drama, and little action, but this is the pits. Benson is not even a good enough writer for a screenplay novelization. He has zero style and zero feel for character. It's like he's describing the action as simply as he can and making it so distant that even as simple as the book is it becomes taxing to get through. Raymond Benson is the wrong choice for the new Bond writer and it's a damn shame. Watch Tomorrow Never Dies again. Don't even bother with this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Your basic crappy movie novelization","review":"The only difference here is that Raymond Benson, who is now writing the Bond novels penned this one. The problem with Benson is not his knowledge or understanding of James Bond but HIS WRITING. It's bad. Bottom line. The guy is a lousy prose writer, sounding like a high school English student in his explanations of scenes and descriptions. There is not an iota of drama or even action here. It's just plain wording of scenes on a page. This book is only of interest to big fans of the movie (which was top-notch Bond) and of the novels (for completists, as Benson's other 2 novels blow this turkey away.)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than the film!","review":"I don't normally read \\"books of the film\\" but after reading Benson's other two original Bond novels (\\"Zero Minus Ten\\" and \\"The Facts of Death\\") I decided to give this a try. I did not care much for the film. Benson, however, must have added his own bits (unless they were dropped from the final film) which made the book much more entertaining than the movie. The characters were more fleshed out and the plot made more sense. Not as top-notch as Benson's two original books, but still a surisingly good read. Well done!"},{"rating":"1","title":"007, Kitsch Style","review":"Oh, the decadent state of the James Bond books! This \\"novelization\\" seems to be written by a ten year old. Poorly written with no suspense, no thrills. A boring Bond.The thrilling actions of the film just don't translate effectively through Raymond Benson's boring narrative. There's also dumb humour that didn't appear in the film. Also, the description of love scenes is essentially kitsch. Yes, Benson tries to flesh out some characters, but the characterisations fall flat. The villain Carver, for example, is just another angry son who is bent on revenge--an age-old cliche.Save your brain power and stay away from this so-called novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"UHH.........NO","review":"I loved the movie so I wanted to check out the book. The book was very hard to follow. The action was good but the whole time I was reading I had no clue what was going on. I didn't finish the book because it was too confusing.

I know of only one Gangster film that surpasses it in outright weirdness - ONCE UPON A TIME IN AMERICA - and the only one that is more darkly comic is GOODFELLAS, which most people treat as serious drama.If you ever scoffed at the good hearted gangsters of the '50's and 60's musicals, or laughed at the pretensiousness of 70's and 80's gangster noir, you may like this film a lot.

The best episode in my opinion was of Ozzie and Harriet with Ozzie being too busy at Christmas. Very funny. I have that on VHS and liked it so much I bought this DVD when I found out it was on it. Otherwise, the sound quality on the Jack Benny episodes is very poor. I found myself turning the tv up and down with each episode.

Good re-issue timing."},{"rating":"2","title":"This book really shows you how horrible Communism is.","review":"This book is one of my very favorites. Kira Argounova takes you through Russia immediatly following the Revolution. Through her eyes and others, you will see the painful life Communism set for all Russian citizens. Horrific details of the sacrifices people made for eachother, the hunger of the citizens and the dying. Although it is painful to read and finish, it gives you a strong feeling of hope. No other fictatious book about Russia at this time will let you feel with the Russians as this will!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Poetic & Beautiful Novel About Russia's Communist Revolution","review":"As far as I'm concerned, this is the only real novel that Rand ever wrote. Lacking the soapbox diatribes of her later works, this novel is filled with a savage beauty, deft characterization, and beautiful poetic prose. It is the story of a young woman who must endure the turmoil of revolution and the imposition of a totalitarian state & who ultimately risks everything for freedom. Don't avoid this novel just because you don't like objectivism (this was written before she started her philosophical movement) or you'll definitely be missing out on one of the best novels of the 20th century."},{"rating":"2","title":"Semi-autobiographical and a well-written novel","review":"This novel is very poignant; set in post-Revolution Russia, a young girl on the point of going to University finds herself living in a world she cannot accept.Kira is depicted very well as a very young, emotional and sometimes impulsive woman who loves the wrong guy for the wrong reasons, sacrifices everything for him and learns that a life not lived as one wishes is not worth living. The tragic character of the Communist official Andrei is incredibly well-done.This book is a bit raw in places, showing the deep feelings that Rand must have experienced as she re-lives the world she left behind along with a family she never saw again. It is not as well-crafted a novel as The Fountainhead or Atlas Shrugged, but it is the most deeply emotional thing Rand ever wrote and well worth reading."},{"rating":"2","title":"Deceptively good","review":"Unlike Rand's other novels--supporters will be hard-pressed to state that she is a butle writer--We the Living is a historical snapshot, a supposedly semi-autobiographical novel that does wonders for evoking a specific time period. The characters are beautiful, colorful, and interesting, even against the backdrop of one of the most colorless regimes in modern history. There's no six-page diatribes or harsh anti-religios fervor in this novel, which is surprising given the nature of both The Fountainhead and Atlas Shrugged. On the first level, this is a solid novel, written with suspence and surprise, genuine plot-driven episodes and (to use a trite phrase) a great way to capture the imagination of the reader."},{"rating":"1","title":"My Opinion","review":"First, I did not like the book. It was like a trashy romance novel. It offered little information on the actual Russian Revolution. The book is about a girl named Kira who sleeps around too much to survive. She claims that she is in love, but she doesn't even know the meaning of the word. I do, however, like the end. I believe that Communism does forbid life to the living. If any part of this story is read, read the end. Kira and Andrei's last speeches almost make reading the book worth while. People who want a spin on a serious topic should read this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"I got mine you better get urs.","review":"same as before, the mentality of the haves against the have nots. Not a nice person, self-centerednessas an art form."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I am a huge fan of Atlas Shrugged, and I also enjoyed Fountainhead. As I had heard We The Living was a quasi autobiography of Ayn Rand's life in the Soviet Union, my expectations were very high. However, although the depictions of life under communism and the Soviet Union were extremely important and revealing, the storyline and plot itself were very dull. Maybe that was the point--the banality and dullness of life under communism aside from all the brutality and meanness. Regardless, the story was not interesting and the characters were not interesting; it turned into a bizarre, trashy romance novel. In no way did this book come close to Atlas Shrugged or Fountainhead. Sadly, I gave it up at about half-way. Others may have gotten more out of this book, but I did not. If you want to read Ayn Rand, go with Atlas Shrugged--it is tremendous."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dull and Depressing","review":"Ayn Rand certainly brings to life the desperation and the hard living of Soviet Russia (unemployment, money problems, food problems, rationalization, etc.) but cannot keep an interesting storyline amidst 400+ pages of fluff and melodrama. Not recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Please enter a title for your review","review":"This book might reward a long attention span but dull is really all I can say about it. The writing is typically cryptic, leaving it up to the reader to fill in the blanks, but generic banal detail fills up most of the space on the pages.The characters lifestyles are inactive, the environment never changes, and the relationships between the characters never get very complex although the relative lack of detail about the characters natures and motives always seems to want to keep you guessing. With every character in the book I was consistently thinking maybe there's more to them but there never was. Edited down to a quarter of it's length this book could have been a more engaging narrative and still maintained the value in it's depictions of everyday living in oppressive USSR society, but even then Kira's tragic romances, which were romantic for about ten seconds before they lost their lustre, would still seem pointless."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't Compare","review":"This book does not compare with 1) Atlas Shrugged, or 2) The Fountainhead. In my opinion, those are two of the finest books ever written. If you haven't read them, put We the Living aside and read them now.I could not finish We the Living. I got sick of the stupid relationship. I guess I got about 1/4th the way through. Maybe my tastes are changing."},{"rating":"1","title":"very dissapointing","review":"this book as many have said is one of the worst books to ever be thought up as ayn rand was a terrible philosepher this book is a terrible read"},{"rating":"2","title":"I felt like I was meeting Ayn Rand in person...","review":"Ayn Rand said that \\"We the Living\\" was the closest she would ever come to writing an autobiography. Maybe that's why when I was reading WTL I got the impression that I was witnessing real scenes from Ayn's past life under the Soviet system. The uncompromising and highly principled behavior of the main character, Kira is inspiring and horrible to witness when you realize what she was up against(communist rule).Kira is not the superhero type Rand would create so well in The Fountainhead and Atlas Shrugged, but she was as close as you could expect to find in Soviet Russia. And unlike Rand's later fiction, WTL has a sad ending... an ending which really drives home the point of how collectivism's ultimate result is death -- death of the mind, death of the individual, and eventually death of everything good in society.It kept me up nights reading and many more nights pondering what it all meant. A great read!"},{"rating":"2","title":"An early work of Ayn Rand . . .","review":". . . it still shows the keen intellect behind her writing. The character development seen in Atlas Shrugged and Fountainhead is there as well. Yet the book doesn't quite move as well as her later novels. Nevertheless, ten times better than the typical novel. Ayn Rand makes a searing indictment of communism, a system she grew up with and knew only too well."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Essential Rand","review":"While writing We the Living, Ayn Rand was still mastering the nuances of the English language after her emigration to America. It doesn't matter; she hits a literary homerunanyway. This is the essential Rand, antiticipating the brilliance of the Fountainhead and utilizing subtlety I wish she had exercised in Atlas Shrugged. You'll be carried away by Rand's protagonist, Kira, a hero in the classic sense of the word. At the same time, you'll be devastated by Rand's all too accurate description of the drudgery and misery of post-revolutionary Russia."},{"rating":"1","title":"The most readable of Rand's books","review":"For those of you who excroriate Rand for one-sided hatred of Communism, let me just point out that she was born under it, and she ought to know. The first hundred pages of this book are the best thing Rand ever wrote --complicated characters, and a vivid, chilling depiction of life under the Bolsheviks. Of course, then Rand the proselytizer elbows her way in, and it's downhill from there. One can forgive Rand for hating Communism, but to go a mile in the opposite direction and espouse such a brutal solipsism is perhaps a sign of some psychological problems on her part. What would the world be like if everyone were to declare himself a monomaniacal Dr. Doom surrounded by foolish mortals? Brilliant she may have been, but, unfortunately, also totally nuts."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great read, great commentary","review":"I was drawn into the novel by the heroine's devotion to her ideals but was finally let down by a weak ending. I wonder, though, if this was Rand's goal? Maybe the story of a Russian girl who holds to her ideals in the communist Soviet Union doesn't have a grand finale? Maybe she is simply crushed by the weight of socialism that sees her only as part of a collective. Besides the ending, though, the plot is engaging and interesting. The writing isn't quite on par with Rand's later works (this being her first novel) but the presentation of her fledgling philosophy and her social commentary make the book worthwhile on every level."},{"rating":"2","title":"Go out and get it!","review":"Although this was the first of Rand's invidual vs. the masses novels, it is quite good. It is her most autobiographical and also her most beautiful love story. The book is not necessarily as triumphant as are her others and is, in fact, quite tragic in parts. Kira, however, is a most interesting heroine and her relationships and how they relate to the results of the Russian Revolution make for a wonderful read"},{"rating":"2","title":"the novel of rand's with the most heart","review":"It has been a long time since I've read this novel, but out of her several novels/novellae, this is probably the one with the most heart. As all of her fiction is quite tragic, this is a tragic love story, but these characters seem to take on a more human tone than characters in her other works of fiction. It would be difficult not to appreciate her writing even if in some ways her work is almost unpalatable. I'm not sure that I would want to recommend We The Living, but I did read it several times myself."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rand's early life?","review":"Anyone interested in reading Rand's fiction should start with this book. It's the first she wrote and, via the depiction of the horrible life it's protagonist leads (seemingly somewhat autobiographical) you can see where Rand's later philosophies and excesses stem from. A moving story of an idealistic, free-thinking young woman's doomed attempts to live her life under Soviet rule. No one who reads this book can come away unappreciative of life in a democracy where individuals have a much greater degree of self-determination."},{"rating":"1","title":"I agree with Kyle","review":"I agree with Kyle.

I have been curious to find out anything about the Tuatha de Danann people, this story answered a lot of questions, I want more! I cried when the Celts attacked the Dananns, who were willing to share their island with them. I know it is fiction, but I could just imagine that that was how the Celts won. When I read how the Danann could have used the earthkillers to win, but decided not to, and marched willingly into battle against a superior army, I cried. Where did the Danann come from, that's what I want to know! I have read a lot of Ms. Llywelyn's books, this was the best of all, I plan on reading all her books!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Feminine fantasies","review":"I am very interested in Irish culture and mythology, but this book was way too feminine for me to be able to wade thru. Most (95%) of the text is long, boring descriptions of the various character's emotional states; the \\"action\\" such as it is, is just silly. For example, the hero's brother has gone berserk, and is about to kill an important guest, when he is stopped in mid-sword-stroke by the beauty of the song that the Bard starts to sing. Yeah, right. If you are a fan of bodice-ripper type historical romances, then you will like this book; otherwise forget it."},{"rating":"1","title":"TEDIOUS READING","review":"The book started off well but eventually became a boring account of a subject that could have been much more interesting. The author gives depth only to Amergin and makes the remaining characters a group of silly, strange people. The women are only sex objects and there is not one female character in the book of any importance. I found myself skipping pages just so I could finally get through this boring work."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful","review":"I recently picked this book up, after reading all of Llywelyn's books from The Irish Century series (which I also recommend, as they are the best books I've ever read). This book is truly wonderful. It's not realistic (nor do I think it was intended to be), but it has that wonderful quality that all of Irish myth and legend has: the ability to transcend time and space. This book is a true tribute to the legacy of Irish storytelling and bardic tradition.I give it 4 stars, though (4 1/2, if it'd let me), because the ending is a bit abrupt; but this may just be Llyewelyn's way of letting the reader know the story of Ierne is still continuing."},{"rating":"2","title":"A fine job of evoking the past","review":"It's hard to truly say what happened back in the swirly mists of time, especially going as far back as when the mythical Milesians arrived, accompanied by the legendary bard, Amergin. However, this book does a fine job of evoking that past as it might have been. I read Llywelyn many years ago, before I had even begun reading Celtic history, and I was surprised by the wealth of authentic detail as found in this book. One item that particularly sticks out in my mind is the description of the burial of Mil. Llywelyn used such precise detail, even down to the couch he lay on, that I could remember seeing a pictures and drawings of just such a burial, all the way down to its intricate wheels. So, relax and enjoy this book, confident that the author put as much true history into her tale as possible, yet creates an astounding epic."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Longer You Read the Better it Gets","review":"I found The Bard a good read, not Morgan Llywelyn's best but very good. The deeper you get into the work the more you are pulled into it. I was sad to see it end...while she pulls you to do further reading. The Bard would surely cause me to seek out other Llywelyn works, of those that I haven't already consumed. You find yourself feeling for the characters, resenting some, while admiring others. Pity for a some and joy for a few. I found myself trying to think ahead, predicting the next turn... sometimes with success, other times with suprise. I would highly recommend this work to anyone with an interest in Gaelic roots & interest."},{"rating":"2","title":"My favourite book!","review":"This is the best work of historical fiction that I've ever read. Morgan Llwelyn really brings the characters to life... I love Amergin, hate Colptha, mourned the death of a few characters whom I won't give it away :), love Clarsah, and long for Ierne right along with Amergin. This is the book that helped start my passion for everything Celtic. ^_^ The story of the Milesian Celts' epic adventure travelling to Ireland and encountering the Tuatha de Dannan is a wonderful story and best told here in Bard. I can't say enough good things about this book :-) =)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent","review":"Yet another amazing story told by an amazing author. Old myths interwoven with real historical possibilites set the stage for a wonderful adventure. The only hang up I have however is that the protagonist never finishes a certain thing that he has been trying to finish throughout the entire book??? I get the feeling by the way she ended the story the author may have been planning a sequel. There were a few items that I felt needed closure. Hmmm... Still fantastic though."},{"rating":"2","title":"Agreed","review":"At first I was very turned off my the mix, simply because it is so very dark and plodding. But there are so many intricacies that can be heard throughout, proof that Dear pays very close attention to mixing smoothly. Some moments are spacey, others damn irritating, but overall a very unique experience. Argy's \\"Rhino in a glass shop\\" has a schlocky beat, and is very deep and funky. Not quite up there, but a damn good effort."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Good Minimal. A unique mix","review":"I am a fan of unique stuff. Anything that crosses boundaries and is different, and good, is what I enjoy most. A lot of the feelings and sounds in many of the tracks on here are quite unique. This is why I gave it such a high rating. However, I must say that when I got it, I never really ended up listening to it as much as other really great mixes. It kind of got boring rather quickly. Its not a very exciting mix, lets put it like that. A low 4."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I had hoped for","review":"I was reading notes on Pandora about the Connells and saw that there was a solo CD by George Huntley so I bought it. If I had been paying attention I would have noticed that all ( or at least most ) the songs were written by one of the Connells not the vocalist Huntely. So it wasn't a solo Connells CD and was weak compared to the group work."},{"rating":"2","title":"good but could be even better","review":"The title is right and the books gives you a lot of not very deep information. But good as kind of catalogue. Authors missed a lot of regions. They took only well known to westeners. Somw great monuments are missed as well. But in general I would recommend to buy it for people who are interested in architecture and/or Islamic culture. Good photos."},{"rating":"1","title":"stunk","review":"The book smelled and looked like it came from someone's basement. The book itself was okay, but I wouldn't recommend it to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pop-Psychology","review":"This book was assigned reading for a \\"Leadership\\" in business class. The first two chapters set the tone for the rest of the book. Read those, and the rest will be just variations on the same theme. I now use the book as a doorstop."},{"rating":"2","title":"Working with You is Killing Me - not anymore!","review":"While this book is intended for those in the work force, as a teacher it is also applicable. A colleague and I are reading this in order to deal with those we work with and to try to learn new strategies for \\"staying alive\\" in our school. The strategies and definitions in this book are helping me to understand those individuals who are \\"killing\\" me. This comprehensive book is great for understanding my reaction to those who trip my trigger and how to modify my reaction so I might better cope with those whose work ethic is not the same as mine."},{"rating":"2","title":"Book for Work Relationships","review":"The service was wonderful, the book is pretty good. I was able to apply some of the ideas and sugggestions from the book toward the workplace environment."},{"rating":"2","title":"Difficult People and Situations Solved!","review":"Crowley and Elster have written a refreshing and extremely helpful book on how to deal with problem people and situations. The book focuses on work relationships, but I found it very useful dealing with people in all walks of life, including my family. I have the Hardcover and Audio versions and use both. I recommended the book or audio version (Audible.com) to anyone who has a problem with work relationships or any other relationship. This is a perfect book to give a graduating Seniors or College students as they get ready to join the business world. It is a must read for everyone in business!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Surprisingly helpful from an accidental reader","review":"My wife bought the book and I was sceptical when I first saw it. I accidentally left it on a low table and our puppy picked it up and shredded most of the first chapter. I bought another copy from Amazon to replace the damaged copy. As I tried to repair the torn pages a few words caught my attention and after that I could not put it down. Take it from an initial sceptic that this book has very helpful suggestions and practical advice that you can readily apply. I highly recommend this book to anybody who is working."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great assessments and exercises","review":"Crowley and Elster offer very effective assessments and exercises to help you see just how caught up in the emotional trap you might be AND they tell you how to get out of it. The core of the book is about managing your reactions to difficult situations you find yourself in at work (for example, how to keep your sanity in the face of a difficult boss), and about how in doing so you take control."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh, Conor!","review":"Although a lot of people don't care for Conor Oberst personally, I think he's an amazing lyricist and have been following him in Omaha since the beginning. \\"Digital Ash\\" was such a disappointment! Not even this die-hard Bright Eyes fan was on board. I've given the album more than a fair chance, and although I like some of the lyrics, the music and arrangements are a far cry from anything Bright Eyes has done before and ends up sounding, as others have said, rather amateurish.Worse, though, was seeing these songs played in concert earlier this month. Oberst followed The Faint, which really rocked the crowd, and then songs from \\"Digital Ash\\" brought everyone down, causing many people to leave early. He only played one song not from the CD, and a lot of people were hoping to hear a few from \\"I'm Wide Awake, It's Morning.\\" Given that the audience was mostly from his home town, the mass exodus served as a fair review. Buy another CD instead of this one--\\"Lifted\\" if you don't have it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Starts pretty average, but....","review":"The album starts off like Bright Eyes' take on Death Cab For Cutie, only more industrial. However, around the halfway point of the album (on Take It Easy, to be exact) the album really starts to wake up and go somewhere.To be fair, the remainder of the album sounds like Bright Eyes' take on Rilo Kiley - but that's a good thing. The second half of the album is worth the price of purchse. While it is a definate departure from the type of music Bright Eyes fans are used to, the electronic sound change of pace and they really use the sound to their advantage.I'm not sure there is anything as good on this album as Lua or First Day of My Life - however, despite the poor beginning to the album, I like this much better than I'm Wide Awake. The standout tracks are pretty much EVERYTHING from Take It Easy through the end of the album.I'm sure big fans of the usual Bright Eyes fare will disagree, however, for the casual listener of the band, this is a damn fine album."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unlucky Friend, Lucky Me","review":"My roommate and I are Bright Eyes fans, not diehard, but quite fond of earlier CD's which we found to be lyrically great (Lifted of the story.., fevers and mirrors)...So when Bright Eyes was going to release 2 CDs at once, we were pretty enthralled. But being college students (and therefore slightly short of cash) I decided that I would buy \\"I'm wide awake\\" and he would buy \\"Digital Ash\\"...Then we could listen to both.Well I am glad that luck was in my favor, because \\"Digital ash\\" is unlike bright eyes I have known. THey go for the Postal Service electronica style, but whereas \\"Give Up\\" is a pleasant if unexciting CD, it is more than listenable. To be harsh this CD is almost egregious to the point that it gets little to no playing time in our doorm.If you want to get into Bright Eyes though, get some of the earlier CDs. I loved \\"Lifted\\" and \\"fevers\\", and to a lesser extent \\"Im wide awake\\". Not digital ash."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Bright Eyes album","review":"This album is by far the best Bright Eyes album. I can't stop listening to it. I really hope he decides to take his future albums in this direction.And as for all these 1 star ratings from people who haven't even heard the album; you need to look at the unoriginal, unintelligent, corporate bull you listen before you put down a real singer/songwriter.Conor Oberst delivers the human emotion in this purposely flawed gem crafted from the soul of his misguided youth. These multi-platinum, ever popular rappers, don't hold a candle to the talent that Conor Oberst has in his left pinky finger."},{"rating":"2","title":"who is D, N Voetberg?","review":"Alright, this cd is really, really good. Ya maybe it does take a few listens to enjoy it, but what good cd doesn't? Haven't you ever listened to a cd where you like it at the very beginning, and then fing yourself getting tired of it after a couple weeks? Not with this cd. I find myself finding new things about this cd with every listen. Not that these are comparable, but with Tool i found myself listening to Lateralus many of times before i really \\"appreciated\\" it, and know i cant find myself without it. And as for that D. N Voetberg guy, or whatever you are, if you think American Idol is \\"real\\" music, you have alot to learn dude. As I can see your from Los Angelos, which makes you as fake as breast implants. Just listen to the song Aenima from Tool, and you will know what i am talking about. Also, read his reviews, they are hilarous, he is a real gangsta, Yo!!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Ambitious at Best!","review":"This album severely lacks coherency, listenable melodies, hooks, flow and story. I am not a big Bright Eyes fan and I honestly think he's overrated, but that was after listening to this disappointing release. There are very few genius moments scattered throughout this album, but not enough to make it worth your while.If you are not familiar with Bright Eyes, try some of his other albums (I'm Wide Awake It's Morning is actually pretty good). This album is not a good introduction to his work to say the least. I guess it was meant for hardcore fans!I, for one, won't be buying any of his albums anytime soon."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great CD If Given a Few Listens","review":"I have just discovered Bright Eyes, having first been introduced through the simultaneously released \\"I'm Wide Awake It's Morning\\". This work is entirely different, and equally excellent. I admit I had to give it more listens before the songs really grew on me (except for \\"Take It Easy (Love Nothing)\\"--this one was love at first listen!). It's a mix of rock and synth-rock, somewhat dark, with many instrumental layers. After a few listens, the melodies are stuck in my head, especially after going to see Bright Eyes live, promoting this CD. It's refreshing to hear intelligent, poetic and symbolic lyrics after a few decades' drought. Then it was all clear--Conor Oberst is a genius, musically and lyrically. The CD is somewhat of an experiment, but not too far away from some of his older work, and it works very well if you listen a few times."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ashes of Brilliance","review":"I have now successfully listened to the entire record 6 full times, and i have come to the conclusion that this is one of those records that will stick with me for forever.I will say this, i too doubted Connor Oberst, but i see where he is coming from and he's coming from a place where i've been too. the midwest takes on new faces through \\"Digital Ash\\"'s hypnotic and moody electrnic pieces.This record plays like a movie or better yet, a stage play. It's captured me, and most of the reviews i have read are so far off from what the record truly is.Listen to it in a pair of really good headphones, then as you slowly become enthralled in it, play it out loud.all of the tracks are awesome, i would say my absolute favorites are Time Code, Gold Mine Gutted, Arc Of Time, Down A Rabbit Hole, Take It Easy, Hit The Switch, and Easy/Lucky/Free.yeah, or every song."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Little Different, Still Great Bright Eyes","review":"Digital Ash in a Digital Urn, as compared to \\"Wide Awake\\", is a very layered, very production heavy album. I'm trying to use a word other than \\"digital\\", considering it appears twice in the album title, but it fits pretty damn well. Strangely enough, I can hear a significant Jesus and Mary Chain/Smashing Pumpkins (\\"Machina\\" era) influence on the album in the sheer amount of sound bombarding the listener. In my opinion, a much more musically interesting album than \\"Wide Awake\\", but a little further removed from the emotional connection to the audience. But I love it."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT LABELED CORRECTLY!

But for my money this a phenomenal cd. I first got into Bright Eyes when amazon posted the free mp3s on the website. And I liked Take It Easy(Love Nothing) and Gold Mine Glutted are much better songs than the way too morose Lua. Overall every song is good in it's own way. The only complaint I have is that the first 2 minutes of Time Code is pretty much silence, which I have to skip through every time I listen to it. And on Ship In A Bottle, the part of the song where it breaks down into a baby crying annoys me. But other than that I have no complaints."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Lyrical Goldmine","review":"Alright, I'm going against what all the other self-proclaimed Bright Eyes experts have said about the two simultaneously released albums from Jan 05. Digital Ash comes out on top, not by much, but it really does show Conor Oberst's musical maturity, releasing two different CDs in two similar but different genres. If he released Digital Ash alone critics would wail and say, \\"oh he's trying to reinvent himself.\\" If anyone finds this new direction he's exploring hard to comprehend, they've been fans for less than a year, because he's been leaning towards this since Fevers and Mirrors, in my opinion one of their greatest albums. I love I'm Wide Awake, don't get me wrong, but if you can really appreciate Saddle Creek/Omaha style music, pick this up. If you like Cursive or Faint, this is definitely the top pick out of the two, although you'd be seriously shorting yourself if you didn't get I'm Wide Awake as well. Both amazing albums, but Digital Ash shows more depth and creativity."},{"rating":"1","title":"Write your own tunes next time, Oberst.","review":"Kinks.New Order.Bob Dylan.etc...Nice lyrics, but tunes (and the hooks especially) sound far too familiar, no matter if they're dressed up with beeps and electrical whistles.I guess with two albums to release so close together he had to cut corners somewhere.

All I can say is what a waste. The other revewer who described the album as amaturish hit the nail on the head. Banal would be a generous description of this album. The only positive point I could make about the CD is that at least the artist didn't attempt to rap. This one's so bad I'll be throwing it away ... I'd be too embarrassed to give it away."},{"rating":"1","title":"Conor Oberst != Bob Dylan","review":"I wonder if Bob Dylan likes Bright Eyes. Bob Dylan had the tumultuous 60's to remark on and did.

It is bad enough that this film has been portrayed as a live action movie, but after watching the first 5 minutes I understood why they didn't advertise the fact it was animated, the animation is dreadful.Scenes where the characters were not moving or talking were quite well done, that is the justification of the one star I have awarded.

However, I found it to be disappointing.I thought it was a mistake doing the entire film in motion capture animation. It was also unnecessary - even though a number of the action scenes couldn't have been done completely in live action, greenscreen technology could have been used for those while using the real actors the rest of the time (see any of the Lord of the Rings films).And how many times can the guy scream his own name (probably about as many times as they used the Austin Powers \\"hide the salami\\" bit)?I thought the fight with the dragon was outstanding (hence the second star), but the movie could have been so much better."},{"rating":"1","title":"One of the worst movies ever made","review":"Saw this in the movie theater because I like to see Angelina half naked on a big screen.

When we heard it was in the works, we were delighted to think this venerable tale would be put on film -- but our disappointment in the treatment of the characters with this cheesy animation and the liberties they took with the original story are simply unacceptable. The so-called \\"special effects,\\" monsters were simply laughable. Jolie looked hot in her body capture suit, but that wasn't why we rented this awful, awful, film. We didn't bother watching the final scenes unroll -- by then, the whole thing had become just a huge waste of time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well done and excellent moral to story","review":"Didn't read it when I was supposed to, way back, but this looks like the 'real thing' and is very well made. The major theme is that people often get ahead partly through some kind of misdeed or succumbing to a temptation, but the consequences will never stop haunting and hurting those you care about. That's what seemed to resonate with me, at least. The nudity was not gratuitous and the special effects were great and not overdone as in many movies about 'sagas.' Hope you give it a try and enjoy it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where are the People?","review":"I had heard that this \\"movie\\" was CGI, so it was not a surprise to me when I saw it. Still, I must say I was disappointed with it for the very reason that it was CGI. Maybe I'm old fashioned but I like real people, real actors, real sets and real action. Cartoons are fine for Bugs Bunny and Daffy Duck, but why for a movie like this? I don't get it. I can't help but think what the result would have been if Casablanca were a made as a CGI cartoon, or High Noon or Indiana Jones. Of course the story itself is a classic. So there is no fault with the material. I just don't particularly care for CGI for the characters or sets. It has it's place, to enhance some scenes, but as the main element - thank you No. I feel like I've been shorted on the real movie experience."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beowulf... woof.... woof","review":"This movie has great graphics, great actors/actresses (Hopkins, Jolie, etc), great writers (Writer of the comic, Sandman).... but it doesn't work.

Avoid this movie unless you are renting."},{"rating":"1","title":"One of the worst movies ever made","review":"I cannot believe they butchered the great poem Beowulf so horribly. It had nothing to do with the story at all except for the names of the characters. This movie was about a self-absorbed jerk who comes to save a loud kingdom from the pitiful Grendel, who has a seductress (seems to be 90% of Angelina Jolie's characters) mother. Beowulf, being the self-absorbed jerk he is, has a one-night stand with her, becomes king of the kingdom, kills the son he had with her in the lamest way possible, and then dies, leaving his buddy to screw Jolie's character and start the train over again. Boooooring! And so Hollywood typical! If you liked the actual story, you'll hate this. This movie butchered it. Oh, the animation was annoyingly awful too. If I could rate it 0 stars I would. Ew."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hwaet! This is terrible!","review":"This re-telling of the great tale of Beowulf is an utter failure in every way. The animation is dank, dark, dull. The characters look more like uncomfortable robots than imitations of living creatures. The basic story is trashed and Grendel's mother (the animated Jolie) is ridiculous. Read the epic itself* or see the movie, \\"Beowulf and Grendel\\", if you must see it on the big screen. But skip this awful interpretation.*There are decent poetic translation by Frederick Rebsamen and Dick Ringler that are worth looking into if you really want to get what Beowulf is about. A dramatic recitation is given by Benjamin Bagby in Anglo-Saxon (with subtitles) and is available on DVD - excerpts can be viewed on Youtube."},{"rating":"1","title":"Flawed in the Re-telling","review":"There are many good things in this movie: The actual characters from the Epic, the basic setting, the intense violence, Grendel, even Grendel's mother. However, and I admit that I am biased here,I just don't think you can re-write a mythic tale that has survived for 1000 years to satisfy a modern director's idea of a good plot.This movie is not Beowulf, it is a movie based upon the Beowulf epic. As such, it changes the central theme of the actual epic: The war between heaven hell being fought on earth as a struggle between good and evil, man and monster. I suppose that modern ideas of heroism can not accept the mythic heroism of the epic, but I feel that those very ideas are what make the original epic a truly great story.Taking those elements out make this movie a morality tale about a false hero reaching redemption at last. The movie reflects the cynicism of the modern era I suppose, but it loses the epic qualities of the original poem."},{"rating":"1","title":"RUN RUN while you can","review":"I had to watch this for extra credit and oh goodness gracious it was horrible. If you read Beowulf. This won't be anything like it, they should've at least changed the title to this movie. Barely any parts were watchable. Some Grendel parts were a bit scary, like less than an inch but that's it. The best word to describe it is ridiculous. Only a decapitated fish would enjoy this. It was incredibly cheesy: the character portrayals , the music, the somewhat good animation but what kills it most is the murder of the actual story line, oh it was just horrible!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Beowulf","review":"This movie is a classic.

It was like watching \\"Shrek\\" with alot of violence and nudity. (blood and butts, if you will) By the time I got over the visuals of the movie (the \\"real\\" animation was pretty disconcerting at first), I was stuck in the middle of a very boring plot. I'm not sure, but I don't think it followed the real storyline of Beowulf. I was very disappointed in this movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"You gotta be kidding","review":"Ha ha ha.

Don't waste your money, for God's sake!The graphics aren't impressive (the characters appear plastic and stiff), the characters aren't sympathetic or interesting (except, as the other reviewer said, for Grendel), and I can't figure out how the hell Zemeckis got so many big stars to be in it. Their acting ability doesn't overcome the lack of emotion in their characters' plastic faces, leaving me unable to connect with any of them.If you can find it used for $1, then buy it and watch it with friends, so you can make fun of it together.

Perhaps the guy in the duplication planr found a reel created by the Shrek 2nd string. Seriously. Take poor quality Shrek animation, add in Clutch Cargo mouth effects, then stick in some Benny Hill \\"hide the naughty bits\\" routine and you have this pitiful waste of time.The opening shot - I assume this woman is supposed to be attractive. Er, by what bizarre standard? I kept looking for the Adams Apple. The Physics? You know, gravity, water motion, flame movement? Perhaps if we were on the Moon. Motion capture? Oh man - I could go on forever. This movie just plain SUCKED. Nobody was able to keep their fake accents up for more than a few lines. BTW, what accent was that supposed to be anyway?Save your money.

If it's awful, you didn't spend so much purchasing it. By the way the commercials were shown, I expected Angelina Jolie to be in most of this film. The characters looked like wooden figures, except for Grendel. I had a bit of difficulty understanding Grendel when he spoke to his mother. In the original epic, Grendel's mother is more beastly looking instead of a beautiful woman. It had its pretty messy moments, like Grendel tearing guys to pieces, and it had dull moments, like Beowulf and his young mistress. You pretty much had to guess that Hrothgar was with Grendel's mother and I wish they would have shown Beowulf's son in humanoid form before he was attacking in his serpent form. It was just terrible."},{"rating":"1","title":"Garbage, If ever I wanted to give zero stars this is it","review":"This film should be required viewing for anyone wanting to find out how to wreck a classic story.

What a waste."},{"rating":"1","title":"OIM 'ERE TER KILL YER MOON-STAH!","review":"Awful, just awful. Beowulf with a Cockney accent. CGI-encrusted actors who look like they stepped from the unrated director's cut of \\"Shrek.\\" A script (co-written by a respected fantasy author) that follows the lead of many other adaptations by establishing an unconvincing \\"personal connection\\" between Hrothgar and the monsters. A battle in which strategically placed benches, mead cups, and beams cover the naked warrior's wedding tackle -- Austin Powers as Beowulf? The nadir of Robert Zemeckis' fixation on motion-capture animation."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for lovers of the poem","review":"Okay, I am not a huge fan of the original poem, but the movie was far worse than the story I remember. They really should have called it something else, because this was not the story of Beowulf. Also, the change of Grendels' mother from a monster to a sex goddess with built-in stilettos really killed the movie for me; I really don't think that was meant to be funny, but I couldn't help but laugh out loud. Maybe if I hadn't read the original story, I would have seen the story in a new light, but that's not the case here. Rent the movie and decide for yourself, but be careful if you ever sit through this movie with a group of English majors...although it does make for an interesting get together. lol."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why?????","review":"Thank goodness I didn't pay to see this turkey. I admit I never read the poem, now I wouldn't get near it. I hated the half real, half animation, made all the characters dead behind the eyes. It was obvious there were actors acting (OVER-acting really,basically chewing the scenery!!!) and their images CGI'd. Why? They were ugly, waaaay too many closeups. I wondered who directed this mess, saw it was Bob Zemeckis, who gave us Forrest Gump and the Back To The Future trilogy and others. Shame on him! After the opening graphic carnage, had no desire to see anything but the ending to check the music on the ending titles."},{"rating":"1","title":"Holy Crap, That Sucked","review":"[...] Talk about a waste of two plus hours.

It has basically spoiled Gaiman for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"STINKY-BAD!!!!!","review":"Tell me, how do stupid people get to make major motion pictures?Ugly to look at, stupid to listen to, and pointless to follow--this has little to do with the great epic (other than sharing a title).It is my belief that the dopey director and stultifying cast decided to make this since the original epic was out of copyright and, lacking any ideas or originality, they seized on the opportunity to TRY to read it and understand it.Alas, they failed.Save your money; save your time. Watch an old Popeye cartoon, instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your time. Go download it for free if you really want to see it.","review":"This movie was visually awesome.

The only drawback was the story, the voice acting, the story, Ray Winstone talking like William Shatner, and did I mention the story?If you really want to see it, highjack an IMAX so you can see it in it's intended 3-D, smoke a bunch of pot or other hallucinogenic drug so you don't really focus on anything but the visual stimuli, or download it for free. Don't waste your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"It does not support the comparison wih 300...Empty!","review":"I wasn't that impressed by the special effects and you can clearly see that all this movie was filmed in a studio. Sometimes the landscape look ridiculous, with some horrible flashy orange sunset:it looks so artificial ! Apart from the monster Grendel (who was greatly animated I have to say), the rest fall apart as the movie goes on...Poor acting from Angelina Jolie as well, just here for the decoration. And Ray Winstone is clearly not as gifted as Gerald Butler.They tried to do something like 300, with the moral of courage and honor but it sounds...empty! Honeyed, without consistance, like a Ron Howard movie. This incredibly beautiful story deserves much better than that.."},{"rating":"1","title":"-2 bad movie ,that could have been greater than all","review":"I think this animated live action sucks,the story is ok but differs from the saga's a+ cast for a d- bad movie.think more than twice then go home and rethink it again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beowulf","review":"In 6th century Denmark, Kin Hrothgar's (Hopkins) kingdom is being terrorized by the monster Grendel (Glover). The king calls for someone to come and defeat Grendel. Beowulf (Winstone) answers that call, seeking glory more than gold. On his first night there, Grendel attacks and Beowulf must deal with him. But, Grendel is not the only creature waiting to terrorize the kingdom. Grendel's mother (Jolie) and a dragon also lie in wait.Computer animated and only loosely following the epic poem, \\"Beowulf\\" is an entertaining feast for the eyes. I think that animation was the way to go with this story, and the images are very realistic. Voice talents of Winstone, Hopkins, Jolie, Gleeson, and Penn all fit well with the characters. Purists will probably be disappointed with the changes, but for those not familiar with the story will probably have no problems. \\"Beowulf\\" is a great example of how far CGI has come, and an excellent diversion for those craving some action."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's okay at 16X speed....","review":"This was just horrible.

Angelina Jolie gets to play dragon mother with a (sexual) taste for the Danish kings. She uses them to procreate and have baby dragons who torture the local villagers. Star studded actors that include Robyn Wright Penn, Antony Hopkins and John Malkovich cannot save this movie - that is how bad it really is. All actors have these really bad nordic accents. I would not recommend it for young children since the film has brash adult humor. I am so disappointed, I have no more words to describe it."},{"rating":"1","title":"BEOUWULF","review":"This sci-fi film is a bit weak, a body-enhanced second rate actor said to have acted in East Enders (a long running UK soap) fights monsters etc supposedly in the raw.

I've never read Beowulf although did glance over it quickly before seeing the film, to get the gist of it.I simply could not get over the poor character modeling and animation. This looks like a film that was made 8 years ago not in 2007. The story was lame and I think most disappointing of all is that nothing was ever truly resolved. Beowulf was a self conceded jerk-wade of a character who I thought was to have the strength of 10? men. Rather than ripping the beast's arms off in the first big battle scene as I thought I read about Beowulf, he just slammed the beast's arms by closing the door until they came off.

At the end, Beowulf fights the dragon, but we find out the dragon is Beowulf and Grendel's mom's son. Grendel's mom LIVES! THAT'S NOT COOL!!! I would NOT recommend BEOWULF!!!p.s.

I thought why don't they just make it live action? But I really like this movie after watching it despite my initial misgivings.The story is epic, the acting terrific, and yes the animation is actually quite good.I also had misgivings about the story itself, which suggests that Beowulf is less than honest about his dealings with Grendel's mother.But if you view the movie not as a canonical Beowulf, but as a representation of the spirit of Norse Mythology the movie has much worth.The story is different than the poem, but the spirit of the movie is closer to the spirit of Norse Mythology than many other versions of this story put to film.The mother of Grendel is obviously the queen of all wicked witches, Gullveig as well as Angreboda the mother of monsters.Beowulf gives in to temptation, but in the end proves that he is a hero."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not Bad","review":"I was actually surprised by this movie.

As far as Beowulf goes. Where do I start. Well I'll say that watching Beowulf in action made me question my own machismo. He strips naked infront of a woman to fight Grendel only because it would make it a fair fight. He literally yelled at a man who was trying to kill him to do so and the man broke down in tears because Beowulf was way too much man to kill. Beowulf simply told his right hand man to give him some gold and that he now has a story to tell. Any man that is willing to lose an arm to kill anything is much more of a man than myself.

All that happens is the main character stands around yelling \\"I am Beowulf\\". The plot jumps about 30 to 40 years without notice or explanation. If your getting this because of Angela Jolie don't she was in the movie for a whole 5 minutes. It was awful. Don't bother."},{"rating":"1","title":"Absolutely awful","review":"Give this one a miss. This is definitely not the story of Beowulf. They took far too many liberties with the story and cheapened a classic epic by 1)adding stupid comic and overly sexy details; 2)using gratuitous blood spatterings and much gore; 3)altering the plot significantly; 4)making Beowulf a boastful, lying, easily-seduced muscle-bound \\"hero.\\" Hrothgar as the father of Grendel? Honestly! Even worse, Beowulf as the father of the dragon!As a teacher, I previewed this DVD to see if I could recommend it to my students. Absolutely not! No way would I let my own children (all teenagers) see it, and I'm going to get rid of my copy as soon as possible.Disgusting!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible","review":"Not only is it a horrible adaptation of what is a wonderful poem, but it is ugly too.

I would."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad, Really Bad","review":"A little bit of cartoon violence, a little bit of cartoon sex, a dash of religious bigotry, but no connection at all to the epic poem (other than the title) on which it is supposedly based.

The viewer's time would be better served in reading the text and an insightful piece of criticism, such as Tolkien's \\"Beowulf: The Monsters and The Critics.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Why don't we just watch video games instead?","review":"Enough!!! Can Hollywood get any lazier? Actors command salaries for voice only when added to Animation? It's not acting! And, if I wanted to see such, I would just watch a Video Game in simulation mode! Beowulf might have been awesome if presented in true physical acting form.To get the bad taste out of my mouth, I popped in my \\"Excalibur\\" DVD. Guess what, almost 30 years ago, a great sword epic could be done with Real Actors and non-computer generated special effects.What's up with today's Hollywood?

They should offer a 3-D version."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"Beowulf is a classic tale that deserves better than this. I hated the video-game style imagery. The poem is beautiful to hear, and to adapt it visually it deserves a beautiful visual style, more lushly beautiful, more fantastic, more starkly ugly, grittier and more brutally realistic, whatever. I found the style bland. The sound design could have gotten it a second star, if I could use it as an audio-play, that would be ok too, but no luck there, the sound design is similarly bland and artless. Now that this much money has been spent on this boring piece of drek it will be at least a decade before another production company takes a crack at this wonderful treasure of literature. What a waste."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just terrible.","review":"If you've read and loved Beowulf, don't watch this. It's not true to the original at all - not even close. Beowulf's character was sold out for enhanced palatability to the masses. The whole movie was done in CG which was distracting and downright laughable in places - a very poor choice from my point of view. Just another Hollywood murder of a classic to contribute to the dumbing down of the masses."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Single","review":"This is a pretty good single if you ask me. It has 11 tracks (which is pretty generous for a single) most of them are remixes for Guilty and then there is a couple instrumentals for those remixes and then there is the demo version of Goodbye and a remix for it aswell. If your a Gravity Kills fan then you should definitley check this out."},{"rating":"1","title":"A bit on the slow side","review":"I like this game, at first. THere are many good elements, the cereberal bore, which drills out guys brains, and turrut guns, and bear traps. All in all, this game is to violent for younger gamers, it can get pretty boring one player, but the multiplayer is the best feature, if friends are always over, get it, if your looking for a good 1 player game, stay away"},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible game","review":"I played this game a total of 40 minutes before I gave up on it. The graphics are poor, the gameplay is difficult, the controls are bad, the concept is bad. I absolutly hate this game. I found it hard and somewhat boring to play.

I rented this one, and have hesitated to buy it since I usually play games alone. I was correct in not buying it. It was pretty bad for the one player version. The graphics were fuzzy and it was way too dark (no matter how much I turned up the brightness on the game. Maybe I need the expansion pack. It was pretty boring in the single player mode."},{"rating":"1","title":"not as good as the others","review":"This game's graphics stink. It was way too hard, and the characters moved way too fast. I don't recommend this game to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst shooting game ever!","review":"Of all the shooting games in the world, this is the absolute worst! The graphics are not even half as good as Turok 2, the weapons are stupid, and the enemys are the most unimaginative, stupid brutes that I have ever seen! Also, the one player mode [is terrible], and there is absolutely no challenge whatsoever. The enemys dont even attempt to fire at you! So if you are a fan of (and I feel sorry for you if you are) bad graphics, bad weapons, bad enemys, and no challenge, buy this game.

The 2-player trials cannot be completed! Come on Acclaim what's the deal. I've been told to mail the defective game to Acclaim. Who wants to go through all that trouble? I just took my defective game(s) back. We deserve a product that works as it is supposed to. What is wrong with you people. Why all the good reviews? I can't be the only person who has found SIX defective copies of Rage Wars. I really enjoyed the game until I found this glaring problem. Now I consider it just garbage. I bought this game for a good multiplayer experience. All I got was major disappointment. This couldhave been a great game. Sorry Acclaim you've struck out once again. Fix the bugs and maybe I will buy it. Again!"},{"rating":"2","title":"good game if you have at least 2 - 4 friends","review":"This game is ok like i said if you have friends to play multiplayer with. The one player trials are just too hard. right now i have had the game scence December, 2001 and i havent gotten through it yet. But other than that the game has great graphics and cool weapons. This game would be better to rent for a few days to see what you think before you buy this game. And by the sounds of things there is a glitch in 2 player trial i havent tried it out to see if it works yet so you will have to find out yourself."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bonington at his best","review":"The first ascent of the South Face of Annapurna is told in Bonington's characteristically engaging style. No detail of organization, logistics or communication is left out, with the result that we end up knowing quite a lot about what the climbers had for breakfast and what was said during their radio conversations; but I see this as a good thing. The book is slightly lacking in exciting scenes of actual climbing, as many expedition books unfortunately tend to be, but has plenty of gripping material nevertheless."},{"rating":"1","title":"1 star for evil seller's price","review":"99 dollars for a 129 pages? that's like a dollar a page!!! evil person, share information."},{"rating":"1","title":"Useless at best","review":"I am the Business Development Manager for a large electronics company, and always looking to improve my business skills. I found the book was written without a market in mind. It is some how written for a person with no experience, or education in business, who is dealing with mutli-million dollar contract in the play business. I think that rules out pretty much every person. It goes in to the basics of negotiations like \\"you might need a contract\\", or \\"some things might be important\\", and then addresses these issues in terms of a person who would need to be the best in their field to approach such situation. Badly written, no focus market, probably paid to get it published."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent real-world security reference","review":"This aptly titled book uses plentiful real-world examples to bring the reader into the world of information security. Sixteen chapters present a panoply of actual computer security attacks, each followed by lessons learned.Case studies come in five areas, from basic hacking to forensics. The book ably mixes introductory and technical material so that it succeeds at being useful without being inscrutable to nonexperts. The authors do, however, assume a basic level of network and security understanding. The case studies show what system and network administrators can do to protect their networks from the most common attacks.Even at 320 pages, the book is easy to read. It is a well-written work that balances the competing extremes of generality and minutiae. Any network administrator looking for a boot-camp approach to network threats is advised to read this book of example problems. The point is to learn by example so as not to become one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not the best, but better than Corporate America","review":"Bought this about the same time Corporate America came out. This isn't the best effort of Mister Delp and Goudreau, the three RTZ cd's are more true to the \\"Boston\\" sound we've all grown to love.This collaboration is pretty \\"soft\\" when it comes to rock, the only real rocker is a live piece (Rhythm Wont Stop, tossed in to fill out the tracks, and actually one of the worst on the album.

I may be wrong, but I made the mistake of thinking a \\"mattress cover\\" would cover/protect the ENTIRE mattress (like a big sack). I thought it was a \\"mattress pad\\" that covered only the top with possibly a light weight material on the side to keep it in place. This product does NOT cover the ENTIRE mattress! It ONLY(like my idea of a pad) covers the top of the mattress. It has some VERY, VERY, FLIMSY (net like) material on the side, with elastic on the edge (nothing to protect the bottom).

Needless to say, I'm not happy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Was this Matt Stones first movie appearance?","review":"I'd like to give this film 3 stars... but I can't. Some great insights into Howard Stern and the Howard Stern show as well as some surprising interviews with other celebrities. I would have given it 3 stars if the interviews with the Stern fans weren't, in my opinion, loaded. What I mean by that is all the Stern fans, outright fans, were idiots. While some of the more normal interviews had some positive but mostly negative things to say about Stern, the all positive ones were freaks. And one of the interviews, billed as Dave Stone, looked an awful lot like Matt Stone of South Park. In fact, unless Matt has a twin named Dave, this was him.

The author swallows whole the complacent platitudes of modern economics and never, ever seriously examines his assumptions.

I honestly had to stop reading it altogether because of this mindset of the authors.They could have worked at integrating the science fiction of Star Trek into what we already know about science. Instead there is nothing but criticism at every turn.It's a great book if you enjoy looking for that which is bad or even a little wrong in the Star Trek universe. I guess that some kind of weirdo enjoys that pursuit. However, as an intelligent report, it fails.I am so peeved at this book that I will send it for free, no charge, no shipping, no nothing to anyone that wants it.

While it is a true representation of a chronic illness, it is neither an uplifting or comforting story. Ms. Flax covers the current Western methods of treatment. She does this by offering examples that illustrate the downside of each treatment. It is difficult to accept the alternative treatment methods she promotes (i.e.: massage, herbs, meditation). She was not originally treated with any of these methods and it is uncertain whether her outcome would have been better or worse.

Reading the box, it looked like it might be a good horror flick. How wrong was I !!!!! This movie shouldn't even fall into the horror catagory. The whole movie is about a teenager, Casey Noland, who aspires to be the next famous serial killer...... Not! He can't even bring himself to harm the next door neighbor's dog! What makes this movie even more stupid is the fact that his \\"gothic\\" friend wants to become his first victim. Together, they think of ways and weapons he can use to make him \\"different\\" from other already known serial killers. This movie is more funny than horror which still isn't saying much for the film. With a stupid plot and poor acting, I don't recommend this film for any true horror film fan for it is not a horror movie at all. Don't be fooled by the box...... it's not worth the money even to rent it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Diamond In The Rough","review":"OK...I'm going to keep this short.

It may not stack up for those snotty connoisseurs out there, but for the rest of you, take the risk...you'll like it!! This was a direct to video movie, but is far better than much of the crap that somehow made it to screen.

Justin Urich plays a morose lad whose ambition in life is to be a serial killer, and Loeb wants to be his first victim. It's all slowly paced, poorly written and Loeb is simply awful. Urich does a little better but the whole plot is so ridiculous one doesn't really care.

A teen fascinated with serial killers and murder decides he wants to be a killer after he graduates from High School and a real life killer is killing people in the town. A desperate attempt at black comedy with barely any laughs and even the black-humor isn't very funny. Avoid this and rent Pulp Fiction,Very Bad Things,or any other dark comedy out there.

Being slightly plump as well as having a klutzyness problem myself, I could totally identify with the main character. In fact everyone can see themselves in this book. It is like the end of the movie \\"Nerds\\", when everyone comes down and proclaims themselves to be nerds.For everyone who has ever been picked on by the \\"jocks\\" or just been made fun of their apperance and wishes they could do something about it. For those who like to see the good guy take the fall for the good of another.

He was bothered by parts were the boys are trying to get a girl to stand up while she's tanning with her bikini top undone. This happens several times over the course of the book, like an underlying theme. Very age inappropriate for kids under thirteen, I think. If there had been any indication that the characters had been punished for this behavior, or felt guilty about it, or if the girl had stood up for herself and told the boys to leave her alone, I might have felt differently about this book. As it is, it's just wrong, and not something kids under 13 should be exposed to."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just, no.","review":"I bought the hardcover when this book was first published not really knowing what I was in for and, well, damn. I was young enough think possibly the book was powerful. Now I see it as the kind of book that makes readers feel hectored with it's \\"do you know what pain and suffering is\\" episodes of sexual abuse. Pretty much, stay away.

I had no problems with the graphic nature of the book. However, the characters had no life to them - their actions and histories have mysterious motivations that are alluded to but never explained; they do nothing but ride horses, get drunk and have abusive sex. The story goes on and on and on, and there is no plot, no climax, no resolution. We know Lee can't handle intimacy after the first sexual scene - nothing in the next 300 pages dds any clarification, meaning or resolution to this storyline."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretty lame.","review":"The book was written assuming everyone was familiar with horse riding lingo and drug lingo. I've ridden a horse once in my life, and I was never a heroin user. I was lost through alot of the book.. Honestly halfway through I wanted to put it down but I can't do that.. I finished the book and normally I feel something when I'm done. I just turned the last page and said.. \\"Hmm, thats it?\\" There wasnt much of a plot or point to the book. It is very graphic in the sex scenes. I do not belive I would recommend this book to anyone. It wasnt worth the ten bucks."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Service","review":"This is a great product.

Don't let their unknown names fool you, this cast produce some lovely singing. Be warned that if you already have some of the top notch Don's such as Sotli (Decca) or Karajan (EMI) this recording will never live up to those standards. Please don't compair Bergonzi to Cleveman! or Telbaldi to Martinpelto! They just come up very short. That said I listened to Tu che la vanita about 4 times back to back.. it is lovely! There are moments that fall short as in any live recording... mostly I found the Eboli of Tobiasson the least at home in Verdis dark score. The recored sound is very good, but again did I mention it is live? So you do hear stage noice and such, but it is never TOO distracting! Hope that you enjoy this recording, I have already listened to it 2x and I am headed back for a 3rd."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent!!!","review":"This book is an excellent addition to my sons library! He said it has the most amazing pictures and commentary that he's seen."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great introduction to practical application","review":"Mr. Dixon simply explains the basics of geology in this book so that a middle school student could understand the concepts. The glossary in the back is very useful (good immersion into the vocabulary in geology). The basic rock and mineral identification section was particularly interesting to me given the pictures and thorough descriptions of the variants. It claims to be an introductory guide and it does so superbly."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Overview for the Beginner","review":"For the person interested in geology but not wanting to become an expert, this is a very useful guide. Talk geology on a bus some day and find out just how little people know about this subject. Even so, geology can be presented in a way that is interesting and approachable to those who may not be science junkies or in the field themselves.This book does a good job of conveying the basics in a way that is understandable and can serve as a supplementary textbook for some science teachers depending on what their curriculum includes. For those of us interested in geology, but not interested in becoming geologists, this is also useful and interesting material. Interestingly, I left my book outside and it became the victim of \\"weathering.\\" So I may need a new one at some point."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book for the big picture","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed this book. I am an aspiring amateur geologist, and for me getting the big picture is paramount. I have other books, many going into great depth, but I just needed something to get me going quickly. This book did it.The one thing that I didn't like is that the terminology is introduced sporadically; for instance during the description of the \\"spheres\\" of the earth, while discussing the mantle and crust, the lithosphere and asthenosphere were not mentioned. Yet in a much later chapter, they were casually mentioned. I suppose my initial love of the \\"big picture\\" would fly in the face of this, but just thought I'd mention it.If you are interested in Geology, this is worth the investment."},{"rating":"1","title":"only 2 because of shipping","review":"No matter how nice it is these cabinets are too expensive when the shipping is almost the same price as the cabinet itself!

His quirk and humor, interesting characters, and engaging writing are all wonderful.This copy of his story is a cute, solid little book, with gold gilded paper edges (Which makes us all feel quite happy and kinda important, doesn't it?). It also has some of those woodcut illistrations that give any book a kind of old, classic feeling (in a good way). It is, however, about 2/3rds the hight of what I'd call the average book, with a font size to match. It doesn't bother me, but it others might wish it larger. This is the only reason I didn't give it a full five stars.I'm quite happy to have it on my bookshelf, where it's look and words will bring me much enjoyment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too small.","review":"This book is thicker than it is wide with tiny type.

The little thumbwheel you are supposed to turn to roll the jam out is impossibly stiff and despite spinning it enough in both directions to raise a blister, did nothing to free the jam. The space between the rollers is inaccessible and without special knowledge of the printer, the rollers are impossible to separate in order to clear a jam.I returned the printer - even if a service desk had been able to clear it, I do not want to be able to print at the convenience of a service desk."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Machine but be cautious if you're a Mac user!","review":"This is a great all-in-one copying and printing machine but works poorly with apple computers!

Very smart, but very quick prose. Anne Ursu does not try to jam emotion down your throat or tell you what you should be feeling. In this way it was like a piece of theater. You are presented with these highly identifiable human beings and the understanding is left up to you. This makes the book highly engaging and explains why I got so involved that the novel was finished nearly before I looked up.The book is only now becoming available, but early buzz about Spilling Clarence in our area is very good, and as an early reader I can say it's well deserved."},{"rating":"2","title":"*****************SIMPLY MAGICAL!!!!*************************","review":"Anne Ursu's first novel is simply MAGICAL! Her writing is alive full of charm and charisma that pulls you in and keeps you reaching for more with her amazing characters who make the town of Clarence come alive as they begin their journeys of remembering!!! Her characters will touch your heart...you will simply fall in love with them all and think about them as if you actually know them and when you are done you won't be able to forget them! This is a book you just can not put down, will definitely want to recommend to everyone you know, and if you are like me will read at least one more time to make sure you did not miss anything!!! I can't wait to read more from this talented new author in the future and will be adding \\"Spilling Clarence\\" to my personal list of favorites!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"a unique new voice","review":"With Spilling Clarence, Anne Ursu accomplishes something most writers aspire to and few achieve. This book establishes Ms. Ursu as a unique voice, with a distinct world view peppered by humorous observations, rich characters, and smart insights into the dynamics of life in America. Through the eyes of the people of Clarence, Ms. Ursu displays the many and varied ways that people respond to life, with fear, regret, and honest self-appraisal. And she does so brilliantly. A powerful debut."},{"rating":"2","title":"Moving-- An Extraordinary Work","review":"What a pleasure to find such an interesting, well-written novel! Ursu has a tremendous feel for her characters, a wonderful sense of pace, and an original voice. I can't remember a recent novel that moved me so profoundly. A real find!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Truly distinct. Wonderful.","review":"How exciting to find an innovative piece of fiction that is so appealing. This novel has such an original voice, has such a quirky sense of humor, and such a magnificent narrative pace and style.Sometimes attempts at literary innovation mean the author is trying to belong to some \\"high art\\" literary club, means the author forgets the poor reader along the way. Not here.Ursu is an intelligent, yet very feeling author.I'll be recommending this novel for a long time to come."},{"rating":"1","title":"good premise, but.....","review":"I found the premise of this book to be fascinating and full of potential. Unfortunately, it features a disappointing and somewhat cliched plot development with an overly cutsie writing style.I could not develop a connection to or emapthy for any of the characters, could not figure out where the story was going as it dragged on for 200 plus pages, and found the ending to be a dis-jointed segment unto itself. The book reads like a screen play for a sappy made-for-TV movie. I read it for my book club, and found myself surrounded by a room full of \\"amazing\\", \\"5 stars\\", \\"deep, creative\\". All I could think was....\\"I guess that's whay they call it chick lit\\". I had high hopes for this novel; what followed was a dumbed-down fleshing out of its premise."},{"rating":"2","title":"Intelligent and Highly Original","review":"Ms. Ursu's stimulating debut novel, about memories recovered in a highly original way, belongs on the same shelf as Alan Lightman's \\"Einstein's Dreams\\" and Charles Baxter's \\"Feast of Love\\". Book discussion groups will eat it up."},{"rating":"1","title":"Intriguing idea, but . . .","review":"The idea is intriguing, but the result disappointing. The writing style is simplistic and repetitive; in sharp contrast, for example, to Jonathan Franzen's The Corrections, where the style is overly complex and arrogant. Moreover, the characters are never really developed beyond cliches, and crucial plot lines are dropped. (What if memories really are simply creations rather than a replay of facts?) And for readers who have even a bit of education in the neuropsychology of memory, the inaccuracies of the science will be too distracting to allow enjoyment of the story. I, for one, will pass on Ursu's next attempt."},{"rating":"2","title":"An evocative exploration of memory and life","review":"The premise of Spilling Clarence is uniquely original: what happens when the citizens of a small town get sudden access to their own memories, in living,vivid detail? A nostalgic walk down memory lane? Hardly. Ursu's thought-provoking and haunting debut follows three generations as they cope with total recall. Laugh-out-loud funny and heartbreakingly bittersweet, this novel will make you reflect upon your own life and question what it is you think you know about your own past. This is one of those books that you hug after you finish the last page."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow. Looking forward to more.","review":"I've never seen a writer so skillfully interweave narrative past and present; dreams, reality, and memory coexist and inform one another.But the narrative is also clear and told with great wit.I am expecting great things from the author's next book (which I have just discovered here on Amazon, to my delight)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bleakness based upon an unproved theory","review":"The crux of the authors' argument is based upon a subtle assumption (in the preface, no less!). Once you accept that, then their \\"we're all doomed and nothing we can do about it\\" thesis acquires some weight and becomes truly depressing.My thought is: if we're preprogrammed to be the way we are, and the way we are makes us destined to destroy the earth and ourselves, then why write the book?This was really a dark, unrelenting journey of hopelessness. What I don't get is the other reviews: what is there to \\"get\\"? I'm being told I can't do anything to change this person's horribly bleak vision of destruction. I'm just \\"made\\" that way.I'll stick with Edward Abbey and try to do something constructive in my world."},{"rating":"2","title":"Reg Morrison wrote the book I wanted to write.","review":"Why is economic theory so screwed-up?

Here are a few extra considerations: One of the things that makes the earlier work, _Wildlife_, a better book, is layout: none of the pictures in it are split between two pages. In _Song_, several of Brenders' best paintings are laid out this way, and it seriously detracts from one's appreciation of his work. Even if I liked the (generally insipid) poetry which is splashed all over the pages of _Song_, the addition does nothing to enhance either the poetry or the artwork. The few redeemming features of _Song_ include a larger, somewhat better copy of \\"Pathfinder: Red Fox\\", a stunning painting of a snow leopard, and also a tiger (not in the first work). Otherwise, a great artist deserves a better presentation than this book provides."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is without a doubt one of the most prized books I own.","review":"Carl Brenders is my idol as far as artists go. I work constantly to try to be as good as he is. I don't know that I will ever achieve that. He is beyond words.

However, the layouts were too busy and were trying to accomplish too much for my taste. But one certainly couldn't argue with the quality of workmanship and detail.

Sounds nice for single notes, but drags on chords, & leaves itty-bitty bits of shaved rubber sticking to your instrument."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Not-So-Good pick","review":"I bought pick, wondering what a rubber pick would be like. These wedgie rubber picks are much easier on the fingers, you can grip as hard as you like, and the softness will not rub your fingers raw. On the other hand, the rubber easily grabs onto the strings, getting stuck, and basically makes it impossible to play with, unless you are just picking and not strumming. Good idea, but I don't suggest these."},{"rating":"1","title":"Want rubber residue all over your guitar?","review":"These picks do cut pick noise but with an acoustic guitar they wear very rapidly and leave a rubbery residue all over my guitar. I don't like the thought of what damage that stuff would do over time to the inside of my guitar with that stuff getting all over my pickups, etc. Big disappointment. I'm getting a lot of high string in my guitar sound and thought these picks might solve the problem. Back to the drawing board I go."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for ukulele","review":"I'm sure it's a fine pick for other purposes, but it's not for the ukulele as advertised, unless you only want to do ONE (strong) strum."},{"rating":"1","title":"Muted sticky sound","review":"These picks do not add a natural finger plucking sound to your playing.

Terrible purchase. Try something else."},{"rating":"2","title":"So Soft!","review":"I bought these for when I get my new guitar and they seemed like such a comfortable alternative to the common plastic or metal picks.

I've never been a fan of the harsh sound of a plastic pick against my strings; but I'm not exactly a gifted fingerstyle player, either. In my opinion, these are the perfect middle ground. They sound awesome, and once you get used to holding them (they ARE a little different), they work wonderfully. If you play as heavy handed as I do, you'll find that your strings start to eat up the picks, but it's fully worth the tradeoff for the amazing, natural sound. wI'm a huge fan."},{"rating":"1","title":"what a drag","review":"A beginning uke player, have trouble holding onto the felt pick, so thought this one might make it easier. It's supposed to be soft like a finger. It IS easier to hold onto, but it REALLY drags across the strings. Doesn't feel at all like real fingers on the strings. Too much work for me to use it. For guitar, think a regular pick and some Gorilla Snot might be the better choice. For my uke, guess I'll stick with the folded paper pick, like Dad used to use."},{"rating":"2","title":"Maybe better called Seven Fanciful Viking Adventures","review":"The term \\"Romances\\" in the title refers to the style not the content of these stories. These are really fantastic adventures. There are a couple lengthly ones and some short ones, but most all of them are great reading. I would say that even if you don't find the legalistic/feud-based Icelandic sagas particularly appealing, these are a quite different. These seem much more like mythical stories, although the Norse gods play only a limited role in them. In some ways they are like Beowulf because they portray Norse dealing with fantastic creatures and magic. They would make great movies, but not really for children."},{"rating":"1","title":"Romances","review":"I was expeting something akin to the family sagas when I read this and was disipionted.

The tracks here are the typical, trance cheese fluff that any artist would strive to avoid. EACH song has the predictable build up followed by a break down. Granted, buildups are fine, but the mechanical way it is done on each track is rather annoying. Selection and variation would have been welcomed. Also, the mixing is minimal, at best. Many times, it seems like the only device used was a cross-fader.

I bought this CD two years ago and i really dug it, but it will never reach Nails' textures and Depeche Mode's lyrical and melodical approach. Though, GK are a great band, their melodies really seem like their own, they have a unique style. But i agree with people saying they try to recreate Head Like a Hole.

The songs take no risks and are quite forgetable.Their song \\"Guilty\\" was on the movie Seven, I believe, and while pretty good by itself, cannot carry the whole album, especially when the rest of it sounds exactly the same. Yay, they have distortion pedals! The titles could use some work, too... they're all.... blah.I give the CD 2 stars on the strength of \\"Guilty,\\" but that's being generous.

After a breakup is when I feel the most depressed, taking life way too seriously! This book had me laughing the whole way, or smirking, chuckling, snorting, almost-peed-myself, non-stop, nodding-my-head, giggling. Whenever I'd get upset about a man, I'd read a few pages & it was like seeing the guy naked to the core--and myself too (because we're not so innocent either)!

Then read Ship of the Line, then Flying Colors. The three are practically a triptych, whereas the others all feel like they have space between them. Also, since Forester actually wrote Beat To Quarters first, there's in 'introductory' quality to it that no other book in the series has. The series compares favorably with the Aubrey/Maturin series I think. Odd that they were both cut short by the deaths of their respective authors.In short, start with this and the next two as a trilogy, then proceed in any order you want."},{"rating":"2","title":"Alternate Title","review":"\\"Beat to Quarters\\" -- also sold under the title \\"The Happy Return\\" -- is unquestionably one of the best in the series.

I spent a summer with my country cousins in the very area her story takes place. However, after 100 pages I still struggled to see where the story was headed and I didn't feel pulled into the \\"suspense\\" or even grow to care about the personalities she portrayed. My husband and I finished the book for our club but we do not plan on following up with any of her other books.

We appreciated the quotes from Daniel Boone that prefaced each chapter. They were the best part."},{"rating":"2","title":"Really wonderful book","review":"This is a book that almost every one can love. It is a loving picture of a family, and community, caught between traditional Appalachia and the 20th century. There is suspense and whimsy, sorrow and joy, and just an over all good story.

I kept hoping someone would bump off thereal estate man but alas! as in real life, he not only livedbut prospered.

This author is a \\"natural\\" storyteller, and that's why her previous books were so fresh and applauded. While reading The Rosewood Casket, the reader is often aware of the author's erratic attemtps to please the critics, and this truly effects the flow and believability of her natural storytelling. There are many groan inducing passages throughout the novel, many highly forced and completely unbelievable, and many appears to be rushed without much thought being put into them. The overall feeling after completion is that it was basically a very silly and mediocre tale, laced with moments of the author's natural gifts, alas, fleeting moments, but, not nearly enough to ever recommend this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"She has the right \\"take\\" on Appalachia","review":"Sharyn McCrumb is doing for Appalachia what Tony Hillerman has done for the Navajos. She presents a realistic picture of these fine, brave, proud people without the grotesqueness of Cold Mountain or the distortion of Deliverance. This is not so much a mystery novel as it is a novel that happens to have a mystery in it. Her characters are well-rounded and the setting is true. My only quibble with it is her vagueness in the matter of firearms and their use. I would like to have seen a closer connection between the use of the rosewood casket and the actual ballad.

If anyone is/was a terrorist it is the European colonizer who has taken every meaningful thing from my mother Afrika, and to date continues the same.Bottom line, the one who enslaved us cannot lead us or overstand that freedom means that is why the author chose the label terrorist vs freedom fighter..Takes one to know one, and i and we are unforgiving."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent time capsule of this period in history","review":"It would be easy to fall into the trap of modern liberal myopia and dismiss a book like this as too colonial or racist in nature to be of value, and for sure this book will never be assigned reading in any college course. But I think the parallels with contemporary life and international occupations are rather clear. Places like Iraq, Afghanistan and Sierra Leone in 2011 immediately jump to mind. In addition to crafting a first rate adventure story, the author takes the time to reflect on the conditions that lead up to the Mau Mau insurrection and the British response to it. Only an outsider could relay this objective viewpoint. There is no doubt that one man's terrorist is another man's freedom fighter."},{"rating":"2","title":"Genius electro from Rother","review":"This album is pure electro fun.

And, as with almost anything nu-metal, there are no memorable riffs at all. The singer is also pedestrian, his voice has zero individuality.

There are \\"explanations\\" for each question, but they are much too brief to be helpful, especially for verbal.The first 45 pages cover non-test related topics about preparing for pharmacy as a career & preparing for the schooling.

I bought all the rest of the books from England as well.... This is serious writing. I don't mean that there is no humor, but if Eddings is Elementary School Fantasy, Jordan is Junior High School, and others are High School, then this is Collegiate perhaps even doctoral Fantasy. The scope is huge, the characters are interesting, flawed and we developed. Don't read this if you just want to breeze through a book, because after each volume in this series you will be tempted to go back and read the preceding work to tie things all together.

A worthy successor to book I in all ways, and a harbinger of book III. THIS is a page turner. You will follow several people, in different locations and circumstances.

It's a bit more simplistic then the first one but on the other hand it's a bit more complex since you start to get a feel about how huge the world is. Throughout the book rare are the moments of light and happiness... darkness, sorrow, pain is everywhere.Characters are really well developed, plot is outstanding with all those twists and turns and there are plenty answers to the questions from the first book.

It started out well, very engaging. 1/3 of the way through it starts to bog down, then proceeds to the absurd. It seems around every corner, Erikson is trying to outdo his last description of grisly death. I started rolling my eyes at the predictable \\"how much more gruesome can I make the next scene\\" and also there's always some new terribly powerful entity to make mincemeat of the latest extremely powerful entity. To the point of absurdity, somewhat laughable.The interminable march of Coltaine's army, I ended up skimming over. Got through the book pretty quickly that way and felt less resentful of having my time wasted. The last straw for me was, one thousand of the cursed crucifixes???

The worst part of the book comes with the Navy EOD stories that do not cover EOD at all, only underwater operations.

Oscar Schindler is a rich German man who trys to save as many Jews as possible from a nazi camp. I would say that Keneally's book is for ages 12 and up.I think this book is for this age range because of some gruesome details. This book can be appreciated by people of all ages. I'm 13 and it is my favorite book, and my grandpa,65, loved it. \\"Schindlers List\\" is a true story about Oscar Schindler and the Schindler Jews.The book is based on the movie \\"Schindlers List\\".

During what is undoubtedly the darkest chapter of human history, in a time where a person would sell off their own grandmother to the Gestapo, his selflessness enabled the lives of 1500 Jews to be saved, and indirectly, he saved many more lives - the children, grandchildren, and greatchildren of \\"his\\" Jews are alive today because their ancestors were fortunate enough to have their names on his list.You can't help but contrast him to the likes of Adolf Eichmann, who protested during his trial that he had no choice but to do what he did, he was a soldier who was \\"only following orders.\\" Schindler too, had a choice, and his choice and its consequences are lovingly chronicled in Kenneally's book.That he had the courage to make this choice is a point that should never be forgotten. And neither should Oskar Schindler."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enthralling","review":"I had seen the movies many times before reading the book.

Interestingly written between facts and normal fictional dialogue this book is great."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing story","review":"This book is not only a good biography of Oskar Schindler, but (I'm betting) helps the reader understand the Holocaust better than before reading this awesome novel. I had to read it a little at a time, and the writing was not the easist, but it became much easier to read as I went on and I am so glad that I persisted with it. It is a story of man gradually possessed by a goal which he basically manages to achieve. Kineally let the facts speak for themselves and there was little embellishment, yet I found myself thinking about the novel all day and literally couldn't wait for my evening read to see what Schindler was going to do next. Only four stars (wish could give 4 1/2!) only because at times there seemed to be a bit of dryness and way too many names. I would have loved to have had more character development of any number of characters, but I suppose Kineally would have given us that if he could."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Exciting Account of Bravery and Struggle","review":"Schindler's List, by Thomas Keneally, is based on the true story of a German industrialist who saved over 1,000 Jews from extermination during the Nazi occupation of Poland. It presents a very realistic and persuasive account of how Oskar Schindler placed himself at great risk (he was arrested three times) to oppose the Nazi regime and protect the Jewish workers in his factory. The book also describes the subhuman treatment of those that Schindler could not save.Most of those reading this brief review will have seen the movie and it must be said that the book does not have quite the impact of the movie. Still, this is a fine book and a tribute to a man who chose to act decisively when he met evil. It deserves to be widely read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Man From Bethlehem","review":"I make this an annual event, to re-read Thomas Keneally's inspiring story of Oskar Schindler.Writers have sought to contemporize Jesus;they need not look further than Schindler's WWII story, a biography of action, of spiritual dimensions.One man becomes a hero while the world is in a violent grip of madness and darkness, like the time we're in. Yet, who's going to come forth now?Not a MTV star,nor an \\"American Idol.\\"It will take a merchant of war to stand apart from the status quo, even if it means abandoning \\"business ways.\\" Like the Man from Bethleham, Oskar avoided violence,(grew employees) to achieve a lasting legacy.No Jack Welch or business tycoon who pre-empts competition would understand this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Schindler's list","review":"I think that Schindler's list was hard to follow and understand. There were two many German words and too many different characters just there for one chapter and you didn't know who they were or what they were like. The names I couldn't pronounce but the least they could do is change the unimportant characters' names to how it would be pronounced. I think the overall story was too realistic for example it was using all the stuff that you would not even have heard of today only my grandmother would still use them that if she was from Germany (Which she isn't)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Content, Slow Beginning","review":"An excellent book, particularly if you have prior knowledge of the subject. The beginning of the book does start out slowly, however. It does pick up after about 125 pages. I know it's a lot, but its sooooo worth it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"We Must Never Forget What Happened","review":"This poignant book by Australian author Thomas Keneally, was originally published as Schindler's Ark and in which Spielberg based his move. Schindler is a bragging, boozing opportunist who makes a fortune in Poland during the second-world-war German occupation, buying up the businesses of dispossessed Jews. We read about his black market deals, his backslapping relationship with the authorities, his parties and his mistresses - and gradually discover that his lifestyle is a faade, that his true activity is saving thousands of Jews from the gas-chambers. A remarkable man and a testement that we should never forget the terror that the Jewish people were subjected to during world-war-two."},{"rating":"2","title":"A truly compelling story!!","review":"\\"Schindler's List\\" is about a heroic and brave man named Oskar Schindler. He was a German officer in WWII who saved 600,000 Jewish souls. Defying Hitler and every other German officer Oskar Schilinder saved millions. An innocent girl in a red coat triggered him to save these Jews by trading buying or even beating in a game of cards. He saved so many by gambling with their very lives. I thought that this was an amazing book that made you part of the story."},{"rating":"2","title":"Schindler was truly sent by God.","review":"One of the best novels I ever read on the Holocaust. One man really does make a difference. Without Schindler hundreds of Jewish prisoners would have been exterminated in the death camps. A fast, easy reading book with characters who are simply evil incarnate. Schindler was a saint and the world should never forget what he did during the war."},{"rating":"2","title":"Holocaust Savior","review":"The book details how a German industrialist, in the midst of World War II, becomes the salvation for hundreds of Jews. As the Jewish ghettos in Crackow are \\"liquidated\\", Oskar Schindler manages to keep his conscript Jewish workers safe from most German atrocities. When the plant is shut down, he gets approval to transfer his workers to a new plant in Moravia, saving them from Auschwitz. The book is more a documentary of survivor accounts than a novel. The story is told honestly and does not inflate the legend of Oskar, rather tells it in a matter of fact way. A wonderful story of humanity in the face of the Holocaust"},{"rating":"2","title":"an amazing record","review":"The book is amazing for its wealth of information and doggedness to tell the story of not only Oskar Schindler but of what life was like for the people interned in the factories and death camps. In the author's note, Keneally tells that he chose to write the story as a novel but used documentary evidence and extensive interviews for most of the exchanges and conversations and all of the events detailed in the book and made reasonable constructs of conversations where only the briefest record exists. As a novel, the storytelling is lacking--it doesn't flow well or have a strong narrative--but as a record of a truth, it is astounding."},{"rating":"2","title":"For everyone, not just car enthusiasts!","review":"I have absolutely NO interest in car repairs, but a friend of mine turned me on to this show, and I haven't laughed so hard in a long while. These brothers are crazy!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Robotrash","review":"Everything about this movie is a monstrosity. The only thing that would even be considered as descent is the story line. How does a machine/human have the ability to cry? Unless there's an evolution in his organic parts that allow him to have human fluids, there is no sense at all. Then in the past, Alex Murphy looks like he's in his 60s, wasn't he about 40 when he transfered in Detroit in Robocop? I rather watch Robocop 3 which they also screwed up on. The only true Robocop is Peter Weller w/ Paul Verhoeven and Irvin Kershner as the directors. ALL OTHERS SUCK!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Please don't bother!","review":"You don't need to see this even if it's free! All the Robos after part 1 and 2 is a waste of film."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mike Kinsella does it Again","review":"Mike Kinsella has been making waves since the days of drumming for Joan of Arc with brother Tim, but since forging out on his own with projects such as Owls and American Football, one would have high standards for Kinsella's new solo project Owen. The definition of this solo recorded CD takes on a new meaning, here it means that Kinsella wrote and played the music for every instrument, and also recorded and produced the entire CD by himself. Songs that rank the highest among the CD include 'Dead Men Don't Lie', or the two part song (which he does a few times on this album) 'Places to Go' leading into 'Think About It'. Although many critics are claiming Owen to be what American Football would sound like today had they not disbanded, yet Owen's sound is not as jazz-orientated as American Football, and therefore truley takes on a sound of its own. If you're looking for melodic acoustic guitaring and melancholy, sweet sounding singing, look no further than Owen."},{"rating":"2","title":"simply amazing","review":"i've been listening to mike kinsella's music for quite a while now, and i must say that this album is incredible. i definetely think that mike kinsella belongs behind the microphone, and not behind a drum kit, although he does a great job there too. i was really bummed when american football split, but i feel a lot better now!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring...","review":"Having listened to bit of this CD here and there before owning it, the music sounded perfect. Soft, whispering vocals, Mike picking his acoustic guitar. Sadly, however, the album is a disappointment. There are some very nice, beautiful moments; however the songs don't hold up after repeated listens. While I love this style of music, Owen can be boring. The music is very repetitive, lacking changes, both tonally and rhythmically. Nick Drake's \\"Pink Moon\\" or Mark Kozelek's \\"What's Next to the Moon\\" are more powerful examples of Owen-esque music. Owen feels like another example of (members of) a rock band experimenting with a quieter side (Promise Ring = Vermont, Get Up Kids = New Amsterdams) that, though there are good intentions, just doesn't work as well as it could."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of paper","review":"You will find better wisdom in a fortune cookie. This book is a waste of paper. Most of the pages contain one little saying that is only about 20-40 words. I am not joking. On one page it just says \\"What is the Tao? The Tao is.\\" So if you want to pretend to be all full of wisdom and never talk like a normal person get this book. If you want to learn some practical wisdom you should instead talk to a old person that has some real wisdom on life."},{"rating":"1","title":"Non locking cap","review":"I brought this for a dodge ram 1500 for which it was recommended but the dumb thing will not lock.

Keeps the tender areas well lubricated to cut down on chaffing. It washes off the hands easily after applying.

When we do a century ride, we're still covered."},{"rating":"2","title":"What a difference","review":"Highly recommended for those long bike rides.

After about 10 months of this I developed a sore spot from chafing about the size of a quarter on my butt. I found this stuff in a bicycle shop, marketed to bicyclists with a similar problem. Now I smear it on my butt before every workout, and it has worked both as a cure and a preventive measure. I missed nary a workout while my skin healed itself, thanks to Chamois Butt'r. Excellent product. Expensive, but worth every penny."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cheaper and less greasy than Glide Stick","review":"I'm a runner, and I have been using Glide Stick for years. Glide Stick is very expensive, and I used a lot of it. I decided to try Chamois Butt'r as a cheaper alternative. I have been using it for about three weeks, and it works great! The longest run I've gone while using it is 7 miles, no chafing! It's a lot cheaper and less greasy than Glide Stick. I highly recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Comfort at last","review":"While I can get by without it on short rides, it certainly has made the difference on +50 mile outings.

The transmitter works ok as long as the PSP is disconnected from the power and there aren't too many competing stations close by. Apparently there isn't enough shielding material between the power and the FM antenna, when the PSP is plugged to both a high pitch whine can be heard at all times over the three selectable frequencies. Even when the power is disconnected there is a very low hum in the background, but at least this one can be ignored.Also watch for similar products combining power and transmitter from the other companies as they may be the same rebranded product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good product...sometimes","review":"This item is used to transmit the sound from your PSP over a car radio. It works pretty well and gives you the option of charging the PSP at the same time. I find mine very very useful. When my first broke in a car accident i instantly bought a second one...And since the speaker on my PSP broke i really had no choice.HOWEVERPlease note that this product does have a key design flaw on some models. When you are transmitting the sound over the radio AND charging the PSP at the same time it creates a huge amount of background static.....another reviewer mentioned this as well. My first one did this but my second one did not. However i bought one for my friend and his needed to be returned. so just be aware of the possibilty that you may need to return your unit if it has this problem."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Rich Experience","review":"If we must rate guitarists no one before or since is as good.

The tabs are designed to hold down the pump handle when it is not being used to pressurize the tank, but the tank pressure puts pressure on the tabs and they break off easily.

Not since AC/DC has a group been able to churn out the same song 12 times on an album, and the same album over and over. Many of the bands influenced by Sevendust are great, and they have a few gems here and there, but ultimately, it's like Mexican food and Linkin Park.

Childish lyrics sung by an awful voice combined with barely mediocre instrumentals make this album a waste of time and money. Though it can be good for a luagh every so often.

It is now one of my favorites. Whether belting out gripping choruses with subtle, energizing chord changes and harmonizations, or playing the same thing more softly to display the intricacies, sevendust will make you want to scream, jump, punch, and kick as though you were there in the pit.

They tune way down, but sound like no other act out there. This is largely due to the impressive soulful vocals of Lajon Witherspoon. On \\"Black,\\" he screams \\"I ain't doin' nothin' wrong\\" with authority. Just as impressive is his performance on the crooning to bludgeoning \\"Prayer.\\" The rest of the guys are no slouches either. Guitarists John Connolly and Clint Lowery drop bombs on slammin' tracks, like \\"Too Close To Hate\\" and the AIC meets Pantera of \\"My Ruin.\\" Everyone else out there that thinks they're heavy better be taking notes. Sevendust are here to stay."},{"rating":"2","title":"this is a bad MFer!","review":"this cd is bad.

Similarly, there are references to ingredients not previously mentioned and inane instructions like refrigerating fresh fish for a MAXIMUM of one hour.Overall, it feels like the book was rushed to market and/or published by cookbook neophites.

Fear Factory's Burton Bell brings a modern feel to the music and does a good job interpreting Geezer's lyrics. Pedro Howse and Deen Castronovo also mix well in this band and do their parts to bring the music up to par. I bought this album back in 1995 and I still enjoy listening to it today.

First off, Howard Shore's orchestral scores are more than worth hearing and capture the depressed feel of the film, but the remix of \\"Closer\\" by Nine Inch Nails (which played during the opening credits) and David Bowie's \\"The Heart's Filthy Lesson\\" (which played during the closing credits) are not present here, which is very disheartening. Gravity Kills' one time hit \\"Guilty\\" is here, but other than that there isn't anything else worth hearing. If your a fan of the film and love the two songs I listed above, this is what to do. For the remix of \\"Closer\\" is available on the \\"Closer to God\\" CD single, and Bowie's song can be found on his \\"Outside\\" album.

It is not a mystery nor a historical memoir of this period in her life.However it records the people in the expedition, the workers, their way of life,philosophy etc. It is difficult to imagine Agatha living in primitve rat-infested tents when you think about all of her stately homes in the UK. However she admits this period of her life exploring with Max the remains of thousands of years of relics one of her happiest.

Beside those moments, I put aside all else to read this book. David Sedaris's whimsical look at his own quirky life draws you into his world. I've gained a few good one liners from this book that I try to work into conversation as frequently as possible, like \\"I know cats who way more than his IQ\\" or \\"her rear is so large you could land a chopper on it\\". Nothing vulgar or offensive; just a joyous look at life through David Sedaris's eyes. Enjoy."},{"rating":"2","title":"I Snarfed","review":"At first I was wary of a book containing the chapter heading \\"Jesus Shaves,\\" but I loved it-- especially that story, in which Sedaris takes a French as a Second Language class in Paris, and the students use their fractured French to try to explain Easter to a fellow student. I did snarf while reading that chapter. On a plane. It was gross.His best writing comes when he is describing life with those he loves-- his parents, his sister, his boyfriend. It is that hint of, uh, domesticity which allows most of us a connection to his life, enough at least to laugh at what would be funny if we were there, too.We just couldn't tell the story as well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Erratic","review":"Although I found moments in Sedaris' book laugh-out-loud funny and appreciated some of his more trenchant observations, I felt the book lost its momentum halfway through.

I loved his stories. It was easy to follow, since each section was its own story, so you wouldn't have to have listened to one story for the other to make sense, yet it all flowed nicely. It was one of those books that I was actually really sad when it ended and almost wanted to read it again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun, Fun, Fun","review":"Sedaris makes me laugh out loud with stories you have to share with anyone who will listen. I've read all of his books (except Hercules) and this one and Naked are hilarious!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Get the audio","review":"I got this book after hearing Sedaris on 'This American Life.' I would laugh out loud at the radio. Sedaris delivers his sarcasm in such a way that reading it one might miss it. However, I still enjoyed the book, perhaps because I could hear his voice in my head.Sedaris shows how a simple story can be turned into a beautiful form as he explores the tiny moments many of us just ignore in search of excitement. He takes a reader from absurdly silly to poignantly melancholy.Dry sarcasm is his main staple. If you don't like your humor as dry as a three-day-old martini this isn't for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Laughed Out Loud - In Public","review":"I read this on two plane rides to a conference and could not help but to laugh out loud. I'm sure the other passengers thought I was absolutely nuts. I didn't care.Sedaris' style is easy and funny to read, but harder to explain. If you haven't read some of the stories, it's extremely difficult to relay them in any decent manner. Though too many to point out here - two that spring to mind are the ones having to do w/his sister Amy (on the Chicago L and at a photo shoot) and the explanation of Easter during a French class.It's a quicker read that will make you smile (and laugh out loud) the entire way through."},{"rating":"2","title":"I hated the Rooster","review":"With so many people glorifying the chapter in this book about Sedaris' brother, nicknamed The Rooster, I had to add my own opinion. I hated that chapter. I found his protrayal of his brother annoying, offensive, and totally unlikeable. By saying this, I am not saying I didn't enjoy the book. I did. Sedaris is a very funny writer, though I more enjoy hearing him read his essays on the radio. But please, no more praise for the profanity spewing Rooster, who comes across as nothing more than a ignorant jerk."},{"rating":"2","title":"HILARIOUS!","review":"I adored this book! Had fallen in love with his now deceased mother from his first book \\"Naked\\". At one point I had to put the book down to wipe my eyes and control my laughter.Picked it up and started laughing all over again. With all the hilarity there is a poignant under tone that makes one sometimes feel his puzzled alienation."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"After a 3 year wait since Naked, it's a bit of a letdown that this book is made largely of material that has been printed elsewhere. After being such a fan I suppose it's my own fault for having sought out his various articles in anticipation of a new book. But so much recycled material is disappointing, better for a paperback perhaps. There are some very good laughs and expected Sedaris worldview, but the tone is disjointed, rushed- it's magazine writing on deadline basically. Descriptions of life in Paris and 22 -city book tours (like a rock star) are also not likely to appeal to readers who enjoyed his hilarious depictions of life in the working classes. He seems to be above it all, moved on from crude America, and the work is far less engaging for it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not As Good As Naked","review":"I would have given his book \\"Naked\\" four stars, because the stories were well written and funny. This collection, however, left a lot to be desired. Attempts to attain a level of profundity fell far short, and I think the author realized this because he threw in a fart joke (or something of the like) every time in a shameless attempt to distract the reader from the mediocrity. It is a tragedy that many good writers have to self publish their work and struggle to get it read by a handful of people while works like this win awards. I give it two stars because of the story of the American in France who listens to a group of people talk about him in French while he sits and understands every word. That scene was handled with grace...then came the fart joke."},{"rating":"1","title":"Occasionally funny, but mostly boring","review":"I bought this book because of the many rave reviews even on the book cover itself. I was greatly disappointed. It is funny in places but mostly sad. It is the story of a mostly dysfunctional person and his family: his overbearing father, cigarette smoking and alcoholic mother, and talented but uninterested siblings. Some parts are just pathetic as when Sedaris uses drugs. My suggestion is to read a library copy first and then buy his books if you find them worth the money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Amusing and not so amusing","review":"The sales of this book are impressive. That is one criterion of book success. And considering the lugubrious books on various best seller lists, some comic relief might be in order. Does it make this reviewer laugh? Parts of it he finds amusing. Other parts,- to take the name of the Lord and to mix it with the vain language of the current time is a part of the book that was not amusing."},{"rating":"1","title":"me talk pretty someday","review":"This new collection of real-life accounts of the life and times of David Sedaris was an amazing bore. If there ever was an example of the Emperor's New Clothes, me talk pretty, tops the list, evidenced by the heights it has scaled on the best-seller list. Clearly a book need not have any true quality to achieve best-seller status but just clever marketing and previous reputation. Unlike the wacky but fascinating, self-depricating Naked, me talk pretty is a collection of stories one might over hear and tune out during a morning commute. If I were Mr.Sedaris, and thank goodness I am not, I'd be more than embarassed. In fact, me talk pretty is the kind of book that, in better circumstances, Sedaris himself would have used his sharp wit to make fun of."},{"rating":"2","title":"HILARIOUS. You'll read it at least once!","review":"A hard-to-put-down hilarious book. I've read it a few times. A fun book to pass around groups, and then talk about favorite parts."},{"rating":"2","title":"Funny","review":"I read this book based on the recommendation of a friend and enjoyed it tremendously. What an admirable trait it is to be able to laugh at one's self. Sedaris even managed to shed some worldly insight with this autobiographical piece. Very well written and funny. I particularly enjoyed his experience with the Americans and the train ride in Paris. I had a similar experience and reading about it was brought back great memories and laughter. This is my first read by Sedaris but I'm sure it won't be the last. Relax and enjoy it."},{"rating":"2","title":"I was sorry when it ended.","review":"After finishing David Sedaris' latest, I found myself missing him in the same way tend to miss Holden Caufield. A true and funny friend gone away. Like most most gay guys I find Sedaris endlessly endearing while endless annoying. I wish he would write a novel but he's probably too lazy. A wonderful read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Meh","review":"Yes, this book is undeniably funny. However, it's the literary equivalent of Doritos (ie: Pretty good, but lacking substance. And too much will make you feel vaguely ill.) Borrow it and bust a gut laughing for an afternoon. But don't spend your own money on it, because the vignettes become increasingly less humorous with successive re-readings."},{"rating":"1","title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"I really did not like this book. As a matter of fact, I couldn't finish reading it. I tried more than once, thinking I would begin to enjoy it but I just couldn't read it to the end. Sorry for the poor report. It certainly was not my cup of tea."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bitterness is funny?","review":"I received this book and, given all the positive publicity, was anxious and excited to read it. However, I put it down after struggling through half of it, vowing not to finish it. Why? Because hidden beneath Sedaris' sarcastic, cynical approach to humor appears to be a bitterness against people, the world - life in general. Sure, if you like laughing at others, I suppose you would enjoy this book. He reminds me of a cynical, sarcastic Woody Allen. Using humor to basically say \\"See how smart I am? I'm making fun of YOU, the AVERAGE person, and you don't even know it!\\". Bitterness is not funny - it's just plain ugly."},{"rating":"1","title":"Huge disappointment. This book is awful.","review":"I was disappointed and embarassed. I had given this book as a Christmas present last year to a member of my family because I read so many glowing reviews about it being funny and that the author is a modern-day Mark Twain. But I hadn't yet read it. Yesterday I saw it in the airport bookstore and bought my own copy, anticipating a fun read for the next seven hours. It wasn't fun and it isn't funny. It's like eating chewing gum off the sidewalk -- something novel, but not something you want to have inside your body. I'm embarassed that I gave it as a gift and I am writing an apology letter; they must think I regard them as boorish, gross, and unfunnily sarcastic people. Don't waste your time."},{"rating":"1","title":"gross doesn't equal funny","review":"This book has been described as acerbic, witty, and funny. I beg to differ. While parts of the book certainly live up to this billing, almost every anecdote is marred by something jarringly crude or gross. Perhaps is helps make the point? But it really ruined the book for me. For example the image of a nude man being painfully stomped by a woman(?) in spike heals is about as funny as school shootings or people being dragged to death."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very depressing book","review":"There was nothing to laugh about in this book. The author made it clear he had a terrible life, that he hated everything and everyone, and that he has felt unloved throughout his life. I found the book to be depressing, irritating and frustrating."},{"rating":"1","title":"yadda yadda yadda","review":"Sedaris is going to crash and burn when he runs out of the same repetitive boring simpleton (enough adjectives?) stories about his inane family and romps in the world. This book should be called Barrel Fever 2 or Naked 2 - the sequel. I'm going to hurl if I read about Amy Sedaris' shenanegans and the simple humor that the world has embraced. You're better off watching the Brady Bunch for the same kind of knee-slapping humor. Yawn."},{"rating":"1","title":"A good example of how not to write a story","review":"I heard an interview with David Sedaris' sister. She talked a lot about David and this book. It sounded great, so I picked it up that day. I anticipated a raw and witty story revealing the oddness of family life. However, what I got was a rant.I can accept that it is not a novel, but a bunch of random thoughts. Still, I like to be compelled to at least read the next word. But, I found my self predicting the next line and trudging through the pages.Whatever happened to character building? Who cares about these people? Lots of us have stories like these tucked away in our families (what not you?). Anyway, my point is that David Sedaris attempts ONLY to talk pretty. I can just picture him throwing words together and then sitting back with a grin saying, \\"Oh yeah, I'm a laugh riot.\\"Don't waste your precious time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not so much","review":"Dont see what the big deal is. This guy is only moderately funny at best. There were two chapters that even elicited a chuckle. His sister Amy is much funnier. Dont waste your time with David."},{"rating":"1","title":"just an ok book","review":"Well, for me it wasn't funny at all( maybe because I'm from a foreing country and I don't get American humor all the time) and most of the topics are basic and some of the stories a little annoying. Just an OK book!."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't live up to the hype","review":"After all the amazing reviews I heard about this book, I maybe laughed out loud twice. I didn't find anything cutting edge about his humor, it was predictable and often downright boring."},{"rating":"2","title":"too funny","review":"I was on a train from Paris to the South of France while reading this book. I laughed like like a lunatic, tears streaming down my cheeks. He is so right on in his observations about the french laguage and culture. I love it!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"One hell of a book","review":"Wow, this book was really funny! I start laughing in a public place and peaple look at me strange. I've never had a book this funny before. I've lent it to about 9 friends."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I have read a few of David Sedaris' other books and thought they were simply hysterical. However, \\"Me Talk Pretty One Day\\" is not like those other books. Although some lines were worthy of a small smile, I thought the book failed to entertain. Overall, I was disappointed with the purchase. Next time, I will just borrow the book from a friend before I waste more of my money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Different","review":"This is not a typical read for me. I'm reading this for my book club. I'm 30% thru don't know if I make the end. This book was a read for my book club. Think it should be a mans read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Funny, Classic Sedaris Sense of Humor","review":"This is the second David Sedaris book I've read, afterNaked. Like that book, this one is full of classic Sedaris stories - funny, touching, and always self-deprecating. We follow Sedaris through all types of adventures - how does he get himself into these situations? Overall, a great beach read for anyone looking for a light and fun read.For Sedaris fans, I highly recommend Wade Rouse'sIt's All Relative: Two Families, Three Dogs, 34 Holidays, and 50 Boxes of Wine (A Memoir). The similarities in their writing are many, as both are unabashedly gay humorists / memoirists."},{"rating":"1","title":"scratched","review":"This was the first time I have ever bought a book on CD. I usually just check them out from the library. The CD's look brand new but the story skips quite a bit. I will not buy a book on CD again. I will buy the regular book because I heard the book itself was fantastic."},{"rating":"1","title":"Let down","review":"The first chapters were hilarious! The book quickly became annoying after that... The author teeters between self pity and self indulgence to the point where it's just sickening. I found myself reading more in hopes that it would pick up and become cute and funny again like the beginning of the book was... But I'm over half way through now and I'm bored and have no interest in finishing it. I'm disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day - Audio Version","review":"I was laughing out loud as I listened to the audio version of Me Talk Pretty One Day. Mr. Sedaris' narration adds a vital dimension to this wry, insightful, sarcastic set of stories. I particularly loved hearing his Billie Holliday impression in the story about his guitar lessons. His direct translations of dialogue from French into English were also truly entertaining. I highly recommend this book on tape, especially for any long road-trips. Just remember to pull off the road if you start laughing too much."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very funn","review":"2 coworkers recommended this book to me. and i just passed it to another coworker after finishing it. This man is hysterical. I read this book every day on the train and laughed out loud. I've never laughed from reading before. People looked at me funny lol. I loved it and getting more books by him. He talks about everything from growing up with his crazy family, to having funny pet stories, to school experiences, riding the subway, and of course a turd story."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great!","review":"I discovered this book over someone's shoulder on the subway, and after just a few pages I knew I had to buy it. It's clever and witty, but there's enough substance to each anecdote that you don't suffocate from laughter."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh, What a Rotten Excuse for a Book","review":"The public was duped into thinking that this would be a book that someone would like to read. NOT SO! Yes, it was on the best-seller list, so we bought it. Bad idea. Two people in our household attempted to understand this tripe without success. The book is now resting where it belongs--in the recycle pile headed to the county dump. The number 1 rating is much too high."},{"rating":"1","title":"bad sense of humor?","review":"It's simply a long-haul airplane book. I quite did not understand the eulogies from other readers."},{"rating":"1","title":"When will it end?","review":"I found this book a struggle to get through. It had nothing substantial in it to hold one's interest. I wish I had been warned before commiting myself to reading it. Torture......Boring......I'm glad its over.......Never Again!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the paper its printed on.","review":"Based on the reviews of this book, and reviews I have read on other books recommending this particular book, I was really expecting it to be incredibly funny. There wasn't a single thing I found funny in this book. Not even a chuckle. I kept reading expecting for it to possibly pick up, after 100+ pages I realized no such luck. I began to just skim the book, because after all I paid for it. This book had NO point at all. It just sort of rambled on about nothing. Sedaris is SO not funny. The writing is flat. I would not recommend this book to anyone and if I could give it 0 stars, I would. Its not worth the paper its printed on. I am still annoyed I spent money on this, everyone that bought it deserves a refund."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too expensive in Kindle edition","review":"I was ready to buy this until I saw that the Kindle edition was $9.99 while the paperback copy was $8.02. No sale."},{"rating":"1","title":"just okay","review":"Too sarcastic for me! Hearing him read it was worse. He does sound like a little whimpy girl. Some parts were hillarious, but overall I didn't like it and wouldn't recommend it as a book club discussion book, or for the squeamish."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why Did I Buy This?","review":"I'm a fairly tolerant reader, but I threw this book into the trash after finishing 2/3rds. Truly awful--sophomoric, dull, and pretentious...My book club selected it based on one member's recommendation--the others hated it so much that we only talked about the book for three minutes--that was as long as we could be polite."},{"rating":"1","title":"Incredibly overrated...","review":"I had this recommended to me as laugh out loud funny. However I only got a few smiles throughout. It just wasn't that funny. The stories had a lot of potential, but the writing wasn't that good, and didn't make the most of potentially funny material. Skip this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"a wonderful read!","review":"I've read all of Sedaris's books now, and this is by far his best effort to date! Well worth the money!"},{"rating":"2","title":"2 small books in one wrapper","review":"I love David Sedaris's writing and performances, So I couldn't wait to read this book. And I wasn't disappointed -- it's laugh-out-loud funny. But I *was* puzzled. The first half and the second half are two entirely different books. I found myself wondering if Sedaris had simply glued together two unrelated pieces so he could make deadline, or capitalize on his success, or just get the book done already. Hmmm. Well, both halves are fun and funny, so the book as a whole is a good read. But I wish Sedaris had taken his time and fleshed out both essays so we could have two books instead of one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pure Pleasure","review":"Me Talk Pretty One Day is David Sedaris' very funny look at himself through both his family and his time in France. The good news that his sister's comedy, Strangers with Candy, is coming out on DVD made me pick this book up again and remember all over what a truly Talented Family this is (and Amy's appearances in David's essays are amongst the funniest sections, outside of the David learning French, of course). These essays seem fresh on second and third helpings. Since the first time I read this I have finally heard many of them on NPR and now can read them with the author's rather distinctive voice in my head. Now my brain is, sadly, changing all commerical jingles into rather nasally, high-pitched Billie Holliday-emoting songs. That may not be a blessing but this book is and will always be."},{"rating":"1","title":"Proves that anyone can write a book these days!","review":"Sedaris is a talented writer; he has good sentence structure and uses creative analogies to bring across his humor. Although I am impressed by his ability to be funny in writing, I wasn't at all tempted to laugh out loud (as other review writer have said). It's not THAT funny.What I find disappointing about the book is not the writing itself, but the writer and the content. His life is not all that different from the average American. Yes, his experiences in France are beyond that of what most of us accomplish in our lives, but then just write about France and leave out the whole childhood bit; it's no more interesting than anyone else's."},{"rating":"1","title":"Uhh, why the hype?","review":"This is a compilation of about 200 Andy Rooney-esque 60 Minutes essays, just that Andy Rooney is funnier and more interesting.There is no story here, just the author ranting and raving about his life, which to me, doesn't make a book interesting or enjoyable. I didn't know this book would be like this going into it.I can complain about my own life. Why should we care about Sedarris complaining about his? Amusing, but once you are done, it will leave you mind forever.Everyone else loved it, just not me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unless you enjoy essays....don't read this","review":"The book is compromised of a series of essays about his life but I didn't think David Sedaris got his point across in this book. Or if he did, it flew right over my head. The stories were cute and funny but not at all moving like I was told they would be. A book that would be enjoyed by those that enjoy a book filled with short stories/essays."},{"rating":"1","title":"So Not Funny","review":"I ordered this book, as well as \\"Naked\\" because they were recommended for people who enjoyed David Egger's \\"Heartbreaking work of Staggering Genius.\\" I am not sure who decides on those recommendations, but boy were they wrong. I was unable to finish either Sedaris book, as they were boring, bland and just plain unfunny. Egger's book was introspective, fresh, and drew the reader in and made you care about what happened next, not to mention hilariously funny at times. Both of Sedaris' books do little to make you interested in the characters at all and the humor they try to employ wasn't funny when the same jokes were made ten times before Sedaris made them. If you enjoy comedy like recent years of SNL, then maybe you'll like this book. But if you find that kind of humor boring and redundant, then don't waste your money (like I did)."},{"rating":"1","title":"I must be missing something...","review":"My book club chose this book for our upcoming selection. A friend in the club and I have come to the same conclusion: we cannot finish this book. We have both read chapter after chapter, waiting for the book to be other than mildly amusing and somewhat boring, but we never got to any part that hooked us into the book. The author seems to think he is hilarious, in a rather self-consious manner, and his whole tone seems to proclaim, \\"aren't I just so clever\\"; apparently many people agree with him. I seemed to miss everyone's boat here, because I found the book so boring that I could not go on anymore."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I had hoped for","review":"Firstly, let me state that I did NOT finish this book. The reason being is that after reading all the hype surrounding this book, I had high expectations of the humour and writing.....and after trying to read around 4-5 chapters, I found myself not agreeing with the hype. Maybe if all the chapters had flowed as one continuous story it may have held my attention more. I just couldn't get into the whole story despite desperately wanting to enjoy this. And I didn't find it as funny as everyone else had spoken about, so this compounded my exasperation with this book. Maybe I will come back to it another time, when really desperate."},{"rating":"2","title":"I Couln't Stop Laughing!","review":"Buy this book. David Sadaris is incredible! This book is really a collection of anecdotes written by a man who is tentaively going to say what he thinks. And he does so in such a hilarious way that you will quake with laughter. The best part of the book is when he talks about his experiences in Paris. It is really funny. And Sadaris has the uncanny ability to make you feel what he is going through. Another highlight of this book is that he gives a totally new view of things. He attackscomputers and modern life. But in a way that we can all understand with total sympathy. This is really a great book. Buy it as soon as possible and enjoy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not my Style","review":"This just isn't my preferred reading. I read alot of genres this just doesn't float my boat. I couldn't get past chapter 4. I never put down books always finish, however, this would have been pointless to finish as there was no ending."},{"rating":"1","title":"Me Disappointed","review":"As someone who experienced big belly laughs with Naked and Barrel Fever, I anxiously awaited the release of MTPOD.Outrageously insane insights and POV. Interesting characters. The problem with MTPOD...the stories are simply not that funny. A handful of laughs, one or two chuckles.My recommendation...reread Naked."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Hilarious, laugh-out-loud book","review":"I listened to this book on tape, read by the author. I really enjoyed his humor. Sedaris makes observations about his life and laughs at himself and his family. He doesn't take anything too seriously and is usually the subject of his own jokes.It was a treat listening to him, because he does accents and imitations quite well, but I think this book would be just as funny if I had read it.A good portion of the book focuses on his time in France. His tales of trying to learn and speak French are too funny.It is hard to explain why this book is so funny, but it definitely is."},{"rating":"2","title":"Non stop laughter","review":"Really rare to read a book where you are constantly giggling out loud. I would read this book in public and draw stares because I couldnt stop myself from laughing out loud. Sedaris has an incredible Oscar Wilde wit only matched by his insight into the hilarity of our everyday lives. It is a fast read( in fact, I had to force myself to stop reading it, so I wouldnt finish it too quickly), and worth it! I am going to go back and read his other books now.."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bubble gum for the brain - just what I wanted","review":"I can't remember laughing outloud so much while reading. Proves that truth is funnier than fiction. Sedaris has a unique ability to poke fun at himself and his family, and it was fun going on this ride with him. This was a selection in a book club I'm in, and all of us got a kick out of it. Favorite chapter - The Rooster - totally killing me!"},{"rating":"1","title":"is there an option for ZERO stars??","review":"Horrid just about covers it - not funny, very much a waste of time. I think the title is a good clue as to the content - complete drivel. I've given a couple of his other books a glance - everyone deserves a second chance, no? Unfortunately I have found the others similarly disappointing. His little stitched-together anecdotes are weak attempts at humor that don't come off funny and only make him seem more pathetic in the telling."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing On Several Counts","review":"I bought this book because I wanted to get an overview of contemporary Paris and the title came up when I searched for something on that subject. Reading this to learn about Paris is like reading War and Peace to learn about military uniforms. There isn't much and what there is is trivial at best. Beyond that, Sedaris is a Dave Barry wannabe with anecdotes that may stimulate laughter in conversation but usually \\"clunk\\" in writing. His chapter about his brother \\"Rooster\\" who has a twenty word vocabulary, almost entirely profane, is painful, even to this six year army veteran from a \\"line\\" company."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why? Why? Why bother reading another book by this author?","review":"This book isn't funny. Talking about taking drugs, your horrible careers, dead pets and making fun of children is not funny.The writing is not very juicy either. Any one of you reading this could write a better book.The good part is, the writer seemed to have trouble meeting the minimal word limit so the reader can finish reading the book rather quickly because there is not much to it.The reviews on the cover must be for marketing purposes. If you really are curious about reading it, barrow the book from a friend or buy it when it gets to the Dollar Store.It's horrible!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Is he always this weird?","review":"This is the first book I've read from David Sedaris. Sedaris tells some interesting stories, but be warned that they are all a little weird for a small town girl. His family seems to enjoy making each other crazy and/or grossing each other out far too much. Some of his essays are enjoyable reads, but the chapter on his brother was made up entirely up the 'f' word in all it's gloified variations. This is good writing? And, by the way, while some of Me Talk Pretty is good, none of it is laugh-out-loud funny as the jacket describes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overrated, thank you","review":"Sorry, but I had high hopes after reading all the positive reviews for this book. My boyfriend and I bought the audio and played it on a recent trip. I remember giggling once, sort of. What's the deal -- hilarious? What am I missing? It's not that it was horrible, it's just that it was flat -- purported to be funny, but to me a real disappointment. Maybe it picked up after the first two tapes, but we couldn't sit through any more than that."},{"rating":"1","title":"Well Marketed, but Poorly Written","review":"You may like Sedaris only if you watch network television sitcoms religiously.Needless to say---------This book is a complete waste of money.The myopic and tired humor is great only for a specific audience, the male homosexual drug having lived in France. If you fit this demographpic, perhaps you will feel some bonding that may get you through the bad writing, though it may still be a battle.There is not a shred of true wit in this book. It is simply cheap poor lifts from the Hunter Thomas genre and perhaps preening gay dialogue found in a gay TV sitcoms( if they existed.)This book simply does not appeal to a general readership. Literacy seems to have not yet reached bottom yet in the United States.A total waste of time.I hope your bookstore will allow you to exchange the book so you do not take the hit from paid promoters here and from the advertising/marketing machine."},{"rating":"1","title":"highly overrated","review":"I admit that some chapters of this book made me laugh,...BR>In this book, he simply describes openly all the disgustingdetails which probably anybody can find in his life if he/shesearches hard enough.Disgusting details of certain events with peoplewho keep animals do not suddenly become less disgusting justbecause you describe them in writing.Foul language like the author's brother seems to speak it(Sedaris quotes him at length and with delight) does not becomemore fit to print by actually printing it.The fact that this book is so popular in the US is somewhatfrightening. ...Does entertainment have tobe either violent or vulgar or both in order to sell on theUS market?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Depressing and Offensive","review":"I know Sedaris from his work at NPR. On radio he can be funny, but reading about his empty and sad life was depressing.Sedaris'claim that meth harms no one was offensive and flat out wrong. Meth has absolutely devastated many individuals, families, and small towns in the Western USA. Meth labs are also an environmental disaster with toxic chemicals being dumped into landfills all over the West."},{"rating":"2","title":"A brilliant display of talent","review":"David Sedaris is indeed a force to reckon with in this literary genre...short story or whatever it is. He knows how to hold you in the story as he twists and turns and punishes you with a gut wrenching laugh that is painful and sweet all at once. I guess it is that rare talent that comes with left-handed people and the queer types."},{"rating":"2","title":"Don't judge a book by its cover!","review":"This lay around my house in college and I assumed, from the cover and the title, that it was some textbook for my roommate's special education coursework. I had no interest in it as a result. How wrong I was! I read the first chapter and it was so hilarious that I stole the book from her to finish in as few sittings as possible.Sedaris has a unique talent for taking the mundane, the average, even the tragic and twisting it up in his special way to make the reader laugh out loud. I've given this book as a gift to many people, and they all have loved it and looked into Sedaris's other works."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"A quiet, sneaky sort of humor...an easy read\\"","review":"Many will know Sedaris from his hilarious autobiographical commentaries on NPR, especially during his time spent living in Paris. His books are equally funny with such a quiet, sneaky sort of humor and self-referential sarcasm that you can't help but like the guy. From his childhood lisp to being an American in Paris, the anecdotes of his life will literally have you in stitches. One of the funniest people alive. An easy read presented in episodes, good for traveling or the beach."},{"rating":"1","title":"wanted to love it, but its not for me","review":"The series of short stories left me never truly invested in the main character (which i understand is the author). I heard so many great things, and while I found myself laughing out loud on a few occasions, I think it was overhyped before I even read it, so my expectations were most likely unrealistic. He is a great writer, using interesting examples to illustrate this stories, but because I never felt invested in the character, I struggled to have any reason to keep reading. If any of his other books are not written in short story format i'd like to give that a try."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing compared to \\"Naked\\"","review":"With his latest book I got the distinct impression that David Sedaris had run out of amusing episodes in his own past to write about other than a few things that were clearly from the bottom of the barrel. So a lot of the book is written about experiences he has had since becoming a well known writer and there is a \\"gosh aren't I unique in my way of life and attitude\\" aspect to these that just isn't endearing in the way that his self view from Naked and Barrel Fever were. A good part of the attempted humor is his restructuring into English of conversations he and others had in the process of learning French. Funny for the first paragraph, but gets old quickly because it is such a blatantly manipulative humorous device.Coming to this book alone I would have given it 3 stars, but having enjoyed Naked and Barrel Fever so much, points off for disappointment in light of high expectations. . ."},{"rating":"2","title":"Laugh out loud hilarious","review":"Me Talk Pretty One Day is one-third amusing, one-third funny and one third absolutely laugh out loud hilarious. Whether retelling a story about his cussing brother, his experience with a speech therapist or a class of non-native speakers of French trying to explain Easter to a classmate, David Sedaris knows exactly what to focus on to hit a person right in the funny bone. Although two of his previous novels, Barrel Fever and Dress Your Family in Corduroy and Denim, contain stories with similar themes, they are not nearly as funny, maybe due to their tendency toward more restricted/adult themes. Those who plan to give David Sedaris' humor a try should choose this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"He can write....","review":"I got \\"Me Talk Pretty One Day\\" after being bombarded by mainstream and gay press as this being the new wonder boy in story telling. I expected fiction but instead got Mr. Sedaris's life rehashed with little anecdotes and humor interjected in between. Most of the stories will make you chuckle here and there, some real writing talent, but they don't even begin to touch real stories that you'll remember and reflect upon. It's just like he's sitting in a coffee shop recalling stories from his life and throwing some humor in there. Kinda pulp I'd say. One important note though: If you've never heard David Sedaris talk you've got to find some NPR interviews or something. He has a high pitched, feminine voice, that at first had me thinking he was a 70 year old Billy Corgan. Once you've heard his voice it actually makes reading the stories much more entertaining; because you've got him narrating them in your head! Decent stories, great writing style, but not much thought in there."},{"rating":"2","title":"Why Isn't My Life This Exciting?","review":"Something must have been in the drinking water at the Sedaris' home some years ago. Although we all have family/life stories to share, most of ours are nothing like David's. His comic bathroom struggle to dispose of an un-claimed... out of fear that the next in line will believe it to be his, is hi-LAR-ious! I like the way that David views life."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hilarious!","review":"This guy is unbelievably funny. I have read some of these shorts 5 or 6 times and they keep getting funnier."},{"rating":"2","title":"Howlingly funny...just the thing to take to the dr.'s office","review":"I was first introduced to the writing of David Sedaris in a Literary Nonfiction class. The excerpt we read was the one from which the title of this book is taken, \\"Me Talk Pretty One Day.\\" I thought it was pretty funny and bought the book. Well, it is a lot funnier than that. The funniest parts of this book deal with his various looney family members, and Sedaris' deadpan style reminds me of Dave Barry with an edge. I took this book to read in the doctor's office while my husband had his colonoscopy and I think the people in the waiting room thought I was certifiable...Several times I had to wipe the tears from my eyes. Highly recommend this to anyone who is looking for a great comic read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Read this!","review":"Yes, yes, yes! By far my favorite of his books. It follows a clear path of his life and is generally a great read. If I ever want someone to read a David Sedaris book I start them here. It shows off his unique writing style and his wild stories perfectly. I had some issues with a few of his books being hard to follow because his stories constantly jump, but this one follows perfectly and is easy to follow. The stories are laugh out loud funny. Would recommend anyone read this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not really that funny...","review":"This book is really, honestly not as funny as the reviews make it sound. It an ok read, not boring by any means but definitely not great either... i was disappointed after the bookstore helper raved about it. just an fyi."},{"rating":"2","title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"Sedaris has compiled a bunch of wonderful essays. Some definitely aren't as funny as others, but I got a good laugh out of \\"Picka Pocketoni\\". By being able to laugh at himself Sedaris has made it easy for us to laugh at him. I enjoyed his style of writing very much. Although there is no real plot to the book each essay is its own interesting story.Even though I found this book very funny, it is easy to see that not every one would agree with me. I would definitely advise that you read the first chapter before you buy. The funny stories were great, but some you just read because they were there. I give this book four stars because it has good and not so good parts, and it would be easy to have a opposite opinion from me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Heelarious","review":"Buy it. Seriously. I don't read a lot of books, but this had me acting a fool as I laughed out loud to myself while turning the pages."},{"rating":"1","title":"I just don't get it - sorry","review":"Ok, to be fair, it really is a matter of just \\"I can't relate to this material\\". The book is written as a series of autobiographical stories are disjointed and largely interesting. I read the reviews about \\"laugh out loud\\" - I may have snickered in five places, but I didn't find anything that was worthy of laughing. All I kept thinking is that I have waaaay better material for this kind of a memoir; but really, maybe he's funny to some. Me...not so much."},{"rating":"2","title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"Its funny and not anything that I would expect. I found his storylines had many undertones and it was hilarious and heartbreaking at times. A wonderfully entertaining book based on David Sedaris' life."},{"rating":"2","title":"good book","review":"i bought this book years ago and i enjoyed the read so much that i decided to purchase it myself"},{"rating":"2","title":"funny","review":"FUNNY FUNNY FUNNY FUNNY FUNNY, I litterally laughed out loud uncontrollable, throughout the book. One the the BEST books I have ever read, and funniest. True stories of a wacky family. All his books are wonderful and hilarious. Get them all, this is my fav one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful starting point for Sedaris!","review":"After years of thinking of reading Sedaris, a friend strongly recommended this book to me, and I'm delighted he did. Sedaris had me laughing often, relating to his stories and characteristics. I read this book, and now I'm hooked!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This book is VERY GROOVY","review":"The book Me Talk Pretty One Day, by David Sedaris, is an absolutely hilarious book. The whole time that I read it, I laughed. This book is a collection of humorous essays by Sedaris, based on episodes of his lifetime, which he took upon himself to embellish and make funnier.My favorite parts of the book were his French speaking efforts. Teachers who hate him and would rather have a cesarean section than be with him and his problems learning the language make these sections funnier than most. Another good essay is \`The Fatty Suit,' in which his sister Amy wears a fat suit to make their father, who is obsessed with being in shape, upset.Need a good laugh? Read this book. It is roll on the floor laugh your bum off funny."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Good Laugh","review":"This book is hilarious. I love the way Sedaris' views the world. I couldn't figure out how he was able to afford all that he did (live in Paris, travel around everywhere) being a cleaning person and on drugs though. I don't recommend this to conservative people. His observations are Seinfeldish and a step beyond, making them even better than Seinfeld."},{"rating":"2","title":"Super funny","review":"I was introduced to David Sedaris by a friend who read aloud one of the stories in this book. I laughed so hard I almost peed in my pants. I immediately ordered the book and read it in a couple of days. The book is really funny, you'll find yourself laugh out loud all the time. Everything about his stories are great, he is honest about his less that completely normal life and family.Naturally some of the stories are better than others, some just get an occasional smile, but some will have your sides hurting. I'd recommend this book to anybody"},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty Just As You Are","review":"It's been a while, but David Sedaris' essay in this book about his inability to remember the difference between the masculine and feminine endings of French nouns still makes me chuckle from time to time. I highly recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"wonderful... read it at the gym","review":"this is a great book to read while working out. It will keep you laughing and unaware of the pain you may be in. I can't wait for David's next book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A fun, easy read","review":"My brother recommended this book. I took it on a flight from Atlanta to Barcelona and laughed out loud the whole way. If you enjoy intelligent humor you'll get a kick out of the stories in this book. Lots of fun."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the Funniest Books Around!","review":"This was my first Sedaris book. Needless to say, it won't be my last. While there were a few stories that left me searching for the punchline, the majority of them were hilarious! I haven't laughed this much since reading \\"Without Feathers\\" by Woody Allen. I also enjoyed the diversity of the stories presented; it wasn't uncommon for a story about social inequality to be followed by one rife with toilet humor. My advice--read this book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"It's Not Naked","review":"David had a brilliantly funny one with Naked, I laughed, I loved. But I was disappointed with Me Talk Pretty One Day, the reviews hyped it up to be this extraordinary passage of life abroad, but it took forever to get abroad. It was not as funny as Naked and I expected way too much."},{"rating":"1","title":"I don't get why everyone raves about him","review":"I must admit, while I found some of his stories interesting and things I could relate to, and very easy to read, I don't understand all of the raves about him - the funniest writer around, side-splittingly funny, etc. A friend who has read other things by him thought that it might just be an acquired taste, as she has found each of his works progressively funnier. Sorry, but I really didn't like reading it, kept waiting for it to be over, and would have put it down if I wasn't reading it for a book club. Just being honest."},{"rating":"1","title":"Recomended, but not sure why","review":"I am in a creative writing class taught by an author. She heard my short story and told me to pick up this book and read it to see how to link \\"events\\" and \\"stories\\". UGH. I am slogging through this book. The language is awful. I didn't laugh to myself or outloud. I didn't read anything in this other than stories from life. Why not just write a memoire?The events are not in chronilogical order. I did not find the stories about drug use funny. The sarcastic stories about his siblings came off as mean and disconnected. I feel obligated to finish this book because my writing teacher wanted me to read it, but I am so not looking forward to it. I wish I could ask my teacher to reimburse me the $10.00 I spent on the book for my kindle."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a boring disappointment!","review":"I was looking for a good laugh, and many reviews led me to believe that Sedaris would come through, but this book is a disaster. I got a minor chuckle at best, and a great put-me-to-sleep at worst. If you're hoping for humor, go elsewhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"I don't get it","review":"Maybe I'm missing something but this book isn't funny, in fact, it's unreadable. I heard so much about this author I had to read something from him, and I couldn't get past a few chapters. Maybe his sister, Amy, got all the humor genes in their family."},{"rating":"1","title":"Exceptionally unexceptional","review":"I found this book exceptionally unexceptional. The author's greatest talent seems to be at surrounding himself with interesting people who are themselves funny and noteworthy. It's a good, light read but nothing that hasn't been done (in fiction and non-fiction) for years by the likes of Woody Allen, Philip Roth, Henry Rollins..."},{"rating":"1","title":"where are the funny parts?","review":"I just bought this book as an e-book. I feel that I wasted my money and my time so far. I'm to page 53 and haven't found anything funny in the book yet. I'm not sure I'll be able to finish it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Should have been titled - \\"A bum's Life\\"","review":"I picked up this book after seeing David Sedaris on a late night talk show. He seemed hilarious, almost like a younger, bemused Woodie Allen type.While the book is well written, his views on life are very disappointing to me. In his previous professions/stages of life, he was a ne'er-do-well, a loafer, well, basically a bum. Many of his stories are made up of snide commentaries on others around him who were progressing through their lives. These folks were getting in the way of David's quest of just figuring out how to get the next hit of recreational drugs.He can become the poet laureaute for the younger generations whom life is never easy enough and can't put enough blame on those around them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not gripping, but a fun read","review":"I rather liked this book, though the humor wasn't consistent throughout. Several chapters were laugh out loud funny (for instance, the descriptions of David's french lessons) but large sections of the book in between were only moderately amusing. He certainly has lead an interesting life."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sorry, I didn't like it","review":"I would have given this book 1 star but I added a '1 Star Credit' because at least I could finish it. This was my first Sedaris book. I read it because a friend recommended it. I had no idea it was supposed to be funny... even at the end of the book. I feel sort of bad to say I didn't like it because I can tell he is a good writer. But I just didn't enjoy this. It took me forever to finish the book and at the end all I could think was \\"Thank goodness that is OVER\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I saw this book listed on a bunch of people's \\"funniest books I've ever read\\" lists. I didn't enjoy it at all. The stories were boring and uneventful. I only finished it because I felt obligated after spending $10 on it for my kindle."},{"rating":"1","title":"Humor?","review":"Maybe, being a 60 plus, I simply do not understand Sedaris' humor, but this book is the biggest disappointment I have read in a long time. Moderately entertaining, perhaps, but funny, no! If you want laugh-out-loud funny, read any of the Stephanie Plum mysteries by Janet Evanovich; or Edward Abbey's \\"Monkey Wrench Gang\\" or anything by Dana Stabenow, funniest being \\"Breakup\\"; or anything by Carl Hiassen or Dave Barry. Mark Twain is funny and smart. Sedaris is pathetic."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Good Humor to Me.","review":"I didn't enjoy the book. Wasn't funny like the reviews on the back of the book read. Some may have found it funny, but to me it was a pointless list of uneventful life stories..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can't even finish reading this.","review":"I thought this book would get better as I read on, when in fact it got worse. Wouldn't recommend it at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disjointed and disappointing","review":"After hearing much raving about Sedaris I looked forward to reading this book. The first chapter made me laugh out loud but it was downhill from there. I found it disjointed, rude and often crude and had to work hard to finish the book. Very disappointing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved it!","review":"I bought this book for one of my Writing Arts classes and I had never heard of David Sedaris. I thought the book was awesome, very funny, and worth the money. I would definitely recommend it to others!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Buy","review":"Bought for pennies, delivered immeaditly, in great shape, like new!! I don't know why everyone doesn't buy books thru amazon!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Mostly hysterically funny . . .","review":"This is the first book by David Sedaris that I have read and, for the most part, it was very funny. During certain portions (I am ashamed to include one short scatological piece among them) I was laughing out loud. Others were very funny in a more \\"dry\\" sense.The first portion of the book is Sedaris' autobiography of growing up in a quirky family, dealing with a not-too-successful speech therapist, and working (?) as an artist and in other trades. Next, he describes his stays in France at his friend's house in the country and in Paris. Anyone who has spent time in France, and struggled with the French language, will be able to relate to the humourous situations.This is definitely a good book if you need some chuckles and some loud laughs!"},{"rating":"1","title":"2.5 stars- I'm on the Fence","review":"I got \\"Me Talk Pretty One Day\\" with different expectations that I probably should have had. I was expecting a novel, but I got a bunch of short stories. I HATE short stories, but that's my own fault for not researching more before I picked it up, right?So, I grin and bear it for a few stories, but then feel like maybe I'm reading an Augusten Burroughs novel instead? I know technically \\"Me Talk...\\" came out at the same time as \\"Running With Scissors\\", both originally released in 2001, but the stories are so similar to Augusten's that I had to go back and check the covers. Yup. Sedaris. Okay... moving on.Yeah, he's funny. Sure he has some great moments. But, is he really as funny as HE thinks HE is?If I had read this book BEFORE reading Augusten Burroughs's books... maybe I would have loved it a little more. I honestly DID love \\"Naked\\" by Sedaris- laugh out loud funny.But \\"Me Talk...\\" just wasn't... good."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not impressed","review":"I did not laugh. The guy is not interesting. The writing is amateurish dime store bookish. The humor is high school level.I really liked the title. Thats all."},{"rating":"1","title":"WHAT A MISNOMER FOR A TITLE","review":"Let me start by saying I am a bibliophile and will sometimes buy a book just for the look of it. I ended up throwing the book away rather than offer it to any one else. If I could have given this book something less than one star I would have given it a negative fifteen (-15). I found this book gross, crass and inappropriate. I've read books with strong language in them, but never like this one that has filthy language just for the sake of using filthy language. I wouldn't have this book in my home and am sorry that I read the whole thing, but it was a private book club choice. As it turned out no one else finished reading it. DON'T BUY, READ or OWN THIS BOOK!"},{"rating":"1","title":"wasted time","review":"Read three fourths of book and chunked it. I would be embaressed to give it away. Maybe 5 funny pages."},{"rating":"1","title":"Me Talk Pretty One Day","review":"A big zero rating. I don't want to give it a star but you require the field to be put in! If you want the f word and the mf word popping up and hitting you in the face unexpectedly, and totally unnecessary,then you should buy this book. I don't enjoy it and won't finish reading it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Funny, But....","review":"David Sedaris' Me Talk Pretty One Day is a very amusing collection of essays that I enjoyed, so long as I read them one or two at a time. I personally found, after reading more than that, that Sedaris's narcissism started getting on my nerves. That being said, these essays are very amusing, some more than others of course. A good portion of them concern his move to France, although many focus on his family. Sedaris story telling style relies heavily on the humorous exaggeration, and for the most part it works. Again though, after too many essays, it may grate on your nerves. This book is a fun read, definitely nontaxing (for instance, I was easily able to read these essays in a moving car (I wasn't driving)). Enjoy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very humorous non-fiction","review":"This was my first David Sedaris book, and I'm definitely planning on reading one or more of the others. Very witty, somewhat caustic sense of humour. The chapters are unrelated, which makes this is a good book to have with you for those times when you need something to read while waiting (for whatever - doctor's appointment, your kid's little league game, etc.)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Me Stop Laughing One Day","review":"I was standing in Miami Airport, looking for something to read on my impending long flight. I saw this book, flipped through a couple of pages and thought \\"What the heck?\\" The hours that followed were filled with my audible and uncontrollable laughter permeating through the departure lounge and the aircraft. I kept grabbing my best friend/travel companion so I could read passages to her - I haven't laughed that much in a long time. I have since purchased an unprecedented 10 volumes for family and friends, so impressed am I with this work. David Sedaris' take on life is hilarious - the chapter on his brother, Paul, \\"The Rooster\\" is one of my favourites. Each chapter is a short story about one subject or the next. Make sure you concentrate on each one. I now own all the David Sedaris books, and can't wait for his next installment.Just terrific!"},{"rating":"2","title":"An ex-looser is now a great writer","review":"I bought this book at an airport assuming I was going to read it after I finished the one I had midway completed. I had to change my plans, I was having so much fun with his stories that I could not put it down. He surely made me laugh with his less than perfect life. It is lovable to read someone who can laugh at his past and allow us do that at the same time. I have a lot of compassion for the author father though. I would not allow my teenage kid to read it, the reference to drug use is very graphic and I got the underlying message that you can come up right from drugs without any grueling effort."},{"rating":"2","title":"Literally, laugh out loud funny","review":"How many times have you read a review on the jacket sleeve of a book that coins the phrase \\"laugh out loud funny\\", you bought the book, and then wondered if you had missed the section of the book referred to has \\"laugh out loud funny\\"? Well, this is truly a book that will make you laugh out loud. It took several chapters, but starting with \\"You Can't Kill the Rooster\\" and continuing on for several more chapters I couldn't help but laugh as though I were watching a comedy movie in the theater. Although the book tends to trail off near the end, the middle portion is well worth the investment. Irreverent, honest, poignant, enrapturing ... all descriptives that capture this book. I was taken in from the first page and didn't let go until I was finished."},{"rating":"2","title":"I LOVE this book!","review":"Me Talk Pretty One Day is a riot! It's taking me forever to read it because I've been laughing so hard that I'm crying and can't focus my eyes on the page! If you don't like drawing attention to yourself, DON'T READ THIS IN A PUBLIC PLACE! LOL!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Caution, this book will make you laugh....hard.","review":"I reread this recently and I laughed as much as I did the first time I read it. David Sedaris is quite a national treasure even though most people don't know who he is! His writing is wonderful, poignant, sentimental and hilarious. The man knows how to write well and you can tell he continues to love his craft.I don't think I have read a book that made me laugh as much as this one did. I think I had to put this book down at least a hundred times and walk away from it because I was laughing too hard. You know, the kind of laughing that causes mild asphyxiation.This book is delirious with humor and great story telling. A must read for anyone who wants to have a wonderful reading experience. I don't see how you could miss with Me Talk Pretty One Day."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hilarious!","review":"Great, funny & entertaining stories. Laughing out loud like mad. If you get embarrassed easily, definitely do not read in public :)Can't wait to read the rest of his work!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Funniest book I've read this year","review":"Sedaris has an absolutely extraordinary ability to communicate the humor and absurdity in common situations - family holidays, menial jobs, learning a new language, etc. I bought this book on a friend's recommendation, and after reading it I immediately bought another copy to send to my family."},{"rating":"2","title":"If I could only talk so pretty...","review":"Sedaris is witty moving and hysterical. He finds humor in everything, and twists it into lessons and love. Whether he is describing his lack of French fluency, childhood guitar lessons, or his time as an \\"artist\\" Sedaris writes to every audience, adressing questions, fears, and joys of every life."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Tribe of Kiln-Roasted Chilean Toadstools","review":"This collection is incredibly funny. Nobody spins a demented yarn quite like Sedaris and if a fraction of his observations reflect his actual experience, then his is a life (and mind) of epic comic proportions.Though the book seems somewhat fractured due to the previous publication of some if its stories, its hilarity will stick to your ribs like meatloaf poached in seawater."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring book but...He would make a great ghost writer.","review":"This is a person who grew up in a middle class family, has a pushy, over-supportive Dad, experiments with drugs, and ends up hooking up with a Sugar Daddy. This book was like sitting through an extemely bad After School Special. I have to admit his simplistic-sarcastic writing style did hold my attention but it would be great if he had something interesting to write about... like someone else's life -- someone who has got past thinking their story of growing up in middle America is an incredible epic.Get over yourself!"},{"rating":"1","title":"We Are Not Amused","review":"I have to agree with the minority reviewers who thought this wasn't very funny. This is my first Sedaris book and I've heard lots of hype about how hilarious he is. Mind you, I have a wicked, twisted sense of humor, am gay, a former writer, and make my friends crack up constantly. So, I figured someone like Sedaris would have me in stitches. I'm about halfway through the book and I think I snorted a little (in laughter, not illicit chemicals) only once. Other than that I've barely cracked a smile. I don't get why people think this is so hilarious? It's not awful by any stretch, but it's hardly side-splitting humor. I hate to say it, but I think on a bad day I'm funnier than this. Honestly, I'm a little bummed. I wanted to laugh. Really I did."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well worth the wait!","review":"\\"Me Talk Pretty One Day\\" is the most enjoyable read I have had so far this year. Anyone who has read \\"Naked\\" will appreciate the continuing adventures of David Sedaris. There is no other writer who can tell a story like this man. (No, I'm not one of his sisters). \\"Me Talk Pretty One Day\\" is comprised of various essays about family, relationships, New York, France, pets and the most interesting situations that happen in the life of this most talented writer. This book will make you laugh out loud, particularly if you have ever thought of yourself or your family as eccentric. I thank David Sedaris for speaking out in such an honest way about his life for our reading pleasure. Can't wait for the next book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Very Funny Man!","review":"What can I say about this author's new book that hasn't been said already? It's a wonderful and wickedly funny book. David really knows how to write and is probably the funniest author around today. The first part of the book begins with his North Carolina childhood and the second half moves to Paris. What a wonderful collection of essays. I especially enjoyed \\"Today's Special\\" and \\"You Can't Kill the Rooster.\\" But really all of the essays are so funny, and true to life. To be able to put these everyday events into words that are simple yet so funny, is truly a gift.Believe it or not I haven't read his previous book \\"Naked\\", but now its being pulled off my library shelf to be read immediately. When you start to read \\"Me Talk Pretty One Day\\" you will want to sit and read it right through, forget about dinner and everything else. This book deserves more than 5 stars. David, we await your next collection with eagerness."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tries just hard enough . . .","review":"Interestingly, this is the most serious funny book I've ever read. It will make you laugh out loud, no matter where you are, it made me cry (I never cry) and it sweetly describes everything that is lovely and depressing about the world we live in.What I also found is that this book fairly speaks about the true nature of France and the French. It speaks honestly to the dilemmas Americans face when dealing with the French, without resorting to stereotypes and doting, blind admiration.But make no mistake- this is not a book about international relations, gay issues, greek heritage or the trials of being poor in New York. It is a book about a life, played out and described in simple, self-deprecating prose, by a man who is halfway through and still learning to talk pretty."},{"rating":"2","title":"Can't I have another star????","review":"I'd give this book 10 stars if I could. Need to revive a dead fish? Read him a chapter of \\"Me Talk Pretty One Day.\\" I picked it up at an airport bookstore this summer after previously bumping into David S. on NPR from time to time. I read it cover to cover virtually nonstop in about 3.5 hours. I laughed, and crying laughing, uncontrollably many times - part of the attraction. I started reading entries aloud to my friends in the weeks that followed. Any potential lulls in laughter are certainly the result of laughter overload and will, thankfully, give you a chance to refuel and read on! - Enjoy!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Just a great read","review":"'Me Talk Pretty One Day' is my first exposure to the work of David Sedaris, and it will surely not be my last. It's a book which is consistently humorous throughout, and at times devastatingly accurate in it's assassination of character flaws, delusions of grandeur, and idiocy in general - quite often of which is the authors own.The magic of Sedaris' writing, is, that while he can make light of normally heart-breaking subjects like drug addiction or the death of his mother, it's only when he describes his ordeal of trying to flush a 'big-boy' - (not his own), that you begin to feel sympathetic. He treats everything with the same level of amusement without going over the top. Some writers of humour are extremely witty and insightful but they don't really make you laugh. Sedaris is one of few that has the gift of inciting genuine laughter without seemingly trying too hard - and for that he has my full endorsement. Keep 'em coming David."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hilarious, and better than previous books.","review":"I can't imagine anyone being less than fully entertained by this book. It has its sophomoric moments, but one thing that has developed in Sedaris' writing since his early days is generosity. He is generous and forgiving while still being ascerbic and witty. I found the sensibility in books like \\"Barrel Fever\\" and \\"Naked\\" a little bitter. With the earlier books, I got tired of reading about dysfunctional monsters and horrible people page after page. With \\"Me Talk Pretty One Day,\\" Sedaris has become human. He's still biting as ever, but he somehow manages to forgive at the same time."},{"rating":"1","title":"A little too liberal for me","review":"I'm new to this author and thought he would be funny, but found it to be a little too liberal for my taste. I got through the first few chapters, then donated it. It wasn't for me - I'm a little too conservative, I think. If you don't mind potty humor, this book may be good for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"kind of ok","review":"While the essays are intelligently written the book lacks the funniness that the reviews make it out to have. The only essay that made me laugh out loud was Big Boy, I guess bathroom humor is funny no matter how old you are. I had such high hopes for this book but was disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Me thought funny EVERY day","review":"This book has made me laugh more than any book I have ever read. I was constantly interrupting my husband's work to say, \\"you have to read this.\\" I would read him bits and he would be cracking up.Every ounce of his commentary on the world around him is just histerical and so true. He can turn even something as tragic as drug abuse into sidesplitting humor. I couldn't pick a favorite chapter because each one is as funny as the last.I plan to pass this book along to all of my friends and family. Anyone with a sense of humor, and even those without one, will fall over laughing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sedaris' Best Yet!","review":"Every one of David Sedaris' books has given me moments of pure joy. Humor like his is wonderful. With only words, it is very difficult to be funny. But, Sedaris does it.His is a rare gift.This book stands out among his others in that most of the last half deals with his encounters with French language and culture. In this group of essays, he explores various related themes -- the difficulty of being unable to master the language, feeling insecure in an unfamiliar country, etc.Sedaris isn't afraid to let us know who he is. By opening up to us, we get to see the world his way. And find the humor in situations which he tells us about.The best thing about this book is that by allowing us to see things his way, we experience something like what he tells us he dealt with in regard to French encounters. And, this opportunity to see from a new perspective is great!Keep in mind though -- this is not a boring World Cultures book of essays. This is first rate, intelligent humor."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Funniest Book this Year","review":"I read David Sedaris' book NAKED this past summer. Now, I have to read it for a class I am taking at UMass-Amherst. So, to get a discussion going on the writer, I decided to pick up his newest book. All I can say is that this book was hilarious. My favorite story was \\"Go Carolina.\\" It was about David and his speech impediment. I could relate to this story because I had a speech problem when I was young. The first half of the book deals with David living in the US, and then goes into his life in France with his boyfriend Hugh. All of his stories are entertaining. The most memorable people in the book were David's father and his sister Amy. I hope David Sedaris continues writing witty and memorable stories like in ME TALK PRETTY ONE DAY and NAKED."},{"rating":"2","title":"Exceptional!","review":"Possibily Sedaris' BEST work in conversational masterpieces. So funny I couldn't read at times. I would recommend this book before Naked, as Naked was not as focused as Me Talk Pretty.."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best books I've read in a long time","review":"This book is laugh out loud funny. It got me through a long day of air traveling. Me Talk Pretty One Day is almost like a collection of short stories put together in one book because it doesn't follow the beginning-middle-end format. Each chapter is more or less a chapter in David's life. Either way, the things written in this book will make you laugh so loud others will stare and ask what's in it. I read it in one day, and might read it again if I need a good laugh."},{"rating":"2","title":"loved it","review":"Its a great book, although some parts had me grimacing rather than laughing, I really enjoyed it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hilarious","review":"So glad I put the book on my Kindle.

Sedaris is definitely the funny man of this generation and brings humor to everyday life as well as special occasions spanning cultures with a global grin."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not funny. Irritating with a strong mix of boring.","review":"Bought this book because 900 reviews suggested this book could be hilarious. I found David Sedaris after reading all of Augusten Burroughs books (HIGHLY recommend!). He was frequently compared to Sedaris.The difference being that Burroughs is actually funny and Sedaris is, quite simply, not. In this book, the chapters are broken down into what are like mini-stories. They don't even seem like they TRY to be funny. You find yourself flipping page after page hoping that there will be some kind of redemption for the 15 pages you just read to find out that the conclusion is just as blatantly boring as the beginning and middle.It sucks that I spent $10 on a piece of literature I cannot and will not finish. It should be like other products- returnable (I bought it in Kindle form.)Save your money and your brain cells- read Augusten Burroughs train-wreck literature if your looking for a humorous read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Laugh out loud funny","review":"Laugh out loud funny but somewhat lacking in plot or theme. Reads more like stand up comedy than a novel, so depends on what you're looking for."},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT READ","review":"SIMILIAR TO NAKED. A UNIQUE AUTHOR WITH A UNIQUE STORY. I WAS HIGHLY AMUSED WHILE READING. ENJOYED EVERY SENTENCE. YOU WILL LAUGH OUT LOUD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sedaris At His Best","review":"Sedaris' take on everyday life, work, growing up in the south with decidedly northern parents, and life as an American living in Paris is an amazingly witty and entertaining read.His observations on the obsurdity of everyday life is often much more entertaining than his ficitonal essays, like those that fill the majority of one of Sedaris' other books Barrel Fever."},{"rating":"2","title":"steady slope","review":"as a fan of david sedaris from this american life, i was ready to devour this book from the moment it entered my hands. the problem was, i just couldn't chug it down. havinf heard several of the early stories read for that show, david's voice in my head kept preventing me from reading without distraction. i also noticed that many of his essays take on more life when he read them than when i was. luckily, this changed as i read on. by the time i got to the later stories from france, the ball was rolling and i was in stitches."},{"rating":"2","title":"I bought all his others...","review":"...after reading this, Sedaris' latest book. Beyond funny, he is wicked, caustic, subversive and witty. Somehow, Sedaris manages to avoid that deadly cutesy-ness that wrecks most American humor collections. His arched detachment and deadpan delivery remind me of the best moments in Dave Eggers' A Heartbreaking Work... Unlike Eggers, and others, who clobber you with emotional pain, poignancy lies below the surface with Sedaris. He never stoops too low or wrings emotion out of a scene. Wish I could write like this...awesome books, all of them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Super start, slower later","review":"I was in tears I was laughing so hard during this book. David Sedaris is a wonderful writer. He keeps your interest and the words flow so well throughout. Sedaris is great with dialog. Every conversation is realistic. You only have to read his stuff once.Whether he is describing music class when he is young or apartment shopping when older Sedaris speaks with realism, wit and that ever present bit of sarcasism.I am not prone to peeking into other peoples windows but I love to walk through the 'rich neighborhoods' and sort of NOTICE how those other people live. Sedaris describes his similar experience but with the humor that I never thought of.But this is a memoir not a novel so at times the book losses a bit of focus. It doesn't really go anywhere. Even so it is really fun to read and that's why I picked it up, to be entertained. And I was. With that in my mind it is worth reading. There are not many books today that give you a good laugh and are well written too."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't laugh once","review":"maybe its just not my type of humor. i didnt particulary find any of the essays funny enough to laugh out loud, in fact some of them i wondered why others considered them to be funny at all. i read plenty of reviews on the book and the author and was very excited to start reading the book. i am sad to say that i am left very disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Glad I'm not the only one","review":"After reading the rave reviews in the front of the book, and then the glowing reviews on here, I thought I was in for a treat, especially since I love humorous books. Unfortunately, this humor wasn't for me. I found the writing self-absorbed and tedious. I didn't need to find a private place to read it since I didn't laugh out loud once. I struggled to get to the end. The first chapters were mildly amusing, but it was a slow tortuous roll downhill after that. To compare this to the writings of Mark Twain is to gravely insult Mr. Twain. Luckily, everyone has different tastes and different things tickle different funny bones, but my funny bone remained untouched by this collection."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can somebody tell me what was funny about this book?","review":"From reading the reviews for this book it is clear that this book isn't funny to everybody. I was expecting at least a couple of laughs out of the 270 pages, but it never really happened. This book is written as an autobiography about someone to whom nothing significantly interesting happened in his entire life. The book is composed of banal anectodes that could happen to anybody but that nobody would ever think of writing a book about. The first part of the book is definitely not funny, whereas the second part is slightly better. I got this book as a present and I'm glad I didn't spend any of my own money on it. If you want to read a biography, read one about someone who lived an interesting life!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Did I miss something","review":"I guess I missed something when I read this book. I didn't find it funny at all.... in fact... I never laughed to myself let alone out loud. I was highly disappointed in this book. Having never read any other of his works so I have nothing to compare this to, I would not buy any other of his works."},{"rating":"1","title":"Soooo overrated!","review":"Let the Sedaris fans lap it up, but for me, this book has no edge whatsoever. What's the difference between a performance monologuist such as Sedaris or Spalding Gray and a stand-up comedian? The latter at least has punchlines, but the former just drones on and on. This is cutesy, soft, overly-pleasant stuff - the same people who watch \\"Mystery\\" on PBS will love it - perfect for readers who do not want to be disturbed or think too much."},{"rating":"1","title":"Running on Empty","review":"I love a funny read more than anything. But this is too distracting. Okay, he wants to go to Paris-- big deal. The first half of the book almost lost me. I don't think a story has to be so mindless to order to get a rise. There are a lot of other funny writers who still have something to say. Take Orozco's \\"Delano.\\" It's funny in the tradition of Catch 22, and it makes some important observations about society and education."},{"rating":"1","title":"Really not that funny","review":"I'm not without humour however, I do know humour. This book simply leaves something to be desired. Its not terrible but more importantly, its not that great. It has been touted as laugh out loud funny, but it lacks the ability to, in most places, crack a smile. Don't waste your time or prepare yourself for a dissapointment. If you lower your expectations then you can be better prepared for \\"laugh inside, without smiling\\" funny."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where's the funny?","review":"I wish I had read the one star reviews before buying this book. They are right -- it wasn't funny, wasn't cohesive, wasn't interesting. I had to force myself to read to page 50, hoping it would redeem itself, but I finally gave up. There are way too many good books out there to waste my time trying to get through this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Book I Ever Read","review":"A complete waste of time. One wannabe funny story after another from a guy who people revere as the humor writer emeritus. I got angrier and angrier after every chapter and said to myself 1.) why am I wasting my time and 2.) why has everyone I ever met liked this book and held it up to some higher standard of humor. And the worst part is that you get from Sedaris the feeling that he doesn't even care about writing or being funny or being human. His stories are no better. funnier, or more strange than anybody else's. This book was on a 'to read' list of mine for years and it was such a let down. I hate myself for having read it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can I get a refund?","review":"I bought the book with much anticipated expectation. Its reviews promised a funny-can't-put-down-must-read-book.All I can say is that I read it. Now I want a refund so I can buy something REALLY FUNNY. And belive me, I LOVE DARK HUMOR. But this felt short. If your readers really want to read A FUNNY BOOK, READ \\"e\\" by Matt Beaumont or any of the three books by Margot Kaufman. Now THOSE are funny!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Less than humorous","review":"I hate to say it, but I'm tossing the Sedaris book aside. I find it absolutely dreadful--not to mention boring. Several people recommended the book which surprises me. He's unfunny. I'm tired, too, of the repressed-boy-homo theme that so many gay men like to write about. Yawn!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I'm still laughing....","review":"This book was hysterical! I knew when I read the first chapter that I would love the whole thing. So many times I laughed outloud, and I had to tell people around me what was so funny. I think im going to buy this book, so I can read it when Im down. I can't believe that someone would not like this book, at least a little. The only thing I can say negative about this book is that I feel that the second part,\\"part deux\\" was not as funny as the first half. Still I would give any one of his books a try!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Loses steam towards the end","review":"The story is rather interesting until you hit the last few chapters where you realize it's more of the same. The author is able to communicate his sense of humor and life experiences and I was engaged until I realized that I was not going to get any insightful life lesson learned from his stories."},{"rating":"1","title":"Meh","review":"Yes, this book is undeniably funny. However, it's the literary equivalent of Doritos (ie: Pretty good, but leaves you hungry. And too much will make you feel vaguely ill.) Borrow it and bust a gut laughing for an afternoon. But don't spend your own money on it, because the vignettes become increasingly stale and vacuous with successive re-readings. Anyway, in a few years you'll be able to find this book for cheap in bookstores' remainder bins, along with Tama Janowitz and David Foster Wallace novels."},{"rating":"2","title":"BOOM! POP! POW!","review":"This book is a pretty darn good read...quite funny even. I really like reading it on the bus because the essays are just long enough to get through in one trip.

The Musicianship is still excellent, the metal portions still rock, but the vocals and songs just don't work on album like the past album. This will set well for the movie soundtrack. Some of this material is reminiscent of stuff off the masterworks, which had some of their really early stuff on it, which was not as polished. More could have been done with this soundtrack, like a little less pointless swearing (annoying after a bit, Jack needs to learn that silence in sertain parts is OK, he doesn't need to fill it.) Otherwise, still has several songs that are just darn funny, and Dio's appearence on here is priceless.

While nothing overstays its welcome, and Black's voice is still great, and the guitar work still graceful... so many of these songs are over before they get a chance to begin.There's a much wider variety of music on here, like they're spreading their wings, but when it gets brilliant it feels more accidental than inspired. I think \\"Master Exploder\\" is genius, but I enjoy it more for its artistic merits than because it rocks or is funny. I think the problem is that this album can't find a groove in between \\"rock n' roll with a sense of humor\\" and nearly Zappa-inspired antics.In the end, with its lack of cohesion, and the brevity of the album and most of the songs, I feel like I got a soundtrack with a couple bonus tracks."},{"rating":"1","title":"Brand new battery only lasts a couple of hours","review":"and then dies.

The characters in this straight to video release, however, were not the same in voice or attitude as in the other movie. As well, there are additional characters that appear and are never seen in the original movie. Even my little ones had a problem with the inconsistencies!Overall, it just doesn't make much of a package. The character voices are poorly done, the animation is unimpressive and the music is uninteresting.This is the only Disney release my family hasn't enjoyed and I would suggest you avoid it, too!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not much fun for a Christmas video","review":"Somehow I think Disney gets away pretty easily with G ratings for some of it's cartoons.

It's not even a fun movie. You leave it remembering the dark and disturbing parts and not the happy parts.If you think this will be a magical, happy Christmas movie to add to your collection think again.

It was so negative and filled with yelling, destruction, and anger. I understand that conflict is required to move a storyline, but this is movie has only the thinnest thread of a storyline (Forte the organ wants to ruin Christmas and run Belle off, inexplicably), so the entire movie is Belle and castle creature friends trying to make Christmas lovely and Forte talking Beast into destroying the efforts. Of course it all works out in the end but truly in about the last 90 seconds.

Joining them as brand-new characters are Bernadette Peters as Angelique, Paul Reubens as Fife and Tim Curry as the evil Forte. There is also Haley Joel Osment in the role of tiny Chip.The story is heart-warming, and as someone who has grown up with the original movie (and it has to be my favorite Disney film), it was like seeing dear old friends again.Do not miss it!

At it's heart it's much more about the deep philosophy and spirituality of Wicca as a religion and a science, and how to work in harmony with the universe. It covers a very broad array of subjects, including a great section on the God (often an afterthought in many books). Most importantly, it challenges some Wiccan dogma that many take for granted (karma, 3-fold law) and makes you think."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good book","review":"This book is an excellent, well written book for anyone beginning to really get into spellcrafting and witchcraft.

It urges us to return to basic practices with a fresh approach that breaks through crustiness. It questions long standing beliefs, invites discussion, and urges us to take a look beneath what may have been lying dormant too long. A practical and extremely effective handbook, it provides a good magical workout. However, I believe it is irresponsible to market this book as intended for beginners. It is too deconstructive and controversial. I believe it could be confusing and unhelpful for those not properly prepared.

The tab might be hard to see for a lot of people, but, overall I think this is a good product that serves its purpose.

It's one of his original film efforts circa 1986, it features a Tommy Lee Jones, as a thief under contract by the US District Attorney's office. He is charged with retrieving vital records kept at a company and things go sideways upon his escape.While he is retreating from the theft he is seen by a man from his past. He hides the records in a special prototype car called the Black Moon as he tries to evade his pursuers. And in traditional John Carpenter style the car he hides it in gets stolen by carjacking specialist Linda Hamilton. Jones follows her to a warehouse filled with stolen high priced autos which happens to be owned by suave criminal Robert Vaughn.If you are a Carpenter fan you'll find a pleasurable film experience in Black Moon Rising. The snappy dialog, the old 80's clothing and the really cool chases made even more spectacular by Carpenter's attention to detail make this a definite must see film."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great movie, poor quality product","review":"As with others here, I loved this movie from the first time I saw it.

I've noticed newer lights have some kind of oily material on them).I would like to see them offer a lght using 3V lithium cell technology and a brighter bulb with fewer dark spots."},{"rating":"1","title":"A dirty trick","review":"Supposed to include two AA batteries but I see I was charged an additional $7.51 for a pair of batteries I neither needed nor ordered. What kind of a dirty trick is that? Be careful . . .

I decided to try upgrading two old ones I own to the newer LED and Xenon bulbs. Both bulbs were available at the box store and very reasonable. Sadly, neither bulb did much to improve the amount of light these Mini MagLites produce.I didn't test lumens or anything like that. I just added fresh batteries, turned them on in a room with daylight coming into it, and you could just see a small circle of light on the wall at 6'. At 8' they were almost invisible. Better technologies have passed these by."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love these maglights","review":"Small, tough, and sturdy. Not the first one of these I have purchased and not likely the last.

Both failed miserably.Never got a whole lot of use out the mini because the bulb life and battery life were just terrible. I recently tried to upgrade it with an LED kit. Forget it. The internal plastic parts just fell apart in my hands.I had bought one of their C cell lights about 10 years ago. It made it through one set of batteries. When I tried to replace the batteries, the tail end would not come off. It had somehow become welded to the body of the flashlight. I think the parts corroded together and got stuck. Tried a vice, channel lock pliers, you name it. Anything that would impart enough force to get it unglued would have damaged the body. Went in the trash."},{"rating":"2","title":"not for light painting photography but great for other things.","review":"I like this light but it has one major flaw with the large opening :[I bought this for light painting photography this dose not do its job for light painting photography because its full beam has this weird jelly fish look where as I need a clear full strong beam of light :/ but for seeing in the dark or anything else I'm sure its amazing. just don't get this for light painting [maybe pay an extra 10$ for a better one]."},{"rating":"1","title":"Specs are wrong","review":"Says it's an LED in specs.

You rotate the top portion around and the brightness and focal length increases. But then it comes off at the end. I read this about this product before, but its kind of annoying when you want to use this in a hurry and it becomes loose.Would have preferred a switch.Its quite compact and slips easily into your pocket. Would buy again from Maglite, but not the same design.Advice: look for something else, but make sure it doesnt operate the same way as this device."},{"rating":"2","title":"Can't beat $8 !!","review":"So Everyone Loves Mini Maglights, or even Maglites in General, Even though Everyone Knows they aren't that bright and you can buy brighter lights out there, but Everyone also knows that their Maglites are going to last a Long time and for a cheap price, you can purchase an LED Drop in that will Surely Surprise Alot of people!! These Flashlights are great! By themselves maybe not all that bright, but Purchase a Drop in Led and be Surprised at how Good these can Actually be!!So 4 Stars because of the lights Brightness by itself, But Spend Another$10-$15 and you will have an Awesome Led light that will last basically Forever and will probably extend your battery time while being a Million times Brighter!!You can't beat $8 for a Mini Maglite"},{"rating":"1","title":"poor light","review":"Trust me it feels good in your hand but the led streamlight for 20 is a better deal.well i said it is 8 dollars"},{"rating":"2","title":"Love, Love, Love","review":"This small but powerful little flash light is awesome.

They work great when they work, and the light is bright but after the first time I used it it got dim and now when I turn it on it flickers and goes off. A much better flashlight that I own is the Illuminator Flashlight. It is a hand cranked flashlight. It is also less than this flashlight on Amazon."},{"rating":"1","title":"Old Technology, and not particularly good at that..","review":"I can't believe that Maglites are still considered quality lights these days.Sure, they were pretty good 10 years or so ago. But what's changed? The Mini Maglites I've owned have always had the same problems - bulbs which go pop and fail if the light experiences any kind of shock - or sometimes for no reason at all. And that dim, yellow, uneven excuse for a beam of light.It'd be nice if Mag produced a light which you could actually *rely* on to work when you needed it, rather than this outdated rubbish.I've since found far more reliable, brighter, and generally better lights from other makers such as Streamlight.There are lots of lights out there which are miles ahead of Maglites in every category."},{"rating":"1","title":"Total Garbage!!!!!","review":"I bought a 2 aa Mini LED. The first one lasted about a week. It started flickering just like the two guys mentioned in there reviews. It is useless now. I waited to long to return to lowes. So a few months past before I get around to dealing with the problem. I purchased the same exact light from Home depot in a town an hour and half away. I am sure you can guess what I had planned. To my amazement the replacement never worked out the box. Just did the flickering thing. I am not a review writer type of of guy, but this has got me boiling over.

When I take the batteries out and put new ones in, they still don't work. If I change the bulb they still don't work.It seems that they are very touchy about the way they are put back together. They have to have the spring situated just right among other things.I can't believe that other people don't have the same problems I do. My boyfriend just spent 30 minutes cursing, trying to replace batteries and/or bulbs without any luck.

I found this book rather disappointing and not very informative (possibly because I read the other book first) While it does have some information about the tow vehicles (you can get more information in a more understandable format from any man walking down the street that knows trucks) and more information on training the horses to load, I still found it very disappointing. Spend the extra $$ on The Complete Guide to Buying, Maintaining, and Servicing a Horse Trailer by Neva Kittrell Scheve, Thomas G.

However, the entire state is covered very well. Each trail has good information on the terrain, nearby resources (including bike shop in nearby towns), a rescue index, and general warnings that you will find useful on every trail. The book is written with a lot of personality and isn't just a simple guidebook -- it's also enjoyable reading."},{"rating":"2","title":"It a weird but lovely cd","review":"It is a rhapsody style music cd.

The other songs on the cd turned out to be really great from my perspective... But the 2 mixes of Guilty really left me hanging hoping for somehting better... All in all it is a good cd, slightly better in my opinion than there other cds, just don't expect to much from the last 2 songs"},{"rating":"2","title":"My 6 yr old enjoyed","review":"However much I thought this book would help us dig in to a bit of history thus book did its job.

The primary facts are here with some illustrations. The text is simple and easily understood."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good basic book about Jefferson... tad bit dry","review":"This is a good, basic book about Thomas Jefferson that goes a little bit deeper than an early reader. It's more of a beginning chapter type of book. It covers the basics of his life and is done in an easy-to-read way... but I just found it somewhat dry to read. Still, it's a good book for those being introduced to history. Nothing controversial in it, I felt like the author was fair.This book was recommended to me for my child's third grade history, so I decided to read it first before I handed it off to her. So comparing to many of the other history books I've been reading (a good 30 or 40 of them!), I definitely found this one a bit boring and dry. Which is why I gave it four stars instead of 5. But still, all around a good book that I could recommend."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great!!!","review":"This book is an excellent educational resource for young readers! My 6 year old son thoroughly enjoyed it as did his 3 year old brother."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not What I Was Looking For","review":"This book was not what I was looking for. My teacher assigned us a Biography/Autobiography book report (like every month), and I checked this book out in the library. Yeah, maybe its ok for 4-8 year olds, this book is really boring for children like me. This book had stuff I already knew about, and I didn't learn anything. It was really boring and had no interesting facts. So, if you are looking for a book with a detailed scope about Thomas Jefferson, read another book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Spies","review":"This is by far the most horrible book that I have ever come across. It's just horrible. Simple as that. Read the first paragraph and you'll see what I mean. Frayn might be good at writing plays, but not novels (Spies, anyway). Its too descriptive and poetic, and doesn't make the slightest bit of sense. Don't waste your money on this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Spies","review":"This is one of the worst World War II stories that I have every read. It is incoherent and makes little sense. It was totally a waste of money."},{"rating":"2","title":"a wonderful read","review":"Spies is a lovely, beautifully written novel about childhood, mysteries and memories. Don't read it if you're looking for high drama. Do read it if you like good prose, an interesting story (yes, there is a story, and even a bit of a surprise ending)wonderful images, and an evocative look back."},{"rating":"2","title":"Poignant Journey","review":"What a great read this is!The author has a true understanding of the transition from boyhood to adult emotions with all the hopes, fears and tribulations that go with it. Add to this a particular empathy with wartime suburban England and you have a classic of suspense, emotion in a book where Mr. Frayn actually makes you CARE about what happens to the lead character.I loved it so much that I did something I never do and sent a copy to my Mum in England who was a girl in rural England during WW2. (She spoils me by leaving me Capt. Correli's Mandolin)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Would Make A Great Short Story","review":"The book takes place during WWII and follows the lives of two eleven year year old boys as they play a game of spy. The game tests their friendship and gets one of them involved in a very grown up situation with tragic consequences. If written as a short story this book would have received four starts. As it is written though, the last 20-30 pages are well written but the first 150 feel like filler."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretentious and Amateurish","review":"This is one of the worst novels I have read in a long time. The writing, which attempts to be post-modern, is frequently pretentious and often simply incompetent. The main character becomes more and more unrealistic and unsympathetic as the story progresses - especially since he never seems to remember the most important events that occurred during the period of time covered by the narrative. The ending - where the author desperately tries to tie all the loose ends together in the last ten pages - is laughable.Normally I would have tossed this book aside after the first thirty pages, which are dreadfully slow. But I kept reading to see how bad it could get. It exceeded all my expectations.I have the feeling that Mr. Frayn wrote a single draft of this book and then turned it in to his publisher as good enough. It isn't."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tedious","review":"I loved the atmosphere in the novel, to begin with, but by the time I'd read a third of it, I'd come to the conclusion that atmosphere is really all it has. There is some suspense, and I do still want to know how Keith's mother can apparently move very quickly between two places without being seen. However, the 'trick' was wearing a bit thin after about the third incident and the pages and pages of descriptive text eventually bored me, so I've decided life's too short and I've moved on to another book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Expensive, but fantastic","review":"This is a really high quality karaoke CD. The orchestrations are so good that sometimes I will just play the CD as background music when I am working if I don't want to be distracted by following along with the vocals. But when I do decide to sing the vocals myself, I feel like a star...I don't sound quite like Josh, but I feel like him for a little while. This is well worth the money if you love to sing and you like the songs that he sings."},{"rating":"1","title":"Some songs are messed up","review":"Some of the music are okay, (e.g. to where you are) but a lot of them were made in a low-fi fashion. Either the recording equipment was not able to sample a broadband signal, or the music themselves were made from a keyboard like instrument. A lot of the vital part of the original music were made losing its color when being interpreted this way. Moreover, never sing with this karaoke cd if you had never listen to it, even you have learnt the song in its original format by heart. In many subtle ways, the cd kind of \\"improvised\\" some melody part, but mostly in an awkward way. Some transitions that it added were just horrible, messing up the beat and emotional buildup.All in all, this is a stupid karaoke cd."},{"rating":"1","title":"amazing subject completely ruined","review":"Thomas Huxley deserves better than this meandering, plodding tome. What should have been a facinating biography is lost in the obtuse style the author uses. On the plus side--there are some very good passages and pockets of wonderful information, and the bibliography is amazingly complete. On the minus side--the shining bits are so deeply hidden in the depths of the authors quagmire style you may need a machete to find them. I also agree with some earlier posts that a thematic approach would be preferrable to a strictly chronological narrative."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hip Hop Hagiography","review":"Rarely have I encountered such an awkward and opaque writing style. Desmond uses the sampling techniques of hip-hop, producing sentences by stringing together various quotes and quote fragments. The result manifests neither rhythm nor flow as the reader must laboriously decode even the shortest sentences. The overall result is that the book which although it has fair to good factual and analytical content has a fragmentary feel about it and is in general a chore to read."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great book about a great man","review":"The book was quite thrilling. I bought it as a birthday present for my wife (who is a Huxley fan), dipped into it and was hooked. It made me go straight to some of Huxley's essays which I had bought in a second hand bookshop and which but for Desmond would be gathering dust on my bookshelves. Huxley's prose style is tremendous. Desmond's biography of Darwin (which I am reading at the moment) is also very good. Anyone with the slightest interest in the history of ideas should read both these books."},{"rating":"2","title":"Experience the magic of Aladdin!","review":"This story is about a group of kids who find a lamp.

The authors go to great length to differentiate their \\"new\\" technique for analyzing social movements, but the only conclusion I came away with was: organizing a large group of people to work towards an ill-defined goal doesn't work very well.I could have told them that.I was hoping to learn about the hows and whys of nuclear weapons protest, but the authors gave me: person A has this background, and started this organization, and it did/did not work because of factor X.

When I started taking these it really screwed up my hormones. I suddenly had 2 weeks of pms and it made my period 6 days late(it's never that late). I stopped taking the vitamin so my period would start. I thought I might be pregnant - I wasn't. I tried taking it again when my period was over. It made me start spotting and feel really bloated again. I went back to my prenatal.

Although the 5-pound bag may last me more than a year, it's still a worthwhile purchase. My kids absolutely LOVE these lollypops. The kids find the flavors delicious, not to mention they can't tell the difference between these and sugar lollypops. All they know is they're yummy and they can't get enough, which actually makes it difficult to say \\"no more\\". Please note that if you have kids, you may want to transfer some of the lollypops to a smaller bag, and hide the big bag itself.

Obviously, from now on when I buy from Amazon, I will have to actually read the whole page to see what I am actually buying (facts are on the bottom of the page) My son pointed out that the lolipops were made of sucralose, a highly cholinated sweetener of which studies have pointed out adverse effects on the body (including this one : [...] ). I am angry at Amazon.com for allowing this product to appear on the search for xylitol products.

They are very hard to find at any stores (even health food stores) and anything similar is at least twice the price. The only reason I gave them 4 stars is that they are not super sweet tasting like regular candy.

Whenever we are out to the mall or shopping or anywhere, he fidgets and chews his nails and talks and moves about and doesn't listen and can't follow directions... all of the activity overwhelms him.... ANYWAY. I looked for suckers that do not have added sugars and after a little research, I found these with a sugar alternative rather than NUTRASWEET/aspartame-- the only thing I wish was different is that I wish they had the string handles (like Saf-T-Pops). I bought them with the hope that offering them to him while waiting at the doctor or shopping at the grocery, he will have something to satisfy his oral fixation and hold his focus.He likes the flavors and they do the trick! By the way, he is 8 1/2... I DO recommend buying these if you are looking for a simple, sugar free sucker to buy yourself 5 minutes of peace from a noisy child, or to quit smoking, or when you're dieting.I hope this helps! :)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not really Splenda...","review":"Rarely do we write reviews...but this product warrants it. These lollypops were listed as \\"sweetened with Splenda,\\" but be warned Splenda is the next to last ingredient in the product...translation: about three other sweeteners, all known to cause intestinal issues, are listed earlier. If you are looking for a treat that is actually sweetened with Splenda...this is not it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Yum!!!","review":"These lollipops are wonderful!

They just didn't work for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great walking/work out sneaker","review":"I would recommend this product to any lady who has spent her life on her feet and is now having trouble finding a comfortable shoe as I have. These shoes are the only ones I can wear now and I love them for general walking and working out. The only negative is that I wear them down on the heel quite quickly while the rest of the shoe is still looking good. I wish the heels were made of stronger material."},{"rating":"1","title":"very inaccurate","review":"This book is incredibly inaccurate, perpetuating some of the Victorian era inspired myths that frankly should have died with them. It is sad that someone who actually gets published, and one would presume did a tiny bit of research could state that a sword weighed 20 pounds and required massive upper body strength to wield it. Did the author ever pick one up? The actual average weight of a knights sword of normal size is between 2.5 lb. and 3.5 lbs. Even the big hand-and-a-half swords rarely weigh more than 4.5 lbs. Same about how a knight in full plate was helpless on the ground. Again not true and just another example of how poor this book is. Don't waste your time and money."},{"rating":"2","title":"a good book","review":"This book is seemingly a culmination of the painstaking works taken by Angus Maddison for decades. As I liked his previous works such as the Phases of Capitalist Development, so I like this book very much. Of course, the book contains many 'guesstimations' that are unacceptable to today's economists' rigor. This is more so when the author ventures into almost two millenia before 1820, for which he did relatively little work previously. But even here the book apparently provides reasonable figures synthesizing existing evidences with a lucid interpretation, providing illuminating starting points for future studies."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fall down funny.","review":"Every moment of this movie is funny. Watch with the one you love.

What makes it even worse is that the opening titles are letterboxed; then you go to full frame. The film is barely better than the old tapes, as the print used is lacking in sharpness and color saturation. This is, indeed, a modern classic, arguably Chevy Chase's best film ever, and quite funny to boot. It deserves much, much, MUCH better treatment!"},{"rating":"1","title":"pales in comparison to its sequels","review":"Vacation is a decent comedy film, to be sure. But you may want to avoid this one and try the other, better, Vacation movies first (i.e. European, Christmas, Vegas). While good for several laughs, including an absolutely hilarious scene involving \\"cousin eddie,\\" this movie seems to suffer from poor directing. The dialogue often rambles and seems awfully unpolished for a John Hughes flick. Even worse, good jokes are often ruined by inappropriate music: The soundtrack seems better-suited for a video game than a major motion picture. Hardcore Chevy Chase fans will nonetheless delight at the Griswold follies, but others may want to pass."},{"rating":"1","title":"deserves less than a star","review":"this was probobly the worst movie that I have ever seen. Its not funny.Its predictable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lame American \\"comedy\\". Not one funny moment.","review":"\\"Vacation\\" is nowhere near as senseless and moronic as Monty Python, but its humor is equally lame and unfunny. See a man drop something! harharhar See a man drive his car off the road! Yuckitie yuck yuck! See a cranky old lady and crude tweens! hahaha! See the wacky and zany Griswolds! <guffaw>! I never stop being amazed by the rancid dumpster-leavings that Hollywood can convince the American public to swallow, especially in the comedy genre. If only the Griswolds picked up the nation's # 1 Proust scholar somewhere along the road- he might have been able to teach them a thing or two about comedy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best of the Series!","review":"i saw this the other night and it is still as effing funny as when i saw it at the theatre! i tried to watch the subsequent films but gave up because they were just sub par. this one still shines after all these years along with caddyshack,a christmas story and repo man-interesting to note that all three came out by or before '84."},{"rating":"2","title":"Solid comedy from before 1985","review":"Seems like every film before the year 1985 was more solid in storyline than any film from after 85. This simplistic, slapstick, and sexy (thanks to Beverly D'Angelo) film is perfect. While I don't consider the adventures of the Griswalds to be that realistic they ring true enough and hey a movie has to have story and giving a film all the depth and credibilty of real life is not possible so rent and enjoy this great comedy from when movies were still movies."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply Chevy","review":"All you wanted from Vacation and more. It's great to see these guys back again for the commentary. The only person I wished to see/hear is Beverly DeAngilo. She would have made this a 6 out of 5. It is worth every penny."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lots of Laughs!","review":"This movie is one of the funniest movies I have ever seen. I've seen all the vacation series and I love them all! Vacation is funny basicly because of the plot. A very stupid family goeing on a cross country disaster! I don't think this movie should have been rated R because Kids would laugh just as much as adults would! So take my advice-no matter how old you are-and see this movie!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Chevy's Best","review":"No matter how depressing Chevy Chase's later work was, i.e. everything he touched after 1989, this one is a staple and an American classic."},{"rating":"2","title":"CLASSIC COMEDY","review":"What more can you say about this movie?

Very disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"The perfect summer, road trip movie","review":"The first of the \\"Vacation\\" movies and probably the funniest of the bunch.Chevy Chase stars in this movie about a family of four who decide to take a mid summer, cross country drive from Chicago to LA to the Wally World amusement park(which is really Six Flags Magic Mountain). Along the way they encounter all sorts of bad luck and irate people which at the same time makes this movie so funny. The farther they get the wackier Griswold acts.Written by John Hughes and casted very well, there are a lot of great actors in this movie including Christie Brinkley,Anthony Micheal Hall, Beverly DeAngelo, Randy Quaid, and more.One think I've found dissappointing with this is the lack of extras with the DVD.If you've ever driven across country or been on Vacation with your family you'll love this movie. Even if you've lived in an Igloo your whole life, you'll probably still love this movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Likeable movie","review":"This is a likeable, fun movie with likeable characters. Many people will be able to relate to all the travel problems the Griswalds encounter. A few notes about the DVD. The movie is unfortunately in full-screen format, and the bonus features are quite skimpy. I rented this DVD and found the picture quality to be average."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best!!","review":"Hands down, one of the best comedies of the 80's. Chevy was at his best and director Harold Ramis was on a role. (Caddyshack and Stripes.)Many cuts and versions are out there but the truest I've seen, so far, is the anniversary edition. It's in widescreen (I've heard matted/cropped,not sure, but??), nice 5.1 mix, some decent special features but where are all those deleted scenes and the alternate ending?Plus, a big [..] I have. \\"I'm so exited\\" was the song played when Christie Brinkley pulls along side Chevy(Clark Griswald) in the original. Why, still is \\"Little boy sweet\\" a song also by the Pointer Sisters used instead?? Both songs were used in the movie. The latter in the truckstop sceen where Chevy eats the pissed on sandwhich.Is the copyright on that song that expensive to get it??Dunno. Great movie. Lotta fun.Best DVD of it yet. Agreed??"},{"rating":"2","title":"Nothing Special about Special Edition","review":"(This is a review of the DVD itself, not the movie.)Not sure why they decided to release a \\"special edition.\\" Really the only thing extra is the commentary, which is too busy because they have at least 4 or 5 people making comments. Not nearly as good as Chevy Chase by himself on the \\"European Vacation\\" DVD. Also, the video is a bit jumpy and seems low-quality, as if it were transferred from VHS. Sound is excellent however.Worth it just for the movie itself, but really there's not too much extra."},{"rating":"1","title":"full screen? why even bother?","review":"i have to concur with the the majority. this is a classic comedy and they reduce it to full screen. until they wise up and give it the treatment it deserves, count me out. morons."},{"rating":"2","title":"even funnier than than i remember it being","review":"i remember watching this movie more than a few years ago and thinking it was OK,but nothing great.then,having just watched it again,i really enjoyed it.i laughed a lot in all the right places.all the jokes worked worked.there's not a boring moment.and as someone who also lived through a vacation from hell which was almost a carbon copy of the one endured by the Griswold clan,i could certainly sympathize with them.of course it's always nice to see someone else go through something instead of yourself.it's hard to believe this movie came out in 1983.it still stands the test of time,in my opinion.it's one of those classics that will never(hopefully)get old.for me,Vacation is a 4/5"},{"rating":"2","title":"Family classic","review":"Successful enough to spawn a five-movie franchise, this was filmed at the height of Chevy Chase's career and capitalizes on his persona as a goofy charismatic family man. I can't think of any road movie comedies that came before this, and I can see why the success of this movie was emulated. Some of the jokes have become dated, but it's still fun to see young comedians like Randy Quaid, John Candy, and Eugene Levy ham it up for their supporting roles. Quaid is particularly funny as the white trash relative who hits the Griswalds up for cash."},{"rating":"1","title":"2 INSTALLMENT KINDA LAME...","review":"I've seen this movie many times and the older I got the less interest I had in it.

I checked other regions for this DVD and it *is* available in widescreen with French audio.

Chevy Chase is hilarious, and the family car trip storyline is obviously taken to all extremes, but still manages to touch a nerve here or there - we've all been there.

It does not tell about the evils of terrorism but shows what happened from the view of a firefighter. What i saw on this film was enough to change how I saw the events of 9/11 forever.Also part of the proceeds from this film go to the uniform firefighters fund. So not only are you getting a peice of history but you are helping a great cause as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Powerful","review":"The fact that a film crew just happened to be doing a documentary on a rookie firefighter just before 9/11 is fortunate for all who want this story to never be forgotten.

The intended documentary of the probe made the this DVD more emotional,& personal. The reason I don't give this DVD 5 stars is because they cut out Robert Deniro's intro to the documentary. I don't understand why? So, if you taped this on TV, don't record over your tape! save it. Also, the video transfer to DVD was poor, there were faint video flashes, and the DVD did not display the chapters on the menu screen so you can skip to a particular chapter. However, there is additional interviews, and footage not seen on TV. Get it anyway."},{"rating":"2","title":"No words!","review":"Great documentary. Some one mentioned something about making money off of this, unfortunately it takes money to put a product together, its only fair to try and get some of that money back, but aside from that, the bottom line is I believe a percentage of these sales is going to the Uniformed Firefighters Association Scholarship Fund."},{"rating":"2","title":"the real stuff","review":"This is a true image of what happened, not a \\"put together\\" documentary but the plain reality what happened on 9/11.

I was concerned that it would be a documentary put together by a news agency that would over dramatize an already traumatic event. Instead it was a documentary created by two French filmmakers that were brothers who got caught up right in the middle of the events of 9/11. They were originally making a documentary about a probationary firefighter finding his place in the fire company he was assigned. While creating this documentary the events of 9/11 occurred and were captured in their documentary. This is the best account of the events that occurred on that tragic day, and if you have not seen it yet, I strongly encourage you to see it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent DVD","review":"This was a fantastic programme.

The likely hood of two film makers, with cameras loaded and ready, being driven to the tragic event by the real life heros and victims is still unbelieveable even though I first saw this historical footage a few years back.

We've all seen the collection of news spots and commentary. But this film created a whole new set of emotions from its insider view. The opportunity to see the firefighters live out this horrible day brought a whole new level of understanding to this event. I found myself anxiously awaiting the news of whether the \\"Probie\\" made it out alive or not. This DVD takes you where no other account has gone. This is a must have!!! I watched it while deployed to the desert for Operation Iraqi Freedom/Operation Enduring Freedom. This reaffirmed my resolve to be in the Middle East.

I concur that the depth of 'presence' captured within delivers an experience no one else could have shared with us.That said, there is another aspect to purchasing this treasure, and my one-star is only to draw attention to my point. On January 1, 2013 this video was priced at $99.00 through Amazon. While this review will also post to 'seller' feedback, the average buyer does not generally look there.I was buying this for my Fire Lieutenant boyfriend, but couldn't justify the price. In searching elsewhere, the 9/11 Memorial in New York is selling this for $19.99. Yes, you'll pay shipping, but this 80% GOUGING is excessive for no reason. It is not a collector, nor is the $99 listing offering anything extra that the $19.99 DVD direct from 9/11 Memorial doesn't include. 911memorial.org - I'm much more gratified that my money is going to their fund."},{"rating":"2","title":"Riveting....","review":"There are not really words to describe this documentary. The first time I watched it (when it originally aired) I don't think I blinked. I cried like a baby that time and when I watched the DVD, but I thought this was an important piece of history that I would like to have to show my son (who was 3 at the time of the attacks) what it was like - and also to remind myself. It is well done. I especially liked the fact that these 2 brothers who filmed what was originally a documentary on rookie firefighters did not go for the lurid - you can hear the sounds of bodies falling, but they are not shown. One of the brothers states that someone to the right of him was screaming and on fire when he first entered the lobby of the Trade Center, but he did not think it was proper to film. The brothers did not capitalize on the horror of the situation to make money. This is by far the most complete and most compelling piece on September 11 I have seen."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well Done","review":"I never did see the CBS special on this and I was waiting for some documentary on 9/11 that I can have to remeber that God awful day in US history.What I got and saw was an extroidenary couragious account of men who had no idea what they were facing.This documentary made me really see and feel what really went on at the WTC on that horrible day.Just looking at the faces of the firefighters you knew they were going against all odds on winning their predicament that they were in.Well done and this is truly something I will keep for the rest of my life to remeber that day in September and why we are at war with terror."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awestruck","review":"The most amazing documentary I have ever seen. You have to have this to show your children and there children. This video shows the true terror and heroism that our US citizens went thru on that fateful day. You'll never look at 9/11 the same after seeing this. I cant say enough. I will own this video if only to never forget!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Mom, Get The Tissues","review":"I'm not an over emotional person but this movie acutally made me cry. No one has any idea how those acts brought Hell to Manhattan until you see it in this movie. From running, screaming, to watching and hearing people jump from the towers this movie will make you laugh in the beginning, gasp in the middle and cry at the end. It's literally impossible to explain the feelings this movie brings out in someone unless you watch it yourself. From the regular days of a firefighter, to the first plane hitting, to the exploration of the wreckage, this movie shows it all. It is something all true Americans should watch and buy to always remember, not that we won't anyway, that dreadful horrible day, 9/11."},{"rating":"2","title":"extremely powerful!!!!!","review":"When two filmmakers start out to make a documentary about a probationary firefighter, they stumble onto the most gripping documentary I have ever seen.Before this movie I always thought of the F.D.N.Y as heroes but afterwards I now have faces, names, and powerful stories to put with it.You must see this movie!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A Possible Design Flaw","review":"I was thrilled at the price for the features. 1/4, 1/8, 1/2, 4X , 32X speeds with rock solid freeze and frame advance are fantastic in this dollar range. Especially valuable are the Optical and Digital outputs. Dolby Digital is a must and a great bonus is the DTS compatibility. However, (here drops the other shoe) the transport design makes it susceptible to damage. The door is exposed from the top making it prone to misalignment if it gets hit or pushed down. I experienced \\"no disc\\" and \\"disc error\\" messages (not to mention the five second playback fake-out leading you to believe it's actually going to work). I say, \\"Bravo, Philips!\\", but back to the drawing board on this one. Perhaps a modified faceplate on the whole unit and a thinner drawer front will better protect the transport and make a dynamite product. As-is, I would expect lots of unhappy people down the road."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great DVD Player -- \\"skipping\\" not a problem","review":"This DVD Player is THE ABSOLUTE BEST in the price range offering tons of special efffect features. Many reports of \\"skipping\\" on this DVD player are true, but they have to do with the disc, not the player. Some DVD discs are recorded in a \\"duel-layer\\" format, causing a slight skip, once, at the same place on the disc every time. If the disc is recorded in this format it will say so in the fine print on the back of the cover. This \\"skipping\\" should also be prominant on other DVD players as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Title might turn away people that this book is good for","review":"While the advice in the book appears to have been too late for me, the advice and strategies talked about in this book make a lot of sense and help to debunk a lot of traditional Freudian psychoanalytic therapy methods.Most of this book would be helpful for anybody whether in the throes of divorce problems or not. I view it as sound advice for relationship building in general."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best","review":"This is by far THE BEST book on helping your marriage I have ever read...for anyone who doesn't like it, I truly don't know what to say...simple, very effective techniques. The best part is both of you don't have to read this book, or do most of the suggested things to try and it still works awesome. I was a little skeptical when I first started reading it until I stared using some of the ideas and boy was I surprised to see how well it worked in a very short period of time! Unlike some books that can you make you feel like you are in some way being degraded or having to make all the sacrifices to try to make the marriage work all by yourself, this is nothing like that at all. Unless you have a totally closed mind, this book works! I strongly urge you to buy it if you are having issues in your relationship."},{"rating":"1","title":"sls04@sprynet.com","review":"I was very excited when I got this book, but was disappointed after reading it, even though I did follow the advice the book gave. Weiner-Davis's quick-fix approach sounds good on the page, but in truth it just doesn't get to the bottom of any problems. More often than not, ignoring the problem seems to be the rule of thumb here, and that will just build resentment when nothing is really resolved. Also, Weiner-Davis succumbs to the very easy gender stereotypes that are so prevalent in the _Men Are From Mars, Women Are From Venus_ series. Basically, she says men are this way and women are that way. If you like the _Mars/Venus_ books and think critical analysis of a couple's problems is just fine, however, you'd probably like this book. For the couple wanting to fix the problem rather than ignore it, however, this book is just not going to do it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible advice- DO NOT BUY","review":"Her advice is to do what works and bend over backwards for your cheating abusive spouse. If you appease him/her and make them happy it must be working, right? Wrong. She advocates keeping their abusive behavior a secret because if you tell then the person may leave you. Her forum's are awful and just an attempt to pull people into the expensive phone counseling which is not successful. You spend a fortune to have untrained people (yup, not even counselors) tell you nonsense like \\"be the spouse only a fool would leave\\", \\"keep his cheating ways a secret- you will ruin the chance of recovery\\" or other vague silly mantras that do not work.There are much better books out there that provide excellent plans for making a marriage work. I found \\"love must be tough\\" by Dobson to be amazing for a troubled marriage."},{"rating":"2","title":"great book","review":"This book describe how to change your thinking or views on situation that most people are not raise with. This book has help me to stop and think and make changes about myself. Which has helped with how I react in my marriage. I am reading it over just to keep the advise in my thoughts so I don't go back to my old habits of thinking."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must read for someone trying to reconcile...","review":"If you are trying to save your marriage by yourself - then get this book and practice it's concepts. The book is well-written and easily understood. It has helped me tremendously in attempting to reconcile my marriage."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great starting point","review":"The book is a \\"getting started\\" approach to getting a marriage back on track. The solution based method is a \\"let's do this now and not worry about your childhood method\\". This allows marital issues to be addressed immediately, and she claims, for a couple to find some success immediately as well. However, the author doesn't acknowledge that some of those deep seated issues may well need to be addressed--even if they come after the immediate conflict is resolved. I would definitely recommend this book to anyone who is starting to think that divorce is an option--it's a great place to start."},{"rating":"1","title":"Iv'e had better material","review":"If you think of finding a solution on how to save your precious marriage with this book,i wont waste too much time on it giving it a thought! This is one of the books written from the authors point of view,and will make you feel guilty.from ALTER EGO in Tula OK"},{"rating":"2","title":"Offers assertive techniques to repair a marriage.","review":"I felt this book had much to offer. I appreciated the authors belief that marriages are worth saving. She puts forth helpful, assertive techniques that can be used together or alone. But most importantly she reminds you that you have to be happy with yourself before you can find happiness in a relationship."},{"rating":"1","title":"What the Book Leaves Out","review":"This may be one of the most popular books; however, my experience with the book created a sorrowful ending. While attending marriage councelling, my ex and I were told to read this book. I had already been the one all along to change for my partner, and this book had me do that again. Against my better judgement, I changed again to effect a change, in the hopes of saving my marriage. It suggested to try something different, anything different. I say, if you are the one who has already become the chameleon, and the other person wishes to change nothing, you are working with a brick wall. All my changes did nothing, even initiating sex with him after two years resulted in the distinct feeling of being raped. No, I recommend being very careful."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Help","review":"I found this book very helpful in understanding what I can do to make things better. I recommend this to anyone who wants their marriage to succeed and thrive."},{"rating":"1","title":"TERRIBLE ADVICE THAT DOES NOT WORK","review":"DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK. DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK. Advice does NOT work. Rarely if ever.Go to her website for examples of hundreds of people trying to savetheir marriage. This advice is for doormats. Michelle is more worriedabout selling books than actually analyzing why her ideas don't work.Again, go to her website and you will see hundreds of unsuccessful peopletrying to save their marriages with little or no success Obviously Michelledoesn't practice what she preaches regarding \\"do what works\\" because theresults and success rate on her site is terrible. The proof is in the results.How sad. I give it one star only because that was the least amount available.Should be zero. This is all about making money off of hurting people that will buyanything to give them hope. Total rip off that does NOT work. Go to her site for proof."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad Accoustics...","review":"These picks would have been great because of the rubber grip but the actual pick part that plays the string is also rubber! What were they thinking! The strings do not play crisp and clean. Strums sound muted and you cannot do fast action picking effectively. So a 2 for a good grip idea but bad accoustics."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sounds Nice","review":"Sounds nice. If your picking on an acoustic it's not quite loud enough. Not only that but they wear down easily, and leave rubber dust on the beautiful finish of the guitar. It's pretty hard to get the rubber dust off. It's worth a try if you don't mind getting a bunch of rubbish on your guitar."},{"rating":"1","title":"sound nice but wear very fast","review":"I bought this pick because my previous pick was slipping too much...But ultimately I didn't like this one at all because it wears very quickly and leave little perks of rubber on guitar. This one is very horrible product. But it sounded nice as it is rubber. Not for long run use..."},{"rating":"1","title":"slow and grabs","review":"No,no no. This is a bad idea. the pick does not glance or glide off the strings. you have to pull the pick off and away from the string."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not So Good","review":"I really wanted to like these picks. I didn't. They were thick (I knew that going in) and uncomfortable to hold. The material made the sound extra-muted. If you're looking for a finger-picking sort of tone/sound, then learn to finger-pick.... you'll appreciate the tone coming from your own fingers more than these."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hard or Soft? They felt the same.","review":"I bought one of each Soft, Medium and Hard Wedgie rubber picks and even though the colours were right, the Hard is as soft as the Soft. They felt exactly the same in fact. The Medium was the hardest out of the bunch.Packaging error? I have no idea. The fact that each stiffness only comes in one colour and the colours were right lead me to think something is wrong with the manufacturing. So check with what you get.Sound wise, the rubber really removes the treble on my acoustic guitar, making it sound really dull and muted.There is a lot more friction from the rubber on the strings that I do not think it is idea for strumming.The only reason I can think of using is if you want to reduce the noise but frankly, you would have much more control if you used your fingers instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"If you like sticky, slow picks this one's for you","review":"If I had to say something good, it would be that the pick is easy to grasp and a decent size.Otherwise, I found it stuck to my strings and was annoying to use and slowed my play.I play a 6 string acoustic - soft rock, bluegrass, etc. Maybe another type of guitar player would like it.Luckily, it was a cheap buy."},{"rating":"2","title":"bass guitar pick","review":"Of the two types of rubber picks, one being medium and this one being hard, I preferred the hard rubber. It took less time to get used to it and I loved the mellow sound it gives the strings. I have a Fender Jazz bass and a Beatle bass copy andboth guitars sounded great. With the Beatle bass copy being semi hollow in design, the sound the pic gave was very close to using the fingers to play the bass."},{"rating":"2","title":"Feels great to hold","review":"Right out of the package I loved this pick. It's nice and thick with a soft rubber texture making it comfortable to hold. I like a nice warm round tone and this is perfect for that. It's also nice that the rubber grips the strings so it's less cumbersome. The only downside I could see is that after a lot of shredding you'll actually wear off the rubber and have to replace these, but it seems worth it to me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Does what I advertises","review":"This is a very thick pick and so those who like very small ones do not buy. As for sound quality though; it is by far one of the best picks I have ever used. It really gets rid of that distinct pick sound you get with flimsy picks. It is also quite comfortable, but it does take some getting use to on placement."},{"rating":"2","title":"The sound of your thumb while saving your thumb from wear and tear.","review":"This is a fun pick. I play a lot with my fingers and thumb and thought I'd give this a try. Its great! I love the tone of this pick striking strings. I love the way it transmits the feel of the strings. More organic than plastic picks. Yes it might crumble on you if you play too hard. I think if you play as hard with this pick as you would with your thumb you'll be fine. Its a lot of fun and for such a little price can open your playing to different tones for your instrument. Worth a try."},{"rating":"1","title":"not what I expected.","review":"I purchased these picks, because I play bass in an alternate punk metal band. We play drop tuning and playing with a plastic or nylon pick creates alot of noise. I was hoping that these picks would stop the pick noise. They don't make that annoying plastic to metal sound, but they are very flexible. I need to have alot of pick speed. These slow me down way to much. The other reviews I read stated that these were like rigid picks, but no they are not. Too bad as i had high hopes.Good picks if you don't have to tremolo pick, not very good if do have to."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not very intelligent","review":"It's another French anti-establishment movie, with no surprises. A politician gets away with hiring goons. The movie implies you can't sue in France in civil court, so you have to take the law into your hands. There is much that is illogical, such as a policeman pretends to seek a bribe so his chief can remain for a while to investigate a murder. Far-fetched.PS: I also don't like the investigation methods used by the police in France in this movie--what the cops in the movie themselves call Gestapo methods. That's not detective work but beatings."},{"rating":"1","title":"Choose Another Book","review":"The organization and the treatment given to most subjects are well below what one would expect for a Wikipedia entry on each respective topic.Anyone who uses this book for any kind of self-study is unlikely to get more out of it more than a few examples on multiplying matrices, row reduction, and some poetry about eigen-spaces and vector spaces.Take a look at \`\`Linear Algebra Done Right'' by Alxr."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best!","review":"This book is probably one of the best math books I have ever worked with. The last time I wrote a review for this book, I gave it 2 stars; now, after going through the whole book, I'm able to give it 5 stars. No matter what your major is, and no matter how advanced you are, this book has something to offer. It is example-oriented, easy to follow, and right to the point. Each chapter starts off with theory and ends with applications. Each section starts with basic definitions and easy problems and ends with theorems and harder probrems. The 2nd edition is pretty much the same as the 3rd edition, so don't waist money for nothing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too much theory, and confuses vectors with matrix operations","review":"Honestly, I would have never known that there was a better way to do this if I hadn't had to drop this class last fall for medical reasons, then retake it this spring with different prof. and different book. This d____ed book goes out of its way to make things confusing, causing too much memorization, and intertwines what a vector space is with matrix operations. It really does not have to be this confusing. Further, the guy does not teach you how to do proofs, but then requires you to do them in homework. He doesn't teach you where to start from, or what to think of when doing a proof. Linear Algebra is a tough class to begin with. It is known to be abstract and theoretical. Lay does not need to make an already challenging subject more challenging by presenting it in such a confusing way. Thank God I had to drop last fall. I'd have gotten a C or a D (and I'm a straight A student) if I'd had to stick with the Lay book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent text for an introduction to linear algebra","review":"This text is a dream to read compared to many other mathematics texts. Lay's writing style is clear, and he rightly stays away from using wording that distracts the reader from the theory he presents. Mathematical notation is introduced before it is used, and proofs are placed in an appendix.Overall, this is a very good book for undergraduate study. It won't carry you through graduate classes, but it might be useful as a support book if you have a weak background in the topic. Math majors who love concise formalism and extended proofs should stay away from this book. Engineers, business, physical science, and social science majors will find the text very helpful."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best linear algebra text that I've taught from","review":"Students in my linear algebra course have typically liked thisbook.From my perspective as an instructor, I like the order in whichtopics are presented, the emphasis on reasonable use of technology, and the depth of the material, which is just aboutright for our course. However, some sections are not as clearly written as others, and because there is too much material for a one semester course, the instructor has to carefully pick which sections to cover."},{"rating":"1","title":"Jumps around and Lacks important information","review":"I think David C. Lay does not try to help the student with this book. Instead, he wants the student to work for the solution. This is fine some of the time, but not all of the time. I think this book was written from a perspective that most students already know what he is talking about. The examples are inadequate for the problems in the book and the solutions guide always says something really helpful like, \\"Look in your textbook for the answer\\". I like Linear Algebra, but I don't like getting the run around when I get lost. I am using Elementary Linear Algebra by Ron Larson and Bruce Edwards as a supplementary text and it will be the book that I keep after the course is over. On the other hand, Lay's book is going back to the campus bookstore."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not very thorough","review":"This book is not very thorough. Most of the examples are near impossible to do without a previous knowledge on the subject and other resource material. The solution's guide explains every 7th odd problem, which is extremely frustrating as well. The course material goes much too quickly. DON'T BUY THIS BOOK! It's just not worth it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Constructive Criticism","review":"I already know some linear algebra, but not its applications. I am trying to learn on my own. I do * not * need comments for odd questions \\"That the student really should look this up on his own because it is not good to rely too much on answers.\\"I ordered the book so I would have answers to at least the odd problems.I like the way the book asks questions that are not really too difficult but require knowing what is going on. It allows me to gain the knowledge for something I do not know by looking at the answers (if they were all there) to the odd problems."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor book","review":"Not a good text. Even with the accompanying study guide most of the problems are only briefly explained. Multiple choice \\"did you read it\\" questions, often full of hidden word traps, are not directly answered in the book.The study guide merely refers the reader to a vague paragraph and page number. This strategy ignores the obvious fact that if the reader got the question wrong they clearly didn't understand that paragraph in the text."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book sucks.","review":"By far the worst texbook that I have ever had the misfortune to be assigned. I had to drop the course because of it. The language requires a translator to interpret, the problems are presented in an unclear manner, and worst of all, you cannot verify whether your answers are correct, because the book tells you that you should already know them. Avoid this book at all costs. I recommend any book by Robert Busby."},{"rating":"1","title":"Babble","review":"I like Math, Not circler illogic. Took this course in 1997; while my professor was initially excited since he had known Lay, he soon simply shook his head in disgust, and said he needs to talk to his old friend."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Costume","review":"I purchased this costume for my 6 year old son who wanted a batman costume for Christmas. I was searching for a costume that was of better quality than what is found during halloween. The item arrived nicely packaged and when my son put the item on he was thrilled. The neck was tight as the previous review stated and we were unable to button the cap as it was too tight on my son's neck so I will be altering this for him. The quality of the costume was surprisingly good and the overall look and feel of the costume seemed to warrant the somewhat pricey cost of the costume. I am very pleased with the item and would only suggest being aware of the undersized neckline and button and be prepared to alter."},{"rating":"2","title":"Batman Costume","review":"My 6 year old grandson loves the costume. There was one problem however. Although I purchased a medium, the neck closure was very tight, (it would not button) requiring alteration. (He is in the 50th percentile for weight and height). I had to increase the opening an inch around and re-bind."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Hammond B3 Jazz Quintet","review":"Steve's group features himself on the Hammond B3 along with Nate Pruitt, a vocalist from the San Francisco area and great musicians to fill in with horns, guitar and percussion.Lots of jazz standards and some incredible vocals from Nate. Nate brings a wonderful, warm and very passionate voice to the driving sound of the incredible B3. I'd give this album top ratings just for Nate's singing but the real joy of this album is the combination of artists that make this music.It's not wild, it's not far out, it's just good jazz. Perhaps a bit more in the realm of smooth sound but not totally in the world of smooth jazz. Solos are good, well delivered and show good inspiration.I love B3 music - some say I'm addicted to it - well, that may be true - but it's a good addiction. Buying music can't be anything harmful to your health, right?Highly recommended as part of your library of jazz featuring the B3."},{"rating":"2","title":"These are a big help in German class","review":"Not a whole lot to review here, what you see is what you get. Even in this day & age, having a quick reference guide like this is invaluable for writing papers, reviewing vocabulary & dealing with the oft-dreaded feminine/masculine/neutral distinction assigned in German which is not assigned to words in the English language. I wish I'd had these back when I was studying in middle & high school- I would've retained my German studies better (this was back in pre-Internet days). I'm now a late-to-the-game college student and need all the help I can get! I've found this sheet to be consistently accurate & easy-to-comprehend."},{"rating":"2","title":"Handy","review":"My husband and I are not young pups and we want to learn German. Not so easy for someone with no background. The Quick Grammar guide is a handy fast reference and I'd recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hauntingly Beautiful Chicester; this album's a keeper!","review":"\\"Chicester Psalms\\" has long been one of my favorite contemporary choral works, possessing a passion and pathos typical of Bernstein works but without the customary weight or cynicism; more approachable, somehow. This recording of \\"Chicester\\" is warm, intimate, and-- unlike almost every recording of it I've encountered-- in tune! While I find the tempi a touch speedy to my liking, particularly the middle section of the second movement, the primary theme of the second movement moved me to an astonishing degree--absolutely gorgeous. My only real \\"criticism\\" of the recording is, perhaps, an insufficient sense of \\"blending\\" in the final mix (microphone placement emphasizing one or two voices, etc). Beyond that, and especially for the price!, this little gem is worth having in the library."},{"rating":"1","title":"can't hear the singers","review":"I bought this CD to hear the chorus and the soloists. All you can hear is the orchestra. I had it up REALLY LOUD and I could barely hear the singers at all. I threw it away."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not For Me","review":"This product did not work for my coarse, curly hair. Instead of looking shiny and nourished, Optimum Oil Therapy Shine Booster left my hair looking dull and dry--which defeated the purpose of me putting on a moisturizing product in the first place. Worst of all, the product was very difficult for me to wash out of my hair--so much so that it took four consecutive washings to get it out! Needless to say, I won't be using Optimum Oil Therapy Shine Booster any more."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Looking Products","review":"They cancelled my order without notifying me.

I have a few flames on my bike, so I wanted this one. My complaint is that the screw ball fastener is plastic and the threads are metal. That'll last about one day with me---I'm too active.

You cannot see any of the components. There are two very small (dime size) LED pods that are integrated in to my gauge package on the Speedometer that appear to be factory blinkers and are unnoticeable as anything other than factory lights. The front and rear detectors are installed completely inside/underneath the bumper covers so you could only see them by completely disassembling the front and rear of the car. The Laser diffuser is neatly hidden inside the center front grill opening and with the grill covers in place is undetectable as well. The system comes with a clever remote to control all functions and settings, and is a simple as using a remote on a DVD player."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't be deceived by this book!","review":"This book neglects many of the most well know cults of today, and instead speaks about the 7th Day Adventist Church and those who keep the real Sabbath Day (as written in the 4th Commandment). Sunday worship is the Mark of Satan's authority (the counterfeit to God's true Sabbath), therefore making it the \\"Mark of the Beast\\". It was created by the Roman Catholic Church in 321 A.D. (by Constantine) and all those who keep Sunday are unknowingly following the Catholic Church (the \\"Mother of Harlots\\") and the \\"Dragon\\" who controls it. This is the truth!! Edmond C. Gruss (a former Jehovah's Witness) mixes truth with serious error and his intentions are questionable at best. BEWARE!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing Freddy","review":"While the Freddy series on the whole is fantastic, this one was disappointing. None of the out-loud laughs you get from a title like FREDDY GOES TO FLORIDA. Definitely don't start with this one if you're new to Freddy, or you might not try another.

Whatever category you want to through him under, Kistenmacher is worth a listen, and Starting Again has some wonderful moments to prove that.

I have tried a whole bunch of different detterent methods. This was a last resort due to the cost. The sensor works well and I think it could easily do a great job, if it didn't leak at the hose connection. I think If I buy a new hose and epoxy it in place it might work. I might just do that anyway, because you have to pull it out of the ground to take the hose off it anyway. Which brings me to my next gripe. The female connection for the hose on the stake does not have a turnable piece like the end of your hose does. This means that to screw in the hose you have to either turn your hose, or the sprinkler. Neither of these options works well, and to all they would need to do is put a 2cent piece of plastic on the end. Oh well. To sum up the motion sensor works as advertised, but it leaks like crazy.

A bonus is that it occasionally picks up a squirrel, and so has helped a bit with that problem too. The only negative is that the sensor will be fooled by wind (e.g., plants swaying in the breeze) and as such it goes off unnecessarily on some days. I generally turn the scarecrow off during the day, so really this has not been much of a problem for me.

I love my cat but was getting increasingly frustrated at him with each episode. Then came the Scarecrow. The bait was set, we easily assembled the Scarecrow turned it on and watched...Sure enough Mr. Hobbs went sneaking around the house into the garden, then POW!

It triggers so often that a change in shade or moving air can set it off. I used a fixed 9V supply to get away from changing batteries every week.Sensor looses sensitivity over time. Level 5 was enough at the beginning to set it off by a larger dog from 15 feet. At the end of it life span I had it on max and I could jump furiously in front of the sensor to get it started. Every smaller animal can easily walk straight in front of the device without getting wet. Even the deer came back once they noticed it's not working anymore.Conclusion: If your plants are more than $50 every 2 month go and get a good supply of the Scarecrows.

The cover is costly at about $2,400. Unfortunately, our three beagles like to run and play on it. Their claws damage it badly and I had to find a way to keep them off the cover. I found the Scarecrow Sprinkler on the Internet and decided to try it as a dog deterrent. I located the Scarecrow next to the pool, fiddled with the adjustments until it was aimed correctly and waited to see what would happen when the dogs decided to play on the cover. Predictably, they soon ran on the cover and were instantly greeted with a high pressure spray of water which they thoroughly hate. It only took a few such encounters for them to learn that they would get a spray bath if they got on the pool cover. The Scarecrow's range is excellent and it's sensitivity is adjustable.

The miniature dachshund also loves to attack it -- setting the nozzle off which makes her bark and growl even more insanely at it.It has NOT, however, kept a great blue heron from taking fish from our koi pond. Just this morning I found yet another speared (but not eaten) very large dead goldfish laying on the lawn nearby -- seemingly captured by the heron and then abandoned. Since this is the third fish we've lost since installing the scarecrow -- I would suggest it might scare the bird away from consuming all the fish, after it steals one fish, but it does not keep it away altogether."},{"rating":"2","title":"Keeps cat poop out of my garden","review":"As the title says, I bought this mainly to keep the cats from digging out my plants and pooping in my garden. It works. Totally worth the money to me. I put it in the corner of my garden. It has adjustable levels of sensitivity so it won't sense me walking 20 feet away and the sprinkler can be adjusted to it doesn't spray the fence on the sides. When it turns on, it is pretty noisy, so even without spraying the trespassers, it scares them by sound. It only stays on for a few seconds so it doesn't soak my garden or waste a lot of water. LOVE IT!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for rabbits.","review":"Product just won't spray rabbits. Spent the last week moving the Scarecrow to different areas of the lawn, changing the angle is was inserted in, playing around with different sensitivity levels and all for naught. It just won't pick up the presence of anything as small as a rabbit. Every morning I went out and there were fresh piles of rabbit droppings all within the range of the Scarecrow. Disappointing, since I really wanted this to work!For critters larger than a rabbit, it probably would work fine so I am giving it two stars instead of one.We did manage to spray a few guests as they came up the sidewalk to our front door though."},{"rating":"1","title":"Deceptive advertising","review":"The information on the product indicated that it would work with cats. There was even a photo of a cat. The directions stated that it has difficulty with small animals. During testing, a cat walked close by with no results. Also, the website photo showed a foot petal to help drive it into the ground. The product has no foot petal, making it very difficult to drive it into the ground. The sprayer needs to be driven deep to stay up during the spraying, due to its force. I decided to get a refund."},{"rating":"2","title":"So far keeping the deer away","review":"I bought this product to keep the deer away. I have used numerous things on my flowers without success, I was tired of having my flowers gobbled up by those nuisance deer. They may be pretty but certainly can do a lot of damage to my flower garden. Since I set up the scarecrow I have not had another flower eating attack. Even the squirrels have mostly stayed away, no holes in my flower garden. I put it on at night, turn the water on and turn it up to about 6 sensitivity, its been working well. I turn the water off and turn the sensitivity off through the day. The deer come at night. So far I'm pleased with it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Does the job","review":"If you are having problems with dogs or cats in your flower beds, this product is the way to go. I was having problems with the neighbor's dogs and cats, as well as two cats that just decided to live with us. I purchased this item about a month ago and already have moved it to another location as the critters do not care to walk even close to where it was originally placed. As a matter of fact, our dogs had to go by the flower bed where the scarecrow was first placed to get out into the yard from the house. They would stand on the porch and only go past the flower bed when convinced they needed to do so. They went in a dead run and had to be let back into the house from the garage because they did not want to get sprayed on the way back in. Plus, it is good comic relief to see them meander into the spray zone for the first time or two!"},{"rating":"2","title":"scarecrow motion activated sprinkler","review":"the most effective and efficient way to keep deer off your garden.

The Scarecrow works as advertised, have had to replace the battery twice, seem to last about two months with a high sensitivity setting. The garden is \\"protected\\" by fishing line every 12-18 inches up to more than 6 feet, which the deer learned pretty quick to just jump over. Since they cannot see the lines, I think they just made sure they cleared the top of the corner posts.After setting up the Scarecrow, the second night the deer jumped in, got blasted, and left fishing line trailing out behind them! Haven't been back in the garden since, but they have found our roses and other flowers - we will be ordering a couple more Scarecrows!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Super and fun!!!!","review":"After dear ravaged my vegetable garden (didn't know they like jalopeno peppers) I put up 7' fencing, yeah, like that stopped them!

The first morning after I used it there was signs of water all over the place and my fencing was intact and they haven't been back. No chemicals and simple to use. As for the \\"fun\\" part - I didn't realize that my neighbors son who parks his car on the other side of my fence was in sensing range and he got a surprise one morning when he went to get in his car!

Also went off a lot with nothing around.Decided to try liquid fence instead. My Mom swears by the stuff."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love this product","review":"The motion activated sprinkler is exactly what we needed to be able to grow plants and trees in our deer infested yard. I love watching the deer jump away when startled by the sprinkler. I have new growth on my fruit bushes which I was told I wouldn't be able to plant because of the number of deer in our area.(The deer practically sleep 6 feet from the house and eat everything in sight). I love that it is a humane way to keep the deer away from our plants. The only issue we have is that the motion sensor is so sensitive, sometimes the wind blowing the long grasses can set the sprinkler off- but I look at it as a way to ensure my plants get watered."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheap plastic","review":"It works, but the hose housing is really cheap plastic that leaks and is easy to break."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best solution to keep cats away from your yard","review":"This is a great solution to keep cats (or other animals) away from your yard. It is easy to install and works really well. I installed in my yard and within days, all signs of cats were gone. The knob to adjust the sensitivity of the scarecrow is a bit tricky to calibrate and the sensitivity of the sensor varies with temperature. It took a bit of trial and error to figure out where to set it and prevent a water splash when people or cars are passing. Overall, a great tool and a great solution."},{"rating":"2","title":"turns your dog into an idiot","review":"Bought this for my son-in-law as a gift at his request.

My only complaint is that there is not enough vertical control of the height of the spray. I have mine near the bird feeders and it was hard to adjust it so that it sprayed the cat, but didn't hit the feeders above. I had to tilt the whole unit down, which then affected the distance that the IR beam reached.

They work really well, every time I cut the grass, or go to the mailbox I get sprayed.... but as far as the heron, it does not scare the Heron at all. I have seen the Heron fly on the fence, wait for the sprinkler to go off, then fly down get a Koi and fly off. While the Heron flew off, then the sprinkler came on again.I hope you listen to this review and don't waste your money!!!They do make cute yard ornaments!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"What a waste of money!","review":"I eagerly anticipated scaring off the critters that made a nightly (and daily) smorgasboard of our garden. Instead, what I got was a flooded garden. Just about anything moving will set this device off, and our garden is fairly close to the edge of the woods. When there is a breeze, plants move around... and the sprinkler is set off.I adjusted the senstivity to the point where it didn't work any more, and the bottom line is I was unable to get any decent performance.Save your money. I assume all the other people who bought this and used it successfuly use it in a very sheltered environment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not robust enough","review":"The scarecrow works. That is it works under ideal circumstances. We have a lot of landscaping and wind trips it too easy. It trips so much (when no animal is nearby) that the batteries run down and it is useless when it is needed. If you have an open area that you're wanting to protect it probably will work fine.

Before I started using this product the deer were eating everything in my garden. Once I set up the sprinklers the deer ceased to be a problem. They deer appear to remember that the sprinklers are there and now keep their distance -- sometimes right on the periphery of the sprinkler's sensing range. I currently have four in use with two back-ups in the shed. Despite being a few years old and having been through some rough winters, mineral deposits, harsh sun, etc., they still work. Highly recommended for keeping deer and turkeys away. In my experience, cats are less deterred."},{"rating":"2","title":"It really works!","review":"This worked like a charm - you just have to remember it will get you too!! You should also know - DON'T USE AN OLD WATERHOSE!!!!! The hose split in two from the pressure and the water ran for a day and a half! NOT the sprinkler's fault - mine for using an old hose. I didn't learn my lesson, and used another \\"newer\\" older hose and it did the same thing, luckily we didn't have the water turned on as strong as we did the first time - which you don't need much water anyway so we learned our lesson on that. My advice - go buy a brand new hose for the sprinkler. The dogs and cats \\"use\\" to love to walk right through my flower bed and the cats of course use to think it was their easy access litter box - but NO more thanks to the scarecrow. The cats won't even walk towards the flowerbed direction. I wish I had this sprinkler several years ago - it would have saved a lot of headaches.

As you can tell by the 5 star review, this works exactly as described and I was also able to adjust it so I'm not accidentally watering my mailman or UPS guy. (I'm pretty sure they're also glad of that fact as well.) I put this on a 7 setting and also adjusted the angle down, so it's only spraying about 3-5 feet in front, rather than the sidewalk. It's extremely easy to set up and the sticker's give it a little personality. As a side note, it does need a 9 volt battery and it's not included, so just make sure you have one before you get started, so you don't have to wait. Zero tools are required to put it together."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good product","review":"I bought this product to help protect some corn sprouts from crows ( worked fine ).

Since I set it up I haven't seen any further evidence of attempted break in.The motion sensor sensitvity can be adjusted. It works well and has good range.I do wish that it came with a high ground stake or had one available as an option. It does sit very low and most plants will overgrow it and block the sensor view. I suppose you can make one pretty easily by sticking the stake into the end of a PVC pipe and staking the pipe to the ground.

The spray also malfunctioned and just made a serious little flood. I found the tiny piece that had shot itself out of the sprinkler head and corrected this but if I hadn't it's life span would have been about a week.

I installed a splitter on the hose bib and hooked up the sprinkler after applying the yellow stickers and hooking up the battery. It worked like a charm right off the bat and is keeping the chickens off of our back patio (40ft x 25ft) .The sprinkler only fires for a few seconds when the adjustable motion sensor is activated so it doesn't waste much water. Our first battery lasted about 4 months of daily use.I highly recommend this motion activated sprinkler to keep chickens out of an area."},{"rating":"1","title":"Deer like scarecrows","review":"Three of these going off one day as we drove up on the driveway to see three dear munching under their spray"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't work!","review":"It worked for a week, then started shooting in one direction (the settings are correct), then just stopped working at all :-( Very disappointed!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"a little leaky but effective!","review":"The gizmo is easy to put together, and is very effective at deterring the huge deer population in our area, as well as rabbits and so far, squirrels. It's also fun to trigger the motion sensor and run like mad to get out of its way.However, it is a little leaky, from the top of the unit where the spray is emitted, after every trigger.

Influenced by the encouraging reviews, purchased this product on two occasions (the second time after our memory had faded about the poor experience the first time around). Besides the cheaply-made sensor housing, the mechanism is erratic and doesn't closely reproduce its stated intent. In an effort to create the ideal \`conditions' for the ScareCrow, we even purchased a pressure reducer as well as a new set of 9V batteries (as suggested in the manual ). To no avail. At best, this item may have amused our local wildlife; certainly didn't trouble them. The ScareCrow (at least to us) was a waste of money, highly unreliable, and not effective in its intended purpose."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wouldn't suggest it","review":"Works good but leaks constantly. Followed the directions on how to stop the leak from the sprayer, didn't do any good, still leaked. The motion detector works great and the spray goes a long way, it's just the constant leak that is the problem.

Our garden this year has been one of the best ever, with complete protection. The only issue we had was when the battery ran out and we missed 2 days (and lost 2 tomato plants and much of a blackberry!). This thing works really well, even when we are gone on vacation. We use it on the highest sensitivity (covers about a 30 foot semicircle) and change the battery every 30 days. It doesn't use that much water either, since the sprinler is only on for about 2 seconds.

In fact, several years later, as an RN myself, I still sneak it off my bookshelf to re-read now and again. There are many stories from all facets of nursing subspecialties. Having worked medical surgical nursing, I can personally vouch for the accuracy of my favorite chapter, chapter six, \\"The Long Hallway.\\" The stories are diverse and compelling. It's a well written book that has potential to entertain a wide audience. Medical terminology is clearly defined for those unfamiliar with it.

There's no discussion of why you would take a specific approach, or when you need to take specific steps.I also bought Home Networking for Dummies, which is the most well-designed approach to networking I've read.

Child welfare workers, adoption workers, etc. are not well-versed on this topic and may present the basic rate to you as the only thing available. Read on...adoption is a win/win situation when you understand your rights financially. Read this and then negotiate your AAP agreement armed with accurate information.

People may attempt to classify this particular album into a genre but I see it as great material regardless. If you know anyone that doesn't care for \\"industrial\\" music let them listen to \\"Epitath\\" or \\"Stateless\\" and don't tell them that it is industrial; therefore, you wont help to pre-determine their own opinions and as a result they will find greatness."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cerebrally pleasing","review":"First I have to thank a friend for telling me that Cyber-Tec is now C-tec.

When she wakes up her friend has seemingly disappeared and everyone on the train said she never existed (in fact, I believe that this is the same plot that has been borrowed for a new movie that I saw the commercial of in theaters).The end is one of Hitchcock's best plot twists.

The picture is great, no \\"static\\", etc. But the sound is very poor, no better than my VHS tape copy. It fades in and out, especially during dialogue and then blares forth at other times.

Through the use of \\"wipes\\" the Criterion people show you a before and after version of the cleaned-up print. Very neat.There is also a commentary from a film historian which is interesting, if a bit dry. I didn't get a chance to listen to the whole thing yet.This is a good Hitchcock movie.

Very poor video and audio quality, it is impossible to figure out what was \\"Enhanced\\" on this DVD. The sound is muddy and the video is very soft. Certainly not worth the asking price.

No doubt that within a decade, the use of computers will be able to fully restore these films by filling in all the missing dots.The Lady Vanishes is one of the most imitated films ever. Basil Radford and Naunton Wayne are great as the homosexual pair disdaining almost everything. And Margaret Lockwood shines as one of the great (though little known) beauties of the century, somewhat of a cross between Myrna Loy and Vivian Leigh . All three were reunited in Carol Reed's Night Train to Munich just two years later.It might be interesting to compare the performances of Radford and Wayne to that of Jim Parsons in the Big Bang Theory. What we take for granted in film today was built upon the reels of the past. If everything were so obvious from the start, the Wright brothers would just have built a stealth bomber at Kittyhawk."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Lady Vanishes into Fun Film","review":"I love this movie so much,\\"The Lady Vanishes\\".Early Alfed Hichcock at his early best.Story is fun to watch as it move on.Magart Lockwood is a woman you,just love her in this movie.If you find a copy that good,buy it or if you see it on TV watch it.

For the price they are asking, better care should have been spent on the sound quality of one of the early masterpieces of the master of suspense. The sound is exactly the same as on my VHS version, varying between extreme shrill and loud sound and soft, incomprehensible sound. If the original sound source is so bad that no doctoring up will help, then at least have titles or Closed captioning to help us out. Picture quality is good and the only thing that saves this from receiving no stars. How can we enjoy a mystery if half the dialogue is unheard? Criterion has let us all down and has dumped on Hitch. They have not served him or us well.

Totally bummed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cool, but not durable","review":"We got this diaper bag for our first child mainly because my husband is the stay-at-home dad and and I wanted him to feel comfortable walking around with the diaper bag. While the bag looks cool, and lasted for the first three months of our son's life, I've been overall disappointed with the size, feeling like we needed to fight with the bag to close it every time we went everywhere, and yesterday was the final straw when the shoulder strap broke in the middle of the sidewalk. I think this bag is just not meant to be a primary diaper bag. It's difficult to fit everything you need in your primary diaper bag and still close both straps. I often found myself just closing one strap and letting the other hang to make it work. This will probably work as a \\"dad bag\\" where you're packing the bare essentials for a father/baby outing, but I wouldn't recommend it as an everyday use bag."},{"rating":"2","title":"A first-rate book for anyone who wants to know about Jesus.","review":"Barclay has a problem with the virgin birth, and he seems to have explanations for some miracles.

There were a few parts that were mildly amusing but the movie could never seem to build any momentum. Just when it would seem like it was getting good it would switch to a scene with Jeff Daniels and suddenly not so funny. Jeff Daniels best comedic role is, of corse, Dumb and dumber and he has a few good moments here but mostly he just plays the straight guy and his scenes just seem to drag the movie down.

And I would have been right not to do so, because the only thing that makes this film even remotely funny is Richards enormeous talent for physical comedy. He can do the most amazing things with his face and body, and during the first third of the film you get to laugh a lot. But then it gets boring. After that the film tries to tell a story that no one want's to hear.

Pretty old but this new recording on the modern grand is all the energy, articulation, clarity and brilliance of that set. It is unusual to compare the harpsichord version with a version recorded probably 35 to 40 years later on the concert grand. But what comes out to me from this recent recording is the joy of playing the music by Angela Hewitt and her obvious devotion to the music. It has none of the ponderous playing of so many versions that I have listened to and purchased. These recordings to my mind beat all the competition and it is the best yet in her complete Bach series."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretty","review":"Competent piano playing, but I had hoped this kind of prissy, superficial playing went out with Rosalyn Tureck and her ilk.

All the faults of her other Bach recordings are on full display here: She has a way of focussing on a voice by making the others practically inaudible. This works well for Couperin - and I greatly enjoy her recordings of Couperin - where the melodic line is more important, and other voices less important than in Bach.However, in Bach's music, this kills the intricate weaving of voices that are its glory.

The quantity of pads is really low compared to the price."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fell apart","review":"I bought one to do my deck and it worked great on half of it and then the pad started coming off which let the stain flow freely, so I went back to Lowe's to buy a replacement pad and they don't carry them so I bought another stain stick. when I finished the other half I looked at the head and it's starting to come off also. I still have one or two more coats to but on with something else. Don't waste your money like I did."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your Money or Time of this tool!!!","review":"It took a half an hour just to get the product out of its packaging. After reading the instructions I was excited to use this product. After spending a day and a half painstakingly staining the spindles on my 16'x24' deck I was ready for somethign a bit easier. The excitement quickly faded. On the first attempt I would not get the stain to even coat the pad. In order to coat the pad I ended up with a puddle of stain the dripped down the side of the deck. In order to fill the pad with stain you must push the plunger which shortens the pole. As the pole shortens you end up having to bend over to control its movement. Disappointed and angry that I wasted my money and time on this tool. After the fiasco I gave up for the day and will return to a brush and roller tomorrow."},{"rating":"1","title":"Strong Concept - Pathetic Tool","review":"I am a builder and never have time to do my own projects. In an effort to speed up my weekend deck staining project, I decided to try this product. I puchased it from Lowes in lieu of at least two other similar products. (Though neither of the others had the same capacity to store and distribute the stain product from the handle.) I was skeptical, but hopeful. I filled it once and began staining the deck; looking good. Filled it again and the pad came off the thing. I had to finish the remaining 95% of the deck with a brush. It's going back to the store. Also, the end of the pad appears to be designed to allow you to stain between the boards. Absolutely useless. It's sad that such a high potential concept is executed with such a lack of quality. It's junk, really."},{"rating":"1","title":"Garbage.","review":"The product is garbage, and there it was placed. I bought this to do a fence, and after six (a mere SIX) boards the pad peeled off as though the adhesive had dissolved. This is a waste of money.

Task: deck floor, semi transparent stain, 88 sq.ft. It is impossible to control the flow and carrying the head back for the next stroke invariably dropped stain, then to try to blend in the drops, it over delivers stain since it can't be readily controlled. not to mention that as you deplete the supply in the tube it gets shorter. [They should warn anyone over 3ft6 not to attempt to use this tool. The pivot head does not pivot freely [it's made in China after all].Please do not waste your time or money on this product.

The rest of the songs are okay but I think the movie's better than the soundtrack because the movie is scary, that is if you like SCARY movies. Now I am a big fan of scary movies but the only scary movie I don't like is Hellraiser. I think Hellraiser is retarded and it's not even scary it's just like Terminator 2. Scream is the best out of all horror films including I Know What You Did Last Summer and Halloween. I recommened that if ya'll hadn't listened to this soundtrack yet, should. It is a good soundtrack but some of the songs on there are just dumb. I would just stick with the movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's an excellent soundtrack!","review":"This cd is cool, and most of the songs are nice and soothing except Youth Of America by Birdbrain, and Better Than Me by Sister Machine Gun.

Red Right Hand by Nick Cave And The Bad Seeds is alright, but it's not my favorite. In fact, it's sort of tasteless. First Cool Hive by Moby is very calming and soothing, and Trouble In Woodsboro/Sidney's Lament is actually a good score, and I like it because it starts off on sort of a loud note, then gradually gets softer. I'd recommed this, especially for fans of the movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliant - worth waiting for!","review":"The Scream soundtrack is great, I've been trying to buy it in England for ages!

Half the pages have no photos, but are blank with only one word on them: eyes, feet, hands, etc. Far too many of the photos are blurry abstracts and could be photos of anyone. One example: Actress Miranda Otto chose her shoulders. The photo doesn't even show her shoulders, but rather a few strands of hair and the faintest suggestion of unrecognizable facial features . It tells me nothing. I purchased this book because I read that it contained a photo of Elijah Wood's eyes. Well, it does, but I have seen at least 100 more beautiful photos of this actor's spectacular eyes. I did not buy it to see a photo of the photographer's daughter's toenails.

As an added bonus, my husband finds 10-15 mins relaxation too as he and my daughter lay side by side to relax.

Memoirs are important and she is moving away from promoting them. Father's Touch is both a well-told story and educational at the same time. A must read for those interested in understanding the mind of a pedophile, as the author quotes from his molester/father's writings. This book shows the manipulative skill of molesters as well as the resilience of survivors in challenging the misconceptions of friends and family. I wonder why the victims must always have to answer why they are this way, why they made the choices they did. I am not a victim but I hope one day molesters undergo the amount of therapy that victims no doubt need to survive. Father's Touch is a one-of-a-kind memoir.

I never knew that the legal system in Canada was so fallible. The truth can be distorted and facts can be omitted so egregiously. Justice is not always carried out adequately as a result. Failure to report the sexual abuse of children is a crime in itself no matter who is aware of it. Memories of child abuse will never fade for the victims. There is the natural tendency for the victims of sexual abuse to also repress the pain of sexual abuse which is wrong. The inclination of the victims to become confused about their sexual orientation as young adults is clear in this memoir. Years of therapy and journal writing helped the author to acknowledge and uncover the pain. This eventually put him on the path toward healing. These efforts gave the author the ability to give and receive love from other people. Father's Touch is a courageous and honest reminder that the scars from sexual abuse can heal through time and personal effort."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not only for Americans and Canadians","review":"Donald has put his story on paper.

Cable boxes, dvrs, tivos, blueray DVDs and any product with a microprocessor or harddrive is likely to cause interference that will render the MRF-250 useless.Both the MRF-300 and the MRF-350 have separate antenna modules that allow you to mount the receiving module in an area not prone to interference.

The reason I bought the device was so that I could install my electronic components (second HDTV installation, in my master bedroom) in a closet behind my HDTV screen and not have to run yet another cable through the wall to transmit the IR signal from a remote.The MRF system never worked. I tried everything. Finally I went and bought a lovely-but-expensive Niles Audio IR repeater system, installed it, and now everthing is working just fine.I intend to try to recoup something from URC, which is a notoriously difficult company to work with, especially when it comes to technical support services.

The loose thread that holds together a book's worth of paranoia and preaching pulls in the narrative stitches, so that in the end: we stop seeing conspiracies and we all stop ranting. The new kingdom just sort of takes over. Rathbun has a Flannery O'Connor sense of grace, grotesque and explosive, which makes this book so impacting.Challenging all notions of faith and mercy, this book takes apart what has become the blanket Christian culture.

What's worse, the book appears to be photocopied, with left-hand text blocks often skewed to the printed page, and a postage stamp randomly photocopied on top of some text on p. 75.

There are some absolutely compelling scenes hidden amongst the pretentiousness. The worst written chapters are the ones from the servants' points of view. While I appreciate that Drury was probably trying to show their awe and reverence for the various nobility and royalty, the extra words spent on groveling and self deprecation turns simple thoughts and plot progressions into multiple page passages of wasted words. The book is much smoother if the servant scenes are skipped all together."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worse than its predecessor","review":"Return to Thebes has the following content in it: Grief, lots of murders and deaths, funerals, and King Tut. The royal family returns from the heretic city of Akhetaten. Several members meet unfortunate deaths. The Queen cannot produce an heir. In other words, just another day in old Mother Egypt.Now, the bad side of this comes in the form of the novel itself. Normally I would wonder if there could be a book even worse than the previous A God Against Gods-but now I do not even fear the literary Hell...after I have been through Return to Thebes.The old devils of A God Against Gods return to haunt the reader. Pompous prose, distanced characters, a flimsy plot that, while being somewhat historically correct, cracks immediately under the heat and pressure of the heavy, overdone words-that is what Return to Thebes subjects the reader to. Yes, there are some good moments to this book, but they are even less than A God Against Gods.

Not only does the manga-ka seem to assume we know as much about her world as she, but she then follows up with a shaky storyline.The bottom line is, if you want to buy this book, read at least a chapter or two first to make sure."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your manga-bucks - pass on this one","review":"It has some nicely drawn characters and decent background art. The character's themselves aren't too bad either. There are some nice quirky moments of humor but they are separated by lots of who-cares storyline. As a matter of fact I've seen cereal boxes with more plot than this manga. It might pick up in vol. #2 but I'm not holding my breath. It's as if the creator sat down and decided to write a little gender-bender school story, but then decided they'd like it to have a supernatural twist so the main character is given the power to control water. Not bad so far, but then the creator struggles mightily to come up with storylines that could include this power at a high school. It's really sorry stuff so far. I would like to see this creator paired up with a real writer and save his/her focus on the sequential artwork, which is where this creator excels."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Settlement Cookbook","review":"The book was in really great shape.

I think the plain fact is despite Lefty Grove's greatness, he was a dull uninteresting guy himself.

As far as pitchers of his era, check out \\"Walter Johnson: The Big Train\\" by Henry Thomas which is a far better book.

One would think that a book on pulse diagnosis might start with describing the attributes of a pulse. Defining the terms used to describe the pulse would be a good place to start. Perhaps then one could go into how to take a pulse and what to look for. Unfortunately this book violates all standard pedagogical principles. Terms are used before they are defined.

When a book is titled the \\"..... division\\" I expect a detailed description of the movement of the division, its equipments and its engagements. Instead, with this book all you get is the most general descrition of the division but plenty on soldiers in uniforms and their insignia. A general book on WWII gives me almost the same information on this divison. And there are only pictures of soldiers off duty, basically nothing on tanks and other equipment. They should not have called this book the \\"Hermann Goering Division\\".

Often these exercises include things that were not present in the book or concepts are presented in a manner different from the text. There are a huge number of mistakes in the workbook, especially in regard to track numbers on the cds (sold separately). Avoid this at all costs. It has nothing to offer. Any competent teacher should be able to come up with their own exercises that would have much more practical value.

Right Here For U, is another slammer, the vocals on this one are nice. 8 and 9 are nice burners that will hold u over til #11 another highlight. 112 hasn't sounded this god since Cupid, I was truly impressed with the vocals from 1 1 deuce.

The single has no chart history on billboard, but was still hot, and did have a video. The next single was Hot & Wet. The radio and video version both featured Ludacris. On the Hot 100, it reached #70, and the RNB Chart it reached 29. This single was the biggest of the album for them. The last single which was second best was Right Here For You which only got to #72 on the RNB chart. The rest of the album is fair. The first two singles were more based towards Hip-Hop genre, and the last one was more of an R&B type song.

Kelly cuz he is the King of R&B...; not USHER ladies).This album alone is the worst effort in R & b history.... it seems that artist who's been around for sometime and release just about anything and think it sells... no that is just lazy and trifflin'...112 maybe good lookin and stuff but if you dont like the music please dont buy the album just cause they look good... buy it for the quality of the whole CD (not just 3 or 4 cuts)...

Code will often refer to an object that you are not told to create until later. Then, you are not told to set certain properties on the object (you just have to \\"know\\" which properties to set). I usually prefer the \\"Teach Yourself\\" series. I was sufficiently satisfied with the first one in this series, but quality control is lagging. I have to admit that many examples in this book will be frustating and confusing to a beginner of Visual Basic.

The TY in 24 hours is a good fast overview, then go straight to Master Visual Basic 6 by Evangelos Petroutsos. Now that is a GREAT book that teaches the new VB6 programmer how to do it.

If you copy and paste the code listing of 1.1, it wouldn't run because it introduced \\"i\\" that did not declared.

I rushed to the yellow dots on the screen to pick up some quests and started the level grind. The new instance in Hellfire was fun, not easy, but challenging enough to keep me coming back for more. At around 63 I hit a dead point though. I realized that it was the same thing that it was before. There are more quests then ever before. I never run out before moving to the next land. That's a good improvement. The big con of this game thought is just that it's the same grind that it was before. But there is new content. Classes are balanced nicely, some could use a bit of tweaking, but you'd never notice it. All in all its 10/10 if you still love the game in general, but if you were getting bored before simply because lack of content, I think you'll end up getting there again once you hit 70 and explore the new instances.

You just need to activate it. They will not let you reuse an activation code that has previously been used on a different account. A Used WoW game is therefore worthless.Amazon will refund your money (most likely), but one has to question the idiocy of selling a WoW Used product. Most likely it is only because Amazon has no way to make this kind of exception for Used items on the site, and/or they do no foward looking investigation when selling Used items. And because many sellers/buyers are unaware of Blizzard's activation policies until they contact them to get the required information. Amazon should enhance the database to make exceptions for this type of Used software item.

I rushed upstairs, sat through the hour of installation and patch downloads and went to log on. Disconnected from Server. Every attempt to log on resulted in this message almost immediately. Attempts to contact Blizzard Technical Support were a wasted effort. Their phone line is constantly busy, they don't respond to emails, and they ignored every forum post by the myriad number of users facing the same problem.

I really would not recommend this at all. As I have mentioned before about the special effects being so awful, I must say the only good and 'horror-movie' about it is when the cat crawls in the man's mouth and int him and then back out. That was grade A for Effort- however, the rest of this whole movie appeared to be boring, predictable & just plain stupid."},{"rating":"1","title":"Grusome Threesome","review":"I saw this movie in a theater when in first came out. I can honestly tell that it is full of gore and is generally disgusting. The movie has three horror stories that are set within a story of a boy about to be cooked by a witch (Debborah Harry). The stories, two of which are classics, are not connected to each others. They are good, but the movie is ruined by the excess of gore. It's an attempt to substitue too much graphic violence for the ability to tell a story. Know any other movies that do that?"},{"rating":"1","title":"sometimes great but not that great","review":"it starts out as a lady comes home to cook a boy for dinner but the boy tells the lady three storys from the Tales From The Darkside book. the first one is Lot 249 with Christian Slater, Julianne Moore and Steve Buscemi, which this one is the best with of course Slater's character. then the next one is The Cat From Hell with William Hickey and David Johanssen, this one is ok but it sometimes shallows the movie with its annoying and mangling old people. the last one is A Lover's Vow with James Remar and Rae Dawn Chong, it starts off good with Remar but then ends up being a cheesy story with its lame gargoyle effects."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great cast, Terrible Movie","review":"What the hell are fabulous actors Christian Slater, Julianne Moore, Steve Bucemi, Debbie Harry and Matthew Lawrence doing in this piece of trash?

The Teflon Fiber Ceramic Plates doesn't snag my hair at all and the Tourmaline Ionic Conditioning makes my hair shiny. YES SHINY which I'd never thought it could happen. It's worth every penny and more. I love LOVE this flat iron. Also the fact that it's got 2 year warranty makes the brand that much more trustworthy.The only thing I don't like is the side lock turn button because you need 2 hands.

None of the projects appeal to me so I will be returning this book.If you have The Decorated Page or The Decorated Journal by Gwin Diehn you don't need this book. Both books by Diehn are better done and more useful. And if you truly are looking for an inspirational book to kick start your art journals pick up The Creative License by Danny Gregory."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing inspiring","review":"This book contains NO interesting ideas, NO beautiful pictures, NO inspiration, and NO meaningful journal writing. However, it does contain techniques you probably learned in kindergarten. So unless you are under six, you do not need to buy this book. These authors presumably have created beautiful art at some point, considering their profession as art journal writers and instructors, yet they withhold any and all information on this topic throughout the book. I feel completely betrayed -- I gave them money and they gave me none of their knowledge. I wish I would have considered the advice of those who rated this book poorly prior to my purchase.

I will admit to getting some ideas from it, but found it pretty basic for the most part. I really didn't like any of the pages the authors did and wasn't really inspired by any of it. I have to agree with the other reviewers who said this is more like cut and paste scrapbooking and not art journaling. If you want a book about doing crafts, this is a good one. If you want a book about doing art, then save your money."},{"rating":"2","title":"There are no rules for journaling or art","review":"This is a fun, low-pressure style of getting started with keeping journals. Many altered book and altered journal material published is complex, done by real artists who take a lot of time with it, and can be a bit intimidating - although certainly beautiful and inspiring. These sisters are not concerned with sophisticated art (in this book - one sister is actually an artist.) It more about making the process accessible. Their journal pages are easy to make, very simply decorated, and fun to look at. This book focuses on helping people get started with their journaling, and they offer a lot of suggestions of topics to make it easy. The book is written with humor and a friendly tone. I thoroughly enjoyed it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Truly Awful","review":"I don't understand all the complimentary reviews; this is Romper Room (anyone remember that?) level. Not the book if you really want to learn about how to begin you own art journal. (I wouldn't give it any stars except Amazon requires at least one.) Very, very weak on technique.

There are many new ways to be creative in making your journal pages or scrapbooking pages. The \\"Personal Palette\\" and prompts help get all your thoughts on paper, out of your mind and where you can see them. Clears your mind to renew it and start to think about new possibilities in creativeness and your life.Materials used are easily obtained and are reasonable cost. It was fun to go select all the color palettes from the paint section of the local hardware store. Changes taking place in my life and new happenings to come about this next year.

Highly recommend."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"From the reviews, I expected so much more from this book. It does have a very attractive layout, but the content doesn't live up to the presentation. There doesn't appear to be much new here.

It came out over three years ago, but still sets the standard with innovative ideas and provides a lot of inspiration."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it!","review":"I bought this book because I loved Linda Woods's artwork, especially her richly colored mixed media pieces with images of the Buddha. I was surprised and delighted to find in this book such a wide range of journal pages. I did not expect to be able to create art like Linda's, and thought I would again see only journals I wished I could make. I can completely relate to the intimidation of journaling with art, and the authors quickly got me past that by addressing those fears head-on, and showing examples of simple and more complex pages. These sisters got me writing and collaging, and expressing many different emotions. My journal is looking pretty darn good, too. I'd still love a book of Linda's Eastern-inspired art!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I just didn't \\"get\\" this book","review":"To me, journalling involves much more of the written word. The point of this book (does it even have a point?) is to devise some sort of symbolic meaning to people, events, or emotions, and then just use a color or a spiral or something to convey a 1-word snapshot of the subject. To what purpose? There may have been 1 page devoted to \\"altered books,\\" which is really why I bought this book. I saw no techniques or layouts I will use, and I really thought the artwork was not only amateur-ish, but not even evocative of any real meaning."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fearlessly Inspired","review":"This is the first book in this genre that actually does what it promises...inspires unabashedly free art journalling by \\"wow\\" giving real ideas that lead to more and more ideas.

It's a simple, basic look at how to create some wonderful memories to pass on to friends, family or just keep for yourself.My husband even read it and loved it! That's saying quite a bit as he's a real man's man!Excellent book, especially for those who don't know where to begin!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't inspire me . . .","review":"I have a pretty extensive library on altered books, journals, etc. and I always find new and interesting ideas in each new acquisition. This book, however, let me down. It's not that it's bad, it just didn't offer anything new or exciting. Unfortunately, it only shows one particular style of visual journaling and the \\"have no fear\\" approach didn't inspire me. If you do have a fear of getting started and would like to start slowly this might be a good first book. It just didn't do it for me. Sorry."},{"rating":"2","title":"Art and Smart","review":"Finally, a book on art journaling that is not just a bunch of picturesof collaborative journals. Visual Chronicles is beautiful to look atandfun to read. It's the type of book you want to read over and overagain.The projects are easy to follow and understand.

I bought it as a gift for my grandson, & in the first place, they sent it to me instead of to him. It did give me a good chance to look it over, though. The issues are too flimsy for a child this age to handle without ripping, and worse, there is insert material (renewal cards, etc.) between almost every page and the magazine is not readable without removing them.

I'm a librarian and am going to buy my grandchild books instead of this next year."},{"rating":"1","title":"Some content questionable","review":"I was fully prepared to purchase two gift subscriptions of Babybug; however, after reading a sample issue changed my mind. Once concern was the selection of the nursery rhyme Old King Cole who \\"smoked a pipe\\" and the second was the contrasting of big and little using a pig and a wig. I would prefer not to show smoking in a book geared to such a young age group and find it unusual that a wig was chosen. These two choices by the editors in the same issue regretably caused me to reconsider and decide against the purchase of this subscription.I"},{"rating":"1","title":"Really Disappointed","review":"I was very disappointed with this magazine. We got a subscription based on all the great reviews, but were unhappy with it. Each magazine has a story about Kim and her stuffed rabbit, Carrots.

The oil stinks. At least in my case, it did. Moreover, the fact that it was herbalized proved to have no significant benefits over regular sesame oil, whether I used it for abhyanga or in a basti.

I also rewatch this movie when I'm bored and continue to be amused.As you may know, rumor has it Leonard wrote this after dealing with famous Hollywood short guy, Dustin Hoffman. I don't know if that's true but Devito was great lampooning Hollywood and Chili Palmer was played to perfection by Travolta.

John Travolta, who had just made his big comeback performance in Quentin Tarantino's \\"Pulp Fiction\\" scored another massive hit with his role of Chili Palmer, a Miami lone shark who gets sent to Hollywood to muscle a B-movie producer but ends up getting swept in by the business. Along for the ride is an all-star cast including Gene Hackman, Rene Russo, Danny DeVito, Delroy Lindo, Dennis Farina, and James Gandolfini. \\"Get Shorty\\" is a fun, hip good time.

I'm not going to get into specifics on the movie itself. The Blu-Ray conversion is pretty good. The detail is very nice and I did not detect any artifacts caused by filtering or other forms of noise reduction. Get Shorty was filmed by Don Peterman and his flicks were typically distinguished by a clean, low-grain elegance, with precise lighting and solid blacks; and the Blu-ray has accurately reproduced this look for Get Shorty. The Blu-ray captures the just-too-bright, slightly artificial look of the L.A. and Florida locales (the latter also shot in L.A.) where most of the action occurs. The DTS loss-less sound contains appropriate background noises but nothing that will make you turn your head. The menu structure for the disc is pretty bare-bones, but has some great bonus features and deleted scenes. Overall this Blu-ray is solid and I recommend it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Movie","review":"Didn't know this was a VHS. I should have read the description better.

The Grip Tites were first demonstrated for me at a woodworking show. The demonstrator took a 8' long 2x4 and ran into midway into the saw. Then, in order to exhibit the power of the Grip Tites, he pushed the board sideways into the blade. If the Grip Tites had not been in use, that board would have kicked off the blade and caused major damage. As it was, the board started burning, the blade whined, but no kickback. After two very close encounters with kick back, I decided on the spot I had to have the Grip Tites."},{"rating":"2","title":"Don't wait too long","review":"This thing is great.

I ordered it on Tuesday and Amazon delivered it to me the next day. My only regret is that I didn't order it a bit sooner because Monday was the day I cut the tip of one of my fingers off with the table saw,(while cutting thin strips).

Dave Mason's album Alone Together would make up four albums today. Every song is a classic. Second to none.Alone Together/Headkeeper"},{"rating":"2","title":"Way before my time but a GREAT album","review":"One of the most unsung heroes of rock ever. Very few can write songs as well as Mason. All you have to do is give one listen to \\"Sad And Deep As You,\\" which is one of the most moving, emotional songs I have ever heard. Leon Russell adds such a nice touch with his piano work.I grew up listening to this when my dad played it (he swears he had the original carmel pressing until his brother \\"lost\\" it), and it will forever remain a special album to me.I may only be 19 years old, but this album will always hold a special place with me...it holds as true and is as emotional as any modern-day release. Dave Mason was NOT a one hit wonder with his Traffic anthem \\"Feelin' Alright?\\" and this album PROVES it! Alone Together is definitely a classic that deserves a listen. Don't overlook it because you are missing out!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Mason's First Solo Album is Also His Best","review":"After leaving the progressive rock band Traffic, Dave Mason went solo and became less and less adventurous with his music as time went on. \\"Alone Together\\" is the best of his original studio efforts, and is probably a better buy than his recent greatest hits albums. Turning his back on Traffic's heady brew of jazz-pop fusion, Mason opted for a more comfortable laid back folk rock style, which shows itself most completely on songs like \\"Only You Know and I Know,\\" \\"Just a Song\\" and \\"Can't Stop Worrying, Can't Stop Loving.\\" \\"Shouldn't Have Took More Than You Gave\\" is the hardest rocking effort on this album, but that is really only by comparison. Lyrically, Mason is not the wordsmith to compare with his former bandmate, Steve Windwood, but on the other hand there's nothing laughable here either.Overall, \\"Alone Together\\" is a solid early 1970s mainstream rock album recorded back when Dave Mason was still a viable and important force in rock music."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow","review":"\\"Alone Together\\" is the best album I've ever heard. I am 50 years old and have probably listened to it 300 times. I NEVER get tired of hearing it. I wore out at least 2 LPs before I bought it on CD. Different strokes for different folks, but for me \\"Alone Together\\" is THE album I'd choose if I had to pick just one."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the Classic Albums of the Period","review":"With \\"Alone Together,\\" Dave Mason does his best George Harrison impression - and that's not bad. The whole album has a rich folk-country-rock feel, making it Dave Mason's best solo release and one of the better albums in an era that produced classic after classic.Interestingly, every song is better than just about any of Dave's contributions to Traffic, in which he often seemed to be the weak link in the chain. While in Traffic, Dave often sounded like a George Harrison wannabe, circa \\"Sgt. Pepper.\\" On \\"Alone Together,\\" he sounds like a worthy rival to George, circa \\"All Things Must Pass.\\"In short, \\"Alone Together\\" is Dave Mason (and British folk-rock) at its best."},{"rating":"2","title":"5 Stars for the Spectacular Bonnie Tyler, -5 for packaging","review":"First let's start with the fact that this is an official Sony 2007 release, why release something in this day and age and NOT remaster it?

But the gorgeous textures and dark atmosphere makes up for the album's short length. The band takes an interesting approach by taking the vocals away from the forefront, and blends them in with the rest of the instruments, similarly to the way that Sigur Ros handles their vocals, albeit On Fire's poetry is indeed in English, rather than Icelandic.I'd give this an 8/10 and recommend it for fans of Sigur Ros or Radiohead's \\"OK Computer\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best AI book","review":"I've read this excellent book twice.

I was happy to see that it also covered not only residential but commercial buildings as well. Would definitely recommend it to anyone looking for a broad overview of the Spanish style."},{"rating":"1","title":"Try Expanding Your Horizons","review":"This book is great....if you're interested in this style in California.The authors almost completely glitz over the architectural contributions of buildings in Texas and Florida.

They start collections off with picking apart an Interface when I wanted more general theory first. They need to give some small complete examples first, then pick them apart on complicated sections.I also think the book is too big and many chapters could be dumped as they are specialized.The best part to me is how it compares different languages on doing things."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor quality control","review":"I don't think this book deserves a 5 star rating. The quality of material between the chapters are too uneven.

The book is hit very badly by trying to cover too much, it just miss the \\"pro\\" mark in many places, to be barely at the \\"advanced introducion\\" mark, imho. I like the new chapter on Generics, but the chapter I dislike the most is about \\"Viewing .Net Data\\". At the defense of the author(s), that is probably due to insane cuts made by the editor, but the end result is what the customer can read.One star, but that poor result is for the editor.

When I actually wanted the stuff I was hanging to come down I couldn't get it off. Trying to get my hanging off It snapped it (since it was wood) and the strips took off my paint and plaster.

I have swapped them all out to make sure I wasn't putting them on the wrong wheels, but they do not fit snugly like the original wheel hubs. They don't snap on and while will hold alright with the wheels on, they will fall off if you even tip the car slightly sideways when the wheels are off.

In order for mind candy to work, however, it must be at least minimally plausible. The willing suspension of disbelief just doesn't work here. Unlimited funds, international absolution of all sins and the treatment of foreign countries like they were just another NYPD precinct dosen't cut it. Character development is lacking here and so is the usual cast. While The Two Chinatowns gave usual protagonist Detective Brian McKenna's partner (Detective Cisco Sanchez) center stage, The Protectors gives short shrift to all of the previous supporting roles.

I was captivated from the first by Mr. Bruce's description of Frank Morris being transported to Alcatraz to begin his life there as a prisoner. I started turning pages and was transported along with the prisoner - through the rain and fog to that dismal prison.The second surprise was all the history Mr. Bruce put into the book that went way beyond just this one escape.

If you CAN finish the whole book, you won't care about any of the characters - prisoners or prison staff.The short vignettes on, it seems, every prisoner who ever attempted to escape from Alcatraz, all sound the same.I can't even say anything more about this book, because it is so boring and badly written, that I'm annoyed at myself for attempting to read it in it's entirety.I finally gave up."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simple, but easy to understand.","review":"The illustrations themselves speak louder than words and its a good teaching tool to help people of different ethnic backgrounds that have mixed race in them, especially parents of two different cultures who are married with kids who are mixed race to teach them and show them there are people out there in the same situation as them.

The tempos are a little slow for what I am used to, but the emotion is still there. The surround sound is not very informative. In comparison to Solti-Chicago, this falls slightly short. Of course, the recorded sound is better than that available with the older Solti recording. The Concertgebouw sounds slightly out of control at times, especially in the big finale. The Chicago brass triumph throughout with Solit, but the brass section here does not function as a cohesive unit.

And many places can't be gotten to no matter what. It earns a 4 star because where it can be used it works pretty good. If your car is an easy car to wash then perhaps you will really like it. Mine is a hard one to wash so when I get done, I let it dry then go back and wash the areas I missed by hand. Even with that, it's still easier and quicker than washing the whole thing with a sponge. Plus the long handle makes it easier to do the roof without stretching or reaching and the lower areas without stooping. It feels a little light duty and I worry how long it will last, but if it holds up well I would probably buy another."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for flat surfaces","review":"The rigid,saddle shaped washing surface is not suitable for washing flat surfaces. There is a 1 inch depression in the middle which means only the edges make good contact with the surface that you are washing. Even on a curved surface, the head does not swivel, which means you constantly are trying to adjust the stick angle to get better contact of the mop head with the surface you are washing, and it darn near impossible. This all requires much more effort than using a plain sponge, or my favorite car washing tool, a shaggy mitt with nylon mesh on the other side. I have used the Wash Stick twice on my car and will not use it again. This tool would be much improved if the head were flat instead of concave."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sponge on a Stick and no more.","review":"Just buy a sponge mop and bucket and save $$.The head on this stick does not swivel, pivot, flex, or otherwise make it easy to use.The stick part does not fill over 3/4 with liquid.

Will be returning it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Clips can't hold rollers.","review":"I bought these about a week ago and have tried to use them several times on my hair and my daughter's hair. Our hair types are COMPLETELY different, but the product has reacted them same to both. HORRIBLY!! Her hair is fine and straight, and mine is thick and curly, but the rollers couldn't figure it out. They are way too hot to handle, so trying to put a lot of hair on them resulted in frequent burning, but not putting enough resulted in scorched ends. The worst part for me (as with many other reviewers) is that the clip doesn't hold the roller. The heating element is too slippery, so the roller dangles. I didn't see any creases, however my curls were too loose to last through the day. If you have a need for loose curls for a short amount of time, this is it! But, if you want nice waves that last a long time, skip this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worse thing ever","review":"First you burn the heck out of your fingers, second the curl does last at all.

I used them once, and 3 people commented on how different and nice my hair looks. They are easy to use. I only need about 5 rollers for my hair. One tip: I had some fly away hairs that I went over with my curling iron to smooth out.

If that wasn't bad enough, I had some weird crimp mark in each strand where the clip holders were.Previously, I had a set of curlers with the metal pins that held the rollers in place. I'm returning this sad set of rollers and am on a quest to find another set with the metal pins.Don't buy these unless you like spending ridiculous amounts of money for bad products."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good, depending upon your particular needs","review":"This is a fantastic set of hot rollers if you are looking for long, loose curls that are quick and easy to set.The soft velvet flocking on the rollers made it so easy to curl my hair around the rollers tightly. The rollers themselves heated up very quickly. Although they only take 90 seconds to heat up, I found I had a better curl when heating them up for five minutes before rolling. The clips helped to keep the heat in while securely holding the rollers.I prefer a tighter curl so I hope that Remington comes out with a smaller set of these since I prefer these to any other set of rollers I've ever used."},{"rating":"2","title":"WOW! CURLS IN NO TIME!","review":"Delighted is a mild word to describe my experiences with these rollers. I've spent more days than I could count with my hair in rollers from morning until evening just to try and achieve perfect curls for a night out. Now, I get an even better result in a mere five minutes!First of all, this set comes with 12 large (1 1/4\\") and 8 medium (1\\") rollers. These aren't your garden variety rollers - they have hinged clips to hold the hair and heat comes not only from the roller but from the clip, ensuring thorough curling.The rollers heat in only 90 seconds, and are easy to use (remember securing rollers with bobby pins?)Recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty good","review":"As heated roller sets go, I'd give this one a thumbs up. The rollers are large enough to give bouncy loose curls without ending up looking like a poodle. The set heats up quickly and curls hair fast--I get the curls I want in 10 minutes maximum. There are two negatives in my opinion. First, this set is big! If you're short on counter or dresser space, this is not for you. Also, the type of clip does leave a ridge in hair. The clips are generally a good idea, and the rollers stay in pretty well--but I think clips with teeth would be a lot better. I've found if I don't leave the rollers in too long the ridge isn't too bad. But like every heated roller set I've ever owned, the top of head rollers just don't stay in. Teeth on the clips might help this problem too. As for the \\"new technology,\\" who knows? Sounds like a lot of babble to me. Heated rollers are basically metal with a covering that heat up--nothing complicated about that. But overall, these work better than most."},{"rating":"2","title":"Incredible hold!","review":"I purchased these curlers not having any expectation other then them being easier to use because of the clips. I never expected them to actually make a difference on how long the curl holds in my hair. With my old hot rollers, I would curl my hair and by the time I got to the office, every last curl had come out and my hair would be straight. Well I used these and my curls lasted over 24 hours! And that was after sleeping with them and going out on a very humid day.I am very impressed. I hope they continue to work so well!"},{"rating":"2","title":"very good :)","review":"My hair is thick and shoulder length.

Going back to the store!","review":"I just spend an hour in the store looking at all the roller sets and sizes. I thought I had chosen the best set to achieve what I wanted. I specifically bought rollers to add volume to my straight, somewhat fine hair. I went straight home and watched a bunch of youtube videos to make sure I knew how to roll without looking like I was from the 50s. Then, I went at it. Yes, I achieved some nice bounce and curls with this set. But what I really wanted, I got none of; volume. Instead, I got some atrocious kinks and bends at the roots that I had to recurl with a curling iron to fix. That's what I was trying to avoid! So I'm heading back to the store to return this crappy set and get the kind with more of a claw clip....I hate the kind with the little metal pins."},{"rating":"2","title":"work great","review":"This is a really good item for med-thick hair.

The curlers are too hot to be held easily while trying to roll the curls. The clips, which I thought would make the rolling easier, leave crease marks on the curls that aren't very pretty. For these two reasons I wouldn't recommend this product. I saw other products that specifically said \\"cool tips\\" but I sort of assumed the ends would be cool enough to hold - oh well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't like them at all... in fact I'm taking them back!","review":"I have very fine hair, it's thick as in there is a lot of it.... but very slippery and smooth. I was attracted to these because they appeared to have a texture that would work with my hair. While the texture does indeed pick up my hair, these curlers made the ends crispy and it left creases near my scalp. I'll admit this is only the second set I ever bought and don't have a lot of experience with them; but I have been reading about how to use them and cannot seem to get around the creases and crispy ends! I have been trying to work with them the past few weeks in the evening and weekends, with no luck.I have no idea what type of hair would work better for these, so I can't even think of anyone to give them to. So I'm packing them up to go right back to the store! I feel bad about taking them back, but I just can't get them to work for me. I may look at some of the jumbo ones with a different clip; just buy two sets instead of one!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money","review":"I purchased this set a year ago from a retail store. Unfortunately, these rollers are a real disappointment. As other reviewers have said, the clips are awful. They don't hold the roller tight enough to get a good set--but they also leave you with a nasty crease that's virtually impossible to disguise. I did try these rollers with other clips (both jaw clips and traditional wire clips), but they don't really fit right. Overall, I do not recommend this roller set to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing Special","review":"I thought the heated clips were a great idea, and that was the selling point for me even though they were too expensive. The heated clips were NOT a good idea. They have no \\"claws\\" to grab onto the hair, so the curlers just slid right out of my hair. When I held my head really still I got some of them to stay in for 5-6 minutes.When I took the curlers out I was very disappointed because the clips left big kinks in my hair and the curls fell out within about 10 minutes. I am returning these and will get a set with those big bobby pin looking things or claw clips to hold the curlers in place."},{"rating":"1","title":"Failure","review":"Pros: operate with lid closed, on/off switchCons: Takes up way too much space, hard to use without burning your fingers because the heating contact point is across the length of the roller & I burnt my fingers trying to get my hair onto the roller.But the main reason I'm taking these back is because the crease/dent it left in my hair. HORRIBLE."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pass on and safe yourself a huge headache!!","review":"I can't believe I wasted my time on these rollers. The clips are worthless!!!

Also this is a great price, I actualy purchased mine at walmart and paid [...] bucks more!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Too much trouble to use","review":"I was excited about these when I bought them. Having the clips heated sounded like a great idea. Well, I've used them several times now and have decided not to use them again. The clips have flat plates on the insides and nothing to keep them in your hair well. Because of this, the curlers slide out of my hair over and over again. Also the clips leave real dents in my hair, not just minor ones. With all that and the room they take up they're just not worth it."},{"rating":"1","title":"No way to avoid the crimp marks","review":"The clips were an attractive selling point for me, but they do not hold well, and they leave a line in my hair on every curl. Not good, not pretty, not what I want.

They really work, and I agree with most reviewers it does leave a mark on your hair, no big deal but it's there. I'm now addicted to them and use them every other day, I love the look. What I also love about them is the fact that they heat up quick, and really within minutes you have curls! It's truly amazing. And the quantity is perfect for me, I don't have much hair though, but if you would need more just do them by section, remember it only takes 5-10minutes to get curls.I would highly recommend this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"This is the first product review I've ever written.I was not pleased with these curlers. They are not jumbo - and are smaller than I expected. The holder is vertically taller than other curlers so they would not fit in the drawer where I planned to store them. Finally I used them about 5 times and the electrical component gave out and they were totally unusable.Additionally I did not find that the heated clips decreased the time I had to wear the curlers.I'm about to order regular jumbo curlers with clips that do not heat."},{"rating":"1","title":"Crimped Hair! ugh!","review":"I purchased these rollers because they were streamlined, there were a lot of them and I have a lot of hair. Like other reviewers, I was terribly disappointed because of the crimps in my hair caused by the clips. I tried using wire prong fasteners from an older set of hot rollers, but the sizes weren't right and the rollers just fell out. Very frustrating to say the least. Also, the heat source is not the roller itself, but the clamp that has a metal sheath inside that heats up. These have to be the worst set of hot rollers I've ever owned and unfortunately, the most expensive!

I have several different setters but really liked the clips on this one. My friend does not use the clips and just bought the large round plastic claw hair clips from a beauty supply store so that she can get a tighter hold but I didn't have that problem at all. I use the smaller rollers on the top of my head and the larger ones on the bottom, it came out beautiful and full for my photo shoot. I really like the idea of a heated clip to help set the curls. I cliped them farther around from the base to prevent lines and I used a setting spray (hairspray works too) before rolling them and my curls lasted all day. I might purchase a second set for those days I want smaller curls and can roll smaller section but for the most part I really like this product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Quick Lift for Hairdos","review":"This is a set of twenty curlers which are slitted to sit on a heated metal rack inside the case. The top of the case, which lifts up is transparent. It's a pretty large unit.It takes just a minute and a half for all the curlers to be heated and ready to apply.Twelve of the curlers are large, the other eight are medium sized. There are no small sized curlers, which I would've liked but still produce a tighter curl when left on for the maximum ten minutes.Negative ions produce smooth,shiny curls.No need to worry about your hands and fingers, the parts which heat up are the inside of the slits and inside the clips. (where your hands won't be touching)I'm impressed with this curling system, which is quick and simple and pleasant and recommend it highly."},{"rating":"1","title":"Puts ugly crimps in your hair!!!","review":"I am very disappointed with these. Just like someone else has already said the heated clips put very noticeable ridges in your hair at the top of the curl. I would not recommend these and I am going to return them tomorrow."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"While the curlers container looks really neat & tidy, it's hard to get those rollers anchored in your hair securely with the clips. The rollers tend to flop around no matter where I place the clip onto the roller, which is the only reason I gave it such a low score. If somebody's got a trick for this, I'd like to know what it is.You can still get curls from it, although mine didn't hold very long even following up with hairspray. I didn't leave them in very long, as it says not even 5 minutes if you don't want tighter curls. It comes with a nice amount of rollers, although there are never enough large rollers for me, and I'd think of their larges as more like mediums. Decent warranty.You need to be careful to not touch the slot that attaches the curler to the heating unit, when you're rolling your hair. It's very hot.There's probably something better out there. I'm less than crazy about it, primarily from the unsecure clipping method."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not purchase!","review":"I bought these per the reviews that said how wonderful these rollers were. I am so disappointed. It leaves this horrible line in your hair from where the roller sits on the heating element. I thought it was a great idea having hot clips as well as the roller, but because of that, the rollers sit in the base on a line, which produces the line in the hair. The do heat up fast and the result is great, minus the ugly line it leaves."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Hot Enough","review":"I was really disappointed in these rollers, they simply didn't heat up enough and lost the heat after a couple of minutes!

By the time I left the house before work the curl was totally gone!I'm returning these pronto."},{"rating":"1","title":"Blisters","review":"OUCH! The label states that the ends of the curlers get hotter than normal. IT IS RIGHT! These go back! The ends are so hot, I got blisters on my 1st use. They do a ncie job curling and leave a shine.

The print quality of the cover is appalling, streaky and patchy, and the final trimming is off-centre. In additon, the type script is fuzzy and lacks sharpness and clarity - as an 'older' reader this is not just frustrating but spoils the pleasure of reading.

In other words, is the yardstick a correct measure because it matches our concepts of inches and feet, or do we assign authority to the yardstick and follow its caprice?I know many people find Barth great fun, and a lark, but to me he is not funny.

Much of the humor is rooted in his insightful view of life, love, and the seeming futility of it all. Giles Goatboy offers up the microcosm of academia as the stage upon which the Greek tragedy of all our lives is played. The only real redeeming features in Barth's worldview are the laughs he rummages out of the ashes of nihilism, and his wicked, self-deprecating sense of humor. However, his works ultimately offer up a depressingly futile vision of life. His humor makes his perspective palatable, in fact, tasty, but I often find myself hoping that for his sake, Mr. Barth has more hope than his novels portray"},{"rating":"1","title":"A repudiation of all that's wholesome and redeeming.","review":"On aesthetic grounds (though they pale before the moral), the work is objectionable: the rhetoric is extreme, the conceit and action wildly implausible, the interpretation of history shallow and patently biased, the narrative full of discrepancies and badly paced, at times tedious, more often excessive; the form, like the style, is unorthodox, unsymmetrical, inconsistent. The characters, especially the hero, are unrealistic. There never was a Goat-boy!

If you have a crib like we do with a painted finish, beware of scratches. I've lined them with felt.* Inconsistent play with \\"burned\\" CDs.* Overall the product feels a bit cheap.Some of this could be overlooked if it wasn't a $50 product.

The CD player volume is extremely low even on the highest setting and to make it worse the company has put the speaker exactly were the bar on the crib goes when it is attached to the crib making the music even harder to hear. I realize that a baby's music shouldn't be too loud but I like to walk around the room at night when my baby is fussy and listen to the music and it is impossible to hear.

It would stutter, skip, or just plain stop.For the same price, I bought a great little colorful Sony boom box with a ton of features that hasn't missed a beat.

We took it to the hospital with us for delivery - nice and portable. I like that it uses batteries since my little house has a limited number of plugs and most are used for other things. Eliminating the cord also means one less thing we have to baby-proof as she starts crawling. The light is just bright enough to see baby as she sleeps and the blue color doesn't hurt her eyes like yellow light can. I love that it shuts off after going through the entire CD rather than being on a timer, and clipping to the side of the crib means more space on tables and shelves.

Perhaps the batteries were bad."},{"rating":"1","title":"The idea is great, the product lacks quality","review":"I simply love the idea of having a CD player by the crib.

Thanks."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worthless","review":"Ignoring the multitude of negative reviews on Amazon, I purchased this for our child. This CD player is a complete waste of money. First, the sound is so low at maximum volume that it is audible only in the very quietest of times. No screaming baby is going to be even touched by its effect - which defeats the major purpose of calming a baby. Second, the player is so designed that if you have a sleeper other than a crib with slats, the sound will be completely muffled, worsening its already low volume. Third, the system of hooking the player onto the crib rail is iffy at best. A small knock and it will fall off, either onto the infant or the floor. Fourthly, the unit visibly and tangibly vibrates when playing a cd. It is flabbergasting that a reputed company like \\"The First Years\\" could market such a disappointment. This CD player is going back to Amazon, even though I will have to pay for S&H both ways."},{"rating":"1","title":"save yourself the agony","review":"This product is awful!!!Poor button navigation, battery life, design, you name it.

First of all it says it fits any crib and it did not fit well on ours. .We got it to fit, then every time we touched the crib it would skip. if I walked to hard on the floor it skipped. HOW ANNOYING not to mention that the sound quality is poor and I just thought it was plain awful."},{"rating":"1","title":"Broke after 5 months","review":"I thought this player was great -- it is a nice space saver. I had it on the crib and it played fine. I didn't have the volume issues others wrote about -- the volume adjusted fine for me. It would have been a great product had it not stopped working - for no reason. It's dead. I did go through lots of batteries- but that would have been the case with any cd player I believe. Too bad -- I have to return it since it no longer works."},{"rating":"1","title":"Invest in batteries.","review":"The thing functions okay, although I haven't figured out whether or not the timer helps or hinders matters. I know that no matter whether it plays all the time or the timer is set, this cd player uses up batteries faster than anything I've ever witnessed, and this is my third child! I would not invest in this product again. A simple boom box on the dresser would have produced the same results and would have been more versatile. I'm normally a fan of first years products, but this one doesn't cut it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Piece of junk","review":"This CD player looks attractive, so I registered and received as a gift. It never worked correctly. I always got an error message, and nothing in the directions tell you about this message. I exchanged it for another one and the same thing happened as soon as I got it home! The light is worthless, the sound is very quiet. I took the second one back and bought a combo CD/Tape player for half the price. It doesn't hook onto the crib, but it works and without batteries."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible waste of money : (","review":"If I could give this piece of junk a zero I would! Just buy yourself a small boombox and place it near the crib and save your money. We purchased this and returned/exchanged it 3 times just hoping that it was a fluke.1. Sound level is Way wAy waY too low2. Sucks batteries down like a cheap hooker and then getting to the compartment just to switch them out is like fort knox3. Skips on just the smallest of scratches or bumps4. Over priced5. The cover that closes over the cd hardly opens.

For $50 we can get a much better sounding CD player."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disfunctional","review":"I purchased the First Years CD player. I used it for 2 months and then it stopped playing. The CD would spin, but there was no sound. I returned it to the store for another one and as soon as I brought that one home it did the same thing. My husband and I both tried several things to rule out it was the batteries or a \\"user\\" issue. I called First Years to report the problem and the service representative was very unhelpful and her only advice to us was to chanege the batteries or adjust the volume. As if we hadn't tried it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Lemon Law This One!","review":"Our first one stopped working in a few days after we brought the baby home.

It was perfect when my husband and I got to room in with our son while he was in the NICU. It attaches to everything perfectly, his hospital crib, his bassinet, and his crib at home. I love the fact that the music does not play to loud. It is perfect for putting him to sleep. When I get up in the middle of the night to feed him, I just turn it back on. The light is great too because it is bright enough to see that he is okay. We have not had any problems with skipping or poor quality of sound. I would definetly recommend this product!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Worth Your Money","review":"I thought this was going to be a great item compared to the older version which only played nature sounds. I liked that I could either play music or my own nature cds. However, my 12 month old figured out how to move the player back and forth on the crib rail and eventually how to remove the player from the rail. This allowed him to remove it and stand on it in his crib or to throw it out onto the floor. I found it amazing that the player did not lock into place and therefore caused a safety hazard. I would not recommend this item to anyone. I would suggest investing your money into a small cd/radio for the dresser top."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a waste of money!","review":"I thought this was going to be an excellent CD player since it is made by The First Years. We use music throughout the day in our baby's room and thought this would be a good CD player to do that with. However, it went through batteries so quickly that it just wasn't worth it. I found myself having to change batteries every other day. Also the buttons/volume dial are very small and hard to adjust. We also found that this CD player skipped often or would give error messages for no apparent reason. The idea of having an attachable crib CD player with a night light is great, but this one's quality is terrible. I would not recommend it to anyone. I went to The First Years website, registered our purchase of this item, and posted how we felt about the poor workmanship of this item. We never received any reply or offer for a refund. Don't waste your money on this CD player. I recommend a small CD unit that you can plug in near the crib."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't even bother","review":"I registered for this item because I thought it would come in handy despite the negative reviews I had read. I should have listened to my gut instinct. the player only worked a total of 3 seconds and when I called the 800 number they said just take it back, like they knew the item was defective and they were used to hearing about it. I exchanged it for the tape player and that didn't work at all so back to the store I go. Don't waste your time or your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointment","review":"I wish I had read the reviews before purchasing the product.

To those that want to return it, but do not have a receipt- CALL FIRST YEARS! I have returned two without a receipt, and the shipping was FREE! Do not bother with returning to the store. The store generally just puts your defective product back on the shelf to sell to another unlucky consumer. First Years is a good company and they need to know how bad their product really is. If they have to keep paying for replacement products and shipping regularly maybe they will just recall this hunk of junk like they should have months ago."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Product I've Ever Bought","review":"If I could rate this product a \\"0\\" I would. This product design on this item is extremely poor. I am on my second unit (both brand new) and have had the same luck with both. The main problem is that the cds skip constantly -- even when the unit is NOT bumped. The result is far from relaxing. Remember those old diskmen that skipped constantly because they didn't have internal baffling? This is just like that. I even followed the protocol for cleaning unit #2(per the company's instructions) before giving up on it. The cleaning made no difference with the skipping. I'm surprised that this product remains on the market considering it's poor design. I've decided I am getting a regular cd/cassette player jambox to set next to the crib.I have to say that I read all of the negative reviews first, and ignored them because I wanted this product (or at least the concept of it) so badly. For once, I should've listened to others' advice."},{"rating":"2","title":"Definite recommend","review":"I have used this CD player every night since the day my son was born - he's 2 years now. For the first few weeks I had it attached to his bassinet and the light was fine. The light wasn't too bright that it would wake the baby or too dim so you couldn't see him/her. Then when we moved him into his crib, we attached it to that. I do agree with the one reader that if you do not have thin rails on your crib, it won't attach. We could only attach it on either end of the crib (side rails were too wide) but it left marks on our crib so I just lay the CD next to his crib. We even take it on trips w/ us. The only down fall is that it does eat up batteries. I usually have to replace them about every 2-3 weeks (and we use it every night). We are expecting our second child in April 2004 and I plan on purchasing another one for this child."},{"rating":"1","title":"what I think","review":"The Crib CD player hardly ever works, and if it does, it goes through a set of batteries with each CD you play.

It's turned an every-night marathon, sometimes 1 1/2-2 hours, of putting her to sleep, into a relaxing 15-20 minutes. Happy Baby makes for happy Mama! The volume is soft, even at its max setting, but I find one of the soft-to-mid volume settings just perfect for bed time. I wholehearted recommend this for anyone with a toddler who is sleep challenged!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Buy a CD/Clock instead","review":"While the concept of this product is good, since it is not built to accomodate the new style cribs with wider sides and trim, my wife and I returned this immediately. Instead of buying this unit that requires batteries, I would recommend spending the $50 on a CD/Alarm clock (Sony makes a nice one)- now you can play your CDs and, since it plugs in, you don't need to go through batteries. This will also last a lot longer for your child."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'm very disappointed!","review":"I saw this unit advertised in one of the Babies R Us catalogs and I talked for weeks about getting it. Since the closest store to us is still about 30 miles away, it took me a while to actually get it. I was so excited, came right home and installed it. And to my utter disappointment, the unit was a piece of junk. I tried several CDs on it, but it would only play them if the unit was laying down (not hanging from the crib side -- what's the point!). And when it would finally catch on and start playing, it would skip like crazy. I'm making another trip to the store to return this tomorrow. What a disappointment!"},{"rating":"1","title":"skips constantly","review":"i have now exchanged this item three times. it skips constantly. i would not recommend it to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good idea - very poor quality","review":"I had triplets and bought 3 of these.

Being able to change the music our son listens to every nite is such a nice option - and we don't have to listen to the same lullaby's all the time (if at all).The light is dim, but as a few others noted, who wants a bright light? The baby is trying to sleep!It's enough light to see him if I peek in and it's still on.I feel the volume is plenty loud enough. It is a crib cd player, not a house cd player. It's plenty loud enough for his tiny nursery, and i've never turned it all the way up.I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 for the battery issue - it eats batteries worse than any other toy he has - including the swing which we use much more often.I thought that was strange, and if it does take that much power, it should come with rechargable batteries.Maybe the next model :)overall we're very pleased though."},{"rating":"1","title":"Agree w/ Waste O Money","review":"I purchased this item at an additional 30% off the \\"clearance price\\" thinking this was a great deal regardless of the quality.

Baby will love you for it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Does the trick","review":"I really like this CD player. I do not understand why it has such a low review.*Yes the light is dim but I did not want a bright light. It is a nightlite. It is just fine. I can check on baby and see him fine.*The volume does not get very loud but for what this is designed for it is fine. I put in a lullaby CD and he drifts off to sleep.*The timer function if great.*The only reason I did not give it 5 stars is that I wish the digital readout and the buttons lite up. It is hard to see in the dark and I do not like to turn on the light to see the buttons and digital read out. Maybe in the next version the manufacture will include this.*As far as the CD's ckipping when hit, I solved that by sliding a piece of foam between the play and the rails of the crib. No there is no space to move at all and it does not skip.***It is not perfect but it does the trick!***"},{"rating":"1","title":"Piece of Junk!!","review":"The second day of use I started to get \\"ER\\" when I pressed play.

We are now using my clock radio CD player which he'll be able to use through college if he wants for half the price.DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY...TRUST ME ON THIS ONE!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"This thing is pointless!!","review":"First off, it skips all the time. While I was trying to pat my baby's back, I bumped the crib and it skipped. While I was across the room rocking her in the rocker, it skipped. 2/3 times it would give me an error message. And when it would work, it would have an error message within 5 minutes later. After exchanging it for a new one and getting the same results I called the manf. and they told me to try some things.

It happens so often that we run out of batteries and then the CD player sits, useless, for long periods of time until we get around to getting new batteries.

I wouldn't recommend this product unless you have a LIFETIME supply of batteries handy."},{"rating":"1","title":"it gets worse before it gets better...even dangerous","review":"we have had this product since our child went into a crib. the music was fine in the early years, and the product presented few challenges. ever since our daughter could pull herself up and fumble with the device, it has been a little dicey.today was the very worse, as our inquisitive daughter got her finger stuck in the back where the attachment clips go. it turned out to be some trauma of dis lodging her finger, but it truly could have easily been a broken or amputated finger within minutes of our arrival. this has to be reviewed for safety sakes. it is truly a terrible accident waiting to happen"},{"rating":"1","title":"Good Only Until Baby Sits Up","review":"We had this unit given to us as a shower gift. Wasn't thrilled because it required changing batteries every week and was very sensitive to skipping, but it did its purpose to soothe the baby to sleep with lullaby music. Our baby is now 13 mos. and we hadn't realized that he has been picking at the clips that secure it to the railing. Just yesterday we found he had finally managed to break off a piece and almost choked on it! We do not recommend this to be placed in a crib after your child has learned to sit up.. We have written to the company to have this put on the product info. Anyone who has this should remove it once the baby sits up! We wouldn't want any other parent to have to scoop a chunk of plastic out of your toddlers mouth."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a good purchase","review":"I agree with the maority of reviews.

I received it as a gift at a baby shower, and I thought it was really neat. However, the first one I had did not work at all, and had to be returned to the company. They sent me a replacement. It worked fine, but the batteries would only last for MAYBE a week. I used it perhaps two times with my first baby.In addition to the fact that the batteries need to be replaced constantly, the design of the product is a pain too. It is just plain difficult to change the CDs, and the buttons on the controls are tiny. Anyone who has a baby knows that any product you use for the first few months needs to be operable with just one hand.If you want to play CDs in the nursery, go to a discount store and buy a $15 CD player that will sit on the dresser. This one is a total waste of money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Piece of Junk","review":"I was really excited when I got this because I thought that it was a great idea. However, after taking it out of the box and trying it out, I realized the concept is great, the quality isn't.When I opened the plastic cover so I could have access to the buttons, all was good and in great shape. When I pressed the play button, the button broke. I pressed stop and took my CD out. When I closed the cover over the buttons, the latches broke, so the cover wouldn't stay closed.The quality of this item is poor. I took mine back and the person who handled my return said that they get a lot of them back and are no longer going to carry them.

It easily breaks. Worst of all, the sound quality is for the birds. You would be better off purchasing an alram clock radio with a CD player.

Unfortunately, my sister had this piece of junk on her baby's crib and we were shocked to discover that it cost $50.00 (it was a gift).

It can be plugged in and when baby outgrows his crib you can still keep and use the cd player on his/her dresser. It's better to buy CD player with long term use in mind, so invest your $$ in a better CD player that can be used for years to come, not just the baby, crib & toddler years."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not handy","review":"While this is a nice product, I ended up returning it for several reasons: 1) The two C-batteries were not convenient or easy to replace (need a screwdriver each time), 2)The CD changer compartment takes two hands to open and it makes a loud noise -- not good for a sleeping baby, 3) The music is not in stereo sound.You're better off with a mini-boombox that plays both CD's and cassettes -- not only for convenience and sound quality but for the price."},{"rating":"1","title":"worked only two days","review":"Gave this as a gift for my grandchild...she loves the music, but only after two days, music wouldn't play, called the company and now I have to return it.

This is one of them. But this one costs [price]. I wonder if First Years counts on this item being a baby shower present that will be thrown out instead of returned.The concept is a good one. Since babies like music, place a small, portable CD at cribside. I wanted it to soothe my son while I changed his diapers. Was I mistaken!! The unit skips repeatedly. It drives me to distraction, never mind the affect on a newborn. Furthermore the speaker output is so tinny, Edison's \\"Mary Had a Little Lamb\\" sounds better.Inserting the batteries were a chore as well. I can't report on battery usage since my wife and I do not use the thing any more. Considering that the Discman has been out for a decade, I was very surprised by the Crib CD Player's poor quality.Thank goodness we kept the box."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Bad You Can't Rate Less Than One Star!","review":"This product is a piece of junk!.

We use this cd player everynight for the first 3 months of my daughter's life and she falls to sleep to it everytime. We didn't have any problems as everyone else did BUT the only complaint we do have is that it doesn't last too long with batteries. We got tired of recharging those batteries and unscrewing the back to change the battery(safety feature, I guess)...So we went to Target and bought a small cd/radio alarm clock(with an outlet plug, of course)......it worked out great for us."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Worth The Money!!!","review":"We had high expectations for this cd player. What a great concept but a horrible product. It seems as though the batteries run out after one cd. And yes, it does skip and quit in the middle of a cd. It is also very time consuming to take the batteries out (and who has time with a brand new baby???)Don't waste your money!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I think it's great!","review":"I really love this player; the light is just right for a baby; the sound is very good;I can hear it playing in the baby's room from my room at the other end of the house.

The 2nd CD player worked but it was such a letdown. The volume is very low, even on the highest setting. It eats batteries. You can only use it while the baby is in the crib(because the volume is so low you can't hear it unless you are in the crib or right next to it.) I would have much rather had a portable CD player... Now that my baby is crawling the Cd player is virtually useless.

The batteries don't last!! They are very hard to change. You have to remove the light which is near impossible to get to the batteries. In the beginning, I was using this every night to get my daughter to sleep & then one night our whole routine is off because this wouldn't play. And it had only been a week!!! The thing skips horribly. It was the worst baby product I recieved. I went out and got a CD player alarm clock for $40 and have had no problems. You will spend more on batteries for this CD player then the $50 you spend to buy it."},{"rating":"2","title":"The truth be told.","review":"The truth be told, yes the volume is low. It is not supposed to be a stereo system. This is a perfect thing to have for a childs crib. It shows them that music doesn't have to be blareing to be enjoyable and also this product isnt supposed to be used for loud music anyway. That is why it is made for a crib!! To be soft and soothing, to lull your baby to sleep. So for those who want a stereo type system to play music in the room i would suggest that you buy just that. My baby goes to sleep more easily with the soft classical music playing. Oh! and another beautiful option.......you can change the cd's to whatever you want. Unlike mobiles that only play selected songs over and over and over again. As far as the batteries i have had this for 3 months and only had to change them one time and that was recent. So inconclusion i would recommend this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor battery life and shoddy quality","review":"Player is relatively compact and connects easily to crib. The positives end there. Main negatives are amazingly short battery life (which I assume is a function of poor product design since the thing holds two big C-sized batteries vs. my compact little sony cd player which holds two AA batteries and plays for hours and hours) and the fact that you need a phillips head screwdriver to replace them. Also, the speaker quality is pretty weak and the controls are not very responsive. Finally, light is a nice feature but too dim to be of any real value."},{"rating":"1","title":"We hated it","review":"The volume on ours was not very loud. It skipped and was hard to use.

The volume is perfect for bedtime (it is not meant for jamming) and I put it on the changing table to avoid the skipping. Also, I love to take it on trips. I attach it to the playpen she sleeps in and it doesn't break her routine from home. Love it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Worth It!","review":"This CD player which seemed like a nice addition to my son's nursery was such a waste.

I received a lot of lullaby cd's for my baby shower and thought this was a great idea. It works great except for the battery drainage & after the cd is over, it shuts off. But in my case, my son is already asleep by time its over.I would recommend this to my friends & family."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Huge Waste","review":"This CD player is completely impractical. You will spend so much money on buying more batteries that you will pay for the CD player a couple of times over. The sound isn't the best quality either. As for the timer button, you can't just leave it pushed in. Every time you hit play, you have to turn the timer off and then back on again to get it to re-set. I didn't want to take it back because it was a gift. I would rather have a regular CD player with a plug sitting on the shelf and I should have taken it back."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't do it !!","review":"Wow, what a poor, poor product! Once I determined how to install the batteries as there were no instructs in the box ( meaning someone else had returned this to the store ), I found that I was not able to employ any of the control buttons on the display! Also shame on babies r us for simply restocking this item after someone had returned it for the same problem. They simply threw it back out on the shelf !!"},{"rating":"2","title":"LOVE THIS!!","review":"I love this product!! My daughter loves music and this was perfect!! The light is easy to turn on and a very subtle glow to be able to check the baby at night! The cd player does not offer the \\"stereo surround\\" of a huge entertainment system, but my daughter did not care! She danced and loved having the music playing. We played our CD Player a lot and the battery usage is not any worse than a toy with batteries that is used frequently. I never had to return it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic!","review":"I just love this CD Player! I have a premature baby in the NICU and she falls right to sleep when we have it playing. I do admit it really eats up batteries-but its a fantastic item.We have had no trouble with it skipping."},{"rating":"1","title":"The sound is terrible","review":"I registered for this and was too embarassed to take it back, but there truly is nothing good to say about this cd player. The sound is very very low (goes from inaudible to barely there), the nightlight function is controlled by a teeny tiny button impossible to find unless an overhead light is already on (what good is that??), all the buttons on this are ludicrously small, difficult to use, and impossible to find without waking the baby, and switching cd's in cumbersome."},{"rating":"1","title":"pchad","review":"We got this product as a gift and it worked 3 times. If you set the timer you might as well buy new batteries right away but you have to expect that these things will eat up batteries. After changing batteries for the third time in as many weeks, the product turns on by itself and the only button that works is the light which also now starts and pauses the CD. The only way to turn it off is to take out the batteries which requires a screwdriver for a screw about an inch long TO HOLD BATTERIES!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Idea But Disappointed","review":"I really used this when our son was in his bassinet, but not in the crib.

Yes it plays CDs, but that is about it. My main issues are: (1) opening the CD player or the control shield is extremely noisy and difficult; (2) the volume range is nowhere near wide enough (the unit is very quite); (3) the light is useless when the unit is mounted on a crib rail. I would not recommend this product!"},{"rating":"1","title":"first time mom named Michelle","review":"I was excited to get this product. The cd player was a gift off my baby regisry and i ran out and bought c batteries only to be let down by the outcome of performance of this product. I played a baby einstein classical music cd for 1 minute to test the product out and was unpleasantly surprised by the horrible sound quality. All i heard was static with a bit of music in the background. This product is going right back to the store. I recommend getting a little boombox made by sony or an electronics brand instead of this product. It seemed like a good idea, especially since it hooks on to the crib and has a nightlight, but i bought the product mainly for the ability to play clear music. don't waste your time or your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't fit on most cribs","review":"This would have been perfect providing it fit on most cris.

Your best bet is to buy a small cd player for the same price and you'll get more for your money!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Battery Life and Shoddy Quality","review":"Player is relatively compact and connects easily to crib. The positives end there. Main negatives are amazingly short battery life (which I assume is a function of poor product design since the thing holds two big C-sized batteries vs. my compact little sony cd player which holds two AA batteries and plays for hours and hours) and the fact that you need a phillips head screwdriver to replace them. Also, the speaker quality is pretty weak and the controls are not very responsive. Finally, light is a nice feature but too dim to be of any real value."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible Product!!

We have used it for 5 months and have had no problems with skipping or breaking. Our baby loves to go to sleep with her music. The nightlight was great for checking on her when she was a newborn, but after a few uses the batteries run low and the light is not bright enough. All CD players that run on batteries eat them, but they are safer than cords....your baby will be mobile in no time."},{"rating":"1","title":"So Disappointed!","review":"I registered for and received this CD Player, since it is the only one of its kind. When I went to set up the nursery I was so disappointed to discover that it was not capable of adjusting to accomodate any crib. Unfortunately because of the width of the rails on my crib, It didnt fit. I was so excited about this product, especially because its hanging on the crib was a space saver.

I want my money back,babies r us does not give money back and they do not carry another brand CD player."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wish I would have read the other reviews before purchasing","review":"Now that I have, I agree with most. This is a very cheaply made product that is difficult to open and I can easily see how a few uses will loosen the poorly constructed hinges etc....The sound is awful as well. I'm thinking for a little more money, I will purchase a small boom box with much better sound quality, ease of use and can get more use out of it. The light isn't that impressive either.This is a good example of very poor workmanship. I was dissappointed from the minute I opened it and I tried to give it a chance but just found it difficult to use. From changing the battery to opening the front cover to opening the side to put in a CD -- Everything is hard to open and sticks real tight.When I decided to return it, I read the other reviews and wish I had read them prior to buying."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Impressed","review":"It's a great idea, but I was not impressed with this crib player at all.

Oh, and it does skip just like everyone else has said so don't bump the crib when laying your baby down!! The light is useless too...what is it really for? You can't use it to see the front of the cd player in the dark (it's located on the BACK of the cd player) are you really going to turn on a light that shines right into your sleeping baby's crib??

It's worth the effort to stay awake, though, to follow the suggestions in the imagery and also to listen to the affirmations.

She apparently had love for a married man and did not succumb to it, in contrast to Elsa, the daughter of Mr. Stanhope, who is horrified by Elsa's action in contrast to Alison's and to his own.

The 17-50mm range is not great but for portraits, around the house and landscape photography us enough. Our second lens is EF 70-200 f2.8 IS II USM and this one is our workhorse.I recommend this EF-S 17-555 lens - it will make your life easier in low light conditions and any other time.Don't forget: photography is all about to take your camera, go out there and have fun!

Careful testing showed this new lens to be about \\"one-stop sharper\\" over the 17-35mm range than the kit lens. What I mean by this is that the 17-55 matched the 17-85 sharpness with one stop faster aperture: same sharpness at f2.8 for 17mm as the 17-85 at f4.0. Beyond 35mm the sharpness of the 17-55 faded until both lenses were essentially equal in sharpness at 55mm. The 17-55 was noticibly softer at 55mm than at 17mm while the 17-85 was sharper at 55mm than at 17mm. So, the advantage of f2.8 and better sharpness at the wide end for the 17-55 is at least partially negated by diminished sharpness at the meager 55mm long end. The 17-85 has about the same build quality but is smaller, lighter, covers a longer focal length range and for me is a better deal at about half the price."},{"rating":"1","title":"slightly dis appointed","review":"After reading some very good reviews of this lens, I was very diaappointed to see dust inside the lens, including a fairly large spot, within days after getting it. The distortion around the edge was quite noticeable. With a lens costing this much and comparison to \\"L\\" lens, I never expected this. Canon needs to improve its quality control. I, too, believe that a lens hood should have been included at this price."},{"rating":"2","title":"AWESOME LENS....MUST HAVE!","review":"I'm very serious about that title...if your finances allow, do not buy the kit 18-55 lens, kick those dollars into this lens and you'll be an EXTREMELY happy camper! Others may give detailed reviews and sing the praises of this lens in more colorful ways than you'll read here, just know that I had the kit lenses and now I have this one and am ecstatic about the upgrade!

This was a bad experience and I ended up having to buy a good copy of the lens elsewhere)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good, but not great","review":"High imagine quality, quick autofocus, but the build is a little weak.

The carton showed-up today. A large box, deflated airbags and my new $1000 lens in Canon's carton bounced around. I can not believe Amazon hasn't a clue on packing/shipping these lenses. Fortunately, it seems my lens is OK, but this is the last of several purchases I will make direct to Amazon.com."},{"rating":"1","title":"Excellent Optical Quality, Sub-Par Build Quality","review":"I expected this unit to be a bit more robust for the $1,000 price tag, but was disappointed that it felt cheap in my hands. After about a day's worth of usage I didn't feel that the unit had long-term durability so I returned it in exchange for the Canon 24-70 f/2.8 L USM. I bought my 17-55 from Adorama and they were fast and efficient on processing my return without issues.If you can live with paying $1,000 for what equates down to quality glass in a cheap feeling plastic and an un-sealed dust-prone lens, go for it. I would suggest, for the price, the 24-105 f/4 L USM or the 24-70 f/2.8 L USM."},{"rating":"2","title":"1.6 crop Canon","review":"this lens is too heavy for its size, but with aperture of 2.8 it becomes very light, especially for shooting in low light"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"The item arrived packed with a few air pillows to cushion it from side blows. However, if the lens was dropped anywhere along the way, there is nothing protecting it with Amazon's method of packing lenses. To test the lens, I took 25 tripod shots of a few scenes with this lens and the EF-S 18-55 kit lens under the same conditions and apertures. Apertures ranged from f/4.5 to f/11 so as to compare with kit lens. Quality was very similar with the kit lens winning by a nose about 50% of the time in both my and my wife's judgment. A big letdown and certainly not worth the $. I assume I got a bad copy from the good reviews elsewhere."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great lens to carry if you want to travel light","review":"After I bought my Canon 40D back in 2007, I was looking for ONE single lens that I can take on my travel, as I always want to travel as light as possible. It has to operate in low light condition as I may not always have my tripod. It has to be versatile in its zoom range as I may be shooting landscape in wide angle one day and portrait of my Mom the next. The EF-S 17-55mm f/2.8 delivers what I was looking for. IS works extremely well and I've made some street shots at night that would not be possible otherwise. I have been using this for 2 years and it's always the lens I take with me if I'm required to carry only one.The sole complain I have with this lens is flare, even with the lens hood. It doesn't improve much if I use larger apertures. It makes all the back lighting and sunset scenes more challenging. And that's why I'm giving this a 4 star and not 5."},{"rating":"2","title":"awesome lens","review":"I love this lens. A lot of my friends who have looked at the pictures also agree that it takes great photos. The image stabilization is a really nice feature, it lets you just walk and click, making it super easy to take pictures of people/things while you walk. I found myself just holding my finger over the shoot button after a while, because it was such a joy to take pictures with this thing.I don't know anyone who hasn't liked this lens. For someone who is looking to buy their first serious lens, this a a pretty good selection, I think. It takes great portraits, has fairly wide angle so you can capture scenes, and the image stabilization is cool especially the more you start playing with f-stops and film speeds. You can get a lot of cool blur effects without much work, just like magic.It also took a great night picture for me, that I've become really proud of. I can't say enough good things about this lens.FYI, my camera body is a Canon EOS 400D."},{"rating":"2","title":"Favorite walkaround lens.","review":"This is now my favorite lens. It is now on my XSi 95% of the time. Wide enough for most purposes, and has some zoom capability. Excellent in low light, good for portraits, and its not TOO heavy.

The lens is pretty bulky though, but then again, so is my camera.Some people don't like the fact that you're paying a premium for an EF-S lens.

So that's not a huge factor for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dust Sucker!","review":"I am on my second copy of this lens. Both lenses accumulated significant dust underneath the front element within one week of owning this lens. It has a very poor feeling zoom operation. It's impossible to zoom slowly and evenly while shooting video. I love how sharp this lens is, even at 2.8, but it's inexcusable that Canon chose to not fix the problems surrounding the poor build quality for such an expensive lens. I plan on keeping this lens, because it's the best lens for a crop sensor. It pairs very well with my 60d. It's off to Canon for a cleaning after one week of owning. I plan on putting a UV filter from now on when it gets back from Canon. Last thing, its absurd that I have to spend another $50 on a lens hood because Canon won't send one with the lens. For $1,100, it should come with a lens hood. Think twice before purchasing this lens."},{"rating":"2","title":"L class?","review":"I had this lens for a short period of time and experimented with various subjects. My impressions: IS works very well. 2.8+IS+highISO = flash-free handheld photos in the dark. A little too bulky and heavy for my taste -- I have been spoiled by the versatile and light 50mm 1.4 :) Zoom range is very versatile. This may well be the ideal tourist lens as it covers the needs for indoors, architecture, landscapes, and portrait shots."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great lens. Kind of expensive.","review":"This lens costs nearly as much as an 'L' lens of the same focal range, but is not made quite as well. It's a pretty long and heavy lens for the focal range, and the hood is just silly big (I guess that's how it has to be, though). The hood is not included with the lens, and costs $50(!) dollars, on top of an already pricey lens. I somewhat miss the longer zoom range of the 17-85mm f/4-5.6 IS that I replaced with this lens, but that lens was just ridiculously slow. Oh well, I guess it's all about trade-offs in this game.Still, it *is* a great lens. It's sharp, in my experience, and I'm happy to have the (much) larger maximum aperture, which is the whole reason I bought it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Strange book from a strange guy","review":"This book is a little strange, Heinrich Böll seems to me to be a somewhat strange man. Anyway the book is about the nazis, the cathologic religion and love. The main character Hans seems to always be in conflict with everyone. But he is quite outspoken, for one example he is playing with some Hitler jugend in nazi Germany and then he exclaimingly call them nazi-swine! Now that's kind of bold isn't it?

They even liked the parts with model trains---they usually just like the big train parts of videos like this. There was also less annoying banter and dialogue than some videos like this, and more pure train viewing! The only thing I didn't like was the part where Santa was throwing things (hard to tell what? It looked like popcorn or something!) from a train for kids to pick up off the tracks---I don't think that goes along with the safety message on this same video---NEVER PLAY ON TRACKS! But still worth buying and watching with your kids and reminding them of the rules when you get to that part."},{"rating":"1","title":"just terrible","review":"This movie gives me nightmares.

The packing was sufficient to keep it from moving around so there were no nicks or dents and all the glass was intact.

The only disappointment is that the bulbs were not ready to be shipped at the same time so I have an installed light that won't turn on because it doesn't have the bulbs yet.

We tried to order an extender pipe to bring it down from the ceiling, and it only comes in black, even though are mount is silver and they are made by the same company. Also, the extender needed a pipe coupler, which was not included, and I can't find a place to buy it anywhere.

I found this book to be very inspiring and uplifting. It is the story of a woman, though her humility, grace and strength, with God's help saved her people. It shows once again that God is in control and He uses the most humble people to carry out His plans. He is a God of surprises and we are only to trust and obey Him and He will do amazing things through us."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect","review":"Charles Swindoll won my heart long ago. Queen Esther won my heart after hearing Chuck Swindoll teach on her for about 10 weeks.

He used the most unsuspecting people to save the Jews. This story has been a lesson in my Bible class for 6th grade girls for years."},{"rating":"1","title":"More speculations than Truth","review":"In reading this book I was disappointed to find that the points Charles Swindoll makes are based more on speculation and inferences upon inferences than actual Biblical truth. I actually could not finish reading this book as I couldn't find the value in this. I prefer to learn about the life of Esther from what the Bible presents, not how the author thinks Esther might have felt and then how she might have responded from that."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not this one","review":"The book has an attractive cover and is well-marketed. Beyond that, it's not worth the investment of time nor money. The well-meaning author writes in a folksy narrative, with flagrant grammar flaws and overuses exclamation marks. The organization and chronology are likewise poor. Worse yet, substantively, the book reaches far and states assumptions which are not Biblically sound. Unfortunately, the author is not clear to point out those incidences when he may be speculating versus citing fact, which makes for some unsound theology. Read the Biblical book of Esther and see how vastly different it is from this book. This read is heavy on extras and tangents that are irrelevant to the theme."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'm not sure how to comment on it!","review":"I would like for Mr. Swindoll to know that he has wrong information in his book.

It's been very simple to clean and my 14 month old daughter seems to be comfortable sitting on it. She's more than willing to sit and go potty whenever she is sat on it. It doesn't move around much on the floor as it has a rubbery strip to keep it from moving. I also enjoy the fact that the bowl in it doesn't move around inside the chair so no accidental spill, misses, etc. The edges of the bowl are slanted and when you dump the contents into the toilet you don't get drips like you would on a flat edged one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Finally found a big enough potty!!!","review":"If you are looking for a bigger potty, this is it.

My son was just over 2 1/2 years old and he is skinny. I guess they make the potties like everything else in this micro mini world we live in. This fits my son well and he likes it. I love the built in pee pee guard, he can't remove it. He loves to bring the insert to me and show off his accomplishments.

What she means is that her feet are tingling and going to sleep. Then she doesn't want to get off because her legs are numb and she gets scared. She is not a big girl but this seat is just too uncomfortable for her. Also, every time she gets up the insert sticks to her behind and will dump if there is anything in it.

I've put him on it a couple times without his diaper and most times he actually uses it! I think it's more likely due to lucky timing, but I'm still so proud! I'm not pushing the potty-training idea yet since he's not quite 15 months yet, but so far he seems happy about the chair.

Even with sitting back as far as he can go, leaning slightly forward, aiming his pee-pee down, the pee goes up the splash guard onto his inner thighs, down the front of the seat and onto the floor. We've only been using it for three days so far but I have had to clean my son up, myself, the potty seat, and the floor every single time. I know potty training is daunting, but with these messes, diapers were way easier! I'm going back to the simple potty ring on the big toilet now."},{"rating":"1","title":"Gross","review":"This potty chair is terrible. Small and unstable. Use this only if you want to have more pee on the floor than in the pot-the splash guard acts more as a projectile ramp for pee than a guard. it is difficult to clean and the plastic seems to absorb bathroom smells (gross). I would recommend just getting a mini-toilet seat and putting your kid up on a regular toilet."},{"rating":"1","title":"CAN HURT GILS VAGINA","review":"I puchased because of the great reviews but never really looked at the design. When my little girl tries to sit on her own she can miss and hurt her vagina or bottom on the front point.
