I wish I would have had this book 20 years ago!!! I am definitely getting copies for my niece, sisters, and friends. Dr. Edelberg explains very thoroughly and in a way that is interesting what the heck has been going on all these years with these hormones! His book is enlightening and gives great practical solutions and allowed me to implement my own Triple Whammy Cure with unbelievable results. I want to share this with everyone I know. Even some men suffer alot of the same symptoms Dr. Edelberg describes and can really benefit from employing his Triple Whammy Cure techniques. Dr. Edelberg has truly given us a gift with this book - all of his years of experience, observation, and working with patients that we can benefit from.

There are some cool moments in the book such as when Maria and Melissa are going at it in the hallway and Tia breaks them up.

Not sure what happened in the ebook conversion, but it is the worst ebook I've ever seen.

I found the poems in this book a little redundant but still well written and a few even thought provoking. The major problem, and the reason I would not recommend that you buy this edition, is the kindle formatting. The typeface goes from super small to comically large at random. The is no way to adjust it so that it is uniform. I realize that e books are not perfect but this one is almost unreadable. At times, the typeface is as tiny as it can be on a kindle and the tool to enlarge it has no effect. Anyone with even a slight visual impairment would not be able to read this print.

If you need humans in your renderings, make the human in poser--nowhere else to do so, thus we're stuck with it--and then export as an object file and open in Bryce.

I should note both hard drives crashed after the installation of Poser 5 and the upgrade on their website.I have emailed Curious Labs several times for customer support (as has the gift recipient), but have recieved absolutely NO response. Three weeks is a more than adequate time to wait for a response. There is also no technical support phoneline, which there should be.My main problem with this company is not the product at this point, but the lack of service (or even acknowledgement of customers) on behalf of Curious Labs.

When you look at the website of Horus3D, you'll see that a Vicky3-Figure can be raytraced within 3 Seconds with transparency! Poser? How long do you need to do this? So nobody should tell me, that Poser 5 is that slow, because it isn't possible to be faster! The main-programmers of Curious Labs has left the company after the Poser 5 disaster.

I spent a day trying to get the woman's boot to Conform to any thing, the best I got was for it to conform with the toes hanging out.It renders good images if you can afford days to get it right by reloading the base image over and over.

I find that to be one of the lowest and most deceptive practices out there.

And nobody is lying when they say parts of the program don't work. The face room doesn't work, cloth I won't even try, and the hair room works only if you are using to apply gravity effects to pre existing hair.I'm hoping whoever buys the Curious Labs will have the programming ability and integrity to fix the program, and to sack the people who mostly sold a bill of goods to the public.

The kids are able to flush water down into it by pushing the button but the lever that needs to be pulled out to drop the contents down into the bottom tank is tough to pull out and push in.

This portable toilet is in our van, on carpet, not out in the elements. When we added the sanitizer liquid which is blue in color did we see the large stain. The Carpet ruined. It took some time to find the leak, two 1 inch cracks on the bottom tank in a \\"most unlikely area\\". When holding the tank to the light it is very visible and one can see the lousy workmanship of the cheap plastic molding, thin on one side, thicker on the other. Of course this Portable toilet was made in China. For $ 93.89 dollars it is not worth it and cost us even more due to the damage to the rug.

If you have purchased these, I strongly suggest you grab a DVM and check polarity first. By the way, it is not reversed internally in the battery. The wiring from the battery is correct in that the red wire is positive. But the connector was installed backwards and thus polarity is reversed via that problem.

It's as though the author created her heroine after watching Doris Day's portrayal of Calamity Jane, not realizing it was intended to be an amusing caricature for a 1950s audience.Yosemite Sam in a dress would have seemed more authentic as a contemporary American woman.Come to think of it, the author *did* describe how short the character was.

But, to then take these stories and presume to have the experience and expertise to write a book? That's questionable (and that's sugarcoating my full opinion). Jack Welch on big business, and almost any one of thousands of ethical and successful small business people, would have earned the right to be listened to. A book written by a journalist who evidently has little if any first hand experience with running a business in the trenches has not.

I'm not sure even he understood what he was speaking and in doing so, his performance became quite wooden.

I use the set at home with my Gateway laptop and its so nice to have a simple hookup and fewer wires in the way. My cat can't pull the wires and mess up my work anymore! I'm still on my first set of batteries after 2 months and very pleased with the overall performance. Only 2 minor issues: First, if you use the NUM Lock to use the 10 key pad and fail to unlock it prior to disconnect, the F Lock sticks on the laptop keypad. Second,I got spoiled using the extra side buttons as back/forward on my previous optical mouse and this mouse does not have that lovely feature. For a casual home user its a great buy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mouse problems corrected","review":"My wife liked the keyboard and mouse very much but the cursor would randomly jump and move down and left. I played with receiver location and batteries then I read the comments here and on the circuit city site.I want to thank whoever said they fixed similar problems by adjusting the mouse control software. It solved my problem. No more jumping.Now works great and rock solid."},{"rating":"1","title":"sub par","review":"I was disappointed with my purchase...several things made this set a less than perfect product. My main problem is the mouse; not only does it eat through batteries- it never shuts off, so I pull the batteries out at night- but it also has shoddy drivers- the mouse will freeze up occasionally, and if you don't move it constantly, it will left click and move down diagonally the next time you move it. THe keyboard is fine, except the delete key and the F-lock system. Because I already know the Word shortcuts, the F-lock system is just redundant, and actually get in the way because it forces you to relearn the key. If F-lock is on, Spell-check is F-10 instead of F-7. This is unnecessary IMO. The different setup for the delete/home/end/pgup/pgdn might be more efficient, but I still have problems with it. Overall, I wish I'd gone the Logitech route."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad reception.","review":"I received this as a gift. I am happy I haven't spent any money on this one. It has a sleek design and it works fine if you are within 1 feet to your computer. If you want to get a little far, it becomes useless.What is the point of having it wireless if you have to stay next to your computer.Really bad reception. I am trying to watch a movie couple feet away from my computer and I cannot use the keyboard or mouse to control. I tried everything. I took the communication part as close as I could, still I had to bring the keyboard almost next to it. I used brand new batteries hoping that was the problem, but unfortunately it was the useless microsoft product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Major disappointment","review":"After waiting more than a month for this product to be released, I was very disappointed to find the wireless optical mouse is very slow. You can use the USB port and the enclosed software and tweak it all you want, but it still will never speed across your screen. The keyboard seemed fine, but the two items are a package. I returned the Microsoft product and bought a Logitech Elite Keyboard (yes, it is corded, but who really needs a cordless keyboard?) and an excellent Logitech Cordless Optical mouse, which speeds across the screen as fast as I want. The Logitech mouse also has a slightly higher profile, which I find more comfortable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love the backpack, hate the zippers","review":"This backpack has plenty of room for everything you will need including paperwork, accesories, etc. It's is sturdy and has survived now for a couple of years of travel/commuting. The only issue with it is the zippers, specifically the dangling handles. They are fragile, break easily, and cannot be replaced.

Trouble struck when my wife borrowed it to go to Wisconsin. She loved it so much, I am having difficulty getting it back. It is a great backpack. Great adjustable back support.

This backpack replaced my older general-purpose daypack. I like everything about this Contour pack. It's lightweight, has tons of pockets, and is extremely comfortable. Fully-loaded with a laptop, PDA, cellphone, accessories, and books it still feels balanced and comfortable on my back. The lumbar support system, which has four adjustable position, is a great innovation. You can feel the difference--the pack fits snug against your body. The laptop is held securely in its own padded area. The zippers are smooth with oversized finger tags. The pack stands up on it's own: no need to rest it against a wall.

It collects all the trite elements of several series and popular novels and adds nothing orignal to the story that would make it it's own story.It is void of orignality. It is a collection of fantasy novel cliche's, and they all irritate. It would have been different if this book was a parody.Volume one of a series?

There is no straining to overcome light reflection to tell what colors the dominoes are or having difficulty counting the pips at a distance. Yes, Puremco's choice of colors for the 6 & 9 could have been better but the line under the 6 suffices once we got used to it. Yes, the 4 & 7 have somewhat similar shades of yellow.

So no, it can't AF, it can't meter (with most camera's) there's no digital components and you have to manually close the aperture if you're lucky enough to find yourself in a situation not requiring it to be wide open. But the glass is very well constructed for the most part, and if you have patience and time to learn the ins and outs of this lens you can capture far more than acceptable images. If you're a beginner to the photo game this is probably not the best lens for you, as its focus ring can be touchy and learning the how to of using it's aperture settings is a pain. But, if you're like me, and have a mixed bag of equipment (i shoot Nikon dig. and Oly. film, as well as owning an Oly dig.) then having one lens, that can fit all of my body's with a simple change of the T-mount ring is a heaven sent."},{"rating":"1","title":"Preset Lens for Sony Alpha","review":"Well made, but optically flawed.

No more hunting for the back arrow with the mouse. Anytime I can do something without the mouse I like it.OFFICE SHORTCUTS: Honestly, the one I use the most is Mail. I have the Mail key reprogrammed to create a new mail message. So I don't have to find the email program, then click new mail message. One button access to new email!COMPLAINTS: My one complaint is the way they arranged the key group above the arrow keys (home, page up, page down, delate). This is a non-standard way to arrange the keys so it take a bit of getting used to.

The voice acting and plot are terrible. However, character advancement, swarms of enemies, and a large selection of weapons make up for the characters' inane babbling.Difficulty increases in parts of the game, requiring a change in strategy. You are encouraged to change your tactics and equipment to match the enemies that you are facing. After finishing the bonus dungeon twice (level 198, doing millions of points of damage), there are still very dangerous enemies around.If you're looking for 20--80 hours (depending on your commitment) of dungeon-hack/Gauntlet-style gameplay with pleasant RPG elements, this is for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dreadful game from SEGA","review":"Lets list what's wrong with this game, as there are so many things.1)Awful voice acting that ruins any sense of atmosphere.2)Very cheap production with events happening in a 2d storyboard.3)Very Childish with horrible dialogue such as \\"Sheeesh\\" \\"Now hush up young man\\" and the main character being patronised constantly. Dreadful4)Awful setting up with the female lead as the girlfriend from the very start. Even though there are much cooler and better women in the game. The hero always gets the \\"Pluckey tomboy\\" Cheesy.5)Dull combat with a single attack button as bad as shining tears. Did SEGA not play Star Ocean 3, when they decided on real time combat.6)Not great graphics.

But the fact that the action is so incredibly hard really hurts the game.

What I mean by that is that the author presents a jumble of traditions and tells the reader to practice with any of the \\"deities\\" mentioned that they feel comfortable with. This is fine for people who work with architypes and old gods but the author also mentions Orisha. Orisha are NOT gods, they are spirits, they are tangible living spirits which are recieved through initiation into Santeria. Orisha can be worked with without initiation, but you must have a relationship with them, not treat them like just another face or architype of different gods and goddesses. In Santeria there is God/Olodumare and then there are Orisha who are spirits.

So I think I am qualified enough to say: this is not one of the best, to say the least. The story started out well enough, but soon I became bored. By chapter four I was ready to close the book. I simply did not care for the babbling sniffling heroine Cecily and the boring knight Simon with his fever attacks. The story dragged on and on. If you want a sweet little story with a sweet hero and heroine, go ahead. But if you want a sizzling romance, buy something else."},{"rating":"2","title":"A knight with nightmares, a novice with dreams of passion","review":"Sounds like an intersting story, but it lacked something.

Personally, I was VERY disappointed after being suckered by all the 5-star reviews. I have seen these guys live and, like most regional bands, their studio effort fails to capture their live energy/sound. That being said, I wasn't impressed with their live performance, either (YES, I caught a good show - the \\"faithful\\" told me it was \\"classic\\" . . . poor saps!). These guys are quaint, but lack the chops and conviction to engage this listener. I sold it after (too) many attempts to find some redeeming quality.

Instead the result is an overview of much of the information security topic area.It is a good book for non-security IT professionals and perhaps useful in an introductory course as a text, but inadequate for in-depth work in infrastructure design.At the same time, this book is far superior to Held & Hundley's Security Architectures whichs dwells on Cisco PIX and router configurations and fails to consider how those pieces fit into a larger IT and IS architecture."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unrealistic Drivel","review":"I question the security background of any of those who read this book and gave it a good review.

Growing up seems to bring problems Katie doesn't want to deal with. Katie starts starving herself on purpose and throwing up anytime she eats.

The biggest problem is that it was probably updated many years ago.

An other big problems is the pricing of the activities and transportation. England is an expensive country and you may want to be careful with your budget.

It felt unpolished.Was hoping for something a bit more epic or fantastic. The fights were also somewhat unpolished. Granted, I saw some things I hadn't seen before, but it just looked a bit rough / raw in terms of the actual film style and that turned me off from enjoying it. As the Amazon review also said, some of the fights and editing cuts are so frenetic it's hard to tell who's slaughtering who until it's over.In all, unless you're really a fan of the genre and don't mind what I'd call unpolished camera work, you might want to rent this before buying it.

Unfortunately this is NOT a remastered version of the film, it's the same version that's been on the market for years except it has bonus audio track for discussion of the film ,only they don't seem to be paying attention to the scenes that are happening as they discuss it. I have seen many remastered versions of Hong Kong classics and they look clear and clean, this is still the same blurry picture as all the previous releases and it's not even enhanced to fill wide scene TVs ,so it's right in the middle of your screen like a small rectangle surrounded by black borders.

Michelle Yeoh looks great and does a decent job but she just seems too wholesome to pull off the role of the somewhat evil kung fu master. She is not as intense as Brigitte Lin who is really the master of that sort of character. Tony Leung, Donnie Yen, and Joey Wang are all really great in this movie. This is highly recommended for HK fans but not so much for casual kung fu fans who are better off with something like Swordman II.

You get laid-back Willie playing the most laid-back music on earth. Some of the songs are reggae standards, and some are his own songs that he \\"reggaefied.\\" Willie fans will like this, but so will fans of reggae music, and those two are often considered mutually exclusive. Pick this CD up, it will lighten your day."},{"rating":"1","title":"Reggae with Steel Guitar didn't work for me","review":"I've always liked Willie Nelson, but I can't say I've ever been much on Reggae -- although I certainly appreciate Bob Marley. Nevertheless, I thought I'd give this a try, thanks to my public library where I was able to listen to it with no risk. I have to give this a \\"thumbs down.\\" Reggae with steel guitar doesn't work for me, and I could not get my head around this CD. Willie's vocals...well, I guess I'm so used to hearing him in his country mode that it just didn't sound right to me. I'm sure Willie had a good time recording it, but I'll stick to his solid country stuff. My suggestion to Willie Nelson fans: preview this before you buy it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Let sleeping dogs and terrible musical ideas lie.","review":"I wish there was a 0 Star rating.This Cd is bad on two levels.Bad Reggae and Bad Country.Should not have been disinterred."},{"rating":"1","title":"Love Willie, hate this","review":"The producer of this record does not kow reggae.

That's the auto-tune vocal tracking tool you have heard about. You use a pitch shifter to make non-musical singers get in key with the backing instruments. Clueless young act like Brittney Spears, Ashley Simpson and people like that get put through a pitch shifter. But not Willie!! You don't turn Willie Nelson into a Cylon, people!I have seen Willie live and he really does have amazing talent, he can really play and he can sing and carry a tune ... but you wouldn't know it from this slick over-produced mess.What a crying shame - anybody who put Willie Nelson's great voice through a freaking Pitch Shifter deserves to be shot ... I'm going to put this album up for sale and hope I don't hear these tracks again ... so sad!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it","review":"I bought a wireless Logitech keyboard/mouse combo and it was not worth it. It just gave me a lot of problems, so today I went and got this combo and it was easy to set up, the directions, were much better, it takes a while getting used to the angular keyboard but I like it a lot, and it works very well. I'm very happy with this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lame","review":"We have used Logitech cordless desktops for years and I tried a Microsoft combo because of a great deal. I have now tried two Micro$oft cordless keyboard/mouse systems and can attest: Buy a Logitech.The feel and construction of the hardware is [inexpensive]. Keys are loose and floppy. The mouse feels like Soviet plastic.The software is lame too. Stupidly simple things like battery condition are not available under mouse or keyborad properties. The last straw was using a simple combination of keyboard and mouse click (like shift + click) was not possible in Windows Explorer. Maddening!And don't look for support online. Microsoft is typically a frustrating experience to find support. It's actually worse!"},{"rating":"2","title":"More Freedom","review":"This wireless optical keyboard has been fantastic! Having one less wire to contend with and the freedom of positioning my keyboard without coming up short with cord length. The split keyboard positions my hands to help with my wrist injury, which was noticeable almost immediately. The hot keys and Media buttons are quick to respond and you can set up the keys to your own folders and media choice. If I were to have one complaint, it would be that the keys seem a little stiff, as I like the more softer key stroke. The wireless mouse, is not the best, but it does give you one less wire to mess with."},{"rating":"2","title":"nice, but has downsides","review":"I really like having a wireless keyboard. But, I wanted to note some annoying downsides:+ There is a delay after bootup, during which I cannot use the mouse or keyboard. So, it takes longer to log into windows.+ The F-lock key is really annoying because it's setting is not stored. Each time you reboot, your F1-F12 keys are pretty much useless until you hit F-lock. The MS defined meaning of the function keys without hitting F-lock are no good for someone who is used to the normal meaning of those keys.+ Non-standard home, end, pageup, pagedown etc, is also annoyingfor anyone who uses multiple keyboards. Ther is only one insert key.+ Post-boot delay also affects RH linux. It looks like lineak.sf.net supports this device, but I have not bothered with customizing the extra keys yet."},{"rating":"1","title":"Works-- -- sometimes..","review":"For three weeks it worked great.

Fabulous keyboard, great touch and layout, I can type all day on it. HATE the flaky wireless connection - When first starting up, I regularly have to fight to re-establish a decent wireless connection between the keyboard and receiver. It only picks up every other keystroke, sporadic reception... this is with the receiver sitting within 6\\" of the keyboard. Once a decent connection is established, it works great! Same problem with identical wireless sets on different machines.

Other times it would work perfectly.I wouldn't recommend this product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely fantastic keyboard and mouse","review":"In my estimation, this is one of the best keyboards I have ever used. The ergonomic shape took a little getting used to, but it's much more comfortable than the conventional keyboard layout. The software set up with no problem, but as noted by other reviewers below, you do have to install the software first, and reboot, which is seemless. Unlike other wireless keyboards that used infrared sensors, I was able to use the keyboard and mouse from anywhere on my desk and did not have to point either toward the direction of the receiver.The absolute best part of this keyboard is its short cut keys. They're conveniently labeled and are particularly useful; I really love the one for \\"close\\" (F6), which I now shoot for everytime one of those annoying pop up online ads start to open. There are others too many to mention, but rest assured, I highly recommend this keyboard for all of its features. It's well worth the price."},{"rating":"2","title":"one correction, however","review":"if you are held back by the claimed range of \\"6 feet\\", worry not.

I needed a new one and found a deal on this version (it was cheaper than a new Natural Pro, I guess because it's not USB), but was glad that I tried it out in a store first. They've completely change the feel of the keys; they're soft and spongy, rather than crisp like the previous models (Natural Pro and Natural Elite). Some people might prefer this, but I definitely didn't and am going to stick with a Natural Pro."},{"rating":"1","title":"blatant disrespect for previous MS natural keyboard users","review":"First of all this keyboard is not bad in itself, the key action is alright. HOWEVER there are two things about this keyboard that have caused me to lose some productivity when using this keyboard: 1. MS decided to change the layout of the home/delete/end/pgup/pgdwn/insert key group AGAIN! 2. MS decided to delete the right windows key. I had used a windows natural keyboard before this and had just begun to get used to the alternative key-layout. Now they have changed it AGAIN!... If this would be your first MS natural keyboard it's probably alright for you but I feel MS is unreliable when it comes to adhering to one layout. MS does not seem to care that it's customers lose productivity when they have to use a keyboard with a different layout (especially when you're a touch typist like me)... My next KB is not going to be a MS as I don't trust them to keep the layout the same."},{"rating":"2","title":"Natural Microsoft Keyboard","review":"With the software,the keyboard is easy to install and edit. The 10 extra keys can be edited so they can be used for your home page website or other favorite websites, or you can make them a quick source to your documents, pictures, music etc. Although I learned to type many years ago on a regular keyboard typwriter, I found it very easy to feel comfortable on the natural keyboard. I believe my wrists are more rested after typing for a time. The price is right. I would buy it again. It also goes well with the Microsoft, wireless optical mouse, which I recommend."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Impressed","review":"Three of the six welds holding the handle to the lid popped loose the first time I heated this pot up. The gauge is not as thick as I was hoping for and the bottom stained terribly the first time I used this pot. My Martha Stewart stock pot from K-Mart was much better quality than this thing.

I have yet to use it, as I'm still waiting for the rest of my kit to arrive, but based on initial feel and appearance I think it will serve me just fine.

Almost forgot, the price was right."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good, but not great.","review":"I bought this as an alternative for a black ceramic crab pot steamer thinking the stainless would hold up better that the ceramic coated metal pot. I've gotten about 5 yrs use from those before a hole begins. Anyway, I've only used the new stainless pot 3 times and I've noticed it gets much hotter, much quicker which makes you have to increase your liquid capacity so it doesn't all boil away. Not too big of a deal. Also the crabs have a much easier time grasping and climbing the perforated basket than the smooth surface of the aforementioned ceramic pot which makes for some interesting escapes. Nonetheless, I hope to get more yrs of use from this pot and if it holds true, then I can adjust to the quirks for my specific application."},{"rating":"1","title":"China made JUNK --- many problems!","review":"1) Had I known it was made in China --- I would have never spend this ridiculous high price!2) The pot arrived REPAIRED --- not dented (since packaging was excellent), but with a flattened lip on one side (about 1\\" of the lip) that showed heating marks and sanding scratches trying to get it somewhat straight (also due to the sanding, rust was showing)!3) The handles are NOT riveted (as stated and pictured), but welded!4) The bottom is THIN --- you can poke it with your finger and it will move in-and-out!4) The basket was also repaired, and it can only fit inside the pot by hitting it with your fist (taking it out when hot is dangerous, since force is needed to disengage from the pot, and hot liquid sprays on you)!5) The lid has a tiny ding on the inside --- a pinprick --- and it had already started to rust even before adding any water!In conclusion --- what I got is China Made Garbage (how others award it so many stars remains a mystery)!"},{"rating":"1","title":"product quality","review":"this product could be dangerous the basket does not fit right it hangs up could turn over if your not careful China made same story"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great pot!","review":"I am an amateur chef who enjoys good quality \\"tools\\" in my kitchen. I bought this expecting it would be a good heavy pot with quality components that would stand up well being used on top of a side burner on a grill. The fact it is designed to sit 6 inches above the water is a real plus - no soggy, water-logged end product. Wife doesn't allow cooking of smelly seafood (in its first use, lobster!) in the house. It delivered 5 stars on all counts. Gave it as a gift to my son, and he was very pleased with both the pot and the lobster he got for his birthday. Now, I wan that pot back, probably won't get it.

It never ran dry and we kept the heat down, it is just paper-thin."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Value - Would Recommend","review":"I purchased this pot for the purpose of home brewing. I needed a stainless steel pot with a lid. I brewed my first batch of beer with this pot several days ago and had no difficulties. The handles held up to the 5+ gallons of liquid I used in the brewing process, and I was happy to find that they stayed cool to the touch throughout the process, allowing me to handle the pot even after the liquid had been boiling for an hour or more.Four stars (rather than five) for this pot only because the steel does not feel as thick as I might have liked, but I don't foresee any potential problems with that.

L is really the star of the show, and its his charm and quirks that make it fun. However, in all honesty, this series tanks in the 2nd half.

How could anyone, no matter how skeptical, not be impressed by what Dr. Lynne has accomplished in this wonderfully written book. Her dedication to detail, including never before seen personal photographs of the anomalous lights, the spiritual messages that permeate the book, and her ultimate wake-up call for humanity, that the reviewer obviously missed, make this a must read.

What it should say is, \\"We may not be alone.\\" After painfully trudging through a rehash of things most of us that have followed this story already know, Dr. Lynne puts us to sleep with all of her personal 'revelations.' You know you're in trouble when the vast majority of her 'discoveries' end with a question mark. These are not hard facts, but simply an author posing questions to her readers as well as to herself. She is missing the mark. Dr. Lynne may feel exhilarated, but quite frankly I'm left quite disappointed ."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of Time","review":"This book is a waste of time.

Neither of them satisfactorily document this series of UFO sightings with sufficient detail or descriptive rigor. However, Mr. Hamilton's The Phoenix Lights Mystery is the superior effort and the only one worth reading.I say this without any animosity towards Lynne Kitei.

She and other ranch kids embark on a journey to find \\"the wild stallion\\" to see if it's a real horse or just a legend that everyone is talking about. It's a movie worth watching and maybe even passing on to friends to watch with their families as well. Enjoy! :O)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"I watched this with my daughter and she got bored with it pretty quickly. Maybe good for a horse lover but that's about it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cute Story","review":"Cute story about the city slicker (Miranda Cosgrove), the country girl, & a few friends trying to protect & save the local wild horses (namely the local legend: an unseen black stallion said to be an escaped race horse gone wild), & the 2 girls become friends while doing it. When herds start to go missing its up to them to figure out just what is going on. It has its funny moments & has a good simple storyline. Being a wild horse advocate I will point out that some of the facts do not match up with the real stuff concerning the american mustang today, but overall its a great concept. Horse crazy kids would probably like it since it seems more like a kiddy movie, but adults will probably enjoy it to."},{"rating":"2","title":"Picture is Not Justice","review":"I bought this ring as a present for myself.

I knew instantly that I would be returning the item. I ended up with a loss of $10. on a $37. item; I had to pay the return shipping and a re-stocking fee. I will not be ordering anything from Amazon in the near future unless I have seen the item first-hand before ordering. The re-stocking fee I felt was unfair."},{"rating":"1","title":"It is NOT silent","review":"Specifically searched for a clock that is SILENT. This one ticks - despite the claim that it is silent. AND it cost me the $10 restocking fee to find that out. Seems a case of false advertising to me. If you are a sensitive sleeper and are looking for a non-ticking clock - do not buy this clock. It is a mild tick, but a tick nonetheless. Nothing else about this clock was redeeming enough to keep it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Replacement Alarm Clock","review":"My last bedside alarm clock was a Seiko and approximately 30 years.

As it must be usual with King's books, the ending is flat, illogical, and worst of all, it leaves the main points (two murders, namely) completely unexplained. I also found it hard to accept that anyone could seriously believe in alchemy in the 20th century, much less make it the very center of a whole movement. The author promises to reveal the inner working of a religious cult or sect, but in the end, I think she fails in it. However, the superb writing style, and the description of the interesting personalities and the complex relationships of the characters (King's strong sides, no doubt) make it worth to read.

I loved the first blue crush, and knew that this was not a sequel by any means, but I was severely disappointed with it. The acting was horrible, the script was poorly written, the editing was choppy, and there are even a couple scenes where you could tell they were in front of a green screen. Pretty sure the budget on this movie was 2 cokes and a candy bar.

How did they get to pretend this was a sequel to Blue Crush?","review":"This movie has absolutely NOTHING in common with the original \\"Blue Crush\\" movie (which I liked a lot). Different actors, different characters, schlock storyline, and ugly waters (or at least the cinematography makes them look ugly). And you know, I had kind of expected a sequel - like what was going on with at least one of the girls from the original movie. But nope, nothing.The surfing is fair - mediocre, kind of faked out (\\"you just caught the barrel of the day!\\" Barrel? What barrel? That was a montage, not a freaking barrel. How many takes did it take?). The whole thing is just kind of surf soft-porn, which really made me mad because \\"Blue Crush\\" was so darn good and \\"Blue Crush 2\\" just sort of fed off its title but sucked. I mean Hawai'i compared to South Africa? Don't even make me laugh. Don't waste your money. I recommend \\"Soul Surfer\\" instead for a good girl surf fix with an inspiring storyline.Ugh, just ugh."},{"rating":"2","title":"Blue Crush","review":"A wonderful movie.

It was far too friendly of a movie, they made it with children in mind, and not the real fans.

First off, I didn't think anything was wrong with the apes arriving the way they did.I assumed they used the second space craft as opposed to the first.The movie came out in the early 70s, only a decade after Spider-man and the Hulk were given origins from radiation.Otherwise, it is a brilliant juxtaposition to the first Planet of the Apes.

I had already tried downloading the newest driver from their site, but that didn't help unless you also skipped their installer and did some manual override. The drive that came on the CD with the unit didn't work at all (even though it had a specific section for Vista 64 bit).

What a rare treat to be able to watch him rehearse and to see other videos I had heard about but had never seen. A great collection. Watching Michael sing is even better than just listening to him."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very interesting but gets long","review":"Michael's voice, as always, is astonishing. That's the good news. The bad news begins with the first number, \\"When you Wish Upon a Star.\\" The song begins with a bunch of children crowding around a homeless man, who magically is transformed into an 18th century ringmaster (i.e., Crawford appears in his \\"Barnum\\" garb), while the street kids turn into circus acts. It gets better from there, going to more conventional scenes in theatres or recording sessions, but they do begin to run together after a while, and for those that know Michael, it's pretty much what you've seen on the In Concert TV special.

It seemed like if she is suppose to make important desitions for an entire kingdom she should be smarter and have some common sence. Turning herself over to someone who already tricked and lied to her once and tried to kill his own brother. Then seeing and hearing how evil he is and still thinking that he will keep his word or do anything helpful, sorry but,STUPID.

As it was, the few scenes taking place about this New Age stuff was hardly worth mentionning!

The point that Mr. Davis made that was absolutley accurate, when he made reference to a \\"CULT LIKE\\" mentality. This is fact!

He says he's sad he has to write such negative things about the airline. It doesn't seem like it. He seems to enjoy taking every slap he can.The problem is some of the logic is rather contorted.

We have another headphone that my husband uses (we're both a little hard of hearing so we both use headphones all the time) and his are fine, no radio interference. With the new headphones the radio is LOUDER. A lot louder. Since I bought it on Amazon I packed it back up and thought, oh well, I'll have to return it.

I used the microphone in front of the TV speaker as instructed. Two problems. I had to turn the TV up, or the volume was too low, even at maximum on the head set. But the needed volume on the TV was too loud and bothered my family in their bedrooms! Second, I could not get good reception unless I was exactly directly in front of the transmitter--not 6 inches this way--not six inches the other way! And if I turned down the TV volume to a level acceptable to my family, the backround noise was extremely annoying.

Not only that, but if you move the slightest bid it starts getting staticky and annoying. Even when you find the perfect spot, if the volume isn't up high enough to drown out the static then you will hear the annoying, vibrating static. It's a difficult sound to describe but \\"annoying\\" pretty much covers it.I don't recommend this system. If your TV has a headphone jack, I recommend you just get a 25' extender cord for $10 and plug in a set of good headphones.

I can hardly wait for my husband to go to sleep (I use them in the bedroom) so I can put them on."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buy different wireless headphones","review":"Here's the scoop on this product: It only works up to about 8 feet and the line between the headphones and the base has to be a STRAIGHT line on the SAME PLANE. So, for example, I wanted to use this while I was on the treadmill. I had to jimmy up the base onto the top of a corkboard (don't ask) so that it would be in direct line with the height of the headphones when I was on the treadmill. It would not work if the base was even an inch above or below the height of the headphones. I only bought infrared because my modem has had problems with interference from 900mHz phones and I didn't want to take the chance with the headphones. But there has GOT to be better infrared products out there than this. If you can achieve a straight line between the base and headphones (with nothing in between the phone and base), than, yes, the sound is fine."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Item--If It Were Dependable","review":"My husband thoughtfully purchased the Unisar Sounds TV Listener for my birthday. I enjoy exercising early in the morning, and now I can watch TV/DVDs without disturbing the rest of the family. The headphones are comfortable, easy to use, but unfortunately worked well for only a week. The left speaker works about half the time and either hisses or goes silent when not receiving the proper sound signal. I'd return them for another pair, if I still had the box and return label. It's a great concept, and I know I'd enjoy this product if it were dependable. So my advice to others who may purchase this item--keep the box and return label."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unisar sounds terrible","review":"When I first started using the TV listener, it worked reasonably well but did have a pronounced swishing sound in the background. After a few weeks, however, I could hear more static than sound. I have tested the cable connections to make sure they were tight, have fiddled with the relative volume adjustments on the headsets and TV, and tried repositioning the transmitter. All without much success. I still use it in a pinch, but only when necessary. Perhaps the batteries, which are almost brand new, need replacing. Overall, I am not happy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Product - my mom loves it","review":"My mom, 93 years old, already called me twice long distance to tell me how much she loved the BeBe Sounds TV Listener.

For example, \\"one, two, buckle my shoe\\" ends at ten. Third, \\"ring around the rosy\\" is right in the middle of the book. No matter how tired my daughter is, she's always up for another round of \\"ring around the rosy\\" - making this a tough book to use at bedtime.

I don't have any particular fondness for it, most of the nursery rhymes are outdated, quaint, often sexist, and grim. But this edition surprised me with the editorial decision to African-Americanize a handful of the children in the drawings, ostensibly to make it more \\"inclusive\\" at the risk of completely revising history. A small black boy in Victorian dress dances with a small white girl and her grandmother (?) to ring around the rosies, which, of course, is about dying of the Plague. You may draw your own conclusions about this, clearly we're complex terrain trying to teach 21st century children to be color-blind while teaching them rhymes that are centuries old and from a time of complete social stratification.

They haven't done so and appear unwilling to correct it. They blame Amazon for the erroneous listing, but seller is ultimately the one who decides which Amazon listing to link to. I filed an A-Z guarantee claim with Amazon to try to get Shopxtreme to remove their listing under this page, but Amazon just refunded my purchase instead of getting Shopxtreme to correct the link.I bought the Lenmar brand subsequently from Amazon and am happy with that brand's quality, so my complaint is with Shopxtreme only, for misleading potential buyers by listing it under this page which clearly says Lenmar brand by Lenmar."},{"rating":"2","title":"Top Notch without the Top End Price","review":"Not much needs be said.

Throughout \\"The Losers\\" it appears that David Eddings is continually looking for places to insert his own personal philosophy on the social system. The title refers to those who begin to greedily rely on social handouts, giving up all hope and ambition for their lives--simply living for the next welfare check. The description makes it sound like there would be a supernatural/fantastical element to the story, but there is none whatsoever. I'm not surprised they tried to cover up the real plot though, because I doubt there is much of a market for fiction about social welfare.Go read something else unless you need to know what David Eddings thinks about the social welfare system...."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Loser","review":"As if the inherent fascism bubbling uncomfortably beneath the surface of Eddings' sword and sorcery efforts wasn't repulsive enough, the author has now brought his right-wing fanatacism into the 'real' world with the Losers.What is barely forgivable in the realm of fantasy becomes utterly repugnant in this allergorical tale of contemporary waste and redemption. Eddings' championing of individualism over the folly of the welfare state is nothing but a dull reflection of the writer's personal philosophy. The public should expect more than that from people calling themselves professional writers.Any bite this work does possess is eradicated by an ending that displaces plot and characters from the true to life impulses in which they are supposed to be grounded.David, go back to creating your own worlds where the rules are simple, the good guys never lose, and the complicated issues of real life never arise."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful..not worth the money","review":"The book starts with such promise only to be let down by such a narrow personal view that the author has of the system without enough info to prove his point.....very heavy handed!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The truth of reality...","review":"This book, which none will dispute, to be outside of Eddings's usual endeavors is a hit nonetheless. Set in today's society it shows us the grim reality of the social support program and the curse of the \\"women who don't know how to type\\"(not meant as a sexist remark). With some lacings of satire where appropriate and drenched in the harsh reality that many are forced to live with. It provides a wakeup call to main stream society about the problems beyond the begger on the street or the coupon guy at the grocery digging in the basket of dented cans and expired goods.

I had no complaints until this morning discovered that it would not power on at all. No lights, nothing. Bummer! I've used this for right at 1-1/2 weeks before it died. I don't recommend it but I gave it 2 stars instead of one because I liked it while it worked as it was easy to operate, did (past tense) what it supposed to, and looks fairly nice.

There was next to nothing on the internet about the manufacturer. Reviews were mixed, but pretty much the same as for grinders costing $100+. Styling and features were nice, so I took the chance.Four months later, I have to say that it's been a pleasant surprise. The grinder performs admirably. I use it practically on daily basis, and I haven't had a single issue. The bean hopper is more than adequately sized. The selection of coarseness is intuitive and convenient--just turn the hopper. There is also a nice safety feature, which prevents operation if the collector is not properly inserted.I would highly recommend the Lello Ariete to anyone who wants to grind their coffee beans at home.

There were more grounds scattered all over my counter than in the little cup holder. Then after awhile, I had to take a butter knife and clean out the little hole where the grounds came out because it became clogged and stopped running.

It does tend to grind a little less than the amount of cups you set it at when the hopper is running low on beans, but that's nort uncommon with gravity fed hoppers.

However; this grinder has been more trouble than any I have had before. We have to take it apart often to unclog the shoots...

I didn't want to spend a lot more money, but only burr grinders grind small enough for espresso. I was happy to find this as a financially feasable option, and it works great! It is kinda loud, but all grinders are. The only problem I've ever had with it was because it needed to be cleaned out, and it even comes with the little cleaner brush! It's even got safeguards to is turns off when the basket is removed, to prevent accidents or HUGE messes.

It was returned immediately.I am still looking for a decent conical burr grinder."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great grinder!","review":"The grinder works great.

The bowl broke within 2 months, and despite repeated attempts to contact the vendor, we never received any response from them. Contact was attempted by email and phone, and while we left messages with the vendor, there was no response. I would not recommend either the product nor the vendor. They rate a VERY POOR for service and while the product worked properly for a short while, I cannot recommend it due to what I believe is poor design.

With the finest possible setting it still gives a lot of coerce particles, I mean really big crunches good for coffee press at best case only. Removing been pot, cleaning burr and reinstalling it again does not help. So basically it does not do what it was bought for.Good points are:- it's beautiful, really not so big as you see it on pictures, elegant and stylish- it's not so loud especially when you consider it's speed - 5 seconds of noise doesn't make difference for most of usMight be I've got defected item, but overall impression is spoiled."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stand By!","review":"I am currently in the market for a new grinder. I purchased this one, after much research. I thought I was getting a good product, but I am not at all happy with it. I've had it for about 4 years, but it hasn't worked right for most of that time. You have to stand with it, holding the dispense cup tightly to the machine, so that it operates. The bottom of the dispense cup came apart a while ago, so I had to tape it back together. I would never recommend this piece to anyone. I paid $90 for it, through Amazon, and now look how cheaply they're selling it! I shouldn't have had to stand next to the machine, holding the catch compartment tightly to the machine. Ridiculous!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I owned a Braun grinder for 10 years and decided to replace it. After reading all the reviews extensively, which contained some conflicting information, I selected this Lello Ariete model. Unfortunately most of the negative comments turned out to be correct. My belief now is that $40-50 is simply too little to pay for a grinder and expect great quality and functionality.Specifically the problems were:- Product is indeed very LOUD much to my family's chagrin each morning. Similar to a gas lawn mower in volume...probably 100-110 decibels.- The unit died after one month. Bad connection in the plug.- There is significant static electricity in the hopper.- The hopper is odd shaped and hard to clean.- A nonsensical set of buttons & lights that control how much to grind.I just purchased the Capresso 560.01 Infinity Burr Grinder to hopefully reach a better tier in grinders.

At least once a week, the pathway from the grinder into the jar the ground coffee empties into gets jammed with grounds and has to be cleared with solid pointy implement. This became moot after 4 months of otherwise smooth ownership when the hopper sheared off of the threads that hold it into the machine, rendering it useless. It appears that I can't return this unit to amazon at this time (order was placed in october, now its january), not sure if its worth dealing with an overseas return. As noted in previous reviews, this grinder was real loud. I guess that's a minor addition now that it's totally broken."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good and loud","review":"So far I like this machine. It grinds well and fairly consistently. It is, however by far the noisiest contraption in the house. It sounds more like it's grinding rocks than coffee.

This actually may be the problem for those who mentioned it broke after several uses -- it may have just needed cleaning.Con 2: The basket is just a tad too wide for smaller hands to be able to pull it off the machine very easily. Maybe some type of notch to pull it out would work better?Caveat 1: The hopper tends to spray the grounds out, rather than downward, so they hit the lid of the basket. When the lid is removed, the grounds spill out. Spillage seems to be a common issue in grinders, though.Caveat 2: The brittle plastic pieces don't seem to be replaceable.Overall, not a great value for the price point, considering its relatively short lifespan."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Second Official Reissue Of This British Psych Gem!","review":"Japanese mini-LP import CD on Airmail. This is excellent, classic UK psychedelia reissued with excellent packaging, however the sound quality is only mediocre and sounds like it was dubbed from a vinyl copy of the album and sounds compressed from filtering. Sounds very similar to the first official CD reissue on the UK Aftermath label. This is NOT remastered from the original analog tapes, which I am disappointed as import Japanese reissues usually have exceptional sound quality. The included lyrics on all these Japanese imports are misinterpreted so much it's asinine and moronic. Please do us a favor and leave the lyrics out.

I love the atomic timekeeping, the fact that my watch automatically updates itself when the time changes.

Assuming completely efficient nutrient utilization, that's an EXTRA 4500 calories per day ingested!). Anecdotes are stories about the individual and in no way can be extrapolated to others - professionally competitive bodybuilders are NOT like those of us interested in strength training as part of a healthy lifestyle. Given Dr Darden's history of promoting a more rational, graded approach to strenght training over the past ten years, then his abrupt transition back to this method, it suggests that he has much less actual data and much more need for remuneration as a motive for writing this book.Do yourself a favor and leave this one on the shelf."},{"rating":"1","title":"NEW ???","review":"OVER THE YEARS I HAVE READ MOST OF MR.

It contains lots of boring 'filler' where you sense he was padding out what should have been a short story into novel length. And the writing is painfully pedestrian. This could be the fault of the translator, but there's no excuse for overuse of the word 'incredible.' Even the writing of the main character, Sumire, who is supposedly a brilliant writer, is indistinguishable in style and tone from that of the narrator, who is Murakami's usual 'regular guy.' The 2001 copyright date is surprisingly recent. This work feels like juvenilia. I give it 2 stars instead of one because there are occasional flashes of the Murakami I love. But if you're new to this author, don't start with Sputnik Sweetheart."},{"rating":"2","title":"just read it, a lovely friendship story,","review":"a cute love story, &#305; enjoy it a lot, \\"sputnik\\" means a friend for a journeyThat's when the stories come apart to reveal each other in a suspenseful, hypnotic, Russian-doll kind of way. There are echoes of John Fowles's The Magus as the reasonable, likeable young narrator finds himself in a beautiful yet sinister place, wading deeper into mysterious waters, each new set of circumstances stranger and more seductive than the last. Some of the dark, mesmerising plot teases of Paul Auster or Ian McEwan also spring to mind.

How much of Murakami do we really \\"get?\\" This thought was running through my head while I read \\"Sputnik Sweetheart,\\" a very simple and straight forward novel. A novel with little for me in which to sink my teeth. Which is not to say that SS was not mildly diverting and nicely written or re-written by Phillip Gabriel.

There are some nice moments in the book, but it seems as if the writer was short on plot lines and never really finished it, and didn't bother to connect a lot of the narrative to the plot.He seemed to set up a lot of metaphor and other nice images but never used them to their fullest.It was meant to be a melancholy love story + a mystery, but it ended up being a complete waste of time and ink."},{"rating":"1","title":"So, so bad","review":"Ignore the alluring cover; this book is like reading paint dry. Don't say I didn't warn you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Review","review":"I just finished Sputnik Sweetheart. And I loved it. So I went on Amazon to read reviews, to see if other people agreed with me. I guess not. Many people complained how the book lacked depth; one reviewer even said it was poolside reading. These remarks took me by surprise, as the book reached out to me on many levels. It gave me something to think about.One idea in this book is that we are all broken vessels, and we want others to complete us. But perhaps that's too much to ask. After all, everyone is looking for something different, and many of us aren't even looking. So we all continue to be broken, to live each day isolated and unfulfilled. Is this life as we know and understand it? At times. I highly recommend this book if you want something to mull over. The plot and ideas are not straightforward, but the emotional impact is there. You don't have to look hard; just let the book guide you. Murakami will remind you of what you already know, beautifully and introspectively."},{"rating":"2","title":"This very modern love story slips effortlessly, fantastically into a Japanese ghost story","review":"What a wonderful, fresh, spare yet rich book. It starts out like a very modern love story, with self-absorbed characters yearning to make connection with the other who is unknown and disengaged, more an outward semblance of a companion than a person in an actual relationship. Then, believably yet fantastically, it slips into a Japanese ghost story reminiscent of Henry James in its mixing of the mysterious with the all-too-real yet unknowable unconscious. I picked this book up serendipitously, as one of the few English-language books in a Seville bookstore that might arguably qualify as readable, and I found a treasure."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of Murakami's lighter reads","review":"Definitely not as much emotional as Norwegian Wood and not as intense as Wind-Up Bird Chronicle, but nevertheless, still a worthwhile read. It possesses the classic Murakami's dream-like touch (although not as strong as his more popular books) which keeps the story engaging and page-turning. I think, as long you are a reader who likes his style of writing (his way of thinking), then you will love the book. It is also an extremely quick read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lonely but Lucky","review":"This is not a sappy tale about unrequited love. Instead, Murakami casts a positive light on a frustrating friendship and an ethereal connection that are very real. His characters endure uncontrollable forces that drive eerie encounters and realizations. And the reader grasps that a feeling or memory of love, however fulfilled or unfulfilled, remains a source of motivation."},{"rating":"2","title":"So far, so good.","review":"I bought two 64MB XD picture cards, thinking I'd have one for backup if anything went wrong with one of them.

If you ever upgrade to a better camera or another device that uses memory cards (MP3 players, or SLR camera, etc) then you'll lose your investment in these XD cards. Also, since they are proprietary and non standard they cost more per megabyte. I would never purchase a camera that uses non standard proprietary cards (like Sony, which uses their own \\"memory sticks\\" or Fuji and the XD cards). But if you already bought a camera which requires them, then you really have no choice. Standards are important with new technology (remember betamax vs. VHS) so that early adopters don't have equipment that becomes obsolete, or unduly pricey due to lack of competition.If you have a choice, try to buy devices that use CF (compact flash) and protect your investment.

The biggest complaint I have is that, for some reason, the author feels compelled to reveal the entire legislative history for every statute or immigration guideline. So if you are studying INA 237(x)(x)(x) you will not only get the very recent changes that led up to the statute, but the last 30 years of history. For true scholars of the law who have nothing better to do with their lives than read irrelevant legislative history I am sure this will please them. For actual law students who think succinctness is a virtue, stay away. Another minor problem is that the author has failed to label his notes. Labeling notes is a very common practice and is very helpful in summarizing what the note is about without having to first read it. Of course, I find the very subject of immigration law to be about as boring a class in law school as I have ever taken so maybe this casebook is just making the best out of a bad situation."},{"rating":"2","title":"I'm Buying It Again!","review":"I LOVE this CD!

Even with the songs for which Armstrong was most famous such as \\"Blueberry Hill\\" and \\"Mack the Knife\\" there are far better recordings available elsewhere.

It's one of my favorites.The stuff that came out of the can is very dark orange-colored which is not typical for lobster bisque, devoid of any flavor, and just plain gross. It could not be eaten out of the can because of the dreadful flavor. There is no cream in this soup and any bisque is heavy with cream. There's milk, wheat flour, and teeny dots of lobster. I'm a good cook but I doubt that I can doctor this up to taste like anything worth eating.When I read the other negative reviews, I thought...oh well. Folks from other parts of the country don't know what real lobster bisque tastes like, but surely Bar Harbor is doing it right. WRONG. As a New Englander, I know what good lobster bisque tastes like and it's not this.Unless you enjoy mystery food and dislike lobster, I'd advise against purchasing this."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's NOT good","review":"The reviewer Jo Ana Starr is right, this canned \\"lobster bisque\\" is plain gross.

We opened up one can up today and four of us tried it. It tasted horrible!! It was brown and tasted like bad fish. No lie. All of us were repulsed.

We will certainly not buy this brand again."},{"rating":"1","title":"worst lobster bisque","review":"I thought it was the worst lobster bisque I have ever had. No flavor.

This was given as a Christmas gift to a family member. In particular, the lighting was somewhat dark, unlike that of the 'Right on Time' DVD. The explanation from MCG Records was that the producer of this particular DVD used a different production technique, presumably to create a theatrical impression with the darker lighting. Also, Lee Williams did not sing a majority of the songs on this production. Lee Williams is the 'draw' for this act, and this aspect of the production was a huge disappointment. As such, if you are looking for vintage Lee Williams on this production, you may be in for a disappointment, unless of course your point of interest is the Spiritual Q C's."},{"rating":"2","title":"Low Tech.....Excellent Accessory.","review":"Very low tech finder that gives excellent results with minimal effort.

Well worth the minimal cost."},{"rating":"2","title":"A flawless mesh of old and new","review":"Credit David Chesky with putting out--at least occasionally--some really intriguing music. This work consists of several tracks played by three Chinese musicians with traditional instruments, and an American synthesist. The choice of material is flawless--a perfect mix of ancient songs and new compositions. The playing is great, creating moods of beauty and serenity. While there are quite a few CDs available in the worldbeat category, none that I know of does what this album does, which is to envelope the listener in a deep feeling of Chinese life. You may not be in China, but you definitely understand what it may be like, at least sensually.Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Nice Blend of Acoustic and Electronic Sounds","review":"I Ching comprises four members: three Chinese musicians (Sisi Chen on Chinese dulcimer, Tao Chen on bamboo flute, and Bao Li Zhang on er-hu, a two-stringed Chinese fiddle) and Joel Goodman on synthesizer and sampler. The tunes pretty well alternate between oriental folk tunes arranged by Goodman and original compositions by Goodman--in light of his omnipresence on the CD, it is strange that he is the only one of the four musicians not pictured on the back cover. The blend of acoustic instruments with synthesized sounds works quite well, and the music is quite enjoyable, with more substance than the typical New Age recording. As you might expect from Chesky, the sound quality is first-class, although I did not find the claim, \\"recorded in natural surround sound\\" to be fully substantiated in my system."},{"rating":"2","title":"Asian music that is modern","review":"This is Asian music that has a very modern feel to it. It is very enjoyable and pleasant and makes great background music for a night of reading or spending time with a friend.I think this would be a great introduction for people who may not have listened seriously to Asian music before.

However, after a few tracks I was blown away.The pace of the tunes is fast and they are, with few exceptions, upbeat. In all my years listening to music I do believe that this is the first album I've ever heard that features bagpipes, electric guitars, flutes, and banjo all set to a techno beat.I'm not sure if Mark Saul is insane or a genius that is waiting to be recognized, but the album does work."},{"rating":"1","title":"great scent with a difficult-to-open bottle","review":"I love the Be Delicious scent, but the difficult-to-open bottles make this an impractical purchase.

Hopefully I can pawn this off on my one of my friends who can tolerate the taste and I'll go back to the delicious 2:1:1 shake."},{"rating":"1","title":"sweetened with splenda :( . . . but you get results :)","review":"So i've tried different post workouts and haven't really found one that is great tasting, and honestly i dont think that exist. So by now, i am pretty much use to drinking some nasty tasting shakes (or supplements over all). I've become pretty tolerant to taste. BUT, this is just nasty tasting. Even for me. Right off the back, it taste very artificial and very dry. And after it got me nauseous and a headache. Which is typical when consuming artificial sweeteners like Splenda.Now the taste is bad enough but, after a week or so i kind of got used it (added more water, a lot more water). but the Slenda effect, i just can't get rid of. Its sad because i was actually seeing nice results. I saw in other websites that this product contains no artificial flavoring, which is weird. maybe they changed their recipe?

I put it in a shaker & even tried adding more water to dilute, but it didn't help. I did add milk also thinking it would help with the taste but NG.

I would prefer about 15 grams more carbs per serving, but that's fine. I just eat a fruit with it.My beef is with the service at Amazon. I originally thought I would use it after every workout, and so I asked to have them send another bucket every two months, but now I am working out less intensely so I don't need it every day, and I'm not using it fast enough to keep up with what they're sending. Two months ago I received one when I still had a full bucket, so I wrote and asked to cancel recurring orders. I thought everything was gravy until I saw a charge on my card for After Max last week. Sure enough, they had already sent it and it was too late to cancel. Now I can't figure out how to get hold of anybody.

I'm really impressive that I can have a full meat after 1 hour of the shake.-It taste pretty good(strong chocolate), however, it has some wheat taste and sour after-taste.

There is nothing here that's worth spending a nickel on, especially for fans who already have \\"24 Nights\\" or \\"Unplugged\\".Polygram did a far nicer job - and their's was nothing terrific, mind you - with their \\"Cream Of Clapton\\" that at least showed some aspect of the history of this performer.

Every student of sociology, cultural history and social anthropology should read this book - not to have their \\"eves opened\\" on Christianity and \\"Vodou\\" but to see how cultural changes influence peoples perception and how easily people demonize their culture for promises of a better life \\"with God\\".

For perspective, I wasn't extra careful about avoiding extra heat, but I wasn't careless either. I never dishwashed it. Occasionally I left it sitting in pans (never for more than ~5 minutes, and never on high heat). Otherwise, the spatula is slightly flexible, but rigid and large enough to hold reasonable amounts of food. The handle doesn't get hot during normal use, nor does it melt on contact with the edge of pans. I never had any trouble getting the edge under anything (though I didn't try more delicate foods like fried eggs).

Make sure you check that before buying a xD-card."},{"rating":"1","title":"expensive propreitary card","review":"Fuji and Olympus have found a new way to make money and rip off innocent consumers. A new card format called xD card. A cool way to ensure royalties and extra cash.If you have already bought a xD card based camera, you are left with no choice, right ? So go ahead and buy this card, it works fine with Fuji cameras.BTW, if you haven't bought your camera till now think twice before getting a Fuji. The xD card costs 2.5 times the cost of simlar sized CF card as of this writing. And xD cards are useless outside of Fuji/Olympus cameras. Compare that to the versatality of CF cards at much lower price.Oh... and Fuji can't seem to manufacture enough quantity if these as of now, out of stock at most places ! Very bad Fuji, switch to CF/SD or watch you camera sales plummet. Today's consumer isn't a fool, he can read reviews on Amazon before buying stuff."},{"rating":"1","title":"NON Standard","review":"Although the card itself is not bad technology, it is NOT the standard (which is compact flash, CF). If you ever upgrade to a better camera or another device that uses memory cards (MP3 players, or SLR camera, etc) then you'll lose your investment in these XD cards. Also, since they are proprietary and non standard they cost more per megabyte. I would never purchase a camera that uses non standard proprietary cards (like Sony, which uses their own \\"memory sticks\\" or Fuji and the XD cards). But if you already bought a camera which requires them, then you really have no choice. Standards are important with new technology (remember betamax vs. VHS) so that early adopters don't have equipment that becomes obsolete, or unduly pricey due to lack of competition.If you have a choice, try to buy devices that use CF (compact flash) and protect your investment. Just my two cents."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent.","review":"Another reason why there is such passion from those who bought their cameras earlier and are upset that new cameras have better memory cards (such as this new XD card): They're afraid that their old cards will eventually be phased out. I am not sure if that is a valid concern, but why take the risk? If you're choosing a new camera, choose one that is cutting edge now, and have the security of knowing that it will serve you well for several years longer than the rest.The cards not only record faster, they erase faster too - an important consideration for a large capacity card such as this 128 MB one.Don't be stuck in the past."},{"rating":"2","title":"does its job","review":"A fine, uneventful product, fits where it's supposed to and operates without glitches.

Democrats are universally portrayed as virtuous and well-meaning. Conversely, all Republicans/conservatives are shown to be mean-spirited and their policies are donation driven and designed to hurt the \\"average\\" American.

I rarely stop watching a movie once I've started, but I found myself considering all the more productive things I could be doing and have very little reason to believe that the last 1/3 can make up for the rest of it. I do enjoy independent films, but this just seems like a B movie all around to me. At points it was funny, but the best jokes suffered from poor delivery, both from the actors and the director. Many of the lines and scenes seemed to drag, with footage that probably should have just been cut. I'd be willing to bet this whole story could have been presented in half the time with no loss of story.The concept is great. I'd love to see a higher budget production with some TLC on the script.

Thinking it was as harmless as the other Sonic game we own, I didn't look closely at the packaging, so I didn't see the E10+ rating on the back. It was only as my 9, 7, and 5-year-olds were playing for the first time that I became alarmed. Every 30 seconds or so, I was hearing swearing. Read the other reviews. This game is not for children, not even older children, if you are as opposed to the use of swear words as I am. The E10+ rating is misleading. This should be rated T. I won't allow my children to play this game because they act out what they play and imitate dialogue. I don't want my 5-year-old saying \\"D---\\" and it's a sad world when I have to police and screen everything that comes into my home. I definitely don't want my children being as disrespectful as the other children reviewing this game are. From now on I research every game that my children want to get."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shadow the hedgehog","review":"I am a pretty easy going parent. I was absolutely appalled at the swearing in this game. This game is not appropriate for children. I also listened to the words of the soundtrack of this game and they are horrible. Here is the site to the words.http://www.espiokaos.com/lyrics/sth_lyrics.htmlIt says \\"I am evil\\" several times and it's difficult to get it out of your head. I just don't think swearing and songs like this should be polluting our children's minds. I do love the sonic games and those seem to have decent lyrics to the sound track. If I would have known all of this I would have never spent the money for my seven year old to have this game. Take the time to look over the lyrics. If you don't mind your child hearing curse words every five seconds. I guess this is the game for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"RACIST","review":"I am appauled that this game is in the market. The bad language and the \\"kill the Black Creatures\\" sound bites every 5 seconds is really disturbing. At first I thought I was crazy but I requested other parents to try the game and all of them came to the same conclusion that the game is racist and sends a horrible message. People who vouch for this game must agree with the messages. This christmas gift went straight to trash and the other Sonic games followed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad Language","review":"I didn't play the game but my son did. He's a mature 9 year old so I thought that the rating (E 10+) would be fine. Well during the first few minutes of him playing the game all you hear is 'd**n it'. I just don't believe that any game with an E rating should have cussing in it all the time or anything like that........period. As you can see in the first review on this page, a twelve year old is cussing in his review. Not cool! Shadow cusses every time he loses coins, falls and dies. Pretty annoying to hear it all the time. I think this game should be rated 'T'. So for those of you parents that want to keep your child safe from this kind of language, DO NOT GET THIS GAME!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Badly written and based on unverified info","review":"This book was worse than i expected.

The book tries to insult great authors like Ian Kershaw who have done much better works than this fellow.Just by that you can tell that the only way he can make himself look good is by making others look bad. The book is very boring and not worth a read, trust me. People who actually have knowledge of hitler know that this fellow who wrote this book just wants to make and extra buck because he has \\"new\\" info. And in the end hitler was not gay, people close to him have testified this like another reviewer said, plus many people have testified that hitler loved to be in company of beutiful woman and he had two long relationships with two young beutiful girls. well anyways i recommend you not to purchase this book and spend your money buying an Ian Kershaw book instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"If you assume enough, anything is possible.","review":"Early in the book, this author leaves the well-travelled world of historical research to delve into the world of speculation.Throughout the book, the author asks the reader to assume this or that was true, and builds a shakey \\"proof\\" of Hitler's homosexuality based upon a host of assumptions.This is not scientific historical research in any way. If I want to suspend my disbelief, I read fiction.

In summer 2005 I lived in Blagoevgrad and found the course to be the best preparation for a lesser-studied Slavic language. It provides dialogues that you will actually find useful everyday when in Bulgaria. Learning to read the Cyrillic is facilitated by the orientation at the beginning and then the gradual exposure to it throughout the 20 lessons. My advice is to work at a steady pace, i.e., a dialogue and grammar exercise each day. All essential grammar is covered admirably without reaching that eyes-glazed-over point. I was in Bulgaria for 8 weeks and only completed up to Lesson 12, but it provided me with the skills needed to converse on all essentials and even some more abstract conversations. In summary, if you work seriously with this book and the 2 CD's, then you'll be at an intermediate level in about 3 months -- what better praise can you give for a course?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Learn Bulgarian ???","review":"I have used books to learn 2 foreign languages, Spanish, Italian and a little Dutch all with sucess.

There is also no [english sounds] pronounciation guide with the Bulgarian words, so advance knowledge of the alphabet and phonetics are needed. A complete waste of time and money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful but Sexy","review":"I bought this book a few weeks ago and put it on my TBR shelf, but the comments and reviews made me pull it out and start it sooner. I'm really glad I did! What a wonderful read. The character of 'Robin Hood' is the heroine's grown brother who is very 'slow' and institutionalized by the town after their parents die. The heroine is only 13 at the time, but she rescues her brother from the asylum, along with two other characters who become 'Little John' and 'Friar Tuck'. This story made me laugh and cry all the way through, but it's also very sexy! Though the story about the family and the 'Merry Men' is important, Deb Stover never let me forget that Stolen Wishes is a romance of the first order. Actually, there's also a secondary romance between Robin and a Native American girl who is also 'slow'. Talking about this book makes me want to read it again. I think I will.This book is not only a keeper, it's a treasure."},{"rating":"2","title":"A beautiful story, beautifully written","review":"One of my favorite authors is back with a mind-bendingly original re-cast of the Robin Hood myth.

He was really making MAGAZINE COVERS, throwing in some URL links and then posting them on the net disguised as web sites.The book is beautiful... that's about the only reason you should buy it."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a waste!","review":"This book is nothing but Roger Black's opinions. If he says a design is bad - it must be so. If he says his sites are the best - it must be so. There is absolutely no practical advice in here. No HTML tricks, no programming hints, no tips on how to create a nice web site which is what I was hoping for. He may be at the top of the field but his pontificating really seems overblown. He may not be that self-centered and self-important in person but boy, does he come across that way in this book! I'm glad to read the other reviews and see that I am not alone in my assessment!

Worth buying for a group and arguing over the topics. Sample discussion: \\" Did any of you guys understand why Black included that section on typography?\\" or- \\"which photo of his agency/him did you like best?\\" Sorry Roger. _User Interface Engineering's Website Usability: A Designer's Guide(1997)_, proves most of your \\"cutting edge\\" theories to be quite flawed."},{"rating":"2","title":"A web site hobbyist gets schooled","review":"I run a website purely as hobby.

So why, if a Web design book isn't a revelation akin to Christ's second coming, is it panned?Sure, it's a bit self aggrandizing and lacking in whiz-bang tech stuff (which is important). But Web site design is a thought provoking process: concept, content, packaging, usability, and delivery. You'd be surprised how many sites ignore the basics...and why better sites use seasoned artists and, yes, behavioral scientists, so us humans know which button to click on.Want \\"Web master tricks?\\" Find another selection. What you'll find here is solid design principals, sorely needed in the publishing of Web-based information."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful but shallow.","review":"I found the book beautiful and fun to go through. However in the end it seemed shallow and empty. Perspectives on design of Roger Black are almost non-existent at times. I wanted to know more about his thoughts on design as I strolled through his works than what was in print. Especialy when I find a beautiful design or spread he designed. The majority of the book analyzes design and appears to be a retrospective of his work in print for the most part. Web site design is there too, but that seems to be trivial, given the name of the book. All in all, it's a beautiful book, and don't get me wrong, I liked it. I just wish I could get inside his head a bit more"},{"rating":"2","title":"Invaluable.","review":"This is without a doubt the best book I have seen on web style.

Doesn't focus on technology so much as design principles/rules you need to think about when designing a page and making it really effective (both look and feel). Very easy to read. Well worth the money I paid for it.Don't expect it to be the be all and end all but it is a great place to start if you want to know more about design and not just about 'what looks cool'.Also great book for someone who hadn't done website development before and was expected to manage a large team of very creative (and sometimes pretty out-there) graphic designers and HTML programmers. Also found it useful on other projects where we have engaged web design companies to design the look and feel of our browser based interfaces."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lots of flash, mostly trash","review":"Although this book is very pretty with lots of ink, thick pages, and nice graphics, I thought that the information value was very low. All of the information that was worth anything could have fit in a magazine article. This book seems to be a \\"look how cool Roger Black is\\" book, and it even has a little section in the back all about Roger Black, in case you didn't catch it from the rest of the book. Roger Black's Web work is very nice, so he has a lot to brag about, but this book should not have been the way to go about it. Although his Web design may work for certain audiences, there's much more to it than this very opinionated (and limited) version. He should stick to magazine design. Don't waste your money. This book is not only over-priced because of the flashy presentation, but it's not even worth the content."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wish I'd read these reviews before buying this book...","review":"All Black talks about is himself, his organizations, his work, and his beliefs. As insteresting as some of those are, this book gives a very poor overview of what makes a good web site, and fails to feature a wide array of design styles and site examples. Reads like one long Black advertisement."},{"rating":"1","title":"Web sites that Roger designed","review":"Not to take anything away from Roger Black - he has designed some very aesthetically pleasing web sites - but what was this book supposed to be about? Certainly it gave great insight into his mind and methodology, but that is all it gave. To read it you would believe that he is the only designer out there, and that Red and Black (although nice) is the only acceptable color palette.Also, if this is a testemant to effective content organization, why was I constantly flipping back and forth between incongruous pages and superfluous magazine designs from the sixties? Yeah this guy had a great career, but that's not why I bought the book.And another thing - this book is the definition of overly designed. Is that to make up for the lack of content? Were all the saturated glossy pages supposed to make us think that our money was well spent on this self-serving egomaniac?Save your money, this book isn't worth it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why is there no negative star rating? Take his points away!","review":"What Black has to say about web-design in this book would fit onto a single 640x480 screen in 72 point bold. He fills a book with pictures of his shaven head, repeats pictures of his own sites, and strangely, since the cover claims he wrote the book himself, quotes himself in the form \\"Black says\\". I read the book in a library, and would want to go to his office if I had paid the $45 cover price. Black no doubt sees this as controversy, but the guy is a pseud, and it seems from what he says in his book that others do all the design work anyway. Don't pay for this advert for Black's company and Adobe.

(How about putting in some more pics of websites that work instead?)I believe that Black Really wanted to write an autobiogrophy about himself, but realized that no one would buy it, so he disguised it as a seemingly helpful book hoping to make some money.Roger, I have nothing personal against you, but you cost me 40 bucks to listen to you talk about yourself and I'm not happy. Do us a favor and make your next revision more about 'Web Pages That Work' and less about the 'Life and Accomplishments of Roger Black: Lord and Inspiration of the Magazine Industry'."},{"rating":"1","title":"Must've gone to press without a proofreader","review":"I have a bit of a problem with Roger Black, in regards to his ego versus the repetitive nature of his work. I like his clean designs, but this is a guy who never tries anything new. He's been lucky to make a career of it. With this book, he seems to officially be resting on his laurels. Not much effort here except on the printer's part. Glad I didn't pay full price for this multi-page \\"gee, look at me\\" self-promo piece for Mr. Black. But my big problem is that...WHO PROOFREAD this thing? there are phrases that repeat over and over, multiple spellings of certain words and phrases, typos, and just plain misspellings. \\"Kristy Brinkley\\"? \\"Adobe After Affects?\\" There's dozens of them. Hmmm. Seems like it was rushed out with not much integrity. Mr. Black, if it's got your name on it, and you are the perfectionist you seem to be, then find a better proofreader--or do it yourself. It's embarrassing. Oh, and I double-dog dare you to NOT use red in a design."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great fun!","review":"This was the first painting-by-numbers that I've bought and I had a lot of fun with it!

There were times when it is impossible to tell who is speaking as Bunch does not use the standard formula for showing who is speaking. The characters are not at all drawn out, they are flat, shallow and two dimensional. There is no emotional resonance and you get no feel for who the characters really are. All in all it was a flat, uninteresting story that was downright boring most of the time.I would not recommend this to adults as they might get bored easily, but children and teens may find the action and suspense enjoyable."},{"rating":"1","title":"don't waste your money on this book","review":"This is an awful written book.

After only a few uses, the ceramic on the fake ceramic plates is coming off. Soon there will be none left.

I bought it yesterday at walmart for about $15.48. You cant beat the price. It gets my african american hair straight and it can even do flips and curls.However the reason why i gave it 4 stars is because it is really ceramic coated not ceramic plated.

It gets really hot and it heats up quick."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for AA hair","review":"I bought this Andis Flat Iron years ago when I was relaxed and It's never let me down.

It heats up quickly and the heat is very even. I have noticed recently that I have had to bump up the heat setting to achieve the same temperature and there is some fading of the gold paint on the plates, but at this price I didn't even expect it to last this long. I was actually surprised it has worked this long after having sat for 7 months on a shelf. The only reason it is not getting 5 stars is the fading and loss of heat output. If it dies today I will only have spent $5 per year on it and you can't beat that for an iron that doesn't pull and heats up well.For the record I have thick, wavy, frizzy hair and it straightens and smooths my hair beautifully. I like the 1\\" version because I have bangs and it is hard to straighten them with a wide iron."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome Straightener!","review":"I got this straightener to replace my old CHI since the reviews on this one were so good.

It's wonderful and an awesome price too!! You won't regret this purchase!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A flat iron worth trying!","review":"I am amazed with the results of this iron. I bought this item recently after reading the majority of good reviews, so I decided to invest in it and I am glad I did! Not only is it effective with my hair being smooth and silky, but my hair doesn't revert. I usually go a half-inch or quarter inch and in one sweep my hair bone-straight. Also when I use getting my ends, I take a styling comb with small the teeth, and glide it once more to assure straight and sleek hair. And like what everyone said for sixteen bucks you can probably rival it against a chi or fhi. In my opinion give it a go, not all inexpensive are bad as some might to make them. At least with this flat iron you can't go wrong."},{"rating":"1","title":"defective","review":"I was looking forward to this iron, my hairstylist had used one this size last time I went.

I've decided to replace this one with theHSI 1\\" CERAMIC TOURMALINE IONIC FLAT IRON HAIR STRAIGHTENER Free Bio Silk Samplestraightener as it had many excellent reviews.

This flat iron straightens my hair just as well as the expensive flat irons that are used at salons. It heats up very well and doesn't take a thousand passes to straighten the hair.My only complaints are that over time it does seem to wear out, and since the plates are ceramic coated instead of completely ceramic, the coating does wear off. However, if you clean the flat iron after each use it does seem to hold up longer.But for $20 bucks, you really can't complain at all."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Buy!","review":"I needed a new flat iron, looked into getting a chi. This looked like a good option, and it was so much less expensive. It works great. I don't even need to turn it very high for great results. I am very pleased! I have shoulder length fine hair, it works great. I was especially pleased with how well it worked on my bangs. Would buy again!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Decent","review":"For the price you pay, it's a decent hair straightener. I used it today and after biking, my hair was still fairly straight, but it lost some of the straightness from when I first straightened it. It's not a miracle worker so I'd suggest some hairspray (I didn't use any). My hair is medium thick, but I'm sure if I turned up the heat a bit more, it'd work better. For the price though, I'm happy with this. It works like it's supposed to and for those with hair that's a little harder to deal with, hairspray will make it all good."},{"rating":"2","title":"It works great for my thin straight hair!","review":"**Update.

I have never owned a flat iron before but this was easy to operate. I set it at \\"10\\" and it got hot quickly. From there it was just taking small sections of hair at a time to straighten. It took me about 20 mins or so from start to finish and I was very happy with the results. The price of the iron is less than half of what it would cost you to get your hair done at a salon. So, this iron is definitely a steal."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works great, without the expensive price","review":"I had been using a 2\\" flat iron and wanted to switch to a 1\\", ceramic iron, but didn't want to spend $100+.

I didn't throw it in the sink or anything hardcore, just used it twice and kept it in my bathroom and it broke.

I put it on the highest setting because my hair is thick and difficult to straighten, and then promptly forgot about it. When I came back to it half an hour later, it was warm, but not hot.

I have used it almost every single day since I've had it, and only in the past 6 months or so has it started to wear out. The ceramic coating is starting to wear from the plates, and it does not heat as well as it used to. Since it started to wear, I have bought 3 other flat-irons to replace my Andis (for some reason, I just cannot find another Andis in any store anymore!) and all 3 of those irons has gone right into the drawer, never to be used after the first 1 or 2 uses.

It also helps that I've found a product that works well with heat tools. Its so annoying because I've used way more expensive products that had a better feel and texture while I slathered them on, but failed once the flatiron hit it.

Then the gold color started flaking off leaving gold specks in my dark hair. My hair would snag on the edges of the chipped away gold parts. I threw it out.

This one does the job. It is smaller than my previous flat iron, but still straightens my hair well. I have finer hair that is normally pretty straight, I just use the flat iron to smooth it out and get rid of the obnoxious waves near my ears and forehead. My hair does get caught in it, but it doesn't hurt. It gets VERY hot, and I have to be careful with the edge of the flat iron hear my forehead, which was not the case with my last one- I recently got a pretty bad burn near my ear. Great for the price, especially for the light use that I have it for."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works really well!","review":"I think this flat iron is awesome!

The reason why I purchased it was because I needed a straightner for CURLING my hair. I have plently of really good straighners for straighting. I ordered this on a monday, and I recieved that following saturday, via USPS. Very fast shipping! When I opened it, it was exactly how they describeded it. I turned it on the 15 heat setting and went to curl my hair. It wasn't making the curls I wanted to so I turned it up to 20. I curled all my hair and I got the desired look! I went to show my dad, and came back in my room. My room smelled like burnt hair so bad! I have really thin, but VERY healthy hair. I guess I shouldn't keep the heat setting at 20, other than that I love this product and HIGHLY recommend it for both curling and straightning. 5 STARS"},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it!","review":"I ordered 1/2\\" too wide and have burned myself, so be careful what you need!

It's not the design, as I said the identical product in a different package worked fine, it's the manufacturing that was f-ed up.If you need to connect a cable to a hot shoe get a similar device, just not this exact one.

It literally took 10 minutes to get my Canon 430ex on here, and once I finally did, my flash was disabled completely. I could not even hit the test button to fire a flash. This has never happened to before mounting my flashes on these adapters. Obviously my pocketwizards would not fire, nor would my 580exII which has its own PC, but I was just testing it. That would not test fire either.I will be returning these next time I am in NYC & this has inspired me to look into basic manual flashes with PC built in, as I am just using them as slaves."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love at first listen","review":"Frightwig is a group of angsty, untame ladies rocking with such force to inspire many other female bands.

I also like how in the music video she lets Ginger die and lets her new self come out. I also like her new look and how she lost the huge heels although I sorta liked them.

A nice big clock read-out, day, date, and most importantly solar and atomic time keeping. Where this watch went wrong for me was with the band itself.After recently purchasing the G-Shock Riseman, I thought I would return it and get this watch instead, hoping I would recoup half of the money I had spent on the Risemen. The only reason I was looking to do the return was because I didn't need, nor planned on using any of the features on the Riseman other than the time and date.Unfortunately, the band on the GW700A is very, very uncomfortable for me compared to the Risemen. The band is almost like a hard plastic rather than a soft comfortable rubber. I couldn't stand wearing it for more than 10 minutes before I had to take it off.Sadly, it's going back to Amazon tomorrow. I really wanted to like this watch but I guess I'll just keep the Risemen as it wears very comfortable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Weak battery, poor quality","review":"After about a year the battery stopped recharging, the back light switch broke and the back light would randomly turn it's self on through out the night.

Great features and very good indigo backlighting. The only thing I'm not real thrilled with was the size - it is a bit bulky and stands off the wrist a little higher than normal. So, if you want something as flush to your wrist as possible, then this isn't the watch for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Battery Stops Working","review":"I bought this watch around a year and a half ago. After about a year the battery would not hold a charge all day. By evening the watch blanked out and stayed that way until given several hours of bright light or sun.

After finally going to the Casio web site we were finally able to bring up a readable copy; however, it would not print in anything but let's-get-out-the-magnifying-glass size.

I've owned so many before and will never shop outside of the Gshock brand.Its water proof and shock proof, which sold me on it."},{"rating":"2","title":"The right watch","review":"I have very specific requirements when I look for a watch. I am a career Army officer and I look for a watch that is rugged, has 12/24 hours clocks, has dual time zones, stop watch, alarm and is very accurate. This Casio answers those requirements. The traditional G-Shock construction is very rugged. The light is easy to use. The GPS synch makes the watch perfectly accurate and the solar power makes battery failure a non-problem. The only minor issue I have had was with the band. The piece that holds the tail down, is a little tight and has to be placed correctly to get the tail through. This is a minor issue and the watch has performed extremely well. The GPS feature does NOT work overseas so the watch will be as accurate as a normal G-Shock during deployment."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nothing else needed","review":"I have some really expensive watches--Rolex etc. These keep time and look pretty but have little else to offer compared to the G Shock Solar Atomic Watch. This watch does virtually everything on its own. It is easy to use and takes a beating. I swim and snorkel, work out, chop wood, mountain bike etc with it. With my business, I travel the country and it resets itself for each time zone I cross. I also travel world wide and the time zone settings are very helpful. I just purchased this new watch for myself and gave my old one, also the same G Shock, to my neighbor's son who wanted one like mine. I couldn't ask for more. Great watch."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cool","review":"I like this watch, but it's not perfect. The tough solar and atomic functions work great. Although it has 5 alarms (4 and a snooze alarm), it doesn't have a countdown alarm.My previous solar-powered G-shock only lasted 6 years before the battery died. Is that the 'lifetime' of the product, as the tough-solar claims? It was not easy to find a replacement battery for that older watch, and I've heard that water resistance often fails after opening the watch up to replace the battery. You're supposed to change out the rubber seals inside every few years too, but that doesn't appear easy or plausible. It's not like there's anyplace online where you could buy them, for example.For a G-shock this watch is actually fairly small, but compared to most watches it is indeed bulky. It's smaller than my last watch so I like that.The backlight on this watch is fantastic. It also grabs an atomic signal several times during the night instead of once, making it much more reliable than previous versions."},{"rating":"2","title":"Happy customers","review":"After sixteen years of marriage I finally bought him a gift that knocked his socks off. I'm talking about the Casio Men's GW700A-1V G-Shock Solar Atomic Watch! I could always tell he did not like my gifts because they would always end up in yard sales. I was threatening to just buy him gift certificates and let him buy his own gifts. But whats the fun in that? So I persisted and struck Gold. He loves the fact he always has the correct time thanks to the Atomic. The fact that it was Solar did not hurt. My husband has never owned a Casio before so this is a new experience for him. He was actually wearing it the first time when we went to dinner with his parents and was bragging about it. I know one thing this is not going to be in our next yard sale. My Recommendation?

If this were the first Maggie Shaye book I had ever read, I might be blown away as well, but this is her worst. I had trouble finishing it and only did so out of respect for the author.The heroine, Annie was really stupid to not see the obvious villain from the beginning and the hero Richard/Ren was not likeable.There was no chemistry. This was the most shocking disappointment of all because Maggie Shayne is a master at creating chemistry between her main characters. I have read all of her vampire books, witch books, and even all of her fabulous cowboy books. I have read the two Fairytale books and all the little ones in between. This one seems like she didn't even write it because it is so bad.If you haven't read Maggie Shayne, then start with this one and maybe you will like it more than I did.

Have been very happy with the FatMax Tru-Laser, red target laser is easy to see indoors and even under most outdoor conditions at good distances. It would get 5 stars if it had a backlit LCD. Unit does have a problem reading very short distances (anything less than 3 feet or so) which I guess is fine since this was meant for situations where a tape measure isn't feasible.

It is inexpensive and easy to operate and it is very accurate but seriously product designers, would it have killed you to make the sides squared off? The bottom surface and surface opposite the laser side are relatively flat but when the product is placed on either of the narrow sides it aims at an angle. What is the point if it is accurate to 1/8\\" over 100' if you have to level it with your eyes? If you are off by a few degrees that makes the accuracy more in the neighborhood 2\\". Call me picky, but I put \\"perfectionist\\" in the title for a reason. It would be a five star product if it were brick shaped but the little frilly curves and angles easily knock it down to two for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Must Have Tool!","review":"As a technological skeptic, I took a chance with this unit. WOW! As accurate as Stanley claims, this tool has made my job as a project engineer in an industrial manufacturing facility so much easier. I no longer need another person to hold the dumb end of the tape nor do I need to crawl behind equipment to measure room dimensions. This is the least invasive method to measure up a room. The ease of use is great (I was measuring volumes and areas 5 minutes after putting the battery in). I have successfully measured ceiling heights next to very bright lights, and it is not fooled by hi-gloss brick finishes. So it is not sensitive to the environment. This is going to be such a time saver and comes highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Uber Cool!","review":"This laser measurer is going to make my life easier by far!

With those ones, all she had to do was shake them and they made noise so she did so constantly.While this doesn't make noise nearly so easily, she still loves it. On these, when the dog squeezes them they make a noise...in this case you hear bubbles coming from the lobster. For a dog with a tiny mouth like a pomeranian, they might carry it by a leg or tentacle and not be able to create a noise but still, when I throw it in a game of fetch and I squeeze it she just goes wild.There is something instinctive about them grabbing something and it making a noise that makes them have crazy fun with these.Of the monkey, frog, and lobster the lobster is her favorite of this brand."},{"rating":"2","title":"Spider-Man 3: Final Battle by Mega Brands","review":"My son has enjoyed this toy and plays with almost every day.

And after a mere six months, contacts are worn and require some type of liquid interface to get any connection. Of course, the only liquid that works has to have some salinity, which causes the contacts to degrade even more rapidly.

After setup, it worked as programmed. Over a matter of a few days however, performance deteriorated. Although using the Help function usually resolves the issue, it gets tedious. One should be able to select an activity and be done with the remote but this is not the case. Users must often follow up to complete portions of the activity chosen. Once the activity is set up, the other functions of the remote such as volume increases, decreases, muting, etc., work as they should and all functionality of the displaced remote controls are emulated on this remote. That is expected so overall, the Monster MCC AVL 300 is below average in performance."},{"rating":"1","title":"terrible product","review":"It's such a great idea, but it simply doesn't work as an RF device. It will work as IR device, but is much too expensive as a universal remote. I was very disappointed because I had high hopes and monster is well known company. It just won't work in cabinets and through walls as advertised. The software is even worse. There are no instructions and the manuals will not open up on-line and support is available only 8-5 Monday thru Friday, so when does a working person call? Oh well, a $300.00 dollar lesson. Please don't but this product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Monster remote is great","review":"I purchased this remote to control my Home Theatre components. I initially set it up to control my bedroom setup, and was amazed at how much the remote is able to \\"learn\\". The setup online is fairly straightforward, and can be changed to meet your needs. The remote will control a wide array of components, including Satellite set-top boxes, TVs, DVDs and Blu-Ray players, etc...There seems to be a loose piece inside my remote, although it may be the sensor for motion (the remote knows when you pick it up and it lights up and offers you options). Hard to say. I contacted the seller, and they were 100% willing to back up my purchase, offering me to re-ship a new remote if I was not satisfied. I told them I would test it out for a few weeks to see if all functions worked properly, and they are being very accomodating.Great purchase.It will also control your lighting if using Z-Wave dimmers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a great experience","review":"Remote received and returned! I disliked the boxy feel of the remote. The remote doesn't fit in your hand very well. The LCD display is poor. I had a horrible time getting the Web-based software to communicate with my PC (kept getting \\"Unable to Display Content\\" error messages). After doing a bunch of Google searches I finally found a solution to the problem and got the software to configure it (required uninstalling and reinstalling the software and creating another account to manage the remote).

The only universal remote I could find at this price range (under $100) that had both RF and IR capabilities. The Omnilink works great for your IR components. I didn't even set up the infrared leads that come off of the Omnilink and all of my IR equipment is reading it from the Omnilink directly even though they are separated by an open shelf. I can be anywhere in the room even with my back turned to the equipment and it picks it up. No more aiming and pointing the remote. The remote feels very well made and keys are solid. Placement of the keys is not the most convenient and will take some getting used to since there are no tactile references. The screen is a little hard to read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not-so Universal Remote","review":"I bought this remote because I lost my Sunfire Ultimate Receiver remote during a recent move. This product uses Harmony's data base, so I thought 'great, I don't have to lay out $300 for an original remote'. The Harmony database showed it was a match for my receiver so I layed out the 80 bucks for Monster AVL 300. Guess what? This is discontinued model. Additionally, the database only has 1/3 of the codes for the receiver (according to their worthless tech support I waited 30 minutes on 'hold' to talk to) they said there is no way to add the missing codes without having a Sunfire remote to manually 'learn' the commands! This remote would probably be OK if you already have the product remote and you're backing up the codes, but if you're buying this remote to replace a missing or broken one, skip it! You're resigned to having lay out big bucks, unless, of course, you find someone with a Sunfire or Theater Grand III remote and they're kind enough to lend it out."},{"rating":"2","title":"Harmony Replacement!","review":"Of course it is a Harmony too.

I would not recommend this product, especially after getting the harmony 900."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Must Have","review":"This is the best remote that I have ever owned. I have tried many universal remotes/learning remotes, and this one blows them all away. It truly can perform any function the original remote can, plus it allows me to hide my components cause it goes through walls. It simplifies complicated functions. With the press of a single button it turns on DVD player, turns TV to right output, and turns AV Receiver to right output. Shipped on time and in great shape. I would buy from here again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Remote that can do it all","review":"Before this remote I had the Harmony 890 and they are very similar. This remote uses the Harmony db so you get all the great features that you do with the harmony remotes. This remote is a few years old so the LCD display is last gen, but still looks good. The actual interface on the computer is not as easy to understand as the harmony, but after about 30 min I got used to it. As with any universal remote, it does take some time to program. For the price it's a great deal since it comes with the RF module.P.S. - The Omnilink (remote module) needs to be paired with the remote to work. You need to add it as a lighting control.

But, this book contains info, specs, step-by-step directions, wiring diagrams, photos and drawings, etc for anything you'd need to do to your saab, except possibly rebuilding the tranny!PS - The reviewer from Villanova, PA commented: \\"The firing order of the spark plug wires on the distributor - it seems to have an image from the 8 valve engine - not the 16 valve.\\" I'd like to point out that this book is INTENDED for the 8-valve version of the classic 900, NOT the 16-valve versions - as the name implies.

In the years that followed, my professors warned me that my taste would \\"mature\\" out of such 'pop poets', and into 'higher' forms of poetry.I must also admit that this particular book has confirmed my belief that Ginsberg was a poet that may have received his share of attention, but perhaps his share of literary credit is long overdue.In \\"Cosmo Greetings\\", Ginsberg's second last volume of poetry (the last would be the equally-excellent but posthumous \\"Death and Fame\\") sees Ginsberg growing older, looking at the world as one small, global community and with more humour than I have read in his work since the early years of \\"Howl\\" and \\"Kaddish\\".Give this one a try, and re-establish your love for this man's work."},{"rating":"1","title":"Undersized hat","review":"I bought this hat in what was supposed to be a size medium.

Although, it may seem like a blend of hip-hop, funk, jazz, and samples, I think the proper classification is Trip-Hop.

I was unprepared for this gentle portrait of a man looking back on his life.LANDSCAPE is told as a series of musing, not in precise chronological order, of events in one man's life. They are not deep, or inventive. They only describe glimpses into his history, but when taken as a whole, the effect is quietly devestating. Nothing really happens of any importance, but not everyone leads a remarkable life.

The story is true to the Beanie Baby craze but there is no solution or even an understanding at the end. My children and myself were for the first time truly confused and disappointed with an ending of a Berenstain Bear book.

I have been trying, unsuccessfully, for 6 weeks to get an unlock code from them to allow me to use the software. For some reason, when I installed the software and registered it as instructed, I never received back an unlock code, so the software is useless.

Once you get the hang of it, it is easy to use and easy to switch back and forth between camera and camcorder.My videos and photos come out crisp, clear and in true-life colors. I can very easily transfer my videos and photos to regular DVD's using my Sony DVD recorder or a computer DVDRW drive.My only complaint and the reason for the 4 stars instead of 5, is the battery's charge is not long enough which requires you to always keep a spare on hand.

Whereas most \\"green\\" theorists have a tendency to sink into mere liberal preaching, p.m. gives us a glimpse of a world that OUGHT to be. No tedious sermons on recycling, condom use, or literacy. Instead, the Magus of Zurich talks about a possible world of duels, sprouting micro-religions, bizarre local cuisines, the transformation of bland existing buildings into bohemian funhouses, dramatic suicides, wild barter economics, and Tarkovskyesque railway systems.In the early '90s I belonged to a New Mexico household that attempted to implement some of the ideas of this book. Although the project failed miserably, individual pettiness was to blame rather than p.m.'s resplendent vision of a politics that would finally confront the irreducible reality of both beneficent and lethal objects."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't work...","review":"\\"Santa\\" bought this for my son for Christmas.

This is a classic example of that. I read a review that called this book riveting, so I was tricked into going out and buying it. The review was right . It was riveting if you consider riveting to be that you need rivets to hold you down to keep you from getting up and never picking up this atrocious display of a book ever again. After the first chapter, I took a nap. Midway through the second chapter, if my eyeballs could throw up, I knew they would have after reading a mockery of all books ever written. Howeve it got past the publisher, I'll never know. This book doesn't deserve one star, it deserves negative 57.

Benchley (the author of JAWS) moves back and forth between recounting his own heart-stopping adventures in the sea (sometimes purposely swimming with sharks and other deadly creatures, sometimes accidentally encountering them), and his simple and clear explanations of how man's interference with the balance of the world's oceans has already resulted in some dying regions.

The actual inseam is 7.5\\", with cuts available for ~3\\" and ~5\\" inseams. I want these to keep my thighs from rubbing together when I wear skirts. To do that, the crotch has to be somewhere near my actual crotch. If I wear them at my natural waist, the crotch is really far down, plus the waist is way above where I wear my skirts. If I pull them up to fit my crotch, the waist is nearly at my bra. The elastic at the waist is not covered, so is really itchy almost immediately. These are really a lost cause and I don't recommend them."},{"rating":"1","title":"not impressed","review":"I'm returning these. I wear size 14 and got a large and it's way too small in the waist.

One of the things to be considered when reviewing a book is how it compares to other ones covering like material.To start off with this book only concentrates on 50 checkmate ideas. It has limited material, which is what I consider to be major drawback. If you don't mind English Descriptive Notation then \\"1001 Brilliant Checkmates\\" by Reinfeld has a lot more material or if you are looking for very simple checkmates then get \\"Simple Checkmates\\" by Gillam.

All of these books work much better!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Most Awesome and Cool Chess Book","review":"This book totally rules!!!!

No-one else has come close to matching the quality of instruction. Sure, the title is odd/amusing depending on your viewpoint. Sure it is not just for kids. But it does teach tactics - to be specific checkmating motifs - in a simple and easy-to-follow format.One way to use this book is to read it thru once quickly and play loads of blitz games. It is amazing how often the checkmate combinations arise in one form or another once you know them.There are very few books in my library that I would say will rapidly advance your game for sure. This is one of them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rather Skimpy","review":"I found this book to have some good \\"how to checkmate\\" problems in it (why 2 stars instead of one).

I do not recommend \\"Bobby Fischer Teach's Chess\\" (see my review on it).Why 4 instead of 5 stars. I think \\"How to Beat Your Dad at Chess\\" is one of the best checkmate problem books, however, it left me wanting more problems to work on.

This keyboard is not the same as the Targus PA800U, but the USB connector is compatible with both models. I recommend the PA800U.

As I ride motorcycles, I use these to tie phones, PDAs, flashlights, multi-pliers, and other useful items to my belt so I don't lose them off the bikes. These are round in cross-section, as opposed to flat, so they work better for that purpose. I also use them in their traditional role as around-the-neck suspension for my cell phone (when I'm on call, I've been known to wear a pager to bed that way so my wife isn't awakened by the darned thing buzzing away on the nightstand). While durable, the woven band will eventually wear out, but it's been six months, and the ones I'm using are still wearing well.

They conclude by weaving a contemporary context and relevance from the common themes. This book, like Dr. Crowley's earlier Celtic Wisdom, is a work of art as well as a work of literature. It is hard bound, printed on gloss paper and richly illustrated with beautiful and evocative imagery. Highly recommended for both the coffee table and the library."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing Special","review":"I generally like Vivian Crowley's work, but she missed the mark with this one.

I figure with these cartridges the performance could only improve. I was wrong. There is NO improvement in the cleanliness of the tank or the filter area. The water actually smells funny with the cartridge in. Plus, I have noticed that the little beads inside fall out, and are reported to be harmful to pets and animals. They're so little it's hard to see them. Not a huge deal to me, but I'm sure it could pose a problem to someone.All in all, I would rather purchase purified water, or get a water filter for my sink for the water to use in the humidifier than use these, since there is no real difference."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't work...","review":"I got this for my small room humidifier, since I have to run it continuously for 24/hrs at a time in order to get the humidity up enough. After about 2 tanks worth I'll empty out the reservoir into the sink and rinse it out with fresh tap water, but every time I always seem build up of that nasty pink/brown slime. It's absolutely disgusting to think that's being shot up into the air and into my lungs.It really seems to be an unnecessary accessory (I don't use the demineralization filters either since we don't have hard water) and I've never had any issues with calcification or white dust. But evidently the cleaning cartridges don't do anything for my ultrasonic humidifier.It's really quite annoying to have to use a Q-tip to try and swab out all the brown slime that gets into all the tight nooks and crannies (which I totally can't even get into so I have to resort to using rubbing alcohol to try and disinfect it).Maybe it might work wick-based humidifiers but not on my ultrasonic one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't know if this helps","review":"Not sure if this actually helps clean the humidifier tank because I'm still cleaning it out regularly.

After replacing its $15.00 filters (every 3 months) that seem to do about nothing, it didn't seem worth the cost and effort to keep it operating. The unit's instructions advised me not to use any additives but just clean the thing about every filling and keep replacing those filters as directed. So, since I was going to throw the thing out anyway, I tried one of these cartridges.It worked. It's been about a month, and the slime is starting to come back, but that's supposed to be the effective life of the cartridge. The humidifier survives. I still have to clean it, but the task is now infrequent and easier.So, it does what it's supposed to do; does it for as long as it's supposed to do it; hasn't harmed the over-priced humidifier; and is good for the environment as long as it keeps this humidifier out of a landfill."},{"rating":"1","title":"it is an expensive unnecessary","review":"The cartridge costs about $5 and last only 20 days before the filter and the cartridge starting reek.

I have tried everything to help deal with keeping the humidifiers clean - and have not found anything that makes the upkeep easier (other than frequent descaling and filter changes).

Within about three weeks we saw definite signs of improvement, and after several months of adding this to her breakfast, the improvement is remarkable.

I've also noticed a reduction in his shedding and his coat looks great! The one issue we had with Allerg-3 is that he would not eat his food if this was mixed in it. We had to resort to using an eye dropper to administer his daily dose, and had to divide his dosage into 3 increments a day because he would vomit if we gave him the full dose.

It does what it is supposed to do. Sure it doesn't always cut the wire completely when you punch down, but you just punch again, wiggle if you need to and you're good to go. Would I buy this if I needed this everyday for my job? Ehh, I'm sure there are better ones out there. But for wiring up my basement and other small, odd jobs, this is perfect. I've used this on Monoprice's slim cat5e punch down keystone jacks and ICC's data modules. It worked much better on ICC's data modules, but only because they were installed in a low voltage cabinet. The cat5e jacks I was holding in my hand. In that situation it's still very usable, just more of a pain, but that isn't the tool's fault.

If you take your comic book characters too seriously then this is not your show. Stylistically the animation is excellent with crisp and heavy line work. The four color heroes just pop from the screen. The stories are self contained and just fun. This episode focuses on the trinity (Batman/Superman/Wonder Woman) and their signature villains. You can watch this with the kids and still feel like a kid. This is for anyone who ever ever tied a towel around their shoulders, pretended to block bullets with their wrist bands or mimed the act of climbing the side of a building.

But THEN! Then the JLI appeared on my screen (with added Martian Man Hunter + B:tBatB Aquaman -- who, in my opinion, should have his own series, and own book, and possibly his own movie as well, because he is that awesome) and that was almost too much awesome for me to handle.

Mr. Ungerman seems to have some insight into what actually happens in the world. The book was a little slow after the start then it picks up.

Training programs can be very different today, and there's no mention here of GPS running, MP3 players and the Nike plus system, or runners websites. Instead, there is a discussion on running with a Walkman.An illustrated set of streching excercises really should be added, and the wellness and psychological content should be critically evaluated.That's not to say this is a bad book, it's motivational and written in a pleasant, informal tone. But if this is the only running book you buy, you'll miss a lot."},{"rating":"2","title":"Most Useful!","review":"This book helps a beginner get started and stay motivated (and injury free) with specific, progressive training plans. Best of all, it shows you where to go next, if you want to press on, after meeting your first running goals. Many running books for beginners aim to get you to 30 minutes of nonstop running and then leave you on your own. This one helps you identify your next goal and then gives you the tools to reach it.

The novel has the added elements that keep those who dislike dry historical works excited and interested in the story. There are some minor historical errors but overall it is a great novel. I found the book so great that I searched all over the east coast for a used copy of the sequal \\"Proceed Sgt. Lamb\\" which tells the remaining story of Roger Lamb. I eventually found a copy and eagerly read it. This book is out of print but is a must read if you read the first book because the ending of \\"America\\" leaves the reader hanging.

I contacted APEX to stop the order but it had already been processed and they said that they would charge me a pricey restockng fee if I sent it back, even though it was unopened.I am upset with Amazon for not making it clear that other parts were required and I am FURIOUS with APEX at their return policy of an unopened, and as yet, undelivered product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tedious, sleepy balladry","review":"This CD is mostly filled with extremely slow, cheesy ballads which become quite boring. Besides, I think Ms Caram isn't a really good singer: although her voice is nice, she has a very narrow range and seems to be singing always the same notes, and that makes her sound very monotone. However, the two uptempo tracks are quite nice, especially \\"Africando\\", a very good samba: here she is rhythmically much more at ease and she sounds ultimately much more convincing than in the slow songs. \\"Maracan\\", the other uptempo track, is also quite delighful, with a tasty final scat. But the shame is that 90% of the CD is slow. In summary, if you're an Ana Caram fan you may like this release, but if you don't know her and you're searching for good soft Brazilian balladry and bossa nova, I would recommend you to choose some other singers as Joo Gilberto, Astrud Gilberto, Nara Leo or Rossa Passos, for instance, which are much more compelling."},{"rating":"2","title":"Focusing by Eugene T.

He is single, lives alone and does not know how to cook. He's over at my place for food all the time so I thought this would be a funny part of his gift this year. The book is great. It has large cardboard pages (like toddler books) and pictures of ingredients in a fashion of 'picture of can of soup' + 'picture of noodles' + 'picture of cheese' = 'picture of final product'. Then a few paragraphs of the steps with cooking instructions. Also some helpful blurbs tossed in like 'only you can prevent kitchen fires!'

The combinations of ingredients are un-imaginable and purely disgusting!For the same concept and much better recipies, I recommend The Can Opener Gormet by Laura Karr instead!"},{"rating":"2","title":"my man's a'cookin","review":"This was my surprise Chritmas gift for my fiance and he has used it more than any other gift! He loves it. These aren't gourmet meals though and many do require more ingredients than just a some cans of stuff ... but it is all worth it to me."},{"rating":"2","title":"meals in minutes","review":"Really just some great recipes to get you started. While I am an accomplished cook, I did find the concept and recipes very rewarding. Literally, I had dinner ready in the time it took to boil some noodles. Anyone who feels intimidated by cooking could take these recipes and change them a little for their own take on the meal at hand."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Man, A kitchen, a book....","review":"A Man, A Can, A Plan is a book for men. It's finely crafted pages are made from board, which makes it a perfect companion to the store, or through the many spills and messes that comprise my kitchen. Leaving no room for error, the list of ingredients is not only in writing, but in picture form as well. As any cook book for men, the categories include Chicken, Beer, Spaghetti O's and other things that really only interest people who don't know how to cook anything else. Almost all of the meals are tasty and somewhat inventive, this of course coming from someone who has never cooked before. Overall the simplicity of the book makes the meals easy and fast to make; making this an extremely useful book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book for my young college graduate son","review":"My son just moved to Boston and we gave him this book to help him in the kitchen. He is thrilled to have it. I love that it is a board book. Sturdy for a young guy!! I hope he puts it to use."},{"rating":"1","title":"WAY too gimmicky","review":"This book's recipes all focus WAY too much on the gimmick of using canned foods. A much better focus for a book aimed at the reluctant cook would be to pare down classic \\"guy\\" recipes to their simplest form, not figure out a bunch of things you can mix with Spaghetti-O's! Ugh. Most of the recipes are unappetizing at best. Maybe this would be a good gag gift. Maybe."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fast, easy, simple.","review":"I bought this book for my husband who does not cook. He actually looked at the book, picked out recipes, and fixed some of the food. The directions were simple and they even provide pictures of the ingredients so you know what exactly to buy. The book is cute and is very simplistic. It is not for the gourmet, the dieter, or anyone who likes fresh vegetables. As the title implies, most recipes use only canned food. On the plus side, the recipes are simple, easy to prepare, and do not require a lot of planning. The results vary from edable to pretty good."},{"rating":"2","title":"plan for the can","review":"I bought this book for several of my male friends who have mild cooking phobias. As mentioned by several other reviewers, it would have helped for the book to have a clearer diagram of all ingredients, but overall, the book took a lot of the guesswork out, and really made the recipes look less like a recipe and more like a diagram to assemble shelves. I think \\"seeing\\" what they are putting into their meal made it less daunting.The food is (don't tell this to them) really healthy overall, as well, which is a major bonus. They, too can cook with fruit! Vegetables don't have to be harvested by hand to be a good part of a meal!Great (and funny) gift for a guy who may just need a little nudge to find his way into the kitchen."},{"rating":"1","title":"R Rated","review":"I thought this would be a good cookbook for my son when he went out to his own apartment.

It is one of his Christmas gifts, so while he's on break we will go through this cookbook together so I can give him helpful tips on cooking meals. Instead of canned meat, however, I will suggest he use fresh meat, but follow the rest of the recipes. He has gotten really tired of eating in the university's cafeteria and really wants to start making a lot of his own dinners. Each page has photos, and VERY SIMPLE STEP BY STEP instructions!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I wouldn't feed this stuff to my dog","review":"I ordered this book and i was sorely disappointed. There really wasn't one meal that i considered to be even edible. If you're one of those guys that'll eat whatever, this book is for you. Also, if you like lots of can corn,tuna,or beans. However, if you like to actually enjoy what you eat, i don't recommend this book. I thought i would get at least one edible useful recipe. I understand that its supposed to be easy and quick, but that doesn't mean you should have to sacrifice taste. As mentioned by one of the other reviews, this book is insulting to men that can actually cook a halfway decent meal. Not to mention, there aren't even very many recipes in this book. This book is not a cookbook.Its a book that puts together random canned stuff and puts it together in a bad attempt to make a meal out of it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Downright insulting to men the world over...","review":"First of all, I have been known to cook quite a bit before, so this book probably shouldn't have been on my list of things to buy to begin with. I thought I'd save loads of time using this book to start cooking for myself once again, boy was I wrong. Since when did Spaghetti-O's become fine dining? I didn't even care for Spaghetti-O's when I was a kid, so the thought of using them in a recipe now is just disgusting. Most of the other recipes in the book are either horribly gross or common sense. I really don't understand why there needs to be a recipe for hot dogs and chili when they're just using regular hot dogs from the refrigerator section of the grocery store and canned chili... it's not rocket science. I suggest you take the advice of the author and \\"dump\\" the book in the nearest trashcan as soon as possible."},{"rating":"1","title":"Better Go To McDonalds","review":"Unless you're hungry enough to eat the nice cardboard pages, this book will do little to appease your appetite. You're better off at the McDonald's drive thru. There was only one recipe my crew would even consider trying, and the ingredients were not on-the-shelf-staples."},{"rating":"1","title":"Um. . . .

Could not find one thing I had any interest in making."},{"rating":"1","title":"not for everyone","review":"Bought this for my college-bound brother and upon receiving it was surprised that very few sounded appetizing. Very economical meals, but not very tasty. Your college student will NOT be picking up any girls with these recipes! I purchased the cookbook \\"A Man, a Can & Grill\\" from the same series afterward. These are recipes I would eat! Great gift to accompany a George Foreman grill, for example. Perfect for introducing the new cook to ways to marinate/season different types of meat. That said, keep in mind that this requires ingredients that can spoil (i.e., the meat)."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Can Full of Dreck","review":"Given that this how-to book is put out by Mean's Health I kept asking myself if it was some sort of joke disguised as a fundraiser for something having to do with actual health issues related to men. I think I was too much of an optimist and perhaps too gullible to think this was anything other than a canned food product endorsement playlist for the culinarily challenged. What we have here are assembly instructions for 'meals' that are geared more towards a 10 year old latch-key kid than towards any male adult interested in healthy eating. The recipes are bland, soulless concoctions that I wouldn't feed my dog. Anyone seriously considering purchasing this book can rest assured that the joke will be on them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what it seems to be:","review":"About the only thing this book was good for was a good laugh when my wife saw it. It could be a good gag gift for a man that can't cook, just don't expect him to use it. Almost all the meals required a oven or stove top, only a few were \\"nuked\\" - plus I don't want to wait a half hour for something to be simmered or baked. ALSO: in small type at the bottom of the page was the \\"Also:\\" area that included stuff that was not in a can, i.e. 10 oz can of refigerated pizza dough, 1/2 8 oz can tomato sauce, 1 cup shredded cheese - why bother, just order a pizza or pop in a frozen one. Save your money on this, there have to be better cook books out there for beginners."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's more advertising, than real cooking","review":"Many of the recipes in this book don't look good at all. Spaghettio's mixed with ground beef and peas? Gross, might as well make Hamburger Helper!Also, most of the recipes would be just as easy to make with fresh ingredients, that would taste so much better. But, it is good advertising for the companies that sell the canned goods..."},{"rating":"1","title":"An insult to men everywhere","review":"I don't understand how anyone can possibly give this book a good review. The recipes in this book are by and large disgusting. \\"Spagghetios Stir-Fry\\"? Puke!More importantly, though, the book is an insult to the intelligence of men everywhere: \\"Manhandle a bag of chips to crush 'em all up.\\" That's really part of the directions in one recipe.Those of you who think you can't cook: have some self-respect and practice cooking with actual ingredients (i.e. those that don't come from a can). You'll screw up at first but it's really not that hard if you just give it a few tries. Contrary to a claim found in this book, canned foot is not as good as fresh food."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nuby Step Stool","review":"I bought this step stool because of all the good reviews. They were right! I love this step stool for my 3 year old son. He loves to wash his hands now at the bathroom sink. He has also started Brushing his poor neglected teeth because he can stand on the stool like a big boy and see himself in the mirror! I think we must have an odd shaped toilet, because I can't imagine how he can stand on a stool and tinkle in the toilet... he has tried a couple times, but the bowl is just too far forward.. So he sits on the potty chair.. Not the stools fault i am sure because it does kinda tuck under the bowl...

I would buy again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice action on this set","review":"The last crimper I had didn't function as well as this one does. It was all manual. This version has a nice grip on the handles and has a clicking lock to help hold the pliers in place. They feel great to use and work extremely well. Enjoy them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great crimping tool for a great price","review":"Works very well, comfortable in my hands, and the fact the cutter and stripper are built in are wonderful. My only gripe about the product is when you cut the wire, there is an \\"auto\\" wire stripper that tends to cut the internal wires on my cat5 cable, so I just need to cut the wire, then seperately strip the wire. Not a big deal at all, I'm just nit-picking."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works great, price is right","review":"I bought this to replace a super cheap crimper I bought years ago for about half the price. This one is far superior and works every time, so far. I have used it on ~10 cable ends. The stripper seems to work fine, and the crimper presses nice and even, unlike my cheaper model. The crimper does smash the locking tab down, but that can easily be bent back up. I like to insert the plug into a jack and then bend the locking tab back as far as it can go. Because its in a jack it doesnt break off.Otherwise I am not too sure about the ratcheting mechanism... I read some other reviews but still dont quite see how it works or if mine works at all. Im also not quite sure why one would need a ratcheting mechanism for this so Im not too worried about it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good for the price","review":"I'm sure there are better more expensive crimp tools available but this is great for me. Doesn't feel cheap and should last if I'm not too rough on it. Take note that the two blades on one side that barely don't meet are for stripping flat cable, and the cutting blade is on the other side by itself. Took me a while to notice. Of course don't bite down all the way on the cable when you're stripping it because different thicknesses and all, just score around the outside of the jacket and it should break when you pull it, the blades are pretty sharp."},{"rating":"2","title":"Solid. Did the job.","review":"Beginner here...Needed to make some ethernet connections from phone connections (2 other wires already in place). Did a couple test runs on extra cord and then went to the outlets to do it right.Tool made everything work smoothly. Cut the wires and chrimped the things perfectly. Did the job."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Price for a Good Tool","review":"Other tools do exist that are much more expensive, but why pay for that when this tool gets the job done. I did not find fault with the build or function of this tool. The stripping component takes some subtlety because it uses a flat surface vs using a recess. I have used the recess on other tools and that makes it much easier to use. Outside of that I am very pleased with this tool"},{"rating":"2","title":"Works really well","review":"I'm new to building Cat5/Cat6 cables but having watched a couple of videos online I heard people say that crimping down a couple of times is a good idea. So I always do that. I have yet to have issues with a cord that I'm able to blame on this crimping tool :) ...usually if a cord doesn't work after I'm done it's because I put wires in the wrong order or didn't push them all the way into the RJ45 \\"end-peice\\".Feels like solid build quality."},{"rating":"1","title":"Needs Adjustment","review":"I like Trendnet. I really do, but this offering from them simply doesn't make the grade. It crushes the locking tabs on RJ-45 connectors so badly that they become unusable (won't lock into the jack) and you have to do it over until you get just the right touch. If there were a way to adjust it, I would give a better rating but since you cant, I can't recommend this tool even for occasional use."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works just fine!","review":"Length:: 1:00 MinsThis crimp tool works great to crimp connectors plugs, but for cutting....not so well.

But overall good product.","review":"Very nice product for the price. Strippers don't work that well. But crimps and cuts like it's supposed to. Good buy.

Luckily I had one already and was just buying this as a replacement for stolen pair."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works Great","review":"Without going overboard on a review, I must let you know that if you are considering spending $80 for the same tool, stop looking and buy this one.

This unit is of decent design and quality otherwise, but this failure in the product prevents me from being able to store it without exposing the stripper blade, and therefore renders this of no use to me. I purchased a higher quality product for a few more, said goodbye to this several-week hassle of returns, and have to give this product 2 stars as a result."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't crimp reliably. Waste of time/money.","review":"I have tried to use this crimper to make my own CAT-5 cables a few times and I have never had success. It seems to push the contact areas on the connectors (where the network card makes contact with the connector) down too far so that the network card's contacts can't reach the contacts on the connector. I have tried not squeezing too hard and it seems to still have the same problem. The other functions like stripping the sleeve off the CAT-5 cable seem to work fine but it doesn't perform it's main function very well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Reliable","review":"The cutter is not convenient since it will cut through the cable.

But over all for the price it got the job done."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for the casual user","review":"I recently replaced the old coaxial cable in my house and decided to also run ethernet cable while I was at it. This tool came in very handy to crimp about a dozen connectors on total. The stripping, cutting, and crimping tools all worked without any flaws. The toughest part in the task is to keep the wires in the correct order as you're pushing them into the terminal. Once they are and you verify they're still in the right order and pushed in sufficiently, you just push the connector into the crimper and squeeze. Not much use now that that project's over, aside from making custom length ethernet cords for friends here and there."},{"rating":"1","title":"Crimping degrades over time","review":"The crimping degraded after about 6 months of use and since the die is not replaceable I have to get a whole new tool.

The locking mechanism is pretty cheap, so I'm not sure how well the rest of the tool will hold up."},{"rating":"2","title":"Oops!","review":"I think what the last reviewer didn't understand is that no men are oppressed on the basis of their maleness, therefore they are not oppressed as men. They can be oppressed by homophobia which sees femininity in a man as a weakness, they can be oppressed by class, race, religion, etc...but not on the basis of being a man.Oppression happens to individuals, but not individually. People who belong to certain groups can be oppressed as a result of their group membership or perceived group membership, but there is a difference between oppression and suffering.That said, this book is brilliant and heavily cited in works by other genius thinkers and in my own personal life."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great 70s jazz rock","review":"The Cave of Clear Light psych/prog compilation features a song from this album, but other than that it seems to have slipped through the net into obscurity. I found the album worth the money spent, it's mostly jazz rock in the vein of Colosseum, but here and there they sound a bit like Cressida or even Atlantic Bridge. This is not about instrumental virtuosity, but there's some pleasant piano, organ and sax playing throughout. The drumming is more jazz than rock. One of the highlights is a long hypnotic jam with a repeated organ motif called 'Is It Loud'. This is an album worth getting if you like your rock jazzy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Music poetry","review":"The Desmond Project is music poetry. This is lighter jazz, reminiscent of Vince Guaraldi, Diana Krall, and, Dave Brubeck. The selections are melodic. The quartet is composed of inventive and accomplished musicians who refreshingly do not feel the need to impress us with meandering and persistent solos. You will not find incendiary chops and riffs here. This is more contemplative. This digital recording is extremely clean and sharp. By employing single-point miking, the stereo imaging is pinpoint. The dynamics are exceptional (and even more so on the DVD-audio release of this material). Actually, this CD makes an excellent disk to demonstrate audiophile components. The music content is so good and so well played, you can listen critically or just enjoy the tuneful selections. So, turn up the stereo, sit back and enjoy. Most highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fresh and Fine","review":"This is one of those CDs that I dreaded auditioning, grudgingly putting it into the CD player out of a sense of duty. I had never heard of guitarist John Basile, figured he had a lot of cheek to record a CD called The Desmond Project, and I really did not expect to like it at all. But after about five seconds of listening, I had reversed my opinion--this is a really fine recording! The rest of Basile's quartet consists of Allen Mezquida on alto sax, David Finck on bass, and Payton Crossley on drums. They may not be household names, but they are first-class musicians. The music on this CD has a lyrical quality that evokes the spirit of Desmond without ever sounding merely imitative. Everything sounds fresh, new, and wonderfully lyrical.To top things off, the recording quality is of demonstration class, as we have come to take for granted from Chesky. Yes, this recording really won me over, and if you give it a listen, chances are you will be won over too."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rebuttal","review":"The reviewer below criticizes me for not giving scripture to support my own view. Well, Fenley had a whole book in which to quote scripture. It's not possible to support my view in the space of a small review, so I suggest the book END-TIME PROPHECIES OF THE BIBLE, also available here at Amazon, if you want a book that quotes the same passages Fenley quotes but ALSO quotes the many passages he completely ignores--passages that describe events for Christ's return that clearly never happened around A.D. 70. and need to be dealt with honestly."},{"rating":"2","title":"Applied Robotics","review":"A great book! Sure to warm the hearts of hardware hackers everywhere. If you want to get into robotics and you would prefer to build a small robot of your own design rather than buying an off-the-shelf robot or kit then this book is for you. Well organized, engaging and clearly written this book will give you the information you need to engineer your own robot. The book includes a CD that contains a fuzzy logic programming language as well as other software developement tools for the reccomended Atmel MCU. This seems like a real bargain in a meaty book that costs under 25 dollars. Edwin Wise also sells inexpensive kits containing electronic and mechanical parts from his company website.

My daughter only likes to sleep on her tummy and hates to be swaddled. This product works amazing. My husband and I set it up and used a board under the bassinet mattress as others suggested and it worked great. We tested it dozens of times and it never failed.We have had NO false alarms and thankfully no real ones either.This is a must have for every parent/grandparent/caregiver of a tummy sleeper. You should always check on your little one but this serves as a great added sense of security.Hospitals and pediatricians should recommend this product. There is little information about them out there and it really could be a life saver. Of everything we have purchased or received this is my most valued item for baby."},{"rating":"2","title":"Peace of mind!","review":"I love this thing. I was terrified (still am) of SIDS, but I can actually let my baby sleep now that I have this.

The reviews sounded to good to be true. Well its all TRUE the monitor gives me peace of mind!! I didn't put my little one in his crib until I bought the monitor (he was in his bassinet right next to me). Before I got the monitor I would always check on him and make sure he was still breathing, I would poke him, put my hand on his chest, just to make sure he was okay. He would wake up I felt bad but I just wanted to make sure. Well, now that I have this monitor WE BOTH SLEEP through the night because I dont have to check on him. I hear him loud and clear and every little sound he makes (its like he still in his bassinet)and the alarm will go off if he moves off the pad (the pad is under his matress). When I pick him up in the morning the alarm goes off because the lack of movement. I have NEVER had any false alarms!

The sound is crystal clear, and not muffled like so many other monitors. It is more expensive, but I would highly recommend it for your newborn."},{"rating":"2","title":"FANTASTIC","review":"Several of my friends had babies just before I had mine. They all remarked about how they couldn't sleep fearing their babies would be victims of SIDS. So I bought this monitor and have never had such fears. Yes, I have had a few false alarms from her wandering to the edge of the crib... but nothing annoying.We have had one true alarm when she rolled over on her tummy in the night with her pacifier in. Not a single friend teases us about this monitor now! This is a top 10 item on any baby list I give!!! BUY IT!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I GOT SOME REST ONLY BECAUSE OF THIS MONITOR.","review":"I spent three months in the hospital while I was pregnant. After having my son I was worried about nights because he was a preemie. From 5 lbs to now 28 lbs (over a year old), this was the best monitor I have ever seen. I have given it as gifts, both my nieces have these, and everyone I have given it to doesn't know how they could do without it. If you worry about your child breathing sleeping in a crib, if you are one of those parents that places your hand on your child to make sure they are breathing, or if you are like me and just worry, this is the monitor for you. You can even set it to make a ticking sound for ever time you baby takes a breath. I would suggest to anyone to buy this."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must for the worried Parent","review":"I bought this monitor becuase I was constantly getting up in the middle of the night and checking to see if the baby was ok. Everytime I went over to the cradle to check on her she would wake up just minutes later so we both were up most the night. Since I bought this monitor we both get more sleep at night and I felt more comfortable moving her into her own room. I use a sleep positioner so we haven't had any false alarms yet, unless you count the ones at 2am when I'm too sleepy to remember to turn it to sound only.Also, we had a hard time finding a monitor that didn't give feedback becuase of the way our house is designed. This works great with no feedback at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed - couldn't use because of interference","review":"I was so excited about this product due to all the great reviews, the peace of mind it offered and a friend's recommendation. However, no matter what I tried, all I could do was pick up my neighbor's monitor! (I assume she had the same type) I tried moving both parts of the monitor and tried both channels. Unfortunately though, one channel remained pure static and the other was my neighbor talking to her daughter! I had to return it. I ended up with the much-less-expensive Long Range 900mghz monitor which is FANTASTIC for at night (it's crytal clear and uses sound and lights) and the video monitor for when baby is upstairs and we're downstairs. I love both these monitors."},{"rating":"1","title":"Invest in different monitor","review":"I hate this monitor. I don't know if it's the area we live in or what.....but when it is plugged in I get HORIFFIC feedback - I hear phone converstations......radios....and what ever. I would throw this out the window if I could. The only time it works half way decent is if it runs on batteries.....but the batteries have to be replaced every 2-3 days. Don't waste your money - this product isn't all what it is supposed to be."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worthless","review":"I recieved this product as a baby shower gift for my daughter. It worked fine the first few nights, but then we had problems with the alarm going off all the time. We tried repositioning it and everything else but it still kept going off. Finally, we stopped using it and bought a different monitor. I'm pregnant with my second daughter now and there is NO WAY I am going to attempt to use this monitor again. I plan on purchasing a different brand and I would recommend to others that they not buy this one either."},{"rating":"1","title":"TOO MUCH STATIC","review":"IT HAS A GOOD INTENTION BUT MAKES A LOT OF STATIC AS A SOUND MONITOR. I ALSO HAVE A SOUND MONITOR IT DOESN'T MAKE ANY NOISES UNNESSESSARY. I RECOMMEND BUY THE MOVEMENT MONITOR AND A SEPERATE MONITOR IF YOU PLAN TO SLEEP AT NIGHT"},{"rating":"1","title":"Sleep with piece of mind untill the false alarms come!","review":"I think this monitor has the right idea but unless your child sleeps in the middle of the crib directly on top of the monitor pad you will get false alarms. My twin boys are 7 months old and the only reason they ever wake up in the middle of the night is because the alarm on the monitor is going off. I had to set the sensitivity on the monitor all the way up and just like before we still get woken up in the middle of the night because one of my sons had moved to the foot of the crib."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of Money","review":"We hated this product and had to stop using the pad after a number of false alarms. Our daughter is a very active sleeper and would scoot all over the crib during the night. Even after putting a board under the matress the alarm would go off every time she was not directly under the pad. We'd go running into her room every time the alarm went off only to find her sleeping peacefully. We still use the monitor but we would have been better off buying something less expensive."},{"rating":"1","title":"Couldn't even tell you what I think","review":"I'd love to tell you what I think of this monitor but I can't. The reason? Our crib has the wire mesh under the mattress, not a flat, solid surface. This device doesn't work unless the mattress sits on a flat, solid surface. To make it work we have to measure the crib and buy a piece of wood to put under there. But, as I am sure you can relate with, being new parents to an infant we haven't had the time, which is why we ordered this on-line as a convenience...yeah, well, some convenience.So there it sits, collecting dust.I honestly wish someone had warned me ahead of time that it does not work with all cribs...which is why I am warning *you*."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it","review":"This is one product every new parent should have on their registry. It allows a parent to get a more restful sleep knowing the product is monitoring the baby's breathing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disappointed","review":"I bought this monitor after reading all of these wonderful reviews on Amazon only to find myself extremely disappointed. Aside from the several false alarms (I can live with that because at least I know it's working),this monitor has proven to be very non-functional. My first baby was born in May, and within the 3 months I've been using this, there have been several times where the receiver goes dead(in the middle of the night-it was working when I went to bed) and I hear my baby screaming from his room and not on the monitor. I even went to the website and tried troubleshooting to no avail. Also, the interferance is awful with just 2 channels although interferance can happen with any monitor. Needless to say, I just ordered another monitor and will probably throw this one out because I wouldn't even give it to my worst enemy. I hope that mine was just a lemon and that no one else wastes almost $... like I did. I definately have no peace of mind with this monitor."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent product! A must have for peace of mind","review":"After using two different monitors that kept me awake because of static, and after frequent nighttime trips to the nursery to check on my little one, a nurse recommended this monitor to me. What a find! It works exactly as billed. I have even tried to \\"trick\\" the monitor, because I can't believe it can detect the smallest breath from my baby, but it does. And the sound monitor is crystal clear, no matter where I am in the house. I can even hear her breathing, which is amazing.I highly recommend this product. Talk about peace of mind? This is it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This is the Greatest Product ever!!!!","review":"This product is exactly what all the reviews say!!! It really does work !!! Finally a product that does work. We just pluged it in and that was it!!! One of the reviews said it took a long time to set up, thats not true!!! They might have turned the sensitivity dial by mistake. Just leave it at the factory setting and you wont have a problem. The only problem we and many other uses have (and its really not a problem) when you take the baby out of the crib or bassinett you have to remember to shut it off or it will sense no movement in the crib and sound the alarm. To us, it shows that this thing is really working!!!! YOU MUST BUY THIS!!! TRUST US, YOU WONT BE SORRY!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth the money","review":"I debated a long time on whether or not I should buy the product. I decided to get it and I'm 100 percent glad I did. In fact, I wish I would have purchased it sooner. For me, this was worth it."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best monitor on the market!","review":"We recieved this monitor as a gift, and at first I thought we didn't really need it, but it is most definitely the best gift we have received! We started using it when we moved the baby out of our room and into the nursery, and I am amazed at how peacefully I sleep! We have had only two false alarms in the 4 1/2 months that we have used it, and that is only because our very active baby had moved all the way to the bottom edge of the crib. Actually, the false alarms made me feel even better about the monitor, because it proved it really works! And while I hopped out of bed to check on my little girl, she just slept right through the whole thing! If you are at all nervous about moving your baby into her own room, this is the product to buy. It is a little expensive, but the peace of mind that I have is worth every penny!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good replacement for hospital's apnea monitor","review":"I knew the day would come when the hospital would take away the monitor they sent our premie son home with, afterall he was now a healthy twelve pounds and had never had any apnea episodes. I relied on that monitor to assure that he was safely sleeping and didn't want to let it go. Luckily I found this monitor just in time. Hours after our hospital monitor was picked up our Bebe sounds monitor was delivered by UPS. I didn't lose any sleep that first night and in some ways like this one more because of the ticking on the monitor. The professional version only has lights next to the crib to let you know everything is okay. I would not want to live without this!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A great nights sleep-finally","review":"We ordered the angel care monitor, and I wish we would have known about it sooner. Our son is 4 months old, and I am just now getting a great nights sleep!! I usually wake up several times a night, just to make sure my son is ok. With this monitor, I don't have to get out of bed to put my hand on him, just look at the light on the monitor, and know he is safe and sound. It really does give you more peace, and makes everyone more comfortable. Now he may actually move into his own room!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Nina's Mom","review":"My husband and I LOVE this monitor. It absolutely gives us peace of mind. It has gone off a couple of times and I wonder if we didn't have this what could have happened. We recommend it to EVERYONE!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A MUST HAVE","review":"I don't know if I would have ever slept peasefully without this product. Caleb is 2 1/2 months old and he is never in his bed without this. I can promise you this works because it's gone off a few times while he was in his bed. I'd pick Caleb up and he would fine so it could have been false alarms but I'd rather have a few false alarms then no alarm. I also forget to turn off the alarm a few times a week when I pick Caleb up and there goes the alarm. I'm taking this with me to my parents house this christmas. I plan on keeping it in Calebs crib for a long tome so that way when he starts climbing I'll know if he's climbed out of his bed. The only problem I had was my bedroom is right next door to the nursery so I had to finf a spot that didn't just pick up fuzz. All monitors probably do that though.I know this is a little costly but it's well worth it! You might want to try looking at ebay for these. I got mine brand new still in the box for $50 including shipping."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works even when the power goes out!!!","review":"I lost a child to SIDS and when we decided to have another baby I was scared to death. She is now 5 months old and rolling over off her back. I do get some sleep. It's very portable. We take it on vacation, it fits right on the top of my cloths in my suitcase. You do however have to put a board between it and the metal spring of a crib. We didn't have to with the bassinet. I just got a piece of thin masinite (spelling, sorry) and it's perfect. It has gone off a couple of time, but when the batteries get low it does that. Seems to always be the middle of the night. I also got the Summer TV type monitor and the two are a great match."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thank GOD for this product - I can sleep!!!","review":"We purchased this when our son was born. He had some issues at birth and to say the least, I was worried about putting him in a room by himself in his crib at night. This is the greatest invention for new, worried parents. Both my husband and I sleep peacefully because of it. We tested it thoroughly and love it. We have given one to all of our expecting family members and they love theirs too. We did discover that you have to have the masonite board to prevent false alarms. After we bought our on Amazon, we found another site - saved quite a bit on the second and third ones we bought as gifts. Go to www.loveourbaby.com"},{"rating":"2","title":"You can sleep soundly too!","review":"With this monitor, you can sleep soundly too. This monitor is worth it's weight in gold. My son was born 4 weeks early with a collapsed lung and I am so glad I had this monitor. The alarm sounded when he was in his cradle and I was able to get him. He is now 14 months old and I still use this monitor. He sleeps 12 hours at night and it is nice to know he is just sleeping. This is the first thing you should buy for your nursery. I would have paid much more than it cost."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best baby product I've purchased","review":"I reviewed this product thoroughly before purchasing and I can't praise it enough! My daughter was diagnosed with sleep apnea at 8 weeks old as a result of this monitor going off. She is now 11 months old, very health and doing well. I thank God for looking after us and having me purchase this product because if not our lives would definitely be different! I wasn't sure if I wanted to spend the money, but would spend double that next time!"},{"rating":"2","title":"positively peaceful parent","review":"My son was a 3 pound preemie, born 2 1/2 months early. He came home on a heart/lung monitor, after a 2 month hospital stay. When the monitor was discontinued, I was worried that I would never sleep again. I purchased the Bebe Movement and Sound Monitor and never worried again!It did go off if my son got too close to the sides of the bed (and off of the sensor pad), but I didn't mind the false alarms.The GREAT thing about this monitor was that at 17 months, my son, a climber, decided to climb out of bed. The alarm went off and he hasn't done it since...and he's 2 1/2 now!!This monitor is SOOOO worth the [money]. I think of it as an investment!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great investment!","review":"This is the greatest invention ever. We brought our preemie baby girl home a week ago, and I couldn't imagine life without this monitor. It's a little pricey, but I would have paid double for it for the peace of mind it's given us thus far. She was born with immature lungs and had to spend 10 days in the NICU on a breathing machine. Hearing that tic is so reassuring and it's allowed us to get tons more sleep than we would have gotten otherwise especially due to her situation. I absolutely love it and would recommend it to all new parents as well as anyone looking for a gift that new parents would really appreciate."},{"rating":"2","title":"Feeling safer at night!","review":"I bought this item after my son was diagnosed with a problem that won't allow him to sleep on his back. We are living in a remote part of the world with no 911 service so this Angel Care is literally our Angel. (this and knowing infant CPR!) We sleep so much better knowing that if our son stops moving during his sleep, we won't sleep through it. It has woken us up twice, thankfully because he had scooched off of the pad. It was a huge comfort to know the Angel is so sensitive. The alarm does not wake my son enough to keep him awake all night either; he goes right back to sleep, if he wakes at all. We absolutely recommend this product to any worried moms and dads who reluctantly have to put their little one on their tummy to sleep. With all of the other things to worry about, some peaceful sleep is sooo appreciated!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't bother!","review":"We took ours back to the store because the alarm kept going off.

For example, he terrificaly overstates how bad the World Wide Church of God, his former church, was in the past.He says that, \`he was an enemy of Jesus\`, I appreciate the repentence but that must be terribly offensive to people like my wife who was and still is a member. Yes, the World Wide Church of God (of Garner Ted Armstrong fame) was quite wrong but having been with my wife to a number of their functions and knowing many them as a close observer of the church of the time he writes about I remember many, many fine Christians in that denomination.

Tremors 2 was a decent enough sequel that it had enough comedy to keep you entertained, high tech weapons to show, and gave you enough Burt Gummer that you enjoyed the movie. So the producers thought that even more Burt would be a better movie.It could have been. But going back to tired old cliches of running out of ammo, and blowing up his place - sorry, been there done that. Not funny anymore. Bad script writing destroys what could have been a good movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"THE WORST MOVIE OF ALL TIME!","review":"I say, this is the worst movie I have ever seen in my life.

Number one is a classic, two was passible, but this one is far behind, the acting in this is pretty bad, and cheesy. I gave it two stars because i was somewhat entertained. Don't spend alot of money on this, if your planning to buy it."},{"rating":"2","title":"COOL !!!","review":"I really enjoyed this movie, I like watching it over and over. Universal should make dozens of merchandise to sell on the internet and other stores, but I heard about them thinking about selling stuff at Universal. I hope they make a tremors 4 and if they will I think Steven Speilberg should make it and have all the characters from the last three films team up together and give the audience a big surprise on how great the movie would be. I loved all three movies and I want them to make so many special things about Tremors."},{"rating":"1","title":"This one made me very unhappy.","review":"Everyone knows the only reason to try and make a sequel is to either: take the story in a new direction or to make a bigger, better film down the same path as the original. This movie fails to be anything. It's premise could have been written by an elementary school student! It has by far the worst special effects of the three fims( the graboids,in original form, look like block figures). Burt Gummer was by far the least interesting character in the first two films and they gave him his own movie(although he is good in small doses). The violence and body count of the first two aren't matched. THE MOVIE IS PG! FAMILY IS JUST ANOTHER WORD FOR CENSORSHIP!!!!! This movie was just plain terrible!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst of the Series","review":"Oh God! As a Tremors fan, I've been waiting for this film over a year and now what I got??? A complete trash... I already got first two film's dvds and this third one would be only a coaster.I think there should be a \\"zero star\\" option, because 1 star is more for this film.By the way, there was no surprise this time, trailer already has spoilers about new monsters. They are flying! What a genius idea this time...Hey, Stampede Guys, I want my money back!!! And a therapist to help me to forget this film..."},{"rating":"1","title":"so bad","review":"This movie is probably the worst movie I have ever seen. The special effects are terrible.

No wonder it never came out in theaters."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tremors 3","review":"Like too many serial movies this has 2, too many sequels. The 1st was fair.

Sorry, saw the flying creatures coming before they came. Again, all very predictable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun, but just a replay.","review":"Tremors 3 is a fun movie but really doesn't offer any thing new, it is prdictable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Far from perfection","review":"Well, nobody could have expected the first movie with its giant, burrowing worms to be as good as it was. And we certainly didn't have any right to expect that the sequel to that film would be nearly as clever and entertaining. With this third installment, the \\"Tremors\\" series finally ran out of gas. Burt Gummer (Michael Gross) was excellent comic relief, but he's too much of a characature to command leading man status. The tired script doesn't require the characters to think their way out of their dilemma the way the previous two movies did. A scene in which Burt survives being swallowed is particularly ridiculous, as is the latest matamorphosis of the graboids."},{"rating":"2","title":"FANS OF THE SERIES SHOULD ENJOY THIS CAMPY SEQUEL!","review":"Ok..Ok.. I have to admit I didn't think they could really pull off anything with a third entry......I was wrong! This is not as good as the original or the second film, but what movie sequels are? The FX are not as good in the film with CGI \\"Graboids\\" and \\"Shriekers\\", but I give them credit for having a new mutation \\"A S S Blasters\\"! This is a very funny addition to the franchise and well worth viewing for a fan of the series. I rate it 3 1/4 stars. The DVD is a very good transfer too!"},{"rating":"2","title":"strangely comforting","review":"If you liked the first or second Tremor, this one is especially fun. Otherwise I couldn't tell ya. If you like dumb, entertaining sci-fi go for it.The old worms are back in Perfection Nevada after 11 years with one in particular \\"el blanco\\" who's hunting Burt. The new creatures: \\"... blasters\\" are entertaining. The funniest part of the movie is when Burt is asked what will happen if the ...blasters get into his food stocks and he replies: \\"...-blaster Blitzkreig\\". Juxtapose that with \\"Hill Street Blues\\" and it just kinda tickles."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better Than Part Two","review":"The first Tremors was a real surprising treat. Part two was very welcome, but not as good. And now, we have Part 3. This one is way better than 2. It has more going for it. Mainly Michael Gross as Burt. He now stars in this. It's about time!. We get three other returning people from the original. Little Ariana Richards is back and what a doll!!. The movie is pretty formulaic, but who didn't expect it?. It's a fun and entertaining movie in the old Tremors fashion. I don't think fans would be disappointed. If they are, they can't be too much of a fan then. Pretty fun."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another Great Read from Ms. Abe'!","review":"I think this may be my favorite offering yet from Shana Abe'. INTIMATE ENEMIES is a great title for this tale of star-crossed lovers torn apart by family hatred and reunited by sheer necessity.Serath and Rafe are multi-layered characters who must overcome the sins of the past and band together to keep an evil enemy from destroying their land and people. It's been done before, sure, but Ms. Abe' puts her own spin on it and her own style, giving us a medieval to sigh over.A great read!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Not your average scottish laird meets feisty girl","review":"This is a scottish historical romance and I especially like it because its not your typical powerful, macho laird (with thighs the size of tree trunks) falls for spirited little woman. The story actually has quite a few twists, turns and intrigue - enough to make me forgo my Saturday afternoon nap. Definitely a good read."},{"rating":"2","title":"good Read; a little bit predictable","review":"Good Romantic Read. However, the geographical/territorial tale is a bit unrealistic whereby England and Scotland share equal ownership of an island within the historical setting of the book. The romance is enjoyable with the heroine's bravery being above average. Due to the fact that the heroine's betrothed is introduced so late in the book, readers can undeniable guess the evil plot that will unravel towards the end of the story. The clan's indecision regarding its leadership and ally struggles pretty much reminds you a little bit of the similar clan issues described in so many Scottish-taled books and movies (i.e. Braveheart).This book lacks a bit of imagination, suspense and intrigue. The relationship between the two protagonists is definitely witty and thus why the rating is slightly above average."},{"rating":"2","title":"Understanding","review":"I always thought other reviewers were exaggerating when they said they threw a book or felt like it. I was in for a huge revelation! I'm the kind reader that says ok 'I know that they make it through, but how do they get there?' OMG, I was having my doubts half way through the book! I even found myself wanting to toss it because I was s SO caught in it. I read the first 200 pages, ending about 3 am. Knowing I had to get up of course I finally convinced myself to laydown. I was awake wondering what is going to happen next! At one point, I even stopped to make sure someone doesn't die in the book. The casual look ahead to see if that character has anymore dialog. Thank you Shana Abe for letting me understand what others really meant."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent!!!","review":"What a great Author. I couldn't put the book down.Thank you for writing a book with so much passion."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible! Crazy!","review":"What's wrong with Jews wanting Jewish Homeland? Zionism is not evil. Every Jew in America and England are safe because of the existence of the Jewish homeland. Because there is a Jewish State, Jews feel safe wherever they are -- whether it is in the USA or in England. Jews have suffered for 2000 years and there is no one we can trust -- not the US government or the British government. There is nothing wrong with English Jews being loyal to the State of Israel. Trying to make that sound like a threat is down-right wrong! What does this wierd-named foreigner know about Jews or Jewish experience in England?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Rubbish","review":"This was one of the worst books I've ever read. The ideas being portrayed were offensive and very inaccurate.The author uses little more than flimsy evidence and innuendo to support his claim that English Jews were responsible for 9/11. The idea that a few English Jews have so much influence on world politics is complete and utter rot. The number of Jews living in England is very small. I can only assume that the author has never visited England and is basing his arguments on the assumption that the religious and political make up of the country is the same as the U.S. There has never been a Jewish power base in England therefore it is unlikely that this religious minority would have a strong enough political voice to provoke the attackers.This book really is a concoction of fabrications and distortions based upon the flimsiest of evidence."},{"rating":"1","title":"Absolutely ridiculous!","review":"I agree completely with Joe Levi. The suggestion that English Jews are in some way responsible for 9/11 is totally and utterly preposterous.It doesn't take a rocket scientist to realise that Muslim fundamentalists were guilty of this appalling tragedy. Jews represent only a tiny minority of the English population and very few hold positions of power let alone influence events in America and Israel. I can only assume that this book was written by Nazi sympathiser/Nazi using a false name. It would be good to see a book published on the evils of Muslim fundamentalists, who distort the Koran to suit their thirst for power and domination.As a Christian, I recommend that you avoid this book since it is likely to cause great offence to anyone who suffered as a result of 9/11."},{"rating":"2","title":"Makes Lot of Sense","review":"This book makes a lot of sense. You will be amazed how English Jews are like American Jews. It's incredible."},{"rating":"1","title":"Idiotic!","review":"This book is about as convincing as Osama Bin Laden would be if he told the world that he loved America and would kill millions of Muslims, who dare to oppose Bush. The author, probably Kim using an assumed name, provides a significant amount of fictitious historical evidence to support his main argument i.e. English Jews were responsible for 9/11. Most readers will find this book nauseating, especially if they have read Kim's other anti-Semitic literary works. The following example is typical of the assumptions made by Kim, regarding the behaviour of Jews: According to Christian Kim, if you know a Jew, you know he's going to be very pro-Israel. Apparently Kim's personal experience affirms some of the points of the book. Anyone who has met Kim will know that the above assumptions are nonsensical and they merely show how ridiculous this book really is.Please avoid this idiotic book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Jewish Royalty in England Causes Greater Problems","review":"Did you know that there are Jewish royalty in England? Yes, daughters of wealthy Jews or wealthy Jews who married royalty and became royalty via marriage. Being that the royalty is the head of the Episcopalian Church/Anglican Church -- it's ludicrous. In other words, Jews have a lot of social clout and political power in England -- probably far greater than in the USA. And that's saying a lot. Given this reality, it's no surprise that these wealthy Jews in England with social and political power will abuse their power to push Jewish interest and Jewish agenda. I wish Mr. Pradesh would have treated the issue of Jewish royals and their contribution to 9/11. Maybe he'll do that in the future? Otherwise, I found this book most informative and helpful."},{"rating":"2","title":"Look at all the pro-Israel Jewish lobby groups, Understand!","review":"I found this book very insightful. If you live in Washington DC area, you know all the multi-million dollar Jewish lobby groups dedicated to pushing US Congress and the US government to supporting Israel. Jews pour millions of dollars every year to extort American leaders to support the State of Israel. As a conscientious Christian who is a person of color and takes the Bible message serious -- also the portions that emphasize that you should not oppress the poor, I cannot but condemn these Jewish lobby groups. What does the Jewish State of Israel do but oppress the poor -- many of whom are Christians. Historically, it was England and English Jews who created the oppressive colonialist regime in Palestine for a bunch of wealthy European Jews. Why is it difficult to understand such oppression will displease God in Heaven and create problems for the world? I found this book insightful and meaningful on many levels."},{"rating":"2","title":"Christians United for Peace","review":"Christians are united for peace because Christ is the King of Peace. It is for the sake of global peace that Catholics have condemned the Jewish State and its oppression of Palestinian Christians for decades. Peace often comes at a high cost. And it's important for conscientious people to stand up against those who practice injustice and oppression of the poor. Jews in the United Kingdom have always abused their previlege. Founding of the Jewish state of Israel is an example of how Jews of privilege abused their power. I found this book refreshing becaue most people in the USA are afraid to condemn the social wrongs Jews commit. I don't know why American Christians are so afraid of Jews. Maybe it takes a Hindu to wake us up!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Love them","review":"I have used these for many years and had run out.

And the people i took to see him were very disappointed because hi would move from left to right making one dizzy. We could not hear the Guitar because he played a early 1800's guitar."},{"rating":"2","title":"COULD BE CONSIDERED MINI-OPERAS FROM CARTER!!!!","review":"I don't have a lot to add to the other two fine reviews. I will say that this is a wonderful collection of Carter's vocal pieces. I realize that his first opera as titled was \\"What Next\\" which is a fantastic work in itself, but I found that these vocal works with their connections in sets of poems to music and overall structure could in fact be considered actual mini-operas leading up to \\"What Next\\". I'm sure that many will disagree with this viewpoint but this is the way that I appreciate and very much enjoy the works. Excellent performances from some musicians and vocalists of the highest order, and a superb recording and production job. Highly recommended for any fan of Elliott Carter's and for those who love refreshing new creative works at their fingertips. Amazing works at a great bargin price. He has proven himself to be amoung the finest vocal composers of the 20th century."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for cookies","review":"This container is great for cookies and other baked goods.

Keep an eye out for Walter and CharlesMatthau, Nell Carter, Jack Lemmon, Mary Steenburgen, JoeDon Baker, Charles Durning, Roddy McDowall and Doris Roberts(Mildred on Remington Steele).The movie is extremely slow paced. You know how moviesoften go syrupy right at the end where the actors startmouthing platitudes and smiling benignly into the sunset orrunning over fields. This movie goes on like that for thelast 20 minutes of the movie.

I think it is so important to reach into other religions and cultures and learn and celebrate. I never knew that it was so interesting to learn religion.

It is extremely watered down and lacks any substance. There are WAY BETTER books out there about the basics of Judaism. I don't expect a lay person to write a tome on the subject, but if you can't even describe the Orthodox movement, for example, in more than five short paragraphs, you have no business writing the book.There is not one citation in the entire book of a secondary source...NOT ONE! And there are very few scriptural citations. I'm not Jewish and I knew more about Judaism than what's in this book before I got my Master's in Jewish Studies. The confirmation chapter is only two paragraphs long...A HALF A PAGE!

I am struggling to finish this book knowing full well that it is not going to improve one iota.I find the characters weak and uninteresting. The affair between the faithful wife and this WWII veteran from Chicago turned journalist is hard to imagine.This book is genuinely boring. How many bars, restaurants, geographic locations and prominent landmarks do we need to read about. Who cares! So the author is well travelled.

We looked at the ingredients on the box, and while it lists buckwheat as an ingredient, regular wheat flour is in fact the main ingredient. Buttermilk was also listed on there.Now, I'm not sure if wheat is usually the main ingredient on buckwheat mixes, but this tastes like they really cut it down and just wanted to make a buck off the name.Very sad.

Hudson was first an important port and then a successful industrial city. One of its most lucrative industries was prostitution, and from the 1780s until state police closed down its operations in 1950, Hudson was known far and wide as the place to go for a good time. This work chronicles the history of prostitution in Hudson, along with the social conditions and political corruption that allowed it to flourish. Hall has produced a lively and engaging local history, written in a conspiratorial tone that immediately draws in the reader. His liberal use of anecdotes gleaned from interviews and personal papers and 40 period photographs enliven this tale of sin in a small town."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great addition to an EQphile's library...","review":"Or really, anybody interested in fantasy storytelling.

This isn't so much a guidebook to Elfquest as an illumination of how it came to be. Some of the essays are written by the Pinis, and others are by admirers and friends.EQ readers will probably appreciate the essay about how Recognition works, but there's lots more there to love."},{"rating":"2","title":"If you're a fan of elves, comics, art or simply fantasy...","review":"...then get this book.

I bought this book years ago while in a vampire craze. I quickly discovered that this was not going to be a vampire story, and I was okay with that at first. It seemed richly worded, well written.But then I got to a page and read something that stopped me cold. One of the characters in this story that takes place hundreds of years ago actually said to another one \\"What's up?\\"Any pretense of being in that era, transported to that time melted away instantly, and I realized that the author was a pseudo-intellectual hack with a flair for fancy words and a sloppy mind.That the story never amounted to anything didn't help either.This seemed like a book by a man who while quite intelligent, felt the need to prove it by writing a snobbish testament to his own perceived level of sophistication, and even on that level, failed miserably."},{"rating":"1","title":"The secret life laszlo, count dracula","review":"It can get worse.

Also Italy's Bulldozer doing Whisky Time is excellent! There are a couple of more modern tracks on here as well from Aura Noir and Nattefrost, which retain that old school spirit. I am hoping that Fenriz sees fit to compile another volume, there are many bands that werent included on here that could have made the cut (Masters Hammer, Necrovore, Havohej, Von). But all in all this is a great compilation. One slight problem and its not a real big deal, but the volume varies on each track. It might be that they werent mastered together.

The romance, writing, dialogue, sexual chemistry, & emotional involvement were tepid. About half of the story was spent on heroine's feelings for her fiancé & her r/s with him.

I'm on line searching for some clear instructions to go with this clock as the ones that came with it are no help at all and there is nothing intuitive about setting the clock or the alarm . . . or the radio for that matter. This was a gift for my four-year-old son, and it looks great in his room, but we have had it for almost a year and have never been able to use it as intended.

There's no way my 5-year-old can. And for him, he'll just hit the cones and change something and then you have to reset everything.Also, with the radio, it's not AM, only FM, despite the description. And there are no presets or even an indicator of what channel you're on. All you have is a Scan button. Hope you don't miss the channel you were looking for.This is just a very poorly designed clock.

It's very hard to set even for an adult (and I'm pretty technology proficient). My son can't set it at all. And as the other review says, if you hit any of the cones, it messes up the clock, even if you are just trying to snooze it or turn on/off the alarm. We also can't get the radio to come in very well and you can only seek in one direction to set the radio so if you want a particular station and miss it, you have to go all the way around again.

She chooses one of two paths, the Tradition of the Sun or Moon to lead her to her great awakening. The learns and finds her Soul Mate and through sex she is able to become one with the earth, or something like that. This book is just a philosophy lecture thinly disguised as a novel. Unlike The Alchemist, which I liked because of its fable-like storytelling, I found this book to be dull, with one long lecture about the mysteries of the universe after another. The outcome of Brida's journey was left incredibly vague, leaving me with the feeling of not understand what just happened there. There were some interesting parts, like when Brida delves into a past life, and that part redeemed the book a little. But on the whole I wouldn't recommend it unless you really like being preached at for 200 pages."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brida","review":"I haven't read the book yet, but it arrived quickly and in great condition.

Sometimes during reading I thought it to be very outrageous, but after some time, I thought it to be so funny that I wanted to laugh and started comparing it to Lord of the rings or anything extremely unlikely to be true... I give it one star because the author claims everything is real and until now I haven't seen a point of light above the left shoulder of my husband, so he is not my other half...

My critical thoughts about the universe somewhat depend on him...his analogies and his theories.I find Brida a result of deep paring of layers of secrets-within-secrets of the paranormal realities of love and romance. Anyone who is interested in such themes will not be able to put the book down until he/she has read the end. And when you finally have, you can't stop thinking about it:\\"What is the reality of the unreal?\\"\\"What if all this is true?\\"\\"What if the woman next doors is a Brida??\\"This book gives wings and direction to the madness in me.

Compared to his other books, I was expecting something engaging, moving and metapohrical. This book was predictable, slow, and quite uninteresting. It felt as though he was trying hard to get across a personal philosophy and in so doing, forgot to employ his usual engaging and lyrical writing. It felt contrived, literal and obvious. Frankly, I never finished the book and didn't (still don't) feel like I missed something or was left hanging.In part, it could have been the narrator (I purchased the book on CD) whose voice and interpretation was rather uninspired. That said, there was little about the character of Brida that made me want to know her story or care about what was happening to her.If, like me, you want to read/listen to all the books of a favourite author, consider borrowing from the library instead -"},{"rating":"2","title":"A treasure!","review":"I loved this book!

It is difficult to discuss the book since the movie has become so famous. I saw the movie first and, although I thought it was flawed, it was still a remarkable piece of filmmaking - especially the first half. Everything that was great about the film came directly from the book.I imagine a lot of people take Fight Club as their bible. I don't think that even Palahniuk feels that way. Tyler Durden doesn't really have a consistent philosophy to live one's life; if we needed to hunt elk through Rockefeller Center, that would be just as stifling as having to work in an office for a living.What makes Fight Club a great novel is that it taps into something we have all felt. Modern society has made everything corporate. Authentic experience is getting harder and harder to come by. We lose our soul working jobs we hate to earn money to buy things that we don't need."},{"rating":"2","title":"THIS IS THE BOOK","review":"This is a page for reviewing the BOOK.

It's more obvious in the book than in the movie version that the whole thing about monkeywrenching the consumer culture was Marla's idea. And a danm good idea too. I can't believe anybody had the nerve to make a film about this inflammatory concept. The censors are all worried about copycat fight clubs, but how about copycat culture jamming?"},{"rating":"2","title":"A brilliant book honored by the movie","review":"I've seen Fight Club-the movie and immediately got hold of the book. I have to say, good as the book is, Fincher does more than an adequate job of capturing the spirit, the madness, the humor and has even added a kinetic energy that compliments the book in every way. It's one of the best realizations of a book's theme I've ever encountered. Then there's the ending... I loved how Mr Palahniuk left that dark and open-ended in the book, and that's why his novel will serve as the ultimate nihilistic statement. Chilling."},{"rating":"2","title":"Astounding","review":"This book was terrific. It is one of my favorite books of all time. It was weird and action packed. I really liked this book.

The narrator is an everyman, trapped in a consumer culture that defines his personal worth and capabilities. His dissent into rebellion, is the fall of modern man, but also the most human element of his existence. The protagonist justifies his anarchic ways like Camus' judge-penitent. His Beaudelarian voyage sails on a beautiful flower-bed of evil until this deceptive odyssey empties into an abyss of man's infernal condition. But before our Virgil takes his fateful plunge, he makes sure to take a piece of heaven with him, to help cushion his fall. An empowering and regenerating read.

But when I read the book, I was impressed at how much detail Palahniuk was able to inject in such a short space. I'm not usually fond of \\"postmodern fiction\\" like William S. Burroughs, late J.G. Ballard, or - God help us - annoying crap like Kathy Acker, Mark Lehrner or anything written by anyone who graduated with an MFA from Brown University and got published by Grove or Vintage. But this is the rare novel where the style works - partially because the storyline itself is so strong and Palahniuk avoids sounding \\"literary\\" or pretentious. This is possibly the best example of the avant-garde, underground style ever produced. And it's very funny."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not just cool, insightful, too","review":"I, like many of my peers, read the book AFTER seeing the movie, and was not at all disappointed.

The movie wins. Unfortunately, Palahniuk's writing style is stream-of-consciousness not done well. If I hadn't already seen the movie, I would have had a difficult time keeping up with what was going on in the book.Basically, this feels more like a book that is trying to hard to be stylish and cutting edge.I can only suggest this book as a counterpart piece to the movie AFTER you've watched the movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"fightclub","review":"this book is about a very messed up man, i think he is a scitco. the is the founder of a cult that is called fight club. the club therns into something out of control prject mayham. this group gets out of control and starts to distroy and build a army. this is a great book"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fight Club book","review":"I was very satisfied with the quality of this product and the fast shipping.

Readers rarely enjoy movie adaptations over their literary counterparts, but I would be shocked to meet someone who enjoys the book more than the movie. Fight Club is not a book. It is a screenplay. Palahniuk over uses commas. The commas prohibit the reader from ever establishing a coherent flow to enjoy the book. Nothing annoys me more than fragments and poor grammar.I had such high hopes for this book. Fight Club, the movie ranks as one of my all time favorites. The book disappoints on every level except on a few insightful observations of the society we live in. However, don't expect these insights to be eye-opening revelations. Chuck manhandles them in such a crude and shallow manner that it undermines any brutish charm it may have had."},{"rating":"2","title":"A book before its time","review":"Fight Club is one of the most amazing novels that I have ever read. Palahniuk's dark and twisted vision of relief brought upon by underground fighting matches is brilliantly written and will surely be studied like Vonnegut or Faulkner in post high school English courses in five or six years. A great book by a great up-in-coming author - an experience everyone should have."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book!!","review":"The book Fight Club is wonderful! Not a lot of people know that the movie, made in 1999, was actually based off the book. As an avid movie watcher and reader I really appriciated the fact that the movie was very similar to the book.

An odd and pointless way to view life, but the abstract truths that the book eludes to are much brighter than the dark overtones of the narrator.

A must read for anyone who has ever questioned the norm or wondered how things would be different with a change in societal norms."},{"rating":"2","title":"a thought-provoking book","review":"For those of you who have never seen the movie, this book is a disturbing portrait of a narrator who begins to express his natural instincts and, before he realizes it, is terrified by what he has become a part of, leading up to a twist that you never saw coming.For those of you that have seen the movie, yes, it does translate well into book form. There is much more psychological introspection and more recurrence of themes (such as the line \\"look up into the stars and you're gone\\"). There is also a bit of an extended ending that wraps things up nicely.Overall, the book is a challenging read, but ultimately very satisfying. As far as contemporary literature goes, this is one of the best in my opinion."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good, but highly, HIGHLY overrated.","review":"There were elements that I liked about \\"Fight Club\\", both the book and the film. The film was stylisticly beautiful and the book was more philosophicaly insightful, but if only the sparks of light in the book and film had somehow come together. I liked the idea of exploring masculinity and femininity and \\"feminisation\\" (and especially the gay/homoerotic subtext that was cleverly and subtly touched upon in the film), but I don't see the connection between THAT and \\"project mayhem\\" and anarchy. It went from something that started off as a witty and insitefull look at men and feminism, to something that made very little sense at all."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fight Club","review":"Okay, who else wants to start their a Fight Club?

My reaction to both book and film are also nearly identical: They are both works of mind-blowing originality and fantastic execution and I did not enjoy either of them much at all.

Sort of a yuppie \\"Clockwork Orange,\\" without the Beethoven. That Palahniuk can thread together all the angst, anxiety and repressed desire that surfaces in this novel is impressive. It may not be the \\"best\\" novel of the year, but it most likely will prove to be one of the most provocative.Palahniuk said recently in the SF Chronicle that this novel arose from his frustrations at having his first manuscript unceremoniously rejected. Hence, at certain levels the novel becomes quite self-reflexive, commenting on the authorial process. A lot of his meditations on fascism and authoritarianism seem less reactionary in this light. (Anyone interested in this strain of thought should see Greil Marcus' \\"Lipstick Traces.\\")All in all, highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"It is awesome","review":"Chuck writes deeper than I can think.

I would've given it 5 stars if I didn't already know what was going to happen. I won't recap the story here-it is something that should be experienced by you, and I don't want to give anything away. I will say that I wished I had read it before I saw the movie. There are differences between the book and the movie. I really enjoyed the writing style. Short, choppy sentences that hit you like a machine gun. I'd recommend you read this whether or not you've seen the movie. It is a great read.

NOW!!!","review":"If there is one thing to say it is this: Not only should you read Fight Club, but you should also read Chuck Palahniuk's other books. These books are Choke, Survivor, and Invisible Monsters(As of this date: (...).If you have just seen the film, you should still read this book. The film and the book differ a lot in some places.

They express their rage beating each others up in underground fighting club. Later the whole thing evolved into a more elobarate terrorist plot. The story is told by the narrator whose job is to apply the formula (is it cheaper to organize a recall or to indemnify the victims) for a large car company.It is a very powerful book, although a little strange. I don't think anybody would like it, in particular I don't think many women would. If you are seen the film, there are many significant differences."},{"rating":"1","title":"I didn't get this one","review":"I started reading Fight Club with high expectations, but never really got to grips with it. I found it amoral, and lacking in humour. It also takes swipes at modern (American) society without suggesting any alternative but a rather primitive response, namely responding with mindless violence, destruction and the creation of mayhem. I give it two stars because Palahniuk can clearly write well, but the whole theme of the book just put me off. And this is not because I particulary dislike books that contain violence and anti-social behaviour- I loved Burgess' brilliant A Clockwork Orange, for instance. I think the absence of humour put me off this book more than anything else."},{"rating":"2","title":"Haiku Review","review":"A Haiku Review of Fight Club by Chuck PalahniukListen Space MonkeyHis Name was Robert PaulsonAnd then there's Tyler..."},{"rating":"2","title":"surreal","review":"I wish I knew more about the philosophy and beliefs that surrounded the basis of this book, because I thought, though they were somewhat insane and disturbing, that they were fascinating.

I would tell you about the rest of it, but I don't want to give it away. I recently read this book, after first seeing the movie. The movie was a good try at translating the book to film. As is usually the case, the book is even better than the movie though. I really like Chuck Palahniuk's style of writing a lot - it's to the point. No flowery prose here.My only downside to reading this was that I saw the movie first, which prevented me from forming my own view of the characters - I kept picturing Brad Pitt, Ed Norton, Helena Bonham Carter, and Meat Loaf. I guess I'll have to go read Chuck Palahniuk's other books before they make movies of them. So if you haven't seen the movie, read this first."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good book","review":"This was a great book to read. After seeing the movie and enjoying it, I wanted to read the book since books are usually better than the movie. This theory was upheld, as the book was not a disappointment. I look forward to reading Palahniuk's other books."},{"rating":"2","title":"Much Better, and Different, Than the Movie","review":"While the actual film might've been too much for the masses to take, this book is even more so. I wish I had read the book before the movie, because it was interesting to see how things had changed from paper to celluloid. The screenwriter of the film, Jim Uhls, did a fine job adapting the story, but because much of the material was terribly contorversial, it had to be toned down. This book is terrific is you love scathing satire and terrific and past-paced storytelling. Palahniuk's way of telling the story is mesmerizing. It intrigued me to see how he broke up how the narrator thought and how we reacted to situations. This only helps to set up the great story line and the terrific climax. In short, nothing in this book is a cop-out or meant to be offensive. It is simply a satire of how we live our daily lives. This novel is terrific from start to finish, and much better than the movie, if you can believe that."},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT MODERN SATIRE","review":"'Normal' life is sliced apart with great precision. This book is a rarity in that it will make you think, not about others lives, but your own. No small achievment.

I didn't see it coming! Which is high praise indeed."},{"rating":"2","title":"better than the movie","review":"It's rare that I ever read a book after seeing the film it was based on, but I couldn't resist after I saw Palanhiuk's FIGHT CLUB on the big screen.

Palahniuk's unorthodox and no holds barred writing style make Fight Club a gem that will leave an indelible impression on you, whether you like it or not.Fight Club makes you put on your thinking cap and won't let you take it off. Palahniuk's black humor is razor sharp as it cuts deeply into our materialistic values and societal norms that we hold dear. His message - we think we own our posessions, job, and lifestyle, but in reality, they own us.Anyone who needs a wake up call that will make you rethink your life's priorities, order Fight Club. I give it my full 5 stars and recommend it to everyone - it is undoubtedly the most original and provocative book of the 90's."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent look at post modern society","review":"Chuck Palahniuk is on his way to becoming a writer of the 21st century. A disturbing look at society today follows that of an insomniac suffering depression. He finds salvation and doom in that of Tyler Durden, a soap making outcast who forms a club with the insomniac. Fight Club where men beat each other fist to fist in raw matches testing one's strength. This book is dark, unflinching, and breaks all barriers of what would happen in our society if it were to break down. The fight club eventually elevates beyond the men's control and becomes a nationwide movement. This is probably one of the best books ever written. I can't wait for David Fincher's film."},{"rating":"2","title":"A MUST READ FOR INTELLIGENT GROWNUPS","review":"A wonderful book - but pretty unnerving to read in these post-Columbine times. Palahniuk is obviously a very gifted writer. He gives us all this amazing, surrealistic imagery; palpable rage; a taught, well-crafted story. I'll definitely see the movie and look forward to future books. Two questions for the author, though: 1) Why the gimmicky ending? It seemed totally unnecessary and contrived. 2) Are you aware that there is no such thing as a Cadillac Corniche? Corniche is a Rolls Royce nameplate. Oh, yeah, one more thing: unless I missed something, I believe that the book was set in Chicago(?) There would not be a street with an NE in the address (like NE Paper Street). Also, Meigs Field is for private planes only. None of this is meant as criticism - I read EVERY WORD of this book, and details other than these just seemed so perfect."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing!","review":"This one's a winner, through and through...I read it in one sitting with nary a notice of the outside world.

Too many stories seem to be re-worked versions of things we've read before; after all, how many truly new things are there under the sun? Palahniuk, however, has created something new and it is both interesting and fun to read.\\"Fight Club\\" follows a disengaged young professional whose life is sliding meaninglessly by until he meets a man about his age who is his polar opposite, capturing each moment of life. The two strike up a friendship and a club that pits other disengaged young men in fights against one another. They strike a chord and events spiral.

I was very excited after hearing about how everyone raves about this novel. Wow what a lie! This book has to be one of the most falsely hyped novels I have ever read. This book was very boring and predictable. I honestly don't see why everyone thinks this is some kind of genius novel. I have read other books by this author and this would not be classified as the best one for me. I seriously think it must be some kind of male thing where all the men think it is pure brilliance because of the concept of starting a fight club. Well to that I say big whoop! That is not something innovative and this book was hardly thought provoking. the only thing I will give kudos to the novel for is the hinting towards questioning the fabric of our society and what it constitutes to be human in America and what might possibly happen if someone were to suddenly stop caring so much."},{"rating":"2","title":"fight club","review":"Fight club is a very exciting book it has lots of action in it and its definitely a guys book. Its about 2 guys who start a fight club in there basement. Now people go there to learn how to fight then they go and fight each other and who ever loses they don't get to come back.

Even then, I don't think it's so much that the movie was BETTER, but the book just works better as a movie. It plays out nicer. The book stayed right on par with the movie and only a few tiny events were changed.If you don't know the premise, fight club is about a guy who shall forever remain nameless. He can't sleep at night, so he goes to support groups for diseases and problems he doesn't have. He meets a woman named Marla Singer and they form a hate-hate relationship. Then the guy meets a man named Tyler and his entire life changes. He goes from a condo filled with IKEA furniture to a crack-house reject of a house.He forms a club called Fight Club with Tyler.

Fight Club was and still is one of those stories you'll never forget. The one thing I love about the book is the contrast it has to the movie. With the movie, David Fincher took certian liberites with how the story played out. Chuck's original was definitely the more intriguing of the two. :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Crazy Story","review":"First of all, I would not recommend this book to anyone who has seen the movie; they are very similar and in the deifferences, I think the movie did a better job.

The story is a fascinating analysis of a generation that has no cause and people who collectively need to find a fatherly figure."},{"rating":"2","title":"I am Jack's Total and Complete Admiration","review":"You simply CANNOT go wrong with Fight Club. If you read one Chuck book in your life, let it be this one. Then, read Invisible Monsters.

READ THIS FIRST!","review":"I enjoyed this book immensely, although I'm sure I could have liked it alot more if I hadn't watched the movie first. Sure, the movie is great, and it compliments the book well, but Fight Club is a book that needs to surprise you. I'm a huge fan of Palahnuik's writing, and I love the way he twists the plot and inserts little bits of useless information into the storyline, but if you've seen the movie, you pretty much know what's going to happen next. Some of the quotations are word for word, and although the ending's different (better, in my opinion), you might find yourself disappointed that you know what's going to happen.That being said, read the book whether or not you've seen the cinematic adventure. It's a brilliant piece of writing, especially if you love Chuck, and it's definitely worth reading. But if you have the option of digesting one medium of the story before the other, read the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"WOW!","review":"Fight Club is simply a fantastic book, and has now become one of my favorites. Chuck Palahniuk writes dialogue so amazingly well and Fight Club has so many memorable lines you'll find yourslef repeating them long after you've put this book down. The Fight Club book is very close to the David Fincher Movie and is an extremely enjoyable to read either before or after seeing the movie. When they go back and look at the top books of our time Fight Club will certainly be on that list!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Unique Snowflake-A bible of self destruction.","review":"Fight Club is an intense and querky read. Palahniuk captivates the reader through the inventive flashback that the majority of the novel is told through. The narrator, Jack, is a great character in a pro-longed downward spiral whilst Tyler Durden is a personification of the anarchaic spirit in all of us. The dialogue is full of brilliant phrases that stay with you afterwards. It is deliberatly provocative and in my opinion, is a Clockwork Orange for the modern era. All the ideas and themes are thought provoking(in many ways similar to the film 'American Beauty')and whilst not for all tastes, a must read. It has references to varios things, and the inventive style makes it impossible to put down. A bible of self destruction."},{"rating":"2","title":"Deserving of some consideration","review":"I made the mistake of watching the movie before reading the book which is, of course, never a good idea. What I, and Hollywood, missed the first time around was Palahniuk's final chapter. FIGHT CLUB is far too smart to take itself as seriously as it seems to, and in the end it lets the reader in on the joke. This final wink was what redeemed the book for me. Palahniuk twists the narrative to indicate how Durden's followers are every bit as brainwashed as the capitalistic society they hate so much. The result seems to be in conclusion with Orwell's 1984, that buying into ANY philosophy wholesale is dangerously foolish. However, while Orwell's theme seems critically pointed Palahniuk's is somewhat dulled and ambiguous. His own love of the characters he has created seems to cloud the vision of the book, but what reader can blame an author for that fault?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Quick and Easy","review":"This book took me about four hours to read. It was well-worth the time I invested. The theme of males being lost in the new world order in which females have increasingly more and more control is a valid theme. Men may have ruled the earth for centuries, but now that women are taking their role in society, men have problems finding theirs, especially since it is no longer necessary for them to be providers. So what if the men deal with this by beating the crap out of each other?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Generation X's first classic","review":"I bought this book around two weeks before the film made its debut and I have read it three times since. Palahniuk creates a perfect satire of the emptiness young men feel and the vain attempts to fill the void with anything from furniture and exotic mustard to brawling and attempting and overthrow of society. And the refreshing thing is that unlike American Psycho, this novel is more subdued and focused on the story as opposed to the gory details. Having worked in a soulless office setting for three years before finding a job I love, I empathized heavily with the narrator. A must read for anyone under 40 who feels the world passed them over. The last chapter alone for me was beautiful and brilliant. Those final three pages are worth the price of purchase"},{"rating":"1","title":"If you liked the movie, you may not like the book","review":"Fight Club the book is similar in style to the movie; strange and enigmatic. The storyline is virtually identical to the movie, which shows how faithfully the movie followed the book. Unfortunately, the book was not very compelling to read and the strangeness became tedious after a while. If you have not seen the movie, the book may be a revelation. However, if you have seen the movie, the characters may appear crudely drawn."},{"rating":"2","title":"How does he do it?","review":"Years ago, I was in a writing class with Palahniuk. We all brought 7 pages every Wednesday for the group to critique, led by a master, Tom Spanbauer. During the months, Chuck was reading Fight Club to us all. Well, I was humbled. Chuck was/is a true genius and I sat back wondering \\"where the heck did he come up with that?\\" Besides his writing excellence, he is a profoundly good critic, gentle in his comments and understanding of the writer's angst. I have followed his career with more than just a little interest. I believe this is his classic. I guess Hollywood did too. Anyway, it was my honor to be involved and had steered me to who I am now.

Although it is not very long, it is much denser than most novels out there. The most enjoyable thing about it is the unique (to me) style of writing. I suppose it was written as a narrative in the second person (i.e. everybody is referred to as 'you').Fight Club is very scathingly witty, and contains many gems which you might find yourself quoting after you finish. Surprisingly enough, I enjoyed the movie more than I did the book, but the book is definately worth your time."},{"rating":"2","title":"OH MY GOD","review":"This book was quite possibly the best I've ever read. I am a sophmore in high school and haven't read anything that made me want to finish a book in over 2 years. I got fight club at nine A.M and finished it within i hours.

It's a firecracker of a premise, and the film (which, to be fair, I must admit I saw first, which may present some bias) takes all the best parts of the book and gives them visuals, which Palahniuk's prose fails in most cases to do. The plots differ in some ways. Without the theme, this book review would rate the novel with one star; the ideas about manhood and culture, etc. give it another star. The movie gets five stars. Watch the movie and then read the book, just to get the whole experience."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome!","review":"The movie, amazing;the book, a masterpiece;after reading the book, you see what the movie was trying to do,granted i think the movie did a good job, but the book was amazing, there's so much more detail, it has more of the love story element that the movie left out, it's has so much more of a grunge feel and it really makes you think;it ends differently than the movie, and i'm not sure which ending i like better, but i love them both.if you're a Chuck fan or a Fight Club fan, get this book.s'all i have to say"},{"rating":"2","title":"First Rule about Fight Club is no one talks about Fight Club","review":"Okay, so maybe I'm breaking the rules, but I can't help it. You have to talk about this novel after you have read it because there are so many issues that Palahniuk explores, it's tough to keep up with them all. This is really a fantastic book that deserves a number of readings to get to the heart of. My particular favourite section is Chapter 6 describing what fight club means to a generation of men raised by women. Fantastic stuff."},{"rating":"2","title":"Big one","review":"What can I say more the typical \\"this is your life and it is ending one minute at a time\\"? I love this kind of narrative style, but what makes the book so special (apart from the mentioned style) is the philosophical message it carries. I was too young when I saw the movie, but when you get a mainstream job, you clearly feel in in your flesh: you are not special. So accept it and let things happen. Obviously, there is no need to follow Tyler's path and set up a fight club. People just need to focus and follow their own nature. Discard whatever that makes you pain, retain whatever that makes you happy, and that's the whole message."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book,","review":"Not like other books, this book pulls you under water right at the begining and pulls you out at the end gasping for air. The way Chuck P. writes this book is so different then all other authors. I don't usually read and this book got me back to reading."},{"rating":"2","title":"C'mon...Just try it.","review":"The most frequent complaint I've heard about this book is that its too short. Well, lemme tell you something...Long Books Get Old. I don't care if you've read a solid gold, Godfatheresque book, at some point during your reading you lost interest, if only for a fleeting second. I won't lie, I went through that fleeting moment in Fight Club, but believe you me...it was very freaking fleeting, man. Very, very fleeting. Very. This book's genius is in its conciseness, and in the end you will think, \\"Damn. How did Chuck do that in so few pages?\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Because you owe it to yourself.","review":"The main reason for reading this book...because you owe it to yourself. This is a beautifuly written peice in which the usual unmelodic tone of our culture is conviniantly tossed aside. The narrarator, along with his \\"sidekick\\", ushers the reader through an examination of his or hers on life. Maybe the books success should be measured in the time spent by the readers as they try to make amends with their own pshycotic minds. And after all, Socrates himself says \\"the unexamined life is not worth living.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Save me from the neo-anarchists","review":"For the first (and hopefully last) time I have to say \\"I liked the movie better than the novel\\". The movie was more clever, and the actors made the dialog pop.I wonder about those reviewers who said the book was \\"revolutionary\\", \\"thought provoking\\", and \\"new\\". I direct their attention to any Nihilist scribblings of the last century.Fight Club offers no new insite into human nature, mob mentality, or philosophy/psychology; those that have some self-proclaimed epiphany after reading this book need to get a life and expand their reading horizons.At it's best, Fight Club, is scathingly funny, dark and morbid. At it's worst, it's highly over rated by chest-beating testosterone-driven man-children."},{"rating":"2","title":"addicting","review":"when u read this you are drown into it. the book is very well written and i have no complaints on it. the only down side about this is that it took so long to get in the mail but that's standard shipping for u"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent book","review":"Should be a real wake-up call to all men.

A mindless consuming taxpayer is not our destiny."},{"rating":"2","title":"A sacred, unique snowflake of special unique specialness.","review":"Here's a word to describe the pervasive resonance this story has enjoyed.Confrontational.Fight Club is a pugnacious challenge to examine your life, in the form of a blunt instrument. If you want to get peoples attention these days, best be prepared to bludgeon them upside the head. We the ADD generations have no time for study and meditation. You have 5 seconds to deliver the message in an original and exciting way. Check and check.Take a massively concentrated answer to the existential dilemma, throw in a couple themes of timely relevence, a sense of urgency, twisted humor and wrap up the whole enchilada in a transgressional tortilla and voila! A quintessential 90's literary masterpiece. Fight Club is the successor to Clockwork Orange.\\"This is your life, and it's ending one minute at a time\\"Consider yourself challenged."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent book!","review":"One of the greatest book I ever read!.Either you have seen the movie or not, you ought to give a look at it.You won't regret it."},{"rating":"2","title":"FIght Club I saw the movie first","review":"I saw fight club on TV before I even knew it was a book, and when I started reading it I thought knowing the ending would ruin the book. But it was the complete opposite. I liked the book even more because I was able to pick on little details I would have only seen on a re-read. The movie and the book are very similar because it's a short book, so not much had to be cut out.I would highly recommend this book, Chuck Palahniuk has an interesting writing style where he will start with the end of a chapter and then use the rest of the chapter explain how they got there. The other notable thing about Chuck's writing style is the dialogue, and how important quote marks are, people will think something while having a conversation and then move right on to saying something else and its easy to get lost with something someone said and what they thought. Other than that a great quick read that's fascinating."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fight Club, Book of the Century?","review":"Not only is this book well written, but it makes you think and i also saw the movie 5 times. It's constructed and put together very brilliantly and Chuck Palahniuk is a talented writer. I seriously think that everybody should a least rent the movie and watch it about 3 times. Some things they say are unforgettable and it's a great script all together. I would be lying if I said it didn't deserve 5 stars. It's just flat out great."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a disappointment!","review":"Perhaps I was expecting too much from this novel after reading all the glowing reviews.

Hopefully, his other novel, Survivor , will be a better read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring and sick","review":"This book bored me and I can't believe the movie was much better.

It just has one stupid idea and it beats it to death. The main theme is that you're not a consumer if you get into fights. Who told this guy he could write? It seems like he wrote this in a week."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible peice of hypocrisy","review":"This book and movie are ludicrous. Chuck P. sufferfrom the same disease that hacks like Bret Easton Ellis and his ilk suffer from. He glorifies what he purports to condem. In this case, male violence. The scary thing is that this book and movie are reaching the ignorant, who see only this glorification and miss the terror that lies at the heart of this awful book. Further, the book masquerades as a rebellion against our capitalist and money-drive society, but what did the author do but allow this to be made into a high budget movie, that exists only as a result of the ideas that the book is rebelling against. If you want to see a real literary account of the violent side of man's nature read the masterpiece _Blood Meridian_ by Cormac McCarthy. This is slick trash hipped up for an ignorant reading audience."},{"rating":"1","title":"Big Jocks","review":"\\"Fight Club\\" is a great book if you are a big jock who likes to flex your muscles all of the time. The plot is about a self-help club with a lot of guys who want to liberate themselves from Swedish furniture by pounding on each other with their fists. \\"Fight Club\\" is an ad that celebrates physical fitness and looks down on those who don't quite fit a certain fashionable physical profile. And all of this is said in the name of non-conformism. But wait! What's more conformist than the belief that working out in a gym and sweating like a pig makes you a better person? \\"Fight Club\\"'s jock-fascism is jockalicious.There's also a latent homoeroticism in the book. The narrator says that he \\"wants Tyler\\" and he has a fantasy about Tyler lifting heavy logs. That's fine, except that the book pretends to be ultra-macho hetero.Anyway, it's a great book for jocks, folks!I apologize for my poor writing skills, but English is not my first language."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Book I've EVER Read","review":"I couldn't even bear to finish this book. I kept thinking throughout the book, how was this published? If Mr. Palahniuk had taken out all the fluff he added, the book would have been half the size. It's boring, stupid, the author has an amazing talent to make this book that has a half decent plot, into the worst piece of literature I've ever read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good but Movie was better!","review":"This is the first book I ever read in which the movie based on it was better. The book was just too choppy, your here then your there. The movie took the plot and made it tighter. The best way to put it is the book is like a first draft, and the movie is the final draft. But without the book and the ideas behind it, there would be no movie,so I give it 4 stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"brilliant and innocent in style and delivery","review":"this book was worth the read and made me just love all the stupid things I ever did for no reason other than to feel like a snow flake.

Boy, was I disappointed. It wasn't my cup of tea at all.In my opinion, the writing wasn't good. The author didn't make me want to care about anyone in the story (perhaps his intent); the characters simply were not developed; the story didn't grab me in and I should have quit reading after the first chapter.

I just didn't get it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great read","review":"The movie is my all time favorite, so I had VERY high expectations from the book.It almost, just almost, met them all.I won't ruin it for you, but I believe it's a matter of imprinting.

Filled with dark humor and even a bit of sarcasm, this book would actually be humorous if it wasn't based on the story of one of the 20th Century's true tragedies.

Her writing is not creative, not funny, the plot lacks action, magic and wit. Everything goes very easy in this book and I found it was VERY, VERY, VERY long-winded. The action comes only at, guess what Chapter 6! Yada-yada-yada for 5 chapters and a prologue, until finally something remotely dangerous pops up. The ending also falls short. Micol's spells do not rhyme throughout the book and my guess is that she got so fed up she resorted to 'The Power of Three will set us free!' On TV, that spell would prove a good change. In the book, it was tacky and boring. She tries to spice things up with a 'Wyatt power boost' but that fell short too. The demon hardly showed any powers and sounded more like a grouchy, grumpy dad who found the thief that stole his china. Sigh... What happened to great Charmed?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Changeling Characters?","review":"When baby Wyatt starts acting strangely after spending time in day care, Piper suspects something is seriously wrong.

Piper doesn't worry about Wyatt using his powers in day care, and, when they discover the deception, Leo, who does little but moralize about the dilemma working mothers face, seems barely concerned.My main problem with this book is that everything is a little too easy. The sisters have no problem finding the elfin village, and the demons they vanquish barely put up a fight. The Elders, strangely enough to viewers of the series, even offer helpful information!Still, it's a short book and may satisfy your Charmed appetite when the show is in reruns."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent introduction to Taoism.","review":"This book is an excellent overall introduction to Taoism.

A broad, objective, easy to digest primer for Westerner's interested in learning about the Taoist tradition. My contention lies in Two Bears review of this work...I applaud any effort to present clarity of subject matter...however, Two Bears review strikes me as a bit rash. The errors pointed out by the reviewer regarding Ms. Wong's presentation of Taoist internal alchemy are mistaken in most cases.Ultimately it seems that Two Bears is simply looking to build a name and repuatation for him/herself by positing his/her own presentation of meridian theory as superior to a long time, well respected practitioner of Taoist studies/practices."},{"rating":"1","title":"Uninspiring book - but at least it's short","review":"This book looks like it was written from a bunch of lecture notes and encyclopedia excerpts - without any kind of personal input.

There is a lot of Chinese people out there seeking to cash in on the Western interest in Taoism. Due to the \\"Cultural Revolution\\", being of Chinese nationally is no longer a guarantee of knowledge of Chinese Culture, as most modern Chinese know little of Ancient Culture because the Communists where so effective in wiping it out. Her book covers an extremely broad overview of Taoism with almost no citations. I cannot know how many errors and assumtions she makes in her book, but as far has her information on Ba kua zhang and internal martial arts in general, I would not trust a word she has to say. I suspect that she is coming from a Post-Communist \\"Wu shu\\" perpective that has very little creditality with tradional Chinese martial artists.

She also seems to spend much more time than is necessary (or appropriate) complaining about the food at rescue sites; you'd think there'd be some form of 'professional courtesy' among volunteers, but in any case, it's not of interest to the reader who buys a book hoping to learn about animal rescue, not cuisine.

It is even possible to flash the firmware on a k750i and make it identical to a w800i. The cases of the k750i and w800 are also interchangable.

I've already replaced one memory stick and any MP3's that you want to play will drain the battery to where the charge will not last the entire day. I've also had problems with the phone reading the memory card in which I always turn it on and then off again. At one point the phone wouldn't turn back on, so I had to remove the battery and figure out why the battery wasn't working. Aside from that any pictures or videos that you want to shoot, make sure the subject is only a few feet away or the quality will be poor. For a $500 phone, I'm not impressed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Phone with two cons to consider","review":"Others have done a great service of noting the pros of this phone: great mp3 handling, excellent 2mp camera, etc.I would rate this phone 5 except for these cons:1) Volume while using it as a handset is very low. This is not a problem if you use a bluetooth or corded headset. The speakerphone feature is excellent.2) The camera shutter button is on the side of the phone and turns on the camera even if the phone's keys are locked. Sony informed me there is no way to disable this switch. If you carry your phone in a pocket it may switch on without your knowledge.It is a beautiful looking phone and if you can live with the above you will be very happy. A great blend of 2mp digital camera, good sized mp3 player, great radio & an excellent phone. Contacts can be synched nicely with outlook. File transferring is similar to a flash drive. The phone also attracts attention with it's bright orange case & Walkman logo. This phone beats out the other mp3 capable phones."},{"rating":"2","title":"SOOOO GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOD","review":"This phone is so good!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I like it so much. It works like a computer, with it you dont't need a palm top. I recomend it for you if you are a teen because the MP3 it's so good you can have up to 150 musics. If you are a adult because it has an organizer with alrms, calendas, tasks. notes,calculator and it comes with a USB cable to synchrnize with your PC or MAC and you can talk with it in other countrys.I recomend it for all, buy it"},{"rating":"1","title":"this w800 , disappiont me","review":"this w800 , disappoint meis worst cell that i bought.i take a beautiful pictures with de camera but when i am going to see they not here, i lost them.when i transfer the mp3 songs with the original software, this songs have a horrible noise between them.i am very disappoint with this cell(w800), now I am going to buy a k750 sony ericsson"},{"rating":"1","title":"Sony Ericsson W800i","review":"This is the most expensive phone I ever bought and the first one I didn't get from my phone provider.

Then they said I must have erased the software (how???) and to send it in for repair. They received the phone on March 18th but when I call they tell me they need 7 to 10 business days (15 business days already), they are waiting for parts or it's in the last stages of repair.Sony Ericsson should have replaced it with no questions asked."},{"rating":"1","title":"i love tina turner she my best singer in my life","review":"tina is very good and ilove her songs! that she sings all the time now than with ike her ex husbend! and she very good singer"},{"rating":"1","title":"Scam","review":"Don't get scammed.

If you are well advanced in your study of both cartooning and Flash and want to put together quality animation I'm sorry to say this book will be poor help.I bought the book shortly after it was published, went to the authors website and never went back to either.

Trim , January 1983 edition, is a textbook for students with already a good base in precalculus mathematics. The analytic geometry part consists of the plane or 2-dimensional one in pages 9 to 26 in the first chapter of the book and in pages 500-514 for the 3-dimensional part.From chapter 2 on Limits to Chapter 16 on Differential Equations it goes into Calculus mode. There are 2 Appendixes : Appendix A on Mathematical Induction and Appendix B on Determinants. Answers to Even-numbered Exercises are given at the back. An Index is also provided.The 16 chapters mean a development of 866 pages, including the exercises.The textbook carries a heavy emphasis on graphs and a lot of exercises for application even though the author provides many examples throughout the text.The text should be covered with diligence over a 2-semester period or 8 months ."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better and Better","review":"For some reason I kept deciding not to read this novel and its sequels, but I have been sucked in completely! They are like the novel that you read and want to know what happens after it's over. As the reader, you get to continue to follow Jamie and Ryan's journey as a couple. If you continue with the series it is more like a ridiculously long novel because each book picks up immediately where the last left off.I do agree with previous reviewers that Ryan as a character is a bit perfect, but I don't feel as if that takes anything away from the story. The more you read the more involved you become. Unfortunately, I've become so involved that I can't stop reading these fabulous stories!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Give me a break!","review":"This is the most heterosexual lesbian book I have ever read.

We hear enough about gay people in this world-lets not bring it into a perfectly good reading series. Not only did this book talk about andy being gay, but it also went into detail about him wanting to pursue a relationship with another guy, and talked about how he thought this one guy was hott and he was flirting with him and stuff.

It's in an awkward loaction on the body of the dryer but I suppose that couldn't be helped. In any event, its a very minor complaint.If you are in the market, I would highly recommend this hair dryer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great hair dryer","review":"Found this hair dryer at a Hilton, loved it so much I ordered it from Amazon my last day there.

It dries hair quickly without getting too hot. It's a bit heavy, but since it works so quickly, the weight does not bother me much. The only problem is that it's not very durable. I'm about to purchase my third one of these in about four years. The retractable cord is subject to fraying, or it may just stop retracting. Also, on the one I'm replacing, the screw that holds it open (\\"unfolded\\") popped out. It's stripped and won't go back in.

When my old Revlon finally bit the dust, I started my online hair dryer research and was amazed to learn that this great hair dryer was available at such a low price. I've had it about 6 weeks and it has completely lived up to my expectations. It keeps my thick medium-length slightly wavy frizzy hair looking sleek and sassy in 5-10 minutes. I still have to use a flatiron to get a really \\"finished\\" look most days, but I think that's just due to my hair's particular quirks and not because the hairdryer is inadequate. My only complaint is that it is rather heavy; I didn't notice it in the hotel, but now at home it does seem a bit weighty. Other than that, it's an exceptional dryer for the money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Works well but only for a while","review":"I bought this 5 months ago, and it croaked.

The best part about it was the retractable cord....next! Go for a brand name like Conair or Sasson. Their dryers last."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great dryer and love the folding handle!","review":"This is a great hair dryer. I love the retractable cord and the folding handle -- makes it great for travel. The 1875 watts of power dry the wet hair quickly and I don't have any frizz problems.

Not many folding full-size dryers out there. This RC-2 is absolutely the best hair dryer I've ever used. The ionic business is no gimmick. I have very fine blond hair and dryers usually leave it electrified, especially in cooler weather.

That's an uncommon feature, too.Buy this one!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Stopped working after 30 days!","review":"I bought this dryer because I tried one at a hotel and loved it.

The retracting feature on the cord failed within a couple of months. Andis warranty requires that the buyer pays for shipping it in, plus $6.50 to cover their handling.

When it did work, it dried my hair (thick & wavy) in about 5 minutes! I also loved the retractable cord. When unfolded, this is a full size hairdryer and it is weighty which I liked about it. However, it won't turn on less than 1 year after I got it. I have had previous hair dryers for years with no problems. This is not an expensive hair dryer so it was great while it lasted.

However, I wish I had with this blowdryer. I almost never review items and when I do, they are positive. But this is a first. This is the worst product Ive ordered on Amazon. A COMPLETE WASTE OF MONEY. Literally the worst blowdryer. Isn't it a travelling blowdryer? I took it to south america, a week after I'd bought it, and it overheated and shut off. Needed to wait to cool off. Now its been maybe 2 months? And it literally does not dry for more than 5 minutes because it over heats.HORRIBLE blow dryer. Seriously, do not waste your money.

I love this dryer and so glad I bought it. So nice."},{"rating":"1","title":"Could be better","review":"I expected more from this hair dryer after reading the reviews. It wasn't as powerful as I like and the opening for the air coming out seems to be larger than my last dryer, so it just goes all over the place instead of being more focused. The thing I'm most unhappy with is the cord. I always buy dryers that have the retractable cord because I can't stand having to deal with the cord getting wrapped around everything in my drawer. Every other dryer that I've had the cord goes all the way into the dryer just leaving the plug hanging out. This dryer has about a foot or more of cord still hanging. It is just a pain deal with the dangling cord while putting it in and out of the drawer every day. I'm still deciding if I should return it or not."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a compact dryer","review":"I purchased this dryer because I wanted a compact, easily portable dryer for travel & the idea of a retractable cord was appealing. It is NOT compact. In fact, it's quite large & I returned it because the high heat level was not hot enough. It isn't ergonomic & it's heavy. I ended up buying the Babylisspro TT Tourmaline Titanium Travel Dryer & I am thrilled with it. I have shoulder-length fine hair."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works great - but I'm a bit nervous...","review":"I'm nervous because even though this hair dryer dried my hair faster (you should blot before using it though), better and softer than the \\"typical\\" one that I'd been using, other reviewers have mentioned their ones shutting off and overheating, and I'm wondering how long mine will last. But I'll buy another one, should mine act up."},{"rating":"2","title":"My favorite","review":"I came across this hairdryer when I was staying in a hotel and I just loved it. I buy them 2 at a time because I abuse mine so much. For a compact dryer it really has a lot of power and that is what I need to style my hair. I do have to say they do wear out in like 4 months time but I probably use mine for about 20 minutes a day straight if not more. I tend to burn out the motor- and be careful because there has been a few times that when the motor burns out it has made an awful sound and started to smoke. But compared to many dryers I have tried many do not have the power behind it like this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a reliable choice","review":"We have owned three of these and none have been reliable. The first arrived with a cord that would not retract. Amazon replaced it and that one lasted one year before it failed. It sounded like broken bits of plastic were inside the fan so we stopped using it. We ordered another and it failed after 6 weeks. The fan speed on 'high' is about what you would get on 'low.' There seems to be a quality issue here that I advise you to stay away from."},{"rating":"1","title":"flawed","review":"My blow dryer broke after less than 3 weeks of sporadic use. I thought it was great at first, but was very disappointed that it broke so quickly."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as great as I thought it'd be","review":"After reading the other reviews for this product, I was sold on it. It sounded light and compact, and perfect as a Christmas gift for my mother. I knew immediately upon opening the package that I would not be able to give it to her. While it is not huge, it is not a small travel-sized blowdryer either.So I kept it for myself because the size is comparable to other blowdryers I have used. The thing that annoys me the most is the handle which is square and not super comfortable. The Off/Low/Medium/High switch is fickle too. It has to be directly on one of the settings or the blowdryer won't work. It's not a big problem, but it is an annoyance. Although the blowdryer dries my hair just fine, I wouldn't buy it again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome for Curly Hair!!","review":"I discovered this hair dryer when I stayed at the Hyatt and I found it online.

WOULD NOT RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT AT ALL."},{"rating":"2","title":"Andis Retractable Cord Blow Dryer","review":"I replaced a Conair with this model - the retractable cord feature was the main reason for the purchase, and I had 2 Conairs that broke within 2 years. So far, the cord has worked well, and I have to say my hair seems much softer and healthier after I blow-dry it with this dryer than it did with the Conair (that dryer was also ionic, but maybe not ceramic).

I read all the reviews and this one sounded like the best to me. Everyone raved about how great it peeled, but I figured....how much of a difference can there really be in a peeler. Let me tell you, there IS a difference. It is very very easy to use. It just glides along the vegetable and takes off thinner slices than my old peeler. It just seems so much easier to use. I can't compare it to the other new peelers, but I can tell you if you have an old peeler, do yourself a favor and get a new one.I almost bought the one with the aluminum handle because it looks so pretty, but decided being able to put it in the dishwasher was more important than looks. It's bigger than I expected, but it still feels good in my hand, and my husband likes the bigger size (since he gets stuck doing most of the peeling).

I will say it is very SHARP and has a nice long handle but my praise ends there. Every 3rd stroke or so peels get clogged between the blade and the side, making peeling VERY slow going.

She is 9 years old.The sole is sturdy and looks durable, but that's about it.I really couldn't believe the low quality of these boots for this brand.Not worth the price when you can get the same quality and/or much better for much less.This was my 1st experience with kids 9 West, so, I don't know if all of their kids shoes are not up to the same qualities as the adult line."},{"rating":"2","title":"Let's check it, first","review":"I agree that Acclaim has disappointed in the past with it's wrestling games (i.e. WWF Attitude and the ECW games, which just used the Attitude engine); however, seeing how this game is supposed to be for the PS2, I would imagine that they have revamped their engine for wrestling games. Especially since it's going to include some of the all-time greats, as well as the create-a-stencil feature. I'll check out this game when it comes out first, and just may be the deciding factor that makes me sell my PS One and get a PS2.

Sure the wrestlers they have chosen for the game are some of the biggest names in the business, but that is the only good thing about the game. You have very limited moves, reversals are way too easy (in one sequence I think I had seen 8 reversals on the same attempt), and tagging in partners and climbing the ropes are almost impossible.

Not many wrestlers are available yet the 'Create a Superstar' menu fixes that.An incredibly wide variety of attacks are present in the game yet some are quite difficult to maneuver.Due to the blood and violence in this game, only children 11 years or older should play.Noting all of the positive features and VERY FEW negative features, I rate this game FOUR stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"what?","review":"When I saw the LOW promo on tv making fun of certain wwf champions, I had to pick it up.

Create a stencil will allow you to write your own stuff on the aprons and ring and stuff. Also, you get to fight in the audience, which is cool. I hope you can knock out the ref and cheat like in Smackdown 3:JBI. it will have great matches including ladder and 4 way dance. the one I cannot wait for is the new scaffold match. That's a match where you and your opponent are set on a platform set 25 ft. or so above the ring, and the first man to throw his opponent off the platform wins. also Acclaim IS the creator of create a wrestler and they'res was always the best.

I kept playing it though (after I had turned on the Blood and turned off the ring entrances) and uncovered a deep, fun game.The main problem with this game is that the instruction booklet [isn't good]. If you can pick up the PRIMA strategy guide do so. After reading through it I was like 'OK, so they didn't forget to include this' and 'Hey cool! Tiger Suplex!' Buy the way, this game has hundreds of moves so if you do get a little bored you can always interchange them with others.Acclaim didn't make it easy for me to get into this game. If any game needed a tutorial mode this would be it. Anyway, stick it out guys and girls. There is a really good game in there."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Believe the Hype","review":"So Acclaim revamps the engine and gets old school cred, but it still sucks. The 40 some odd wrestlers from the \\"golden\\" years are really some 20 some with another 20 to be unlocked through gameplay. the problem with this = game play is not good. the wrestlers are slow and methodical with only really four real moves per character. the \\"revolutionary\\" combo move system means you can pin the opponent after you suplex him, i for one am amazed. the camera doesn't always follow your man, and a health meter makes the game predictable and boring unlike \\"real\\" wrestling. tagging out is very difficult as well as climbing the turnbuckles for an aerial assualt. either stick with THQ or find an old arcade with Mat Mania still hangin around, but don't give acclaim any more money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Game!","review":"This is an excellent wrestling game with all the great wrestlers from the past.

That's right, if you do your work on one, you will have to erase and start over if you plan to use the shuffle with a different computer.No one told me this...Do not be fooled by the cute size....it is a trap and a way for apple to bank from each .99 download you have to keep purchasing to replace all of your erased music.

It's a nice little item - easy to use and it looks good. However...The sound quality is not what you'd expect - even in a lower-priced player like this. There is very (very) little bass. I went out and bought a reasonably nice ($60) set of headphones thinking that would help. Sadly, that actually exacerbated the problem - it seems the \\"muddiness\\" of the i-POD's standard headphones helps to compensate for the lack of bass from the unit itself.The device works (though it does take a loooooong time to recharge), it has a very cool form factor...but I wish I'd purchased something else. - I'll call this an $80 learning experience and use the thing until I lose/forget it somewhere. - If you haven't made the purchase, then I strongly recommend looking at other products."},{"rating":"1","title":"How bad can it get","review":"I bought it in the US as a present to a friend in Israel.

I know I will be in the minority here, but if you are open minded and want awesome sound quality, there are far better choices out there.If one brand is all you have ever tried, one brand is all you will ever know.I admit that it looks great though!Sony Model in comparison was: Sony NW-S203F 1 GB"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy this if you're on dial up","review":"It's cute, but what's the point if they don't include a software CD?

So after fumbling thru the \\"itunes\\" website and having to download 35 pages of manual I was able to figure it out. It takes about 4 hours to charges. Then I had to download songs to it, which took again about 30 minutes to figure out but all in all after managing to figure it all out, my kid is very happy and it seems to be very durable.

I went through lots of my favorite music that had a good beat and I put my \\"walking music\\" on the Shuffle. I clip it to my shirt or jacket and off I go.Many friends have commented on the size, color and the clip feature. I love it! I don't have to carry it in my hand and it is so light that you almost forget that you have it on.Of there was one negative, it would be the earbuds which are hard and would not stay in my ears.

However, one day it is willing to play a file, the next day I load the same file onto it and it refuses to play it. The pattern seems to be based on file types, so if you want anything to play reliably, you will need the files to be copied into probably about three different formats.There is no shuffle feature. I have tried everything, heck there is not even a fast forward feature that would be a lifesaver.And Itunes cannot load music onto it... I have tried everything right up to redownloading itunes and restalling it three different times.

It does what it's meant to do perfectly- play a random mix of your music and not get in the way. It will be great for exercising.I'll also download various podcasts for the commute to work.

This is the perfect ipod for anyone who is active."},{"rating":"2","title":"Da Shuffle","review":"Wow I am glad I picked this up. I work out everyday and the Shuffle is perfect for just that.

Very simple, perfect for when I'm on the go or at the gym."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for running","review":"I love that the shuffle is SO small. You can clip it on and not even feel that it is there, much different than my other MP3 player. As a runner, it's great that it doesn't seem to bounce around-- you can't even feel it's there.Also the lack of a screen is great for exercise, because I never get to look at the screen anyway, and it makes more room for larger controls. It's very easy to feel for the control you want without having to look at it, which can be very important when running."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for running","review":"This tiny little thing is the greatest thing for running. I used to have to strap my larger iPod onto my arm or carry it in my hand. This is practically weightless and clips on to clothing and doesn't let go.

For $80, a good buy.This player feels like quality with its satin aluminum finish and very solid clip. Tiny and light, the only danger is that you might lose it.Sound quality is excellent but there is a small amount of hiss at high volumes during quite passages.The only drawback is that there is no display. You can use this player two ways. The most likely way is in Shuffle mode -- load it with music you like and let it go. It's like listening to a radio station that only plays what you like.The other way is to load it with an ordered play list and listen in order. Good for audiobooks, for instance.Interface via iTunes is smoothly done, easy to manage."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great mp3 player","review":"I bought the shuffle a few weeks ago, and am very happy with it. I had been using my nano for awhile, then decided to buy the shuffle for something a little smaller while at the gym. I was very surprised in how loud the sound on the shuffle goes.

Just clip it on and go - you almost forget about it. Even better is the rechargeable battery.CONS: No battery meter.

However, the battery does last for several hours."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect Size - Easy to use","review":"Going from the bulky first generation of ipods, this was a huge improvement.

Extremely easy to use, while very light.I replaced an MP3 player that I use for running that died, so I was extremely interested in the clip feature. At first I was skeptical that it would actually stay in place -- thought I would have to purchase the armband. I was pleasantly suprised. In fact, ran ~13 miles while it was hooked to my waistband and it didn't budge. There are a few arm straps that you can buy from aftermarket vendors (e.g. DLO), but it's not necessary.If you are going to use primarily for running/exercising, I would opt for the shuffle over the nano. It's very rugged, inexpensive and simple to use.Enjoy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Never received","review":"I never actually received this product.

You could carry it anywhere, charge it anywhere, sync it anywhere. It was a thumb drive as well as a music player. Brilliant.This one is smaller. That's nice. However, Apple has introduced yet another proprietary patented connector. It's their's, they have a patent, you pay extra for adapters. You need to give up yet another USB port and add yet more clutter to your desktop. You have to take it with you when you travel.There's no audio-out from the cradle, btw. So don't expect to listen and charge.If they'd used a mini-USB connector I'd have given this shuffle four or five stars. Instead, I'm tempted to give it a single star, but it's not 100% worthless.Boo-hiss Apple.

I saw many people reacting to my previous review and I found them somewhat right.The main thing that comes to mind when you hear shuffle is its small size. Seriously, who is interested in a thing that will only play songs randomly? But driven by its size people might tend to forget that it has no screen, and added to that is the fact that it plays songs randomly.This shuffle is an excellent replacement for older shuffle considering size and price. But you will still be required to buy another Ipod with screen for more control(Apple strategy)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Piece of Crap","review":"I am so disgusted with this product. I expected to be able to use it right out of the box but instead I have to wait 4 hours for the stupid thing to charge. It is basically useless until it's charged. I just think Apple should make this thing usable out of the box instead of a dead lifeless piece of crap. I am very disapointed. I didn't buy this so I could sit and wait 4 hours to use it. The battery should already be charged when you purchase it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hissing sound","review":"The iPod shuffle second generation is small and stylish however at the expense of sound quality. There is a hissing sound, some sort of noise, that is constant as long as it is turned on. It can be heard with the earphones that comes with it, and is more annoying with better earbuds.I was quite disappointed when I got it. The iPo shuffle first generation (gum-pack version) had great sound quality, but I lost mine so I had to replace it.I would not recommend this to anyone who does not listen to music so loud that they impair their hearing.Also the docking station is a bit annoying, since it makes it harder to recharge the battery and use it as a data-saving source. It is possible to buy a little thing that is more portable than the docking station though, that makes it a bit more convenient."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty much what you would expect...","review":"A good no-frills mp3 player.

The small size and controls that are easy to use without looking at them are great for both.Using iTunes isn't that bad, but you really have to pick ONE computer for this device and only use it with that. Even if you try just to play the iPod through a different computer it won't let you. I created several different play lists in iTunes and every now an then sync a new one on the iPod, even though all the lists would fit at once. I do this because the shuffle does not have its own concept of a play list and forwarding through the songs to find the one you are in the mood for gets old.In summary, limited, but good for specific things. Don't mistake this for a more general purpose player."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of Money","review":"This tiny Ipod is too small to be of any real use.There is no display so you are guessing what is playing.Apple iPod shuffle 1 GB Metal (2nd Generation)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it!","review":"Bought this iPod for my marathon training and it has worked out perfectly.

Even after I dropped it on the tread mill, stepped on it and flung it back like 6', it works perfect. Very well built for something so small. Anyway, I see a lot of reviewers complaining about the battery life, and the lack of special features(like screens, radio, ect) but do you guys not realize the purpose of a shuffle. It spouse to be small, compact and not complicated. If your looking for features like those spend the extra money and get your self a 30gb ipod. But if your looking for something to take with you on runs, or when you just need a little music entertainment, this is what you need. I my self have a Nano and the shuffle, and seem to use the shuffle a lot more then the nano, I say the simpler, the better, and simple does go hand in hand with the shuffle!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great item, at a great price!","review":"The ipod shuffle is a terrific way to begin with an MP3. It's affordable, easy to use, and small enough to go anywhere."},{"rating":"2","title":"I like it.","review":"I really like this mp3 player and I've have several to compare it too. It's especially great to use when working out because you don't have to worry about holding on to it. The only reason I gave it only 4 stars is because I've found that 1 GB isn't really enough."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Tough Product","review":"We have gone through too many iPods, but this one is tough and so small. At $75, it also is less of a loss than the iPod 60GB! Perfect for the gym, the beach, where ever. Easy to manage and maintain. Still use the other iPods that have not broken yet, this is the unit of choice in my book.Also, Amazon turned around the order in three days under its 'standard' free shipping. Why pay more?"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best Music Player out there!","review":"This is definitely the mp3 player! It is beautiful, compact, easy-to-use, has an incredible sound (sublime!) and amazing and very attractive design. My respect to the Apple people in California... great-innovating idea! I absolutely love it and so does everyone! (I ordered last October, I have been receiving compliments ever since)"},{"rating":"2","title":"I love my shuffle!","review":"I think the shuffle is a great MP3 player! I have a Nano, and I just got the shuffle today as an early Christmas present. It has worked fine so far, and the sound is AMAZING!!!!! It is sooooo awesome! I love it very much. It's clip-on feature is great. Love it and the Nano! If you purchase this, you will not be sorry! Thanks, and I hope that this helped you!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great!","review":"Is great, easy to use, just that there's just the 1giga version; 2gigas would have been great."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love my lilOrange.","review":"My iPod shuffle, unlike my 4th gen 20gb, has not given me problems (yet). I think the lack of screen and touchwheel or clickwheel or whatever the heck it is is actually an improvement. (Buttons are much less likely to crap out on you than a touch-sensitive wheel.) I load up my songs, put it on shuffle, and go. And my battery doesn't drain nearly as quickly as my old iPod.It's also very handy for the car. I plug it into my casette adapter, clip it to something, and go! The metal clip is also a great bonus, since plastic clips tend to break or fall off of whatever you've clipped it to."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it, love it, love it!","review":"Did I mention that I love this petite little player. I wanted something teeny to workout with that I wouldn't have to worry about getting in the way. I can just clip this to my shirt or shorts and go. I must say that it is very durable for such a tiny thing. Last week my dog knocked it off of my swim suit into the pool...I watched in complete distress as it sunk to the bottom, and thought well there goes my perfect little player. My dad pulled it out, and I dried it off hoping that it would be ok and can you believe it, it still worked perfectly. I am in awe!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing!","review":"I ordered this when they announced it at the keynote in September and got it today!!!It is simply amazing! so small, so practical, and so beautiful. This definitly has the wow factor and is just simply apple!Highly Recommended: great price and quality."},{"rating":"2","title":"Warning: Old style headphones","review":"Just got my shuffle from apple store. It's sleek design is really cool and the sound is great. I love the ability of the clip on for exercise. The only draw back is that apple stiffs you when it comes to the headphones. Steve Jobs in his last keynote address toots about the new sleeker headphones. Apparently you have to buy the nano or regular ipod to get them. Its my first time having apple being cheap with headphones that can't cost them more than a few bucks to make. I'm sure I won't be the only shuffle buyer to register this complaint. Other than that it's a cool product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect For The Gym","review":"This little ipod is a great addition to my apple family. It is light and clips right to my clothes for use in any physical activity. It never feels hampered or bulky. I find that I can only keep my favorite songs on it because skipping is difficult when I'm working out, but all in all it's a great device."},{"rating":"2","title":"100% Satisfaction","review":"I recently purchased the Apple 1 GB iPod Shuffle AAC/MP3 Player Metal (2nd Generation) and have to say I am 100% satisfied. This little thing (and I do mean little) is fantastic. It will hold 240 mp3's and is so lightweight you can clip it anywhere or even just let it hang around your neck from the earbuds wire. It sounds great too. It took me about 20 min to add 150 songs through the I-tunes software. I would recommend this to anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Good Product!!","review":"This is the best product you can buy if you practice sports, it is very very! small. High quality sound and long lasting batery!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The great IPOD shuffle...","review":"The item is not mine and I don't use it. HOWEVER, I purchased it for my lovely wife for Mother's day and she simply adores the thing. She is out every morning, walking and listening to her Shuffle, I have never seen her so happy. It holds up to 240 songs,is small, lightweight and easy to use and the audio quality is terrific. You get everything you need to start enjoying this little gem right out of the box...nothing to do really but charge up the battery, and download some of your favorite songs (either with Itunes or something similiar)and hit the road. I don't know much about the other IPODS but this should be all 95% of us need for some companionship while exercising or whatever. Enjoy..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great idea, but not durable...Bad Battery","review":"Great size sound and clip, but if you are planning on using this often get something else. Battery won't hold a charge after 3 months of use. Apple makes great gadgets that last until there next product launch..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Next Generation ipod Shuffle-1GB","review":"Just what I needed for exercising at the gym. Very light, clips on clothing so no velcro armband is required. Good sound. Songs are easily uploaded or changed altogether via the computer. Doesn't need recharging that often. Plenty of room for lots of songs. And the price was right (about $80). No, you can't select a specific song because there's no viewer, but if you know where it is in the order, you can easily go to it by pushing fast forward or rewind or listen to one specific song several times, just like a CD. Plus, it's very small and trendy. Perfect for what I need. The earphones are a bit uncomfortable sometimes, but I'm sure there are others available which could be purchased."},{"rating":"2","title":"Apple 1 GB iPod Shuffle Metal (2nd Generation)","review":"Love it. My only complaint after owning a iPod Nano is not having the screen to see what's playing. Other than that, it's an amazing little player. Sound is fabulous! More comfortable earphones would be a nice touch though."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great little MP3 player...","review":"This is my first MP3 player and I think it's great. I bought it to have music to listen to while I work out. It's the perfect size, holds more than enough songs and I love how there are different colors to choose from. The only problem I have with it is that the clip doesn't work that great when running on a treadmill. It stays in place while walking, but slides off when running--not a biggie though, I just stuff it in my pocket and press on! Great deal for the money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mini Ipods & functionality","review":"The Ipod shuffle is much smaller than the nano and in fact a lot of functionality is lost in this mini ipod. However, it is perfect for the younger members of the family or for older people who are not interested or cannot manage technology well. It is very simple to use and the bright colors make it fun to carry around."},{"rating":"2","title":"great ipod for exercise","review":"I would give this 5 stars but for a few things:- the included earbuds are uncomfortable and fall out of my ears duringexercise- syncing is sometimes buggy- you have to load all podcasts manually- podcasts seem to be ordered by date on the player, no matter how youarrange them in iTunesRecent releases of iTunes have solved some, but not all, of the sync issues. Also, I have read about some workarounds for the podcast ordering problem, but they involve rebuilding your library, and furthermore from what I've read they're just temporary fixes. Apple needs to fix this.Still, the small form factor, cool design, and easy-to-use controls make this a great product. I sold my 4G 40GB iPod right after I got this, and I have no regrets."},{"rating":"2","title":"Unbelievable","review":"This shuffle replaced one I had for several years. Unbelievable sound, unbelievable size.I don't like having to carry the dock with me when I travel. The old shuffle was nice because if you had it, you could plug it in. Now you have to remember to pack the dock, also.Still, bang for the buck, it can't be beat!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Air Traveler's Nirvana","review":"Get your 2nd gen iPod shuffle and a set of Shure E2c sound isolating earphones and say goodbye to noise, interruption and tension. My Shuffle arrived last week and my Shure's were ready and waiting for the week's flight to Denver and back. Sure I couldn't hear the stewardess but how much is there to saying 'water please?'This teeny-tiny iPod is scary small! Just how is it possible - battery, memory, computer, and plug all in a size smaller than a watch face. It packs and travels easily. [The dock is unfortunately the biggest piece in the package - look for somebody to make a USB to audio-jack cable soon (without the base).] The sound is wonderful.I\\"ve not tried wearing this combo through the TSA security check yet but I\\"m building up the guts to say \\"Are you just making small talk or is it something important?\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Value - Perfect for Running!","review":"Pros- Size- Durability- Price- Clip on function- Long Charge LifeCons- Only can be charged through computer (w/o buying more equipt.)- Shuffle mode is not completly random- Earbuds are cheap (I hate the Apple ear buds, though a plus is that you can sell them new on eBay for $20+!)My arm would actually get sore from carrying my iPod Video on my arm for long runs. So I bought this iPod Shuffle and no problems anymore as this is the most comfortable mp3 player you will ever use... just clip it to your shirt, shorts, pants or whatever and you are set to go."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sucked in by advertising","review":"The unit is cute, it is unobtrusive, and it dos not work as advertised. First you have to use i-Tunes to download to the shuffle. My unit would not interface with i-Tunes. There was a pop up on loading on the computer that said there was more current software available for the unit and I should download. Apple was unable to complete the download. I returned it and bought the Creative Zen Nano with it's drag and drop transfer. It is a bit larger; but it works as advertised."},{"rating":"1","title":"Only lasted a couple months","review":"I loved my ipod shuffle. I used it to store music to walk to for exercise. It kept my hands free so I could walk with weights. But it only lasted 2 months and now it won't charge!!!! I have tried everything but sending it in for a new battery. Very disappointed!"},{"rating":"1","title":"broke within the first use","review":"Setup was so simple:* Plug it in and charge.* Install the upgrades.* Sync your music.Unfortunately, within the first hour it became permanently hosed. No music, just a blinking light. No luck trying to resync, clear and start over, or anything else. A visit to my local Apple store and I could wait 6 hours to talk to somebody to accept my faulty unit or I could pay more to schedule ahead of time (preferred customer).That makes three dead iPods. I wish I could take my music to another platform...damn DRM."},{"rating":"1","title":"Big on Hype - Small on Performance","review":"Bottom line - there are far better mp3 players out there for the same money. Don't buy this one.. keep looking. This player REQUIRES the use of iTunes meaning that one can't just drag and drop music into the player. This means installing this bulky virus/software and waiting for it load each time you want to monkey with your music. Also, you'll be forced to use only one computer to manage you music. This concept is completely dim-witted and annoying.Also, the player does not have simple, but vital, functions like \\"hold\\" or any kind of on-the-fly file management.Get something else that has drag-and-drop file management (sorry, that means non-Apple) and last longer than a year."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Good","review":"I am not recommending this item. After less than two months use, it stopped working. Although the size and ease of use of this item is good, the performance of this item is terrible. I have a 1 GB Sony MP3 that is far superior in terms of performance."},{"rating":"1","title":"Two strikes against the Shuffle","review":"I purchased the IPOD shuffle as a birthday present for my son. Within 24 hours it had ceased to work. While connected to the PC with the power adapter, it became super hot. I returned it and got a new one.The new one worked fine for about a week. Then my son started hearing a popping noise through his earphones. Thinking the phones were just bad, we swapped it out with another set of phones we had ... but the problem persists. I'm guessing the jack is bad this time.With all the good reviews, I guess the problems I'm having are rare, but c'mon. I'll be returning the second one tonight, and I have to tell you ... three strikes and you're out IPOD Shuffle."},{"rating":"1","title":"It comes with a teeny little docking station.","review":"If you look over on the Apple site there are many people who have had the tip of the plug break off on this docking station. You might say \\"hey you broke it and its all your fault\\" The tip has broken off on my station and I wasn't abusive with my gear. It was in my laptop case and it broke during transport to my office. Carelees? Maybe, is the product cheap junk? Definitely!Be very careful with this part. The replacement is almost half of the cost of a new Shuffle. And like all Apple products, the price is fixed. Be very careful!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The much improved Shuffle now has new colors","review":"NEW:-Thinner-Square-Aluminum-Clip instead of lanyard-Docked USB instead of strait plug-Slightly lighter-Available in new colorsGOOD:-Very compact-Great looking design and button layout-Excellent sound quality-Much more durable (and less flimsy, I always felt like I'd break my old shuffle in half if I sat on it)-No external cap to loose-Clip is very useful-iTunes SyncBAD:-No battery life improvement (still 12 hours)-Still no screen-Clip is a little stiffer than I'd like-Cheap headphones-Still no FM tuner, mic, voice record, or line-in-No accessories for it that aid in your workouts, yet (like the Nano)-1GB is the largest capacityBOTTOM LINE: At a price point impossible to ignore, this excellent sounding MP3 player continues Apple's great line of electronics. The perfect starter player or for workout enthusiasts. For those looking for a great compact MP3 player, look no further."},{"rating":"2","title":"Super Small and nice","review":"The clip makes this unit really easy to use, it can clip to part of your clothes or to something around you like a seatbelt.The fact it doesnt have a screen is no big deal you can just thumb to the the next song anytime...I updated this review == I am happy the battery life is still good after several months of use."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect devise for me.","review":"If you don't care to watch videos but want to listen to music on the go this product is perfect for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beware","review":"The quality of this object is garbage.

Really??Not only that, but they're just not a good feeling wipe. They're thick, yes, but it's a feeling I don't like. They just don't clean well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Huggies wipes miss the mark","review":"I'm a fan of Huggies diapers, but their wipes are a different story. On the plus side, they are thick. However, they're not very soft - in fact, I find them fairly rough. They also aren't as moist as other wipes I've tried. Worst of all, though, is how hard they are to pull apart. These non-popup wipes tend to clump together and pull out in a lump of 5-10 wipes at a time - definitely NOT what I want when I'm holding a squirming baby on the changing table and trying to clean up a mess quickly at the same time. Once I use up the two packages I bought on sale, I'm going back to Pampers wipes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too dry and linty","review":"I was very unhappy with these wipes.

The author leads the reader up one rosy path after another to lead only to \\"...on the other hand...\\" After reading this book, I feel we are truely primatives cogitating on the shore of space making up myths.

Serendipity herself is cute, with pastel pink \\"skin\\" and pastel purple hair. Her mark is four-leaf clovers and some flowers. She comes with a brush to comb her hair. This toy is really adorable and a lot of fun. You can have many pretend parties with your new friend and invite her pony friends over to play with you two. I really love this toy and it is well-made.

I really enjoyed Book #1: Awakenings in this series and couldn't wait to start the 2nd book. My only complaint at this point is the editing of the book itself. I'm wondering who the proofreaders were for this text, as I have already found 3 mistakes in the first four pages of the book. I find that to be very distracting while reading. Overall, however, I have found her books to be very enjoyable. They come highly recommended, if you can ignore all of the typos."},{"rating":"2","title":"This stuff works!","review":"Great product. for indoor hydro, dirt, or outdoor (although with outdoor, you would be buying in much larger quantity!) vigorous plant growth requires these nutrients, which are lacking in most nutrient formulas.

Nope, not here."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sophomoric Hack Religo-Philosophy","review":"Nothing new here, nothing interesting. Insipid writing to top it all off.

You can get that same messages by going right to the source, the Bible, or attending sermons by a good minister. So my recommendation is go to church! This book also has an annoying quality that is common to many modern religious \\"spiritual\\" texts, which is the practice of cramming all sorts of oriental philosophy into western religious themes. Maybe just a pet peeve of mine but it's been going on since the 60s and there are books that haven't been adulterated in this way, see Billy Graham's writing for the best example."},{"rating":"1","title":"Zzzzzzzz....","review":"Found this book at a garage sale and got it because I've studied the scriptures extensively and am curious about points of view regarding spirituality.

I called & left a message after hours at manufacturer office but they never called back. Sad. Guess I should not have waited a month or 2 to open this lemon. Luckily, I paid with a credit card. I should let Chase, who makes Amazon visa cards, fight it out with Amazon. Ridiculous. A real lemon. Bought new. Might as well have said ''toy'' if it tears up after 4 uses.

Instead of sending it back I repaired it myself to reinforce areas that were put together with glue instead of nails. Side doors do not shut like they should.

The side doors and top mirror lid did not fit properly after assembly, there were noticeable uneven gaps when the doors/lid were open as well as closed. The finish was terrible.

So a week later and not so much as a call.I had posted a review about this via an automated email request from amazon. I told them what had happened and not more than 6 or 7 minutes later I got a phone call.An Indian fellow was asking me to change my review. Seems that if Amazon/their sellers can't live up to their promises they shouldn't make them, rather than have their people make excuses.I'll not be doing business with them again and will go to a local furniture store next time.ps - this review will not be changed, even if they call."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beware of suspicious reviews!","review":"I was considering buying this armoire, but after doing some detective work I found that the majority of the 5 star reviews, are those customers only reviews.

Has a very solid feel, no press board here. All the drawers and doors nicely lined and operate flawlessly. The only con is that I thought it would be a little taller. It was hard to size by the pictures and the only problem is I'm sure she will fill it quickly. if you have a large jewelry collection you may want a little larger. So look for a larger Coaster product and I'm sure they will not dissapoint."},{"rating":"1","title":"Broken Item","review":"I ended up purchasing 2 of these units. The first one came in really quick and packaged very good. However when putting it together we noticed the left front door hinge was not installed correctly and when assembled in factory the person or machine ended up splitting the particle board with the screws. So we sent that unit back and got another. This unit came in again really quick and packaged nicely. Once again the left door was damaged by the hinge, wood actually split. Coaster has no Quality Assurance or Quality Control. These units look nice but Coaster needs to unpack then when they arrive from China and inspect them. Again Amazon did nothing wrong in fact I am impressed with Amazon for they way they handle returns."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good product","review":"Arrived well packaged, minor problem with receiving shipping notice, was addressed quickly by manufactor customer service department, have enjoyed using it, it is actually slightly bigger than I had expected so I was very pleased with all the space it provided.

It will balance in the crook of your left thumb, so your hand and arm won't get tired from holding it. I can't say for certain, since I don't have carpal tunnel syndrome, but this may be a great dryer for people who suffer from it since there's no need to clinch a fist to hold it.

The first part is built upon the discussion of the ideas given in \\"My System\\", by Nimzowitsch, as seen from a modern master's point of view. Despite of this other-source-dependence, the book is self-sustaining: you do not need to read Nimzowitsch's book to understand J. Watson's.If you want to improve your strategic skills on chess, buy it (and read it!)."},{"rating":"2","title":"You won't believe it if you don't read it","review":"I bought that book mainly because it was awarded best book of 1999 by the British Chess Association. After reading first first few chapters I was amazed: there is many great chess books on strategy, but how many have examples from the very recent matches? As John Watson himself says, chess has evolved in last 70 years, so I am not finding books using 20 or 30 years old examples half as useful. Understand Nimzovitsch's My System as \\"Old Testament\\", and convert to new one . This is a book I am in love with, now I can sell all my others. Buy it and share beauty of Mr.Watsons brilliant work. I wish I could congratulate him personally."},{"rating":"2","title":"John has done his homework!!!","review":"In my quest for chess mastery I have purchased a few books to improve one's chess such as Yermolinksky's Road to Chess Improvement, and Silman's ReAssess Your Chess. I am only about 1/4 of the way done with Watson's book but have already learned a great deal and my chess is already improving. Watson does more than just provide numerous variations at the reader. He actually explains the positions given and explains them well. Without a long review of this book I will simply say it is awesome and should be purchased!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good book","review":"This a good book, but like so many other books, Capablanca is dismissed. For example, in Niemzowitch-Capablanca, 1914 Watson say \\"I'dont beleive that Capablanca intentionally sacrificed the pawn. It is hardly in his style... \\". For the same situation Kasparov say \\"a profound concept\\". Maybe Watson don't remember Capablanca-Alekhine 1936 where Capablanca make not one exchange sacrifice, Capablanca make two exchange sacrificies and won brillantly!!. Because the computers are now very powerful, we can re-test the modern concepts and see what is right and what is wrong. Maybe we will see that the Capablanca positional concepts are right!! For the first light you can read the Berliner book \\"The System\\". However, this book is very instructive, because have so many good games played for more than 200 great players categorized by strategic motifs."},{"rating":"1","title":"misleading and written for noise","review":"the book is devoted to deliver a message, apparently it is commenting about the \\"my System\\" classic book but I have doubts here.ok, let us stick with what is apparent, the writer dedicated this volume critizing the orginal work by Nimzo for nothing, but I believe to make more value out of his work. You have to read the original work, my sytem, to understand this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Useful compilation","review":"A lot of chess is both rule based (positional) and calculation based (tactical). What Watson and others (Purdy, Soltis, Hubner) point out is that at any given position, you can have one or the other element dominate, oftentimes it's the tactical element in a seemingly winning position (i.e. 'defense' in a 'lost' position). The rule of thumb is that the stronger player will find a way to win. The reason computers are so good at chess is that they largely ignore positional understanding for tactics--and it works. This is the basis for anti-positional chess like Steinitz played. So keep a fresh eye.I never like a book that has cult status, like Niemzovitch's or Stilman's book, so I give this useful book 2 stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Picked Up at the End","review":"This book was B-O-R-I-N-G for the first half of it.

(Thus, if you are thinking about getting the book with the complete collection in one, I would not recommend it for a child.

Karmen had no guts, a thin skin, and couldn't believe that Darin wouldn't let him ride his coat tails to success.This book, though, is mostly about the adventures leading up to Karmen's loss of virginity. At the end, he begrudgingly reunites with Darin prior to his death, and \\"feels better\\".The book contains dialog you are supposed to believe is verbatim, and tries very hard to make Darin look like a mean spirited jerk that cast aside his friends on the way to stardom.It didn't work.

Although the story may be true, Karmen seems to want to reflect more about his being delegated to the back of the band rather than put more into the real character of Darin.

All the other videos however are superb, from the tongue-in-cheek Human Nature to the flawless Frozen."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great videos worth the money","review":"The videos from Madonna's album Ray of Light are well worth the price of this DVD alone.

However, I missed some videos like, \\"You'll See\\", \\"I Want You\\", \\"I'll Remember\\" and the Evita videos as well. I was wondering why they were not included in this video collection. My favorite video is \\"Rain\\" with its artistically simple yet elegant Japanese direction, even the song was way ahead of its time. More Power to the Artist of the New Millennium!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A FEAST FOR THE EYES","review":"This is one of the best dvd of music clips I own, in every sense of the word: excellent songs, stunning images, great special effects, etc. I agree with some reviewers on why so many excellent videos weren't included, most notably \\"Erotica\\" and \\"Deeper and Deeper\\". Anyway, I feel the clips included in this dvd are the definitive masterpieces of Madonna's artristy, because, although her latest clips from the \\"Music\\" album have been very good, nothing can compare to the visuals and styles showed in such breathtaking videos as \\"Rain\\" (my favorite), \\"Bedtime Story\\", \\"Frozen\\", \\"Nothing Really Matters\\", et al. This a must for any Madonna fan and for videoclips'lovers in general."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buyer Beware","review":"I have not been a fan of Madonna, and in fact have tended to be very critical of her, since the only time I ever saw her perform, on TV several years back, I thought she was laughably bad. Simply no talent.However, after reading many of the reviews of people raving about how terrific her videos were, I thought that the only fair thing to do would be to see these videos for myself and come to my own conclusions.Who knows - she may actually be as fantastic as so many of these fanatical fans say.I still have not seen Madonna, because the source I ordered from was from the UK, and the DVD I received was Region 2, which would not play on my player.This has happened to me several times, and all I can say is that if you live in the US, be extremely careful about ordering anything from any vendor in the UK, because Region 2 DVDs are what they sell, for the most part, and it is very likely that you may end up with something that is useless to you."},{"rating":"2","title":"American pie","review":"I think this video is Maddona's all time high and its one of her best video so far She is my favorite woman."},{"rating":"2","title":"E R O T I C A","review":"With or without Erotica (which is a shame), Madonna's rank as the most innovative and risque pop superstar is unswerved!

How can they leave out the EROTICA video. Do they think we're all 10 years old!?! And the fact that Madonna is letting WB do this just drives me crazy! Is she getting old and puritan? At least, they could release two different versions of this DVD, one with the EROTICA video and one without it, just like when they released the two versions of the EROTICA album. PEOPLE HAVE THE RIGHT TO CHOOSE!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Madonna can do no wrong","review":"Madonna is and always will be the greatest female musician of all time. Her videos are the best that there is, as this collection reflects. I would like to have seen Erotica and I Want You on the collection, but maybe Madonna knows best.

One can never have enough Madonna stuff."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring and missing the hilites","review":"It's missing Erotica -- which means that it is *unpurchasable* -- a puritan/victorian decision made for us by the record/dvd companies (thank you for watching *my* moriality* -- *plegh*).

Written for a 3 year old reading level, the 'book' was mostly filler - useless stories and personal anecdotes.The only useful information could have been presented in a 3 page brochure.

The first exercises appear on page 64 and end on 75. The following chapter just repeats the information found pages 64-75. Too little too late in the book to keep the reader interested. I found more useful information by using a search engine on the internet regarding the multifidus. The figure on page 9 is very misleading as it is only a segment of the multifidus. The multifidus group runs the length of the spine. This book reads very much like a college thesis."},{"rating":"1","title":"Could work for some","review":"Interesting facts in this book, but errors, too. The most serious error is the assumption that multifidus will tag along automatically. For those that it will, this might work perfectly. However, I've understood that it is for some of us absolutely critical to learn to voluntarily contract our low back multifidus as well. And that important part is missing in this book. (In my case the right side multifidi in my lower apparently didn't kick in during light activities for 8 years. When I was taught to voluntarily contract the multifidi they started contributing. This fact is based on scientific studies and you can check it e.g. inTherapeutic Exercise for Lumbopelvic Stabilization: A Motor Control Approach for the Treatment and Prevention of Low Back Pain)I would recommend Rick Jemmett's book on Spinal Stabilization instead. That is a buy you won't regret!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Solid Scientific Perspective","review":"I'm a yoga teacher that deals with a lot of clients with back issues. The author of this book doesn't say anything about yoga but his approach is easily adapted.I really appreciated his mixture of scientific research with personal anecdote. His exercises are easily integrated into a yoga routine.I was surprised though that he doesn't mention laying on your back and pushing the lower back into the ground as a possible multifidus-strengthening exercise. I've found this to be very effective and easily adjusted by using a small towel under the back to provide resistence.Also, I purchased a \\"Stabilizer\\" which is a biofeedback device that measures the amount of pressure one is excerting. This works great with the laying on your back exercise I describe above.The author's additional section about how to sit, etc. was a nice touch."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Solution???","review":"I don't think some of the exercises illustrated in this book are appropriate for all patients, especially some of those with lumbar radiculopathy (or spinal stenosis). Exercises #4 and 5# involve a patient lying in prone (on stomach) and have them perform alternating lower extremity or upper/lower extremity lifts. Many individuals attempting #4-5 exercises at home will likely go into lumbar extension (especially if they forgo the pillow under their pelvis), which will close down the foraminal openings where the nerve roots exit. If this individual has an inflammed nerve root, he or she will likely experience an increase in radicular symptoms (numbness and tingling)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty Good","review":"So I've been doing the excercises as this book suggested and it's been great. I hardly ever get back pain anymore. My back pain is stiff lower back and I've also has disketomy done too. Ever since I did their suggested work out I truly have not had any incidents of back pain. I would've liked to see this book suggest more excercises. It gives out only a few excercises, however those excercises are very effective.

His music flows so convincingly that many of my friends are surprised to learn that the Sun Bear concerts were improvised. It takes rare talent to have that kind of spontaneous creativity, and jet Jarrett plays on for 20, 30 even 40 minutes at a time without pause.Jarrett's skill as a pianist is also impressive. At times it can seem like the man has three hands... Listen carefully and you'll hear multiple musical themes emerging from some passages.The music occasionally lapses into the atonal, which can be somewhat annoying if you're not in that mood. But there are some real musical treasures in this boxed set. The first few minutes of Disc 5 are my personal favorite."},{"rating":"2","title":"Monumental melodies","review":"Certainly designed for the more disciplined listener, this is nonetheless solo piano improvisation at its near-finest articulation.

The actors chosen to play the Bunkers and the Stivics created a perfect chemistry that worked beyond belief. I think that this is proven by the fact that after the departure of the Stivics (the end of this 8th season) for California, the show just wasn't the same; at least not for me and my hubby. Folks either loved or hated this show; don't think there were any in betweens. I highly recommend this season of \\"All in the Family\\"!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Okay","review":"First of all, I got this at my local craft store for half the price. Second of all, I guess the quality of this set depends on what you want. It comes with ONE scratchbord which already has the image printed on it, so you essentially use the craft tool to trace it and.... that's it. It says that there is a practice board but it's actually a 1X2 inch piece of board identical to the only other one that comes in the kit - pretty lame. If all you're looking for is to trace someone else's art work the finished product does look nice, and it is good quality scratchbord, otherwise buy something else."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good companion","review":"This book is a great companion book for \\"Hodges' Harbrace Handbook.\\" It is a simplified approach to english."},{"rating":"1","title":"Non-Functional","review":"This product is also sold under the brand name subsidary \\"Game Mill Publishing\\" through Officemax stores.

There's such a collage of styles that give this album its own unique flavor. Tripped out synthesizers, guitar riffs, precise scratches and cuts, it's blended and melted together courtesy of Herve \\"RV\\" Salters. It's tough to put a label on what this album sounds like, but I think that was the whole idea. If you're into genre defying music, then this is right up your alley. The closest you can come to labeling this would be to call it good music, plain and simple. Highly recommended.

Their latest single, the funky and Rock-inspired Wake Up Call, the second single from It Won't Be Soon Before Long, is a very hard-hitting diddy that really sounds great from beginning to end.

There is no instruction for the yoga asanas instead the voice over goes on and on using vapid statements about Kabbalah.I figured that there would be some mention of Kabbalah in the program, due to the title. However, I also expected there to be a solid yoga practice with proper cueing. When the voice over actually cued a movement it was often behind the performers.There was no instruction on moving into or out of a pose and the poses where not held for equal amounts of time on both sides of the body.There are so many good yoga DVDs available and I suggest that no one waste their money on this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Good Practice","review":"I am really glad I bought this video, the practice is around 40 minutes, not extremely challenging but you feel you have really worked out.

The GPS tracking capabilities of Delorme's product looked good. However, I was disappointed in the mapping quality compared to Microsoft's product. For example, Street Atlas shows my home location (based on address) at the end of my street - not acceptable. Microsoft's product is more accurate in pinpointing the location of an address. The quality of the maps was also disappointing. The user interface is non standard and non-intuitive. The requirement to have the CD in the laptop in order to see maps is not acceptable. Note that Delorme offers a 30-day money back guarantee, which I appreciate. I will take advantage of it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Long time user in Connecticut","review":"I agree completely with user from Cleveland. Delorme took a fabulous interface (Version 8.0 / 9.0) and completely ruined it. This is the one piece of software that I have never failed to upgrade immediately since the program's introduction years ago. For the first time, I am sorry that I did. SA 2003 is much slower, the Windows interface is gone, and the graphics quality is degraded. This is change for the sake of change, without regard to a previously very loyal user base.

I was very happy with the previous version, it did everything I wanted, was easy to use, and was fast. I bought Street Atlas 2003 mainly to get the newest map information. It was a huge disappointment - it's slow, you can't select certain states to save on your hard drive (it's all or nothing), I don't care for the map display (you have to zoom way in to see street names), you can no longer select certain areas to avoid, and worst of all the automatic routing often gives nonsense reslults (I've found that the program thinks that some interstate off-ramps are local roads and will go out of it's way to route around them - the results are sometimes just plain goofy)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible, horrrible, ....","review":"I bought the whole bundle including the GPS reveiver, USB adapter, and the software.

I like especially the printing features: Travel package, you can choose how many miles of the route you need to be covered on a page. Print overview is good. Print big maps on up to 3x3 pages.This program uses the layers feature (similar to photoshop) so you can add or hide layers or routs on the main map. it is also nice that you can calculate a route by setting the start/end point to be one of points of interests already tagged on the map (when you fully zoom in).Again this program is not very user friendly and it took me some time to get over my anger.

Street Altas 2003 is a big step backward. They are attempting to merge the 3-D Topo Map program format into Street Atlas and failed on first pass. The maps are not attractive to the eye, the scanning and zooming is much slower, and the controls clumsier. The points of interest are hard to find, uni-dimensional by class of point of interest, the drawing of the route to the point of interest is full of errors, and locating the point of interest once selected is difficult. In earlier versions, the points of interest were located easily by icons and rapidly explained with a right click or pointing, to include the point of interest phone number. The routing program is goofy, and missing the \\"stick to interstate\\" feature, resulting in bizarre routing on slow, back roads. Delorme, you bombed on this one and I want my money back."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not as bad as all that...","review":"This package is really pretty usefull, although it takes getting used to.

The list of exercises provided as an appendix to the book, give a good summary of what is required to achieve a positive outcome for those willing to commit to a regular practise regime.

If the author would have said things such as, in my opinion I only like one position, etc, then that would have been acceptable. Many people (especially in the church) are very confused about this topic and this is not mentally healthy for people, and in my opinion as a reviewer, books such as this are causing more people (especially women) to go in the wrong direction and to become even MORE repressed/suppressed and that is not good news.

It left me with hair and a painful cut, which never happened with my Intuition. After this experience, I am returning the razor with its 60-day money back guarantee.

Clearly, this should not be happening after only a few months of use!! And clearly they do not stand behind their product!!!

Half the team wore this watch and the other half the Suunto Vector. Must of us owned both. I found the Casio Pathfinder easier to use.The only issue I had with my watch is sometimes it went into conflict and went through all the modes and would not stop until the batteries were removed. I was the only one that had this issue.We worked in extreme enviroments and the watch took a beating. Sand Storms, attacks of all types, crashes, high heat 125 - 130 degrees. Cold below zero for long periods. All the features were a great asset to all of us. We often compared data with our other instruments like GPS and other sensors we had.

I have been in some places that most would never want to be and survival is based on your intellect and who you know. The watch functions pretty well while in the box but has trouble standing up to ruff conditions (which the company claims it can). I was given the watch to use and within a few weeks the the pin (which holds the band to the watch) was ripped from the watch and in turn damage the watch so as not to be useable. This is not my definition of a tough watch. If I was to draw any conclusion from this I would say this watch is great as long as you don't wear it while doing any physical labor. It doesn't have to be high tech to perform well. My advice is - Dive watches do what they were designed to do and they are made for ruff conditions. Just think it through - what ever the watch is made out of would be a great indicator of what you can expect from that watch."},{"rating":"2","title":"HUGE!","review":"This is a great watch with all the features.

WRONG, well I guess it is cool to have \\"random numbers\\" generated, these functions are so far out of wack that it would be impossible to compare them to toys. Don't waste your money.

You will get an error code (which you have to look up) telling you the battery is no good, and the charger shuts itself off. Or you will get a message that the battery is fully charged, and the charger will shut itself off. You can hook up another charger to partially charge the battery, and this charger will recognize that the battery is good after all and will finish charging it. If you have to have another charger to start the charge, then why do you need this one to finish it? Smart charge? Not in my opinion! I have not had any problem with the clamps breaking.

If, however, you are merely mortal, then you will probably have the opportunity to undo what you've done at least once, in order to do it again the right way.For us, installation in an admittedly challenging situation took about 5.5 hours. Your mileage may vary."},{"rating":"2","title":"A bit complicated, but not too bad.","review":"I read the reviews prior to my purchase and they were mixed as far as how difficult this was to put together. One of the problems is that it can be mounted several different ways with several styles of backboard so there are a lot of parts you will not need depending on your installation. The hard part is figuring out what parts you do and dont need. Once you figure that out, it goes pretty quickly.I am one of those \\"we dont need no stinking directions\\" guys and I read and re-read the directions on this thing. We did a roof mount with a Spalding lexan see through backboard. The whole project took about 4 1/2 - 5 hours including clean up. The final product looks good and seem to play pretty well.Overall, good product. Read the directions and dont be in a hurry."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Deal","review":"Assembly was easy although you have to sort through all the extra parts for different mounting options.

Makes meappreciate St. Etienne even more."},{"rating":"1","title":"Kickout Case Disappointment","review":"I ordered the cases knowing full well there was a production flaw in the clear plastic being milky. I was given the option to order specific trim colors so I chose black. I needed the trim to be black to go with the case graphics I had created. I was really surprised to receive blue cases instead. If they only had blue they should have informed me before sending them out. I found the cases at a late date and had to use them - there was no time for a return or to purchase from another source. On a positive note, they did arrive in a timely manner and there were no damages otherwise."},{"rating":"1","title":"Definately Not what you expect","review":"I was very disappointed to think I spent almost 30 dollars on a piece of wallpaper basically. When i read peelable, i was thinking it was like holiday decorations, self sticking on the wall but removable. No, this is wallpaper, you wet it and hang it. The picture is cute, but the quality and price are definately not worth it. I am very disappointed in this product. You can do other things with it which is what I will do, find some plexiglass or something, attach it to that, and put a hook on the back, so at least we can take it with us when we move, but this is the worst growth chart I have purchased. Guess that is what i get for buying online and not being able to see the product first hand to know what i am really buying. Buyers beware!! Don't waste your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"basic paper poster, nothing special","review":"It's ok but keep your expectations low.

Having been recently diagnosed with breast cancer, I could truly relate to the feelings other women in the book experienced. I too had to make so many decisions in a short period of time. As I read the book, I realized how many other women had been in that same terrifying place, and how many women met the challenge of healing head on. Every woman's cancer is different, but the feelings that accompany the daignosis are the same. I truly appreciate the honesty and the willingness of all of the survivors who shared their stories. I would highly recommend the book to all women with breast cancer and to their families."},{"rating":"2","title":"Needs a Second Edition","review":"I was enthralled in the book. Buildings that Changed the World is a spectacular photographic adventure. For anyone that loves history and architecture it is a fantastic book to look at. Reading, however, is different. The author, understandably, has little room to explore the different intrigues of every building. There are fantastic stories to some of these buildings that are not mentioned. Again, I do understand the limited space but I would love to see a second edition to this book that goes into the buildings more in depth. The author uses the Kremlin as a whole but, I believe that the buildings individually should have been addressed. Specifically, St. Basil's Cathedral which has a fantastic history of construction under Ivan the Terrible."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Architectural Survey","review":"I got this book for my boys, 8 and 11, who both like to look at buildings and building design. It was very engaging for them, enough good photos and enough text to be interesting but not too arcane.

I believe that Wolf Blitzer deserves a great deal of praise both for his writing style and the quality of his research.Bottom Line: Pollard was a venal, mixed up person who cheerfully betrayed his country for money. My impression from reading a recent Seymour Hersh article about Pollard is that the \\"I did it for Israel\\" excuse is a convenient afterthought. He should stay in jail...But if it is necessary to release him in order to cajole some future Israeli government into a peace accord with the Palestinians, I could live with that. We should just revoke his citizenship before letting him make \\"aliyah\\" (emigration) to Israel. Personally, I'd like to see him sent there via a giant slingshot (like the way Dilbert gets periodically sent to Elbonia)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wolf Blitzer Proxy Biography","review":"The story Blitzer tells of Jonathan Jay Pollard is actually also Blitzer's own story. The sympathy he shows for Pollard is a American zionist's sympathy for other zionists who put the safety and well-being of the United States completely under the feet of Israel.Israel gives nothing, America gives billions in assistance and blood. Israel needs to learn to stand on their own. America does no good to Israel by propping up extreme zionists leaders and their laquis like AIPAC trained blitzer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Case Applications for study","review":"The Case Applications book has been well utilized in my course and used for homework assignments requiring case canaylsis.

I was quite looking forward to this book and I was really disappointed in the stories and the characters.A giant spider in the classroom that the administration does nothing about? Weird little dwarves, kids with \\"special talents\\" was over the top for me. There is a mixture of sci-fi, horror and fantasy in the stories and none of them seemed to hit it off with me and I am a huge fan of sci-fir and horror and of Mr. Van Pelt's.Perhaps I will just stick to Mr. Van Pelt's novels as his short stories left me scratching my head."},{"rating":"2","title":"A very comforting video","review":"I gave away my original copy (which I liked better because at least one of the interviews was longer in the original...and one interview is missing from the newer version and seems to have been replaced by more interviews by experts. The Howard Storm interview, my very favorite, is still on there. I love it so much, I have purchased several copies over the years. What happens is, I give it away to someone whom I thought would benefit by seeing it, and then then end up buying another to have on hand...give it away...buy another, etc. I always try to have at least one copy of this DVD on hand at all times. I have no doubt this DVD has served to make an eternally positive difference in countless lives. I am thankful to the individuals who made it possible by sharing their amazing stories."},{"rating":"2","title":"Daily life in Persia - just what I wanted","review":"Having spent many months looking for a book which discusses daily life in Persia rather than direct history ie wars, invasions, I was delighted to discover this gem. This book is a treat. Written by an English woman traveller in 1910 it discusses and describes daily life in an easily accessible yet detailed manner. She begins with an overview of history, and style of government, which sets the scene. It then progresses to chapters including amongst others: The Persian Man, The Persian Woman, a Persian city, Travel, Country Life, Fauna and Flora, Antiquities, Sport, Amusements, Poets, Arts and Craft, Superstitions and Medicine. The book includes 20 historical photographs and a regional map.

They never fail to amaze me. Henry Rollins is one of the most influencial voices of our times. He and the Rollins Band always take on the most controversial social issues that they can and make their voices heard. They always say what they mean and never beat around the bush about anything."},{"rating":"2","title":"POWER!!","review":"Boy, this record got power. A bit more jazzy than its predecessor. Personally, I think Gibbs fits the band better than Weiss. Nevermind. This is jazz-oriented hardcore with a lot of groovy drum and bass licks.

The songs on \\"Weight\\" are shorter, faster and much more intense..this and avoiding the dirges of the previous two releases, paid off big time for The Rollins Band. \\"Liar\\" even became a sizeable underground hit although not the strongest tune on the disc. \\"Weight\\" contains several winning songs and has an odd positive vibe not found on any other Rollins CD. By subsituting short bursts of intensity (see \\"Disconnect\\" and \\"Fool\\" for examples) instead of and avoiding the snail paced epic strategy (which really only ever worked for him on Lifetime's \\"Gun In Mouth Blues\\") Rollins comes up with his strongest release in years.Recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rollins Band, would not buy it to break it.","review":"The End of SilenceThis guy sucks big time.

The epilator really irritated by skin caused major bumps and redness. Waxing just hurts too much and is really messy.

So, it's a great emergency tool if all other options are not available."},{"rating":"1","title":"So-So Facial Trimmer","review":"I bought this from QVC.

The extra touches and music on the VHS are downright annoying."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cost and Benefit","review":"Unfortunately, I can not recommend this film for the public in general. Low cost production and the script is poor.I admire Mel Brooks and he did much better in \\" History of the world.\\" As Mel Brooks is a legend of comedy, I suggest this film for those interested in American movie history. In fact there is an explanation for this poor and evasive production."},{"rating":"1","title":"eh...","review":"I'm gonna say that this isn't a bad strategy guide, though it is far from the best I've seen.I've looked through it and it covers the maps, levels, and enmies fairly well. And it looks like it would do the job. The problem is that the actual game isn't much fun, mostly because of its gameplay. The guide isn't organized all that greatly, but it will do the job if you are stuck somewhere (yeah, it doesn't give away too many secrets)."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is not a book; it is a magazine article!","review":"I was misled by the cover of this article! It has been packaged to look like a book but it is actually a 12 page magazine article! I think that $8.00 is way too high a cost for magazine article! I believe that Amazon should not package magazine articles to look like a book so I am disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"What happened to GIS data","review":"I purchased this on the title of GIS support, but after the introduction, there is no mention of how to build maps from GIS data.It is also only about the web service that Microsoft sells, nothing about MapPoint the product for the desktop. It is also very basic.This is a reprint of an article from C# Today from 2003 - before the current 2004 version was released."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pendant is NOT made from silver and looks cheap","review":"Unfortunately, just the chain, but not the pendant wears a 925-stamp. The metal of the pendant also looks very cheap. Especially on the back side you can see that it is definitely no real silver. Furthermore, the stone does not look like moonstone and is scratched too. If I would not have gotten it to Germany on a difficult way, I definitely would return it. Wasted money. Just trash. Horrible quality. I would never order anything again from this seller ..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"Skies & Clouds by Richard Taylor is disappointing. Beginners should find the text instructive and techniques not intimidating, but the examples contain many errors (often according to his own advice) making them counter productive to the student aspiring to greater proficiency. The author demonstrates merely modest painting ability of the subject. Regretfully the lighting and shadows are not well rendered and contrast values are weak. His clouds are overly ephemeral with little structure. A watercolor of a \\"Sky and Sea\\" is the most convincing, because the waves of the sea are well rendered, but the sky is confused with fog and rays of light that look like rain. The book's purpose of being a \\"field guide\\" to aid in the artists perception of nature is good, but a more observant eye and commentary is desirable. The watercolors display visual paint textures but fall short of being inspiring Skies or Clouds."},{"rating":"2","title":"Stories from the edge of somewhere nasty.","review":"Different from Philip K Dick, but Ellison was in similar territory in a way here.

Would def. buy again."},{"rating":"1","title":"the problem is the way it's sold!","review":"You can't choose a size, so they just send you some random sized kneepad, the product does come in different sizes, the seller just doesn't want you to have the choice. Second, this is for only one kneepad, it's not a pair, and most people who need an athletic kneepad actually have two knees. One might assume that if you ordered two, you'd get the same size, but that was not, in fact, the case for me. I'm not sure what I can say about the product, mine don't fit, but I will avoid this seller in the future, and I would advise you to as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"It is a little small","review":"I found that this pad works for me, but only if I'm wearing right. It is small like everyone says. I am not a big guy and it's tight enough to hinder my speed if I don't have it in just the right spot. I needed something to stop me from ripping open my knee over and again, and this did the trick. Not recommended unless you are a smaller than average male, or an average female."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your money","review":"The very first time I used my new sliding pad, I ripped open the same old hairless, tanless patch of skin I was trying to protect.

This album is signature Buzzoven sludge heavily mixed aspects of stoner metal and punk rock. It is also of note that this album has one of their best line-ups with Ramzi (Sourvein) on drums and Dixie (Weedeater, Bongzilla, Barstul, Hail!Hornet, Sourvein) on bass."},{"rating":"1","title":"THIS IS NO CARTESIAN WELL","review":"In Julliard I had to brook my share of modernists (required, of course), some good, some awful. Carter, viewed overall, is an interesting composer, but these works show him in the worst possible light. The fact is: They are grating, obnoxious, of minimum invention or interest. Put me in a room with this CD on repeat for a few hours... and I'd even give up my virginity, had I to give it up, that is. (A minor Julliard joke.) Those immersed in modernism of this ilk will find this review abhorrent. That's tough. I've diddled around enough on my strad (I wish!) with composers like Carter, Danielpour, Maxwell-Davies, et. al., to know that this music will be forgotten long before Mozart ever will. Or Brahms. Or Bartok. Does Carter take us all for fools... or just some of us? This well is dry, my dears. Bone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great christening present","review":"Lovely book.

My children loved it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book","review":"I bought this book to teach Sunday school. I wanted to start at the beginning with the children as they have very little exposure to the bible. We read the stories and I found color pages and worksheets to download that go with the stories. As I stated this is a great book, stories are very enlightening and easy to grasp for this group of children ranging in age from six to sixteen. I plan on buying each of them their own book so they can reread at home."},{"rating":"1","title":"didn't send total order","review":"My order arrived one month after the order and furthermore the order was incomplete (they only sent 1 of 3 books ordered).

Charged the battery overnight as directed and this afternoon I attempted to use the \\"Professional Nail Salon.\\" It fits nicely in the hand. That's the only positive I can say about this product. Yes 6 \\"heads\\" are included, but not even one would remain in the \\"Professional Nail Salon\\" for even a minute. The suckers repeatedly flew out of the tool, flying all over the room and driving me nuts. I think I'll pull out my Dremel flexible shaft and try that instead to finish the job I tried to begin today. At least I know the drill bits remain firm in that one until I want them removed!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice idea, if it worked","review":"I bought this because of the clever design. It worked for about a week. I called the manufacturer, and they said replacement bulbs were $15 plus $7 shipping. Apparently the bulb is custom made for this product, and you can't get it anywhere else.Great idea, but at $22 a week the entire family can use a brand new toothbrush every day!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't get cought on low price","review":"If you have modern tooth brush with rubberized handle or power brush, they will not feet. The slots are counted on those cheap tooth brushes sold in $1 stores. The replacement bulb from manufacturer cost $14 +s/h. That's where initial low price is coming from. The life of the bulb is claimed to be 1000 hours (for $14), less than any regular bulb, but you can rest assure people worked hard so the bulb would never last that long.

They were junk. Bulbs were broken, didn't work and they were no longer returnable. I learned a big lesson to open things right away! The tooth brush slots are VERY small as well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of money","review":"As a PhD qualified microbiologist, I feel it is my duty to point out the pointlessness of this device. While it is true that a toothbrush can contain \\"millions\\" of bacteria, so does the mouth of every single individual on the planet. Provided that you are healthy, and that you are using the toothbrush as intended, the bacteria that can be found on a toothbrush will pose little or no risk to you and your family. Think of it logically, if there was a significant risk of disease due to use of a toothbrush, wouldn't a lot more of us be sick?Dont waste your money on this product - by a new toothbrush."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bulb can last for a very long time...","review":"I've had this unit for over three years. I am now replacing the bulb for the first time. However, since the bulb cost is almost the price of a discounted new unit, I am going to purchase another unit. It is true that you cannot fit wider handled toothbrushes in this unit, as the slots are too narrow. However, the toothbrushes that the dentist gives me fit perfectly. I also have some dental heads that also fit (the kind that goes on powered toothbrushes). You can see the blue light when it is on, even with the cover on. The light is minimal, however. The cycling I believe saves on bulb life. Again, this is the first time I am changing the bulb. One thing, the cover developed cracks over time, and I think it must be from the heat of the bulb. They say to use the cover as a cup, but I never did. It only serves as containing the light of the bulb and keeping nasties away from your toothbrush. I feel that this is a great way to reduce sicknesses in your home."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your time","review":"I actually \\"Rate\\" this a Zero\\")\\"...
