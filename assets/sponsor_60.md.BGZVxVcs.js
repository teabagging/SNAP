I'll keep it brief: the hero is a jerk, the heroine has no spine or pride, the dialogue sounds phony, all the personal interactions are stilted, there is no emotional chemistry and it is all \\"tell, don't show\\" from the start. The \\"flashbacks\\" to get the backstory are just plain irritating and in fact the whole book is; and it feels dated. I didn't sense any real connection between the characters and feel vaguely resentful that I wasted as much time as I did trying to figure out why so many people claimed to love this book. I don't get it. I tried. I'd recommend staying away from this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"not this time","review":"I'm normally very forgiving of escapist, fun, breezy romances, but this book is seriously, even unforgivably, flawed. The cliched backgrounds of the characters (has anyone ever gone through childhood unmolested??) paired against a contrived storyline and then followed by an ending that grew progressively more ridiculous made me want to toss the book into the junk pile. Not recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Strong emotional impact","review":"Mary Jo Putney is an author that I trust, but when I saw this one was a \\"Hollywood\\" story, I really didn't think I'd like it. I was wrong. The characters had tremendous depth, and in the end, you wonder how on earth they can overcome the situations, yet they do, in a plausible and emotionally satisfying way. A definite recommend."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow, wow and WOW!","review":"Loved this book, can't imagine anyone thinking it less than five stars or utterly great.

Ellington's music is so timeless. And this set, with its small combo is incredible. There is a slight harshness occasionally, but it is beyond proof not only an example of this genius's music, but simply as great music that should be enjoyed by many. In spite of my career, most of my at home listening is Classical-- yet this album stands with the greatest. Absolutely amazing!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not all that good","review":"This show was boring, the acting was bad, and some of the scenes didn't make a whole lot of sense.

It dumbfounded me that I could so long for a man who was a creature of imagination conjured by the collaboration of Richard Wagner and Ramon Vinay. The colossal suffering of Tristan, as essayed by Vinay, so moved my womanly heart... Also, Varnay, often eclipsed by Nilsson, was a voluptuous Isolde. She was able to summon the steel for the warrior Brunnhilde, but she was also able to soften into the femininity of Isolde and the Brunnhilde of Gotterdammerung. Her \\"mezzo\\"-touched dramatic soprano imbued a warmth and luxury to these roles. In my opinion, this recording ties with the Flagstad/Suthaus recording as the greatest of all Tristan und Isolde 's on record."},{"rating":"2","title":"hammer on","review":"After my Harbor Freight junk coughed its guts trying to pierce my basement floor this Bosch didn't break a sweat knocking out the task.

I've used mine to install furring strips on both sides of a 200 ft. long block building, works great.

You can use it all day and never wear out. AWESOME!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Strong drill","review":"I bought this because my Makita drill couldn't keep up. This drill is much more powerful. I don't use the depth gauge so that was no problem. The case does look cheap. I sat and worked the clips that hold the case closed back and forth expecting them to break. They didn't, that doesn't mean they are good though. The variable speed quit under heavy use. Still for the price I think it was a good buy and would do it again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Inexcusable Quality","review":"Hammer/Drill switch did not function out of box. Two speed switch did not function out of box. I did not know how to give Zero stars but that is what this product deserves. There is NO excuse for this kind of shoddy quality/workmanship. I also recently purchased a Bosch (Dremel) rotary tool that failed after two minutes of use. Returned for repair and it once again failed in less than two minutes. I threw it in the trash. I should have learned my lesson about Bosch quality then. Be assured I will never order another Bosch product!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Dollar Store Stoppers","review":"I would not recommend these stoppers to anyone.

You have to watch for the red flashes to know where things are happening. Some time ago, it simply stopped working. I attribute this to some Windows patch that I applied at the time, but I have been unable to find any support for this game at all.Even the web page for the game itself is non-functioning, so I have to assume that Microids went out of business or something.

Then one day it just stopped loading. Removed and reinstalled it, same thing. Shortly there after I bought a new computer and loaded it. It worked for about a week then dead again.

I really dig Ornette, so I picked it up, and it's great. It's one of my favorite Ornette CD's, and it's just one long suite running approximately 80 minutes. It was composed for Conrad Rooks's film Chappaqua. But Rooks was so taken by Ornette's wonderful music that he felt that if he used it in his film, it would diminish it. He was right; this music is better than the film. The film is a pretentious, overly artsy mess. This is a very rare recording by Ornette, but if you're lucky enough to see it, and you have the scratch, buy it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dull, Boring, Pure Fantasy","review":"I have always found something to like in books I read; however, I cannot say that about this one. Rich lawyer, nominated for a federal judgeship, is driving to a family cabin when he encounters poor girl from the wrong side of the tracks walking in the rain. He stops, picks her up and finds she has been battered, takes her to the cabin and cares for her. Nothing happens. They go back to the city where rich guy is obsessed with girl and has an affair with her, being careful not to be seen with her. Finds out her step brother is in jail for an automobile accident in which rich guy's step brother lost the use of his legs. Seems the step brother of the girl was shanghied into jail by his sorry public defender who now works for the rich guy's father's firm. And so on and so forth. This is really a bad book.

The \\"R\\" rating is, at best, a tease (and I don't mean STRIP tease). The blocking the director used to prevent any \\"R\\" quality nudity was so contrived as to be laughable.

You could say it is hard rock with a punk pacing. The comparisons to MC5 and the Stooges are accurate.

Sure, the aluminium frame may seem a bit flimsy, but that's the trade-off for a light stroller...It wasn't until I took my daughter for a ride that i realized its major flaw: the handles are way to low for someone 6 feet tall like me.

Otherwise, stay away..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice looking and simple","review":"The stroller is great if you just need something lightweight and simple and would really rate it somewhere between a 3-4. It's not for the parent who's going to be shopping often, since there isnt really any place to store or hang your shopping bags. But it's lightweight and a very good size for someone more petite (I'm 5'0), though my husband has no complaints about it (he's 6'3). The design of the stroller is nice. the colors are great and like I said, it's just a lightweight basic stroller. The only complaints I have are that there are no cup holders for you (but I've put my drink in the pocket, which seems to work fine) and it's not easily maneuvered with one hand. the last issue is the car seat base and car seat, they seem a little difficult to remove from one another, but not sure if that's the case with all car seats and bases."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful Stroller","review":"It's a wonderful stroller.

It wasn't until I read it to my husband that I realized what a terrible story this is.This is a story about a selfish little girl who doesn't take the time to acknowledge her mother's handmade soccer shirt, yet proclaims her father to be the best person in the world when he gives her the promise of the purchase of the best toy ever.I love Olivia and parts of this book were so, well, Olivia! But I just don't feel the book presents the kind of message I would want my nephew...or my own children...to hear and think is okay.I returned the book very sad indeed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as good as the first two","review":"Like the reviewer a few before me, I was quite disappointed with this book. So too was my five-year-old daughter, an Olivia fan, who has yet to request this book at bedtime since the first time we read it to her on Christmas Day night.With this book, Olivia turns from a precocious, engaging young pig to a self-absorbed brat. Most likely this will end up in our summer rummage sale."},{"rating":"1","title":"Real life, but not real lessons","review":"As mentioned by others, this book illustrates all the typical toddler bad behaviors. I can live with that if the book comes around to explaining that these behaviors are not acceptable and there is a consequence for bad behavior. This book never gets around to that. Instead, Olivia is rewarded for her shouting and demanding and lack of appreciation. The artwork is standout, that is why I bought it, but my twins won't be given this book until they are parents too. I think the author is writing for parents and the parents who have given it high ratings are obviously buying books for their enjoyment, not for the education of their children. I would never recommend this book for a child."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another Great Olivia Book!","review":"I love the Olivia books by Ian Falconer!

Good enough for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"never fail perfectly shaped crust","review":"My dear aunt gave me one of these years ago after going to her house and noticing she had used hers to make one of her wonderful pies. She gave it to me right then and there and I used it until there was nothing left to it. I am terrible when it comes to rolling out dough. If I want a circle, I get a rectangle, and vice versa. This is a no-fail way to not only roll out that perfect circle, but get it easily into the pan. The dough never sticks to the plastic type fabric, and you unzip the bag, invert it onto the pie plate and remove the other half. Making it easy to get that crust centered directly onto the plate is such a big help. It washes nicely in mild dish soap, dries quickly ready for the next job. The nicest part about this is that it is not one of those gadgets that takes up alot of space! fold and into the drawer. I've tried finding these and no one knows what I'm talking about. Thanks Amazon, for coming to my rescue."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your time and money!","review":"This pie crust maker didn't work at all. The flour doesn't stay on the inside plastic so that's no help at all. It's much easier just to roll the crust out on a board the old fashioned way. In this thing the dough sticks to the plastic because the flour in no way stays where it is supposed to. A complete waste."},{"rating":"2","title":"This little gadget works GREAT!!","review":"It is so easy to use this pie crust maker. You zip it open to lay flat the two big plastic (vinyl?) surfaces. Take your mixed pastry dough which you have shaped by hand into about a 6-7\\" disk with both sides lightly floured. Then close the zipper and start rolling from the center outward to almost the edge of the zippers or to whatever thickness seems right for your amount of dough. Open th zipper and dust one side with a little flour, close (no need to zip), flip and dust the other side with a little flour and it your pastry lifts off. You will save the price of the pie crust maker with just the first 5 crusts that you don't have to buy out of a box - and they are so much better made from scratch.

I washed it once on gentle/cold cycle when it arrived in the mail, and once more after it had become dirty from food. Now, the velcro strips have totally come detached from the fabric and there are long, loose threads from the fabric hanging from all over (all over!) the product. It looks awful and it barely serves it purpose now that it won't stay put in a high chair without the velcro system that secures the fabric around the chair.I also went online to return the product to the Clean Shopper company, but I'm pretty sure that the company no longer exists. When I visited its website, I was taken to a blank page that read, without more, \\"We thank you for your business over the years and wish you all the best.\\" I'm thinking that my Clean Diner must have come from one of the last, very poorly made product lots before the company went under."},{"rating":"1","title":"Looks good but not worth the money!!","review":"It looks much better in the picture.

The first one I bought was an Eddie Bauer version. It was much better than this and half the price. I have yet to find a wooden chair that this fits into properly. It is nearly impossible to attach to the highchair and never stays in place. The velcro is in odd spots and doesn't stay secured. The belt needs to go around the chair from beneath and doesn't hold the child in place.

I bought this because I wanted to keep my child safe from the millions of germs on the highchairs in restaurants. I have had great success at over 10 different restaurants with this cover. It always fits, the velcro is easy to adjust and it isn't bulky. It also folds up easy and is great for transportation. Maybe I am doing something differently, but it seems strange to me that this would not work for some people and works for others.

It's excellent.When Dowling sticks to the original compostion, the results are very pleasing. He does at times take a different tact to playing certain phrases - occasionally swapping legato for staccato (and vice-versa), and this gives him a kind-of signature sound (he doesn't do this excessively).It's when he takes more of an artistic license with embelishments that I'm tempted to hit the fast forward button. For example, his excursions on \\"The Entertainer\\" seem rather dubious to me.For the most part though, this album is quite listenable (especially liked \\"Handful of Keys\\" and \\"Magnetic Rag\\")."},{"rating":"2","title":"Kept the attention of all our kiddos, including a 2 year old boy","review":"I put this on when I needed something to keep the attention of the kids for about a half hour.

His prose brings alive the tensions, conflicts, and contradictions of a society in search of its identity as Israel becomes an increasingly multicultural, post-Zionist society. That Israel is one of the most progressive countries in the world today on gay rights will surprise most Americans, who think of the Jewish state as the land of the story of Sodom and Gomorrah (with its reputed condemnation of homosexuality). The cast of characters in Walzer's book -- a transsexual pop Diva, openly gay high school students and kibbutzniks, lesbian politicians, and a cast of supportive straight politicians and educators, to name just a few -- guarantees new surprises on each page."},{"rating":"1","title":"not what you expect","review":"I bought this book hoping it would give a good outline to what would be on the cissp exam.

For my own first event, I bought both this and \\"The Complete Idiot's Guide to Triathlon Training\\" and preferred the latter - it's an easier, more entertaining read and the training plans are somewhat easier to follow. And some of the advice in the Friel book is downright bizarre - for example, it suggests that for your first race, you may want to seek out an event where the swim part is in a pool.

Worthwhile if you just need the basics, but compared to my other beginner tri books, this one just doesn't provide the same level of detail. Also disappointing, the author's website referenced often in the book appears to no longer be online.In the early chapters, Friel recommends that your first triathlon goal be \\"to make it across the finish line with a smile on you face\\". Later chapters discuss optional workouts that you can skip but warns 'you will finish the race but you might not meet your triathlon goal'. So, I'll finish the race without the extra workouts but I just won't be smiling at the time? Admittedly, I skipped around but this seems to conflict with what the author originally recommends.Good book, but needs a new version."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not so helpful","review":"The majority the the information in this book was very basic and common sense.

Really recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good book for a first time triathlete","review":"Friel does a good job of speaking to the first time triathlete without watering it down too much.

I had also read several books about the battle before I went on my tour and noticed that the author had taken his interesting stories right out of these books which I didn't like.

In other words, this is terrible history and archaeology. The author asserts that all ancient peoples, and therefore all ancient cultures, can be traced back to the family of Noah, who dispersed after Noah's Flood. This is despite historical, archaeological, anthropological, linguistic and biological evidence to the contrary.I challenge the author to submit parts of this work to any non-fundamentalist academic journal, and see if even a single one of his findings are worthy of publication. If they are not, prospective purchasers should ask themselves is this book worth reading? Can we take this books conclusions seriously?"},{"rating":"1","title":"engaño","review":"este producto lo compro pero cuando lo coloco no es la medida y mi aro es numero 11 pulgada osea ese pro ducto vino mas grande quiero que me devuelvan mi dinero urg es un engaño"},{"rating":"1","title":"Evans Tri-Center Extended Collar Conga head not returnable","review":"I ordered this conga head for my LP galaxy conga. sad to say it did not fit, although it says that it would have.

Morton, um mulato de New Orleans que se considerava branco descendente de franceses, iniciou a carreira tocando em bordéis e esteve em quase todas as cidades onde se podia ganhar algum dinheiro tocando jazz. Costumava se apresentar com um carto onde constava a inscrio \\"inventor do jazz\\". Se ele realmente acreditava nisso ou estava apenas brincando, nunca vamos saber. O fato é que Morton foi o primeiro músico a conseguir colocar na partitura alguns dos principais elementos musicais que realmente diferenciavam o jazz de seus ancestrais: spirituals, blues e ragtime. Para aqueles que no apreciam gravaes repletas de estalidos e chiados, o álbum traz registros cujo tratamento técnico torna a audio agradável até para as orelhas mais exigentes.

The original actuallyhad three different speeds ;while this one uses three speeds, they are hardly distinquishable from each other; the original was of heavier gauge and would not topple as easily as this new version. The original fan model had a fan which cut more deeply because the fins stood out more and hence the original blew the air much more powerfully than this new version.

This one is the one that I can do without. This book does not portray Gregory well in the role of hero. I couldn't get into it. There are moments of classic Quinn humor. However, I was able to put down the book for days before I finally forced myself to finish it up."},{"rating":"1","title":"Greatly Disappointed","review":"I was very disappointed in this installment. I usually love Julia Quinn, her books are normally funny and romantic. However, the characters and how they related to each other seemed immature (more of a highschool boyfriend/girlfriend romance than a romance between adults). In the end, the heroine came across as cowardly, the book had unnecessary plot twist and the author did not know when to end the book. Very disappointed. I think the author should rewrite and then rerelease the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sadly Disappointed","review":"As an avid historical romance reader and a huge Julia Quinn fan, I was so disappointed by this book. I've waited for it to come out for months and bought it the day it was released! I agree with the other reviewer who said the cliffhanger in the prologue drew me in, but after the plot dragged on and on. There was too much meaningless dialogue, and ultimately I did not fall in love with the characters. Although I finished the book, I could have easily stopped reading midway through. If you have not read When He Was Wicked by Julia Quinn, read it instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"I love you Julia, but...","review":"... this was really disappointing. I have ADORED the previous books in the Bridgerton series, and I can always count on Julia Quinn for interesting plots and characters who make me want to keep reading forever. But this book seemed like a rough draft more than anything else. The dialogue was choppy and flippant. The characters seemed to be too immature to be interesting. And I was peeved by the fact that a major (and interesting!) twist in the plot was reserved for the very end of the book, when it should have been introduced in the beginning to give this book the \\"oomph\\" that it was sorely lacking. I still think Julia Quinn is one of the all-time greatest romance novelists, but this is the one book that didn't hit the mark."},{"rating":"2","title":"On the Way to the Wedding","review":"An extrmemly well written book.

I thoroughly enjoyed Gregory's book and the final installment of the Bridgerton's. How refreshing to read about a romance hero being \\"in love with love\\". \\"OTWTTW\\" is full of laughter and humor and JQ's famous one-liners that will leave you laughing out loud.***The idea of these books is not to compare them with the others in this series, as I feel some reviewers have done. Each can stand alone in its own right and there is something to love about them all.Definitely a keeper."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Wit! Mediocre Romance.","review":"This was not my favorite book in the Bridgerton series, but Quinn's writing is fantastic. The first half of the novel had me laughing out loud at Lucy's many clever retorts or one-liners. Lucy is a character I could very well see in a Jane Austin novel. I rated this book a 4 because it was written very well, and all and all, it was complete story.In the romance arena, I only give it a 3. Gregory just took too much time figuring out that Lucy was his match for my taste. When Gregory finally does figure out that he's in love with Lucy (half way through the book), I didn't necessary trust him - after all, 10 pages prior he was madly in love with Hermione.However, if you take the author at her word and just believe that Gregory is truly in love the second time around, then the ending will not disappoint you - it's wrapped up nice and tight like an 8 year old's Christmas present."},{"rating":"1","title":"A major disappointment","review":"I was extremely disappointed in this offering as I am a huge fan of Ms.Quinn. I love the Bridgerton clan and actually enjoyed the first half of the book, but the plot took a bizarre turn at the wedding that left Gregory looking pathetic and desparate. Why would anyone do that to your hero?? This may be the worst ending to a novel I have ever read.

Good summer vacation read!"},{"rating":"1","title":"VERY DISAPPOINTED IN LAST BRIDGERTON BOOK","review":"I have loved all of the Bridgerton Series books, but this one just did not have the same appeal that the others did. The characters in this book were poorly developed and unfortunately poor Gregory never seemed to have a character in any of the previous books. I think maybe this is one of the reasons I just could not finish the book. The story is so boring that I kept skipping to the next chapter finally ended up at the end. I think Ms. Quinn ran out of steam or ideas for the Bridgertons with this book. I am very sorry I bought it. I would have rather read a book about Violet (Countess Bridgerton) the mother to all of the eight Bridgerton children. I think it would have been a wonderful ending to this series. Gregory getting married could have been snuck into one of the other books and that would have been in keeping with his character all through the Bridgerton books."},{"rating":"2","title":"THE STORY TOWARD END MADE ME CRAZY","review":"I read all the other Bridgerton stories and I loved them. This one, however, made me crazy. Mostly toward the end.Anyone who has read my reviews knows I hate \\"unhappily ever afters.\\" Believe me this one had all the ear marks of that. Even after it was resolved I still felt like I wasn't satisfied as it seem anticlimatic.If it had been more in keeping with what I want to read in a story I would have given this a 5 star review, but really I just couldn't. It kept me too disquieted though out and I like my romance, more traditional I guess. I want happily ever after and I want to know I am going to get it.This one reminded me of the movie Message in a Bottle and that ending just sucked. So you can see my problem with my thinking this was the same.It's a great story and it will keep you on edge and guessing, but it just disturbed me. I guess that's after all the mark of a good story, because it lives long after the story ends."},{"rating":"2","title":"On the Way to the Wedding","review":"I see that someone wrote that this wasn't her favorite book, but I have to say that as far as I am concerned,this was my FAVORITE book of the series.

I really loved it."},{"rating":"1","title":"What Happened to Julia Quinn","review":"Julia Quinn used to be a fresh writer whose stories were at turns witty and interesting.

Other than that, very good."},{"rating":"1","title":"not the best","review":"I enjoyed the series but was disappointed in this book. The end of the book was terrible. It didn't flow well and the characters' actions were completely out of character. Also I know it is a romance book but I don't think the ending was realistic at all. It seems like an annulment or a divorce would have been a big deal. All in all I wouldn't buy it or check it out from the library."},{"rating":"1","title":"This one is pretty bad","review":"Let me start by saying that I'm a big fan of Ms. Quinn. It's either a hit or miss with her but most of her books do entertain. This one is definately a miss. I found myself so bored with the characters and the plot. The book drags on for the first 200 pages and then all of a sudden during the last 50 pages of the book the characters fall madly in love with each other and a blackmail plot pops up. Pretty sad ending for such a great series."},{"rating":"1","title":"On The Way to the Wedding","review":"By the time I got to this book, I must admit I was tired of reading about the Bridgertons. This book did not hold my interest, with each character flitting from love interest to love interest. However, the epilogue was a very cute way to end the book. I really liked the ending."},{"rating":"1","title":"I want my money back","review":"I did something i have never done in my life, returned a book to the store. i was so disappointed with this book and felt that i wasted my time, i was furious. and yes i did finish the whole book. i found this novel to be sooooooo annoying, uninteresting and boaring. the main characters were a joke, the plot was uninspiring. there was nothing in this story to suatain me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing final Bridgerton","review":"This was really disappointing. I have enjoyed the previous books in the Bridgerton series and was really looking forward to a strong finish to the Bridgerton series. The plot had a good intention but the delivery of it was rather poor. This is not a keeper."},{"rating":"1","title":"Did I finish reading it?","review":"I'm not being sarcastic, I really can't remember. I read up to the wedding, I think, then put it aside for awhile. And I thought I finished it, but I can't really remember if I did.I loved the Bridgerton series, but I didn't really care for this book. I have to say none of the characters were all that interesting. I stopped liking the heroine when she went through with the marriage. The hero was kind of an airhead. First he loves Hermoine because he saw the back of her neck, then he feels the same way when he sees the back of Lucy's neck.I guess the whole subplot about Lucy being forced to marry was to try and redeem Gregory from being such a bubble-headed boobie, but it just made Lucy unlikeable."},{"rating":"1","title":"VERY FRUSTRATING","review":"I'M NOT SURE IF THE PROLOGUE SET THE TONE OR IF IT WAS JUST THE ENTIRE BOOK THAT FRUSTRATED ME. THE CHARACTERS WERE BELIEVABLE BUT THERE WAS JUST TOO MUCH DRAMA FOR MY TASTE. DEFINATELY NOT THE BEST IN THE SERIES."},{"rating":"2","title":"The 8th Book of the Series -- Gregory is a romantic !","review":"On the Way to the Wedding by Julia Quinn is the final book of the Bridgerton Family Series. This the novel of Gregory - who knows that love exists because his family love matches. I can't tell you too much of the story - but it's a mix of blackmail, romance, humor and the amazing Brigderton Family. If you have enjoyed the series you will enjoy this chapter of the family. The Bridgerton series: #1: The Duke and I , #2: The Viscount Who Loved Me, #3: An Offer from a Gentleman, #4: Romancing Mr. Bridgerton, #5: To Sir Phillip, With Love, #6 When He Was Wicked #7: It's In His Kiss,#8: On the Way to the Wedding. If you looking for a little more mystery I would also check out The Lady Lies The Lady Killer and The Lady's Code by Samantha Saxon."},{"rating":"1","title":"I really wanted to like this one, but......","review":"I've tried to like Quinn's writing over the years, but she makes it very difficult. She wants to be known as a writer with wit and humor (we even have to be told that her heroine is witty on the book jacket, and that Quinn herself is smart and funny), but unfortunately, the dialogue just comes across as wordy and juvenile, her characters silly, not serious. Before page 100, her main characters say idiotic phrases like, \\"piss-poor,\\" and \\"The horror. Oh the horror.\\" For a historical, writing like that should have been edited out. I wish her editors could reduce some of the ridiculous conversations and help Quinn concentrate more on plot. The initial idea for the story was creative. I wanted to find out what happens to bring Gregory and Lucy together. But the dialogue was so endlessly inane and boring, that I eventually just gave up."},{"rating":"2","title":"fun fun fun","review":"I picked this book up from the grocery store and was pleasantly surprised. I admit I have not read other books in this series. But I found this great as a stand alone book. The dialog was smart and funny. The characters were believable. I especially enjoyed that the man was the romantic in this book. The he loves her and she loves someone else start was novel. I laughed out loud while reading this--always a great thing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome!!","review":"This book is a great ending the Bridgerton series. I have been looking forward to Gregory's story for a while because he has always been my favorite Bridgerton character (I don't really know why :/). Julia Quinn is my favorite author and this book was an absolute delight to read. I was done with it in a day and actually plan on reading it again along with the other books in the series. The reason I gave it four stars and not five, however, is because it had more \\"mystery\\" in it then I would like to have in a romance novel. To me, Julia Quinn is more light and fluffy and when she added that extra bit about treason it just didn't really didn't do it for me. But, altogether it was a great read and Julia Quinn gets an A from me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing ending to Bridgerton Family Series","review":"Julia Quinn's name on a book is enough reason for me to buy it. I have LOVED her Bridgerton family but I agree with the reviewer who said the series has fallen off after \\"Romancing Mr. Bridgerton\\".The story just couldn't keep my attention and it was a struggle to finish it. I hope for better books in the future from Julia Quinn."},{"rating":"1","title":"so boring","review":"This book is dull, so dull I didn't even finish it. So dull I can't even must the emotion to hate or even dislike it. The writing is fine, but the characters . . . just so boring. Lucy is occasionally funny, but Gregory is dull as dirt. The only character I found interesting was Lucy's actual intended, and his relationship with his father. Too bad he's . . . gay or something? So I guess he'll never get his own book, or at least not as a mainstream romance.It's just disappointing to read something so dull from an otherwise usually funny and entertaining author."},{"rating":"1","title":"Skip","review":"This story was a disappointing ending to the Bridgerton books. I really didn't care for how Gregory was portrayed - he was super lame and seemed to only have one sentiment for Lucy which was \\"I love you\\". Not very creative. And the so-called suspenseful last 3rd of the book was predictable. Not a good way to end the series, but at least many of the others can stand alone."},{"rating":"2","title":"great but..","review":"Love the stroller. It is lightweight and easy to use.

When baby is too big for the infant carrier splurge and get this! So easy to put together! It reclines really well and has the foot thingy that goes up so baby doesn't slide. The cup holder is awful and the basket is a nice size but difficult to access but I use a messenger-style diaper bag from Skip Hop (love!) so that isn't an issue for me.

Gone was the dark and foreboding atmosphere of Detective Nathan Adler's diaries, in was a very British romp through Jungle and bass dance music. No concepts this time, just great single after great throbbing single. \\"Little Wonder\\" was the kind of song tailor made for dance clubs circa 1997, and the bass heavy sound made my apartment walls shake back then.Keeping Reeves Gabriels back as a full time collaborator (from the Tin Machine days) certainly added to the glorious racket. His feedback laden leads and quirky rhythms elevated \\"Dead Man Walking,\\" \\"Telling Lies\\" and \\"Law.\\" The sole drawback to this album is that it has dated itself (Drum'n'bass lasted what? Two months?), but having songs as amazing as \\"Seven Years In Tibet\\" and the genuinely disconcerting \\"I'm Afraid Of Americans\\" (wherein Bowie mumbles \\"God is an American...\\") makes \\"Earthling\\" a Bowie disc still worth seeking out."},{"rating":"2","title":"Electronica takes over Bowie's music realm","review":"While other aging rockers and bands are still playing the same old stuff they always had, it seems that David Bowie keeps up the latest music style.

I don't have a problem with Bowie going techno. What made Bowie great was the story telling, There's no story here. On the opening track he repeats you little wonder 34 times, he repeats the phrase so far away 30 times all rapped around electronic noises and blurbs that make no sense to me. As I listen to the rest of the CD, the same thing. 1 line phrases repeated over and over with noise in the background. What made bowie great was a collection of the some of worlds greatest musicians led by one of the worlds greatest composers. Not here on this CD you get about an hour of non ending electronic drum beats with noise blurbs, not 1 cool guitar riff. I picked this CD up because of the high rating and it's low price on Amazon.

It\`s a competent and listenable effort, still most of the moments here are just curious yet ultimately forgettable experiments. While it\`s not downright bad, it ends up being tiresome and far from gripping. It already souds dated at parts, which doesn\`t help, although I can see how it was a breath of fresh air when it came out in the mid-nineties.A decent album, but far from a keeper."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great.","review":"This is techno/space/head-banging/emotional stuff all in one package.

Inspired by \\"The Princess Bride\\", the style is similar enough that anyone who enjoyed that book should enjoy this one. Although it is written for the juvenile market (age 9 or so and older) it is still a delightful read for anyone. For a younger person the first thirty pages are somewhat slow but required in order to lay the foundation for the rest of the book. On the other hand, once you get to the section on \\"The Oddball\\" it picks up speed, the two primary characters become well developed and the book takes off. After that it is hard to put the book down and you may find yourself sitting up to finish it. \\"Swords for Hire\\" is a highly recommended and enjoyable read."},{"rating":"2","title":"fresh and funny","review":"Will Allen wrote with the total freedom of knowing this was for people who loved him, and with the understanding of the fantasy tradition.As a result, Swords for Hire is a fast-paced, witty nod to fantasy--observing cliches when that seems fun, blasting them when blasting them seems fun.If I hadn't known this was the only full-length work of a dying young man, I still would have enjoyed it. OK, so it's not Lord of the Rings--it's not meant to be. It's also not meant to be Princess Bride (I actually preferred Swords for Hire to PB), but is a tribute to good writing.

It is one big \\"let me pat myself on the back\\". Hal Strickert is one big dork.I certainly could have done without comments such as \\"She was dressed up and wearing one of her highest and sexiest pair of heels\\" referring to his wife turning her ankle. Then in chapter four we get to hear about Hal and Diane \\"joining the mile high club\\".He starts out claiming they are going to climb a very demanding route. In the end, they climb the same old worn out tourist route that thousands of other climbers take every year.He refers to \\"climbing\\" the mountain. All they did was hike or trek up the mountain just as thousands do every year. There is certainly nothing wrong with taking this route or any others, but don't make it sound like you just climbed Everest.Give me a break. I am either sending this book back or throwing it in the trash."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book did not deliver what I was looking for","review":"This book was a true dissapointment. The information I received from it is available for free on the \\"net\\". The writer comes off as arrogant and gives one the impression that he is the end all when it comes to climbing. The insights were weak, and he dedicated much of the text to filler so he could justify calling it a book. The reference section is an insult to anyone wanting to book their own trip.

Page 169, Leakey DID NOT discover Lucy. Fact easily checked-it was David Johanson in Ethiopia in the mid-70's(as a matter of fact he wrote a whole book on his discovery entitled \\"Lucy\\"). Leakey made many contributions to understanding evolution but this is not one he cannot claim. Page 168, \\"brought back three more Americans. The first was a young man from Canada . . \\" Maybe the author meant North Americans-he should say so because Canadians are very adamant about making sure they are not mistaken for someone from the U.S.A.

There's nothing gripping about it. You can find a lot more interesting, a lot more informative and updated travelogues on the internet and you can read them for free. Also, this book is badly written and edited. Do we have to be told that the kind of food served in a restaurant named \\"Carnivores\\" is meat? Do we have to know that the author and his wife became members of the mile-club on their flight to Africa? I wonder what their son thought upon reading it.

I did enjoy reading it, but Fran seems too obsessed with Bragg to think coherently. She disapproves of her brother-in-law's fidelity but yet she can kiss/make out with Bragg. I find it unbelieveable that she could have forgetten to tell Bragg about his wife's impending return to NY since it has consumed her mind for several days. I was growing tired of her lies whenever anyone implied she was interested in Hart, whom I preferred to Bragg. (At least he isn't married!)

I have also read Deadly Affairs, Deadly Pleasures,and was greatly anticipating Deadly Desire. Alas, I was sadly disappointed! It doesn't begin to live up to the other books, and seems to have been written in a great hurry and perhaps by several people writing different chapters. Whatever, the author needs to refrain from such frequent use of \\"she/he started and stared\\" ( this was in every other sentence!), and in general do more justice to her characters and tie up the dangling story lines: Connie and Neil, Evan/Sarah/Maggie, etc., and get on with Francesca and her frustrations. Enough already."},{"rating":"1","title":"Extremely disappointed with this book.","review":"Being an avid reader of all of Brenda Joyce's books, I was truly let down with the ending of this book.

But, it was disappointing and unbelievable from the beginning. Francesca severely burns her hand while catching the villian in the previous book but is up the next day racing around town, using her hands, as if nothing had happened. The editor must have been napping on this one. Things are said to have happened \\"this morning\\" when they clearly should have happened \\"yesterday morning\\". While the premise of these stories is interesting, I got bored with Francesca and had trouble finishing this one. Francesca has abandoned her college classes without a second thought, can't decide which brother she loves, ignores any opinion she disagrees with and pushes orphans on the police commissioner and than promptly forgets about them. Ms. Joyce should either have Francesca grow up or put this series to bed."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best Book on the Topic","review":"It is a shame that this two volume set is now out of print.

I'm recommending it to everyone!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A tragic, but hilarious, tale","review":"I know that the title of this review sounds contradictory, but this book is not only a tragedy, but a comedy as well. The tragedy is in the depiction of the decimation of the aborigines of Tasmania, due to neglect by the British colonial government, and the murderous outlook of the colonists, both convict and free. It's a sad, but true, story that is parallel with our own treatment of Native Americans. The comedy comes from the bunbling efforts of the crew of a smuggling ship to unload its illicit, and lucrative, cargo. Additionally, there's a deluded vicar seeking the Garden of Eden in the wilds of Tasmania, and a blackhearted doctor who believes in the primacy of the \\"Saxon race\\". Everything comes together in this tale, which is well told, and extremely interesting. It's worth reading for the comedy, but you will be greatly afected by the plight of the Maoris, also."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ambitious (perhaps overly ambitious) adventure tale","review":"I enjoyed this book very much but felt that it ran out of steam --particularly with the \\"coincidental meeting\\" towards the end. Also, the irony was far too heavy handed for me at the very end of the book. I won't say more because I don't want to spoil the book for anyone! I found the doctor and the reverend less convincing as narrators than the aborigine, and also far less interesting. The author could have skipped a few of the narrators, too. Still very worth while reading. T"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent","review":"Just finished this book and didn't want it to end. Hard topic, yes, but such a wide view and a compelling one. This book is rich and engaging and full of the world itself. It's true - there are many voices to follow, but dip in and you will find yourself on a voyage unlike any other. The language is beautiful, the characters are so true, the sadness is profound, and the irony/humor is sharp. I found myself pulling for one character and then another. Even the hardest characters (\\"Mary\\") grew in my affection. It took a sea-going ship sailing across the world to show all the bits of humanity. Wonderful."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great fun","review":"I loved this book. I came across it entirely by accident while searching for a hiking guide for Tasmania - and it was a real stroke of luck. I won't go on at length, since many people have written detailed and glowing reviews, but it is an extremely pleasant read - very funny, even as it also deals with some very serious themes. Pretty educational too. It turned out to be a fine introduction for my trip to Melbourne, where visits to local museums touch upon the historical events and themes treated in the novel. I won't say it's perfect - some of Dr. Potter's diary passages = rambling + indulgent in my view (although the early bits are hysterical), and I thought the culmination of the expedition to find the Garden of Eden fell a bit flat - but these are small criticisms. I started reading it before leaving for Australia and finished it, a happy and satisfied reader, as the plane was taking off from Melbourne. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Grand voyage","review":"Though some may disagree about literary value of this book, I can not but say that it has captured my heart. Written in perspectives of main characters, offering two racurses, one of the passengers of the Sincerity and one of the aborigines and inhabitants of the penalty colony in Van Diemens land. Charactesr are presented very convincable, especially the priest, though some may find it as quite unapropriate attack on church and christianity, but that is the debate for some other place. If you're looking for amusement, or just want to spend some quality time read this book, you won't regret it"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great storytelling","review":"Told from several points of view--each a believable voice--the novel brings history to life. The condescending attitudes of the British toward (and their outrageous treatment of) the aborigines, a smuggling ship, a vicar in search of the Garden of Eden, and a doctor who theorizes about racial characteristics are all skillfully brought together to make a rollicking good read."},{"rating":"2","title":"historical novel re colonization of australia and environs","review":"Sometimes funny, sometimes long-winded (be prepared to flip pages when bored.)

Skip this one.By chance I picked this up on the way to Australia and made the critical error of judging this book by it's cover. Strong suit - nautical dust jacket art and salty Celtic personae from the 19th century. Weakness - unremarkable, irratating and languid roles.The hopscotch 30 year and dozen odd person narrative never developed and left me confused. Trying to pay attention to dated and disjointed \\"Journal Entries\\" and two dimensional characters, throughout an obscure era in Tasmanian history, only fueled my lack of interest. Unless you're truly turned on by Colonial Australian history, this will be a tough read.I was hooked by the nautical thread the book starts with, anticipated a payoff worthy of a 440 page read and was dissapointed. By the end I simply didn't care and was only comforted by the fact that I could donate this novel to charity.

I love the fact that its head turns 360 degrees because it makes so much fun and the fur is really soft. However it's quite tiring to move its wings if you have relatively small hand like me.

Either this fan is an imposter or Patton has gone severely down hill. It is somewhat flimsy. All metal but it flexes far too much. It seems like it is going to fly apart when it starts and then it settles down to a constant loud vibration. You will not easily sleep in the same room as this fan. Very low quality.

I purchased 3 16in fans in 1995.Two of them lasted about 5 years. Why, because these 2 fans did NOT have vents on the back of the motor and hence, over heated and burnt out. This is important to remember, always purchase a fan with vents in the back for cooling. The other fan purchased in 1995 did have vents. I lasted 22 years and finally burnt out. That is why I purchased the new 20in. fan.When I purchased them, they were made in USA, now they (or at least mine) are made in China. No big deal, China makes wonderful products now, unlike in the past. This new 20in fan works fine, I run it almost all day long. It does not seem to be quite as well built as the fans I purchased in 1995. I have not had it long enough to realy rate it yet. But, Patton's are the best you can purchase. You will not be disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"konabob","review":"My 5year old 20\\" Patton fan started cycling on and off due to overheating of the motor.

I actually like a certain amount of white noise from a fan, but this model is deafening. Seems best suited for light industrial/commercial use, such as in a gym, drying carpet, or keeping air circulating overnight-- in other words, yes, it puts out air, but you don't want any humans with normal hearing actually in the room while it is running. Also, there does not seem to be very much of an air output or decibel difference between the highest and the lowest settings. Quality seemed iffy, as well (grill bends/deforms easily).A note on assembly: I needed a wrench to remove the nuts on the sides-- instructions only called for a screwdriver. The removable front grill was awkward to put into place, and it took several attempts to get properly aligned.This is disappointing based on so many positive reviews and the clean, modern lines of what had potential to be a great (and good-looking) product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Portable Wind Tunnel","review":"This fan is really powerful.

Like her other work in this vein you have to suspend your disbelief, as the means of getting into this fairy-tale world is corny (in the same way that Star Trek is or will be one day.) But if you go along with it you find the stock characters trying a bit harder than most to convince you they are for real. The hero is Carse, mercenary, educated treasure hunter who gets mixed up with the disembodied Rhiannon. The woman, Ywain, enslaves him but the tables are soon turned. Rhiannon will finally get control of Carse's body but not before Carse manages to upset the whole careful balance of society. So who gets the girl? c'mon, read the book.Brackett admitted that plotting was the hardest aspect for her, but for her efforts she found logical circumstances to back up the formulas."},{"rating":"2","title":"Jesus, Mary, and Joseph","review":"Used to read this every year at Christmas season.

The fan section worked properly but the remote feature was important to me, and after wasting even more of my money to purchase extra batteries to ensure that it was not merely a battery problem, I attempted to return the unit to Amazon. Unfortunately, they refused to accept the return despite the defect because I had waited more than thirty days to open the unit. Amazon even refused to offer me a credit toward purchase of a working unit. To add injury to insult, the item sent to me had been previously returned by another customer who left the manual filthy and covered with fingerprints.Overall, this is a cheap unit, and the fans work, so I would suggest purchasing the model without the remote if you must have a Holmes.

I don't mind).My puppy loves this.

The thread tape at the top angle of our shower in our last house wasn't sealed well and we accidentally left it on (for a few days) and had some leakage into our basement.

Also, when the button wasn't pressed, it now leaked out the sprayer holes too. I am not sure why, as the first time I hooked it up it was fine. Also, the button on the sprayer is loose, like something is either halfway broken or it just wasn't made well to begin with. I am returning this.

Neither of my daughters enjoyed having their hair washed because using the plastic pail always led to soap in their eyes and a few tears. Now, however, the girls do not resist the need to rinse their hair.

Greed. Greed.It is not the contact problem but the voltage issue. The charger is designed not to take NiMH voltage which is 1.2V to 1.35V. And intentionally make not to start.

Big Letdown ."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works as expected","review":"This product works great, my phone died on a camping trip, and I had bought 2 of these. They charged it so I could talk on the phone and text on the way back. I use the Eneloop rechargeable batteries so I can recharge them after I use them.The other reviewer does not understand that his cell phone battery can store more energy than 2AA batteries. These chargers will add a couple hours of talk time but not fully charge your phone. If you need to fully charge your phone I would suggest a normal charger because these would take too many batteries for normal use.I love these chargers, and will always keep one in my car.

I was able to from somewhere, for my old T730; which I'm still using. I can't upgrade to a new phone, that would use these because I'd have to buy an entire another unit, not just the tips-Why? It's a scam, to make you re buy things you don't need. I've written energizer about it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tried 4 of these, none worked.","review":"My boyfriend and I both have the same phone (HTC Pro 2). So I ordered two of these chargers. When I received them, neither one would turn on (that little blue light) when I inserted batteries and covered, much less charge our phones. Tried inserting batties all kinds of ways, and tested them (fully charged), and nothing. Sent back and got a refund from energizer.Thinking it might have been a defective batch, I ordered two more from another vendor. Same thing. In process of getting refund now. I asked energizer if instead of cash they could send me some that WORK. Nope. They've discontinuted the product."},{"rating":"2","title":"For disaster work","review":"Batteries are usually brought in to disaster areas for use by disaster workers and victims alike. I bought four of these to power my smartphone (HTC Inspire) which is a current hog. They work when you can't be tied to a charging source. Mine came with both the mini and micro plug. An improvement would be a usb jack in the charger instead of the 3/32 mono phone jack. I'm looking for a 3/32 extension cord so I can leave the charger in my pocket instead of dangling off the bottom of my phone (hard on the jack). Someone should build one of these with maybe six AA and a usb jack."},{"rating":"1","title":"only 10% charged with Lithium battries!!","review":"I have the Droid Charge smartphone.

One publisher even stated online that since 2008 they have not been accepting unsolicited manuscripts but the book, published in 2011, said they still did. Five out of ten publishers I researched had different information than the book published.

The dice are excellent for play: they're big, cool colors and changing the 10 for the munchkin face gives a nice touch. The cards that come in the set are as always fun to read and fun to play with. I've rated this set 4 stars because this game is not for everybody, you basically have to like the fantasy rpg genre and understand things like the difference of race and class and such, but for those that do get it the game is awesomely fun."},{"rating":"1","title":"$[...]??? really???","review":"These are nothing but run of the mill game store dice, you can pick up the same ones at your local Card Came and Board Game store for under $10... If you seriously spend $[...] on a set of dice because they come in a box that says \\"Munchkin Dice\\" you have issues. Yea, they are discontinued, but that was because you could buy them anywhere and marking the price up $5 and putting them a box to fool people into buying them thinking they were special wasn't a very sound marketing idea... thus the \\"Munchkin Dice\\" was canned... save your money and go explore the many wonderful styles and colors you can find at your local store."},{"rating":"2","title":"Starkist Light Meat Tuna Fillets, Teriyaki, Real Fast food!","review":"Great tasting food at a fare price.

I must say, I'm pleasantly surprised at the combination. The fish is tasty, filling when combined with the rice, and doesn't stink like most cooked canned/pouch tuna. Maybe it's the marinade making it smell pleasant...I'm not terribly sure. I'm definitely going to keep this on hand for quick lunches and light dinners, as I would normally eat junk when I'm on the go. A quick 15 seconds in the microwave gets this pretty hot (but still edible without burning the tongue), so it's hard to make excuses to avoid eating it.All in all, this is a great alternative to the standard tuna salad. Enjoy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful and helpful","review":"Beautiful CD. I love that it has traditionall french songs and rhymes, as opposed to English ones translated into French. The info in the booklet is helpful, but I would recommend a book by Opal Dunn \\"Help your Child with a Foreign Language\\" as a much better option. Also, if you liked this CD, I believe you would also like \\"1,2,3, My First French Rhymes\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"We LOVE this CD!","review":"I've been listening to this CD with my son since he was about 9 months old. At first, I found it to be annoying and he barely noticed it. Fast forward -- he's now 16 months and starts to smile and/or 'dance' when it comes on and at other times listens intently.

This DVD is so incredibly basic that it is really only for the total novice. I was hoping to learn something new about these materials, but I could get the same info from reading the label on the back of each product. I thought the projects were very amateur as well.

Unfortunately, this is the most boring thing I've ever owned. MJM speaks in a slow monotonous monotone that just makes me cringe...I even tried fast forward without sound and the thing still just drags...you can't speed this thing up enough to make it interesting. The techniques are very basic and not at all advanced or interesting. My opinion? Skip this DVD and see MJM in person. None of her character shines through in this DVD."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Master of Tenor Sax!","review":"In my 20s & 30s I was fortunate to hear and see the great Herbie Fields,and many other well known saxaphone players of that era. A few years later, someone handed me thisLP by Georgie Auld, who I had never heard of. Pity, this man and his big bandarrangments have never received the accolades that they deserved. I played thatLP so much, I literly wore it out. I looked for another, but had no luck findingone. Thanks to the Internet and especially Amazon, I was able to find itreproduced on CD. While I don't think it's an exact copy of that original LP,it has an up-to-date stereo soundtrack, which enhances the big band arrangmentsof Georgie Auld and Billy May. It also has some additional tracks that weren'ton the original LP. I'm very pleased that Amazon offers many artists from thepast, that others don't. Maybe the man at the top appreciates great music fromthe best, not just the best known."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for BOB Duallie!","review":"This will do the trick if you need to keep *mostly* dry. I used it today in heavy rain, and my girlies stayed dry. You do have to make sure you pay attention to where water can collect. I fixed this issue by putting something underneath it to make the water run off. It really fits BOB duallies well, and for so little money! I like that I can secure it to the front wheel, and tuck it underneath in the basket (still attached) when I don't need it. This is nice when there's off and on rain. Very happy with this product! Mine did not have a smell either, and my girls were totally contained."},{"rating":"1","title":"it' ok, but.....","review":"So it would work just fine. However if you have a 19 month old sitting in the stroller that gives the whole thing a good kick, the two strapes on the bottom pop right of the cover and make it useless.Edit, even though the two straps had popped off way to easily I have managed to fix it and make it even better. Just attach some velcro to the parts of the stroller and the parts of the cover that you want to connect. A bit of extra work, but really worth the time and the effort."},{"rating":"1","title":"Completely dissatisfied","review":"It hardly fits our double stroller.

It doesn't fit the Bob at all, don't even try. I say the product is awful, though, because it ripped as I was taking it out of the package. It ripped along one seam so I figured I would still try it thinking I could tape it or something. As I tried to get it over the stroller it ripped again in several more places. Granted, it doesn't fit the Bob, and that is why I would expect it to rip if I was trying to force it on to make it fit. But I was being extra careful since it ripped as I was taking it out of the package. I sent it back. Pay the extra money and get the cover made for your specific stroller. I learned my lesson trying to be cheap."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible","review":"I have a double Schwinn Turismo jogging stroller and live in Washington so it is a much needed accessory. I went to put it on the stroller and it doesn't even fit. Plus, the velcro straps that are supposed to attach by the front wheel fell off. I didn't even get to see if they fit. I'm returning it and will pay the money for a good, decent one. This one is literally cheap. Guess you get what you pay for."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great CD","review":"Had this years ago, but lost it. I love about 60% of the songs on this CD, which is above average for me.

Specifically when he claims the Pure land is \\"here and now\\", which is not mentioned in the Pure Land sutras, or anything by the Pure Land patriarchs, especially Masters Honen, Shinran, and Rennyo. This is a ZEN concept, not a SHIN one. This is but just one of the modernist divergences that plague the Shin community today, that if it had happened in the 13th century would have earned it a place in the Tannisho. Not to mention the claims of modernists that Amida is a myth, or the Pure Land is not a real place. The Dharma Masters of the Shin tradition never said that.I cannot recommend this book as an introduction to Shin at all.

The Eco feature turns off the transformer completely when the power is good and the transformer is not needed. This saves 80 Watts relative to a comparable UPS. It has a fan, but the fan only runs when the power has been out for a few minutes and I'm on battery power, so in normal use it is silent. I had to use Windows under Parallels to set the alarm to off with my Mac. I don't want an annoying alarm when the power is out. I KNOW the power is out. Although it required windows to turn the alarm off, it stays off without Windows. This is a big advantage over UPSs of most brands which have an alarm you can't turn off."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cyberpower CP1500","review":"UPS arrived quickly and works great.

You would like to know what's on the other side. This book by Farnaz Ma'Sumian can provide you details on the beliefs of all the major religions in the world. The book offers an introductory overview of Hinduism, Zoroastrianism, Judaism, Buddhism, Christianity, Islam and Bahai.Additionaly Ma'Sumian has researched Near-Death Experiences (NDE) quite well and offers a broad explanation of current theories to these experiences.The book is fair, impartial and well written. For those seeking theological information on the subject of life after death this is a wonderful introduction."},{"rating":"2","title":"What a sicko!","review":"This book tells the story about David Parker Ray and his girlfriend, Cynthia Hendy, who would capture young women and enslave them in a trailer they called \\"The Toybox\\". They would be tortured and abused as well as having it videotaped for Ray's satanic cult. Three women survive the graphic violence and help put Ray behind bars (Hendy and other accomplices plead out). This book does tend to spend too much time on interviews with people who knew Ray and Hendy, but that might be to understand why they may have commited their crimes. The transcribed audiotapes of Ray in the book are graphic in language. Overall, it is a worthwhile read, as I finished it in less than a week."},{"rating":"2","title":"WOW","review":"I to heard of the book from the Montel Williams show and all I can say is WOW.

The writer consistently misspells place names, incorrectly translates Spanish words and phrases, makes sweeping generalizations about the people of New Mexico, uses quotation marks where they are unnecessary, over hyphenates, and rambles aimlessly through the story. The book is full of factual errors, negative stereotypes, and seems to rely heavily on local gossip. In fact, the only thing the author seemed to care about was printing transcripts from audio tapes made by Ray. I have never read a book that was as poorly written or researched."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ramblings of the Insignificant","review":"This book is filled with insignificant information from insignificant sources. The author apparently couldn't find enough fact to complete a whole novel on David Ray Parker and his group of followers or chose rather to fill the book with as much sensationalism as possible. He gives voice to people that have nothing to do with the case. There was little to no investigative journalism here. That being said, this book did manage to give a horrific glimpse into a gruesome world. It also managed to enlighten the reader about the level of difficulty in proving someone guilty in court. As well, the book demonstrated the predator's level of intelligence and acuity for research prior to and during his period of violence. The victims were those castaways of society that few care about. Thus, if the reader is willing to wind through all the other disengenous nonsense, she will percieve the true identity of a serial sadist."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Good","review":"Although I saw that Mr. Fielder had put a lot of information in this book, I thought it was a very poorly written, and subsequently published, book. There were so many typos, that I wondered if anyone had even bothered to proof-read the book. The printing was crooked and offset. The content of the book seemed to be out of place. I got the feeling that other than simply writing down everything he had found out, Mr. Fielder put little effort in insuring that his book was of a high, or even moderate standard. Had I known this all beforehand, I may not have purchased the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'm through with the true crime genre !!","review":"This book was well written. However, after reading it, I can no longer read true crime books. I always donate my books to the library but had to throw this one in the garbage so no one else would read it. The acts of Ray are so unspeakably horror-filled that he makes the circumcision of women in Iran look like nothing. What he did was so very sick that he should have been put down like an animal. I have never read about such a sick man in my life and I've been reading true crime for 45 years. If you like sadism, torture and the total pain of women, psychologically and physically, this book is for you. Otherwise, I advise everyone out there reading this review: Don't read this book. The content will make you shiver and puke. No normal person could read this book and enjoy it.

This is the one book I could not finish. I made it through about half of it and had to put it down because it was damaging my psyche.

I had to \\"tag\\" it so other people who remember it, and the novella it's based on, might be able to save themselves some frustration.It's a funny, enjoyable kid's book (I read it when I was nine or ten and loved it -- so unlike anything else out there at the time). A bit educational, as it does follow the original story fairly closely, with a lot of interesting \\"this is what was really going on behind the scenes\\" stuff. Dated? Maybe a little, but isn't every book, in one way or another?Oh, and Corbett's \\"Tricks\\" series was one of my favorites as a child as well. Definitely worth looking for -- I intend to pick up copies for my kids while they're young enough to enjoy them. Sweet, fun, kind, nothing that could even remotely be considered scary or dark.

It is about the most hollow-sounding saxophone playing I've ever heard; it makes it sound so inhuman and deprived of richness. His articulation lacks in some places as well. None of this is the fault of the recording, for the orchestra comes in loud and clear. He needs to try again."},{"rating":"1","title":"the most non musical sound i've ever heard","review":"I couldn't even listen to the entire cd. His vibrato is mechanical and his technique dosen't flow. Greg sounds like he is just reading the pieces for the first time. There is no heart in his plaing at all. The Rachmaninov doesn't have a flowing vocal quality at all. I stopped the cd after the first few minutes, then I was curious so I listened to the Glazunov and it was stiff, unmusical, the sections did not flow at all, there ws fluidity in the music. That piece is one of the only romantic pieces that sax player get to play and it had no characteristics of the style."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a new standard","review":"It is nice to hear these works recorded yet again, but Banaszak hardly sets a new standard for these works or for the saxophone in general. Those believing so haven't listened to enough players or recordings. Banaszak is either extremely overbalanced (by a marginal orchestra) or prefers to hide in an unrevealing--and unflattering--recording mix. The soloist and orchestra exhibit questionable intonation, and any profound interpretation that may be present is lost in muddled, directionless playing. The 'standard' has been redefined by so many other players that I have to disagree with the other reviews. Still, Banaszak must be commended for recording these pieces which all saxophonists know so well."},{"rating":"1","title":"One to skip","review":"Greg Banaszak certainly has the technically ability required of a classical saxophonist, but his interpretations are flat, emotionless, colorless, and ultimately boring. Especially disappointing is the Rachmaninoff, which Banaszak succeeds in completely butchering with his thin tone and painful vibrato. The Glazounov is acceptable, but still suffers from overdone vibrato. The first and third movements of the Ibert are okay, but the second movement, one of the most beautiful and lyric compositions in the saxophone repertoire, becomes a clumsy and boring jumble of drawn-out long notes. I would not recommend this album to anyone who is learning to play the pieces performed on this album (that was the reason for my purchase of the CD). There are many other recordings of these compositions which would be more useful to a saxophonist, and more enjoyable to the casual listener."},{"rating":"2","title":"Manly enough","review":"A dated but excellent resource for today's males as they are continuously told to get in touch with their mythical \\"Feminine Side\\" Nothin' in the book is going to be new to manly men but the book may help straighten out a man who has let some skirt play him for a sap.

I honestly think that is pretty good odds for a cookbook though. It all comes down to opinion, because some of the recipes that I've not cared for, other people have absolutely loved the results. I'm really attracted to the book's presentation - I think that it looks lovely. I also purchased the Buttercup Bakery cookbook and find that one to be about the same quality. As for the Magnolia cookbook, I think that it is a bit expensive for the size of it but I collect baking cookbooks and I wanted this one to add to my collection no matter what the price. I think it makes an attractive gift and I think that it's fine for baking beginners. The recipes are simple and made with basic ingredients.

I have been baking for over 30 years and have had great success with other cookbooks, but the recipes I have tried in this book are *complete disasters*. The cakes and cupcakes come out flat and dry. The icing recipes are very sweet and make very large amounts. I would caution cooks too not use these recipes for special occassions, bake sales, etc. unless you have first tried the recipes so you can make adjustments. In all fairness, it seems to be a problem caused by adjusting recipes to smaller batches coupled with insufficient testing.

In other words, the load of body's weight should be applied to certain sectors of the sole, so that the whole body stands upright correctly after some time of use. These ANGLER however, do not have that ergonomic design characteristic of ECCO and best versions of Stride Rite. Additionally, the ''XW'' version of these ANGLER looks rather like a ''W''.

I hooked up my Mac G5 Tower and my Dell PC and it wouldn't send a signal through to the monitor, a Samsung 24\\" flatscreen. Just.. nothing. A black screen. I tried restarting all of the computers, powering on/off the monitor, the KVM switch, and nothing worked. The USB light for the second computer wouldn't turn on either, even though it was connected properly. This KVM switch is worthless.I was unable to try the firmware upgrade because it required a serial port on a Windows machine. A SERIAL port? What year do they think this is?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for Mac and Viewsonic","review":"My application was for one PC (Radeon 9800); One Mac G4 (Radeon 9000) and an Apple Powerbook connected to a Viewsonic VX900 display. I thought this would be ideal as it includes cables and I could replace my miniview VGA/USB KVM switch. I could not get the display to work consistantly with the Macs without resetting the display video. Having to press a button one or more times on the display after hitting the KVM switch will never fly so I've returned it. Maybe the problem was with the Viewsonic, but it doesn't matter, as I'm not about to replace the monitor. If I do replace the display, my next monitor will be at least 1920 x 1600 resolution, so this KVM won't scale to that resolution either (per the spec sheet).I do like the hot-key features, and the separate USB and KVM switching.

He probably saved a large number of more raw recruits as he was a training officer and gave his extensive training knowledge to others, but it does not make a great combat narrative.Also, while there are some interesting parts about the plane, there is really very little detail about how night fighting developed, or why.

Too important of a topic too trust a cynic with."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Primer of the American Revolution","review":"I would recommend this book as the first to read when studying the war. Excellent portrayal of general events and how they happened. A very good general account of the major names of that day and how they contributed to the war. Could have used better/more detailed maps. A must read for those that study American history."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Work.","review":"George Washington's War was my first book by Robt Leckie, who has since become one of my favorite authors. The book looks at a fairly long period in our history, and in that sense the title is misleading. Nonetheless, Washington is the pivotal character in the story that begins with the French-British struggle for North America and ends with the British expulsion to the north. The story is told even-handedly, and while Washington himself is beyond reproach, American policy making and execution will make most citizens squirm rather frequently. I have a strong feeling I'll re-read this book somewhere down the road."},{"rating":"2","title":"Haters of high-school history, rejoice!","review":"Robert Leckie combines narrative skill withsolid history to bring tolife the trial of the American Revolution.

The bulk of the text consists of 2-3 page biographies of various personalities more that might be more appropriate for an 18th century edition of People magazine than a historical text. Leckie is exceedingly opinionated and judgemental, and apparently thinks he can read the minds of people who have been dead for 200 years. Leckie's editorializing is so heavy-handed that it undermines his credibility. The book increased my interest in the American Revolution, and left me hungry for a _serious_ history of that war."},{"rating":"1","title":"loose wire","review":"This product works great, but only for a short time before shorting out.

The way teaching is carried out in this textbook is terrible. It teaches what nouns,verbs,and subjects are, but doesn't teach how to relate all that into a sentence. The examples are nothing but sentences with no explanation as to how the nouns, verbs, and subjects relate or interact with each other. That is the best analogy i can think of as to how this book doesn't do its job very well. If you have four years to learn C, sure buy this book, take a month on each chapter and you're good.

As I found the film \\"Into Great Silence\\" to be visually and aesthetically breath-taking, I was a bit apprehensive about the simple sounds of the Office. This recording is, however, marvelous, with enough bells, kneeler banging, wheezing, coughing to set the mind's eye alight with magnificent and simple peace. As a companion to the film, it is excellent. On its own, it is wonderfully complex and delightful.

For Gregorian Chant one can buy CDs of the monastic choirs of Solesmes and Fontgaumbult, to name only two sources of Gregorian Chant that have great sound quality and choirs.

At first I was surprised that Olympus' telephone recording device was an ear-bud instead of attaching to the phone cord. Then I realized what an improvement it was - you can use it on a cordless phone, a cell phone, or a call over a computer through the internet! The sound quality is great - or as good as your phone connection, anyway.Two notes: (1) It comes with two adapter jacks, but the instructions are minimal to figure out which to use. (2) Make sure to plug the jack into the recorder's \\"mic\\" plug, not the \\"ear\\" plug. It will still record if plugged into the wrong jack, but the sound quality will be terrible."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beware of loud static in your recordings from cellular interference!","review":"I bought this product thinking it would answer my needs for recording interviews conducted by cell phone.However, after plugging the device into my Olympus digital voice recorder and doing a test run, I realized a major flaw. The recording was full of cell phone interference and was basically not listenable. It was the same sort of buzzing/static you often hear if your cell phone is in use near computer speakers.It appears that this device offers no shielding from this electromagnetic interference. Considering that it was made to be used with cell phones, this is an enormous design flaw. From what I understand, this interference is present on all GSM phones and it definitely is present on my AT&T; Blackberry.A major letdown and I will be returning the product as a result. Hopefully I can find another recording option for use with cell phones."},{"rating":"1","title":"Audio, excellent; but wire lifetime, 3 months at most","review":"There is no question that the audio part of this device works well; but what use is it if the wire would not last more than 3 months.

However, when I recorded a conversation the person's voice on the other line comes out very low. So low is the voice that it is more like a murmur; you can't really decipher what the person is saying. I had the volume to the max on the Ipod but to no avail. I do not know if the TP7 that I got was defective or if it simply does not work with the Ipod Touch. I would like to test it on an Olympus Digital Recorder, but I don't have one. To me it was more convenient to use it with my Ipod because I carry it everywhere all of the time and it is less obvious that you may be using the Ipod as a recording device."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful device","review":"I am very pleased with my purchase and would not hesitate to recommend Item being reviewed the Olympus TP-7 Telephone Recording.Kelly"},{"rating":"1","title":"Worthless","review":"I bought this back in March to record business cards.

I'd been using a device that plugs into a landline phone, and it is liberating to be able to record from my cell phone and conduct interviews away from my desk.

I faced such problem once and I just couldn't proof that the company promised me something that was denied later. Had I recorded those conversations, and I'd had never been cheated by them.

Perfect to use to recall information and keep track of meetings.Before purchasing, I compared the in-line recording device that one just plugs into the phone and a recording device. I didn't want something that was bulky and recorded on one channel. I went with this device hoping it would work for me. It did.

Just plug it into the voice recorder, put the earpiece in your ear and hold the phone over that ear. It picks up the caller's voice and your voice and captures the conversation on the digital recorder. The recording quality isn't the best, but using SP mode on the recorder, it's good enough. This is probably more a reflection on my inexpensive recorder than on the TP-7."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works great with my Olympus digital voice recorder","review":"I like this device so much that have ordered a spare; because if it breaks, I don't want to be without it for even one day. Not that I expect it to break, but nothing lasts forever, and I use it a lot. I use it with my Olympus WS-331M digital voice recorder and it works perfectly. I'm amazed at how clear the recordings are.A lot of people have commented the it records their voice louder than the voice of the other person. That isn't dependent solely on this device: it also depends on how loud you talk, how close you hold the phone to your mouth, and, on some phones, the volume setting of the phone. I get different results depending on all of these factors, but the difference is never so much that the recordings are difficult to listen to.The wire is short enough that I've pulled my recorder off my desk when reaching for something. That's no fun when it happens in the middle of a call, so watch out for that."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great item!","review":"My experience matches most of the others - this is a useful, effective item.

I like to switch the phone to the other ear during phone calls, and you obviously can not in order for this to work. I've missed my earhole several times now, but it still recorded just fine.

The hole saw just spins and spins and eventually makes a groove. For wall tile a carbide grit hole saw works much better and for floor tile one needs to use a diamond hole saw. The Milwaukee carbide tipped does not work very well on chipboard either as there is not much offset with the teeth and so the side wall rubs the entire time it is cutting. It is OK for fiberglass and for fiber cement board like Hardie siding where it lasts 4 times as long as a bi-metal hole saw. Getting the cut piece out is a chore as the side slots only go part of the way. The tungsten carbide hole saws with the slots that go the entire length of the side are a lot faster to clear to start the next hole. Very expensive for the little gain in performance with Hardie board and bi-metal hole saws are a better way to go unless you have to make a lot of holes and then the TCT hole saws work best."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointing.

Hawkwind has always been a group, and the only real composer/performer here is Brock, so it is a Brock solo album. Further, most of the material is just reworked bits for other Hawkwind albums. And the bits that have been reworked are really weak. Most of the tracks are under two minutes, so they really don't go anywhere.

The content is concentrated on social issues rather than events of the war or strategies. While the footage and letters used are obviously valid and interesting glimpses of the times, it appears that the selection of material and editing was done with respect to a modern progressive mindset.There were a lot of gruesome deaths in the war and many minorities were treated unfairly.

It is no surprise then that the well known actor and anti-war activist Martin Sheen is its narrator. Insulting to the intelligence of the average person. Reading or viewing personal narratives of American soldiers and American prisoners of war in the Pacific arena would be far more enlightening as to what the U.S. was truly fighting for, not this poor re-write of history that is blatantly anti-American, Anti-war and Anti-truth.

However the mfr Abkco has tried to \\"hide\\" that fact by not changing the cover and/or even the Part Number from when it WAS an SACD. As many know, record companies have spent large $$$ to remaster records for SACD high-def format, which was introduced around 2002. Unfortunately, due to slow sales they are no longer promoting this format, and Abkco took the dis-ingenuous step of deleting the SACD-layer from this formally Hybrid disc after just one year. Since about 2005, when you buy this (as well as Abkco's Stones discs) all you'll get is CD layer, as they've downgraded these products without telling buyers. A bad business practice for sure!

I was in high school when the British invasion was in its prime, and these songs are part of the soundtrack of my youth. But as great as the SACD sound is, many of the tracks here are in mono. I know there were stereo versions of most of the mono tracks here, and for Abkco to deliver these tracks in mono, with no real explanation as to why, is a gross mistake. On those tracks presented here in stereo, the sound is phenomenal. I highly recommend \\"Sky Pilot\\" as perhaps the best sounding track here.

Well I guess they have a clock that tells them when to die because after 2 years this one started doing the exact same things and let me tell you, after seeing the lightning inside the microwave again (BTW no metal or foil) this one is on the way to be recycled and I'm waiting for my Panasonic."},{"rating":"1","title":"Broke after 15 months","review":"Microwave is nice, except that it did not last more than 15 months. Was not used very much, so should have lasted many years. Will cost about $80 to repair the heating element, since only the part is covered under warranty, not labor.

To be fair, whilst researching other comments, it seems that this is a typical lifespan for current microwaves in this price range.

Finally the same day the microwave unit would not run at all.Tried unplugging it to reset the electronics but no luck.I'm very disappointed in the quality of the current Sharp microwaves. Would have given it a zero but that isn't possible.

This book is misrepresented in what it claims to be about. It contains very little information specific to embedded FreeBSD.The author should have written much more about minimizing the kernel, limiting memory usage, device driver development, and flash storage issues - because these are the topics that are the most relevent to an embedded system. The discussion about using Tomcat, JSP, and JNI to provide web access to an embedded device - while important - is severely lacking.A good book about an embedded operating system will explore the problems and trade-offs that a systems developer will have to make. It would also discuss getting the OS to run on a single board computer - such as one of the devboards listed in the FreeBSD ARM project.

Fine if you intend to travel only on the autostrade and other main roads, but one of the joys of driving in this region is finding small roads, sometimes unpaved, which can lead to small medieval hamlets (known as 'borghe')that have remained basically unchanged for centuries.There are a number of excellent maps produced but in my many travels in Italy, I have always found the maps produced by the Touring Club Italiano (TCI), and distinguished by the bright green cover with the TCI logo, to be unfailingly brilliant.

But that was not the case."},{"rating":"1","title":"Barely better than free maps","review":"We rented a car in Rome, and the only map they had was a country map (if you rent in Florence, they have a Tuscany map). The Italy map had almost as much detail as this map (this map was a little easier to read because the region was enlarged). Driving in Tuscany is tricky - the intersections usually only have the next town, and not the road numbers. The next town will usually be too small to show up on this map, and many of the small roads aren't on here either. Most intersections will just be a list of places that aren't on this map. Never let your gas get below 1/4 tank because you'll get lost a lot, and never know when you'll be able to fill up again (this is probably good advice even with a good map)."},{"rating":"2","title":"helpful map of Tuscany","review":"I love these streetwise maps.

We ordered a walking/touring map from every city we will be visiting during our month in Italy, each one showing street names, attractions, wonderful.

If it is a walking touring map you are looking for, this is NOT the map for you, it is rubbish, complete rubbish. The Rome, Florence, Naples, Venice are all perfect, why this one is so different than the rest I will never know but they need to flag it somehow so that others do not buy this useless map thinking it is like the rest of the series.

Relentlessly catchy, yet intimate and obviously heartfelt. I am a bit of a snob when it comes to music, but the songwriting genius here is hard to deny. The production is flawless and I believe he produced it himself as well. This instantly feels like one of those records that will be all over the radio, but I will still be able to enjoy it years from now no matter how many times I hear it. It hasn't left my CD player yet. The songs are that good.

White, Latina Mythica by Bonnie A Catto (Professor of Classics, Assumption College, Worcester, Massachusetts) is a highly accurate collection of classic Roman Mythology excerpts in Latin. Inclusive of grammar and comprehension questions, discussion questions, cultural influences of each myth in art, music, ballet, and literature, ten original black and white illustrations, map of place names mentioned in the myths, genealogical charts, list of ancient sources cited, bibliography, and an end vocabulary, Latina Mythica is a superb learning tool, and very strongly recommended for all students of the Latin language, as well as Roman culture and myth. Also strongly commended to Latin Studies collections is Professor Catto's earlier work, Lucretius: Selections From De Rerum Natura."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good text, poor illustrations","review":"This is a good book for those studying Roman mythology and beginner-intermediate Latin. It is similar to Groton's Latin Stories for Wheelock: it has many stories in Latin, each with a helpful vocabulary list, each story a bit more difficult than the previous one. There is also a master vocabulary in the back. The stories are for the most part told well, using the most popular versions. There are English introductions to the stories, including introductions to some famous authors of antiquity. There are a couple of famous drawings, paintings, or sculptures in each chapter, which is nice. At the end of each story there are some study questions which I could do without but some people may find helpful. If there is anything I didn't really like it would have to be the sketches by Christopher White; they are really awful and completely out of place.

Instead the book didn't contain many practical ideas and was filled with a heavy pro-christian agenda. I never realized that I could use giving children piano lessons as a method of not only picking up extra income, but I could turn it into an opportunity to covert children into my belief system. While I'm by no means anti-christian, the book doesn't help deal with many of the day to day lessons and issues that many of us face with making such a tough, and personal choice. To sum up the book, the lesson is that God will provide, which many of us are aware of from our Bible teachings. If you're looking for a handbook with good lessons, skip this book.

It seems to assume that everyone would make that decision given the financial stability necessary to do so. While it is based on Christian values, it often does so at the expense of sensibility, i.e., cashing out your 401K to stay at home.

First, the entire thing has very strong Christian overtones, and I happen to follow a non-Christian religion. I also find advice like \\"Trust in God, God is the Ultimate Money Manager\\" unhelpful at best and dangerous at worst. God helps those who help themselves! Now, there's nothing wrong with that if it's what you were looking for, but this was reviewed as a practical guide, not a spiritual one!Even beyond that, much of the advice is vague and a lot of it is devoted to anecdotes from stay-at-home moms and their husbands about how much better life is and how much happier their children are since the transition.As a woman contemplating motherhood and cutting my hours down severely, I was looking for a sensible guide to managing finances with clear advice and sample numbers of budgets from families who have successfully done the same thing. This is not that book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too much of a Christian Agenda","review":"This book should come with a warning label alerting readers to Gochnauer's Christian agenda. I wanted a straightforward, \\"how-to\\" book and what I got was a heavy-handed sermon (complete with cited Biblical references) which got old quick. This works for her, apparently, but I obviously do not share her simplistic philosophy. She even goes so far as to say she debates Darwinism in favor of Creationism! Be careful if you don't share these views - there is nothing in the descriptions to alert you before you buy. If you really want to have a better plan than \\"God will provide\\" before you quit your job, check out \\"Miserly Moms\\" by Jonni McCoy for a better, more practical guide, or \\"You Can Afford to Stay Home with Your Kids\\" by Malia McCawley Wyckoff and Mary Snyder."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Advice From One Who's Been There!","review":"This book is great for if you're thinking about either cutting back your hours or staying home full-time with your kids.

The book's an easy read, and very well laid out. Also, I want to stress that this book is nonjudgmental about people who ARE currently working full-time. The book's meant to be a supportive resource, not a condemnation to full-timers (as some other similar books I've read can seem).

It is true that it includes many exciting techniques, but the instructions are very poorly written (including editing mistakes and typographical errors) and frequently less than helpful.Some of the editing choices that were made were questionable. For example, on one page there is an image of an (admittedly lovely) brooch and another \\"detail\\" photograph of the same brooch--only the \\"detail\\" picture is only slightly larger than the original and therefore doesn't add any extra information.The artwork selected is also disappointing.

While I love Clancy, Dale Brown, et. al, their work usually takes me half the book to get into. I can read Hunter from page one and be on the edge of my seat. This book, while not as good as Point of Impact and Time to Hunt, has all the elements of a great tale; heroes, villians, reluctant heroes, self-serving individuals, reformed criminals, cheating spouses, and a pulse-pounding finale that goes on for about 100 pages. A great read!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Hunter never lets you rest!","review":"This is one of Hunter's best books, because if this scenario really happened - it would ruin your whole day. Highly recommended!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic","review":"This book was fantastic. I could not turn the pages fast enough to see the story develop. It was non-stop action from start to finish, but also enough detail, story and character development to keep the reader on edge. Be warned, it is obviously a little dated because of its cold war theme, but don't be too concerned -- its still a great action story. The book is definitely one of the most exciting, interesting books I have ever read. This is my second Hunter book, and he definitely does his homework. His research and knowledge is unmatched."},{"rating":"2","title":"Stephen Hunter's best besides \\"Point of Inpact\\"","review":"In general, this book is pretty good, but it's just missing the little somethings that made Point of Impact so great. In this book, Stephen Hunter reminded me of Michael Crichton's books like Jurassic Park & The Sphere. The protagonists solve one problem and another arises. They say, \\"Uh-oh, what if they think of...\\" and we cut to the antagonists doing just that. Entertaining, and the specifics aren't predictable, but you kind of settle into a groove while reading this book. I was interested enough to keep reading, but it wasn't a glued-to-the-pages-all-night page turner like Point of Impact was. Very well written, but we've seen all the elements a hundred times. Kind of like watching Carlito's Way-- yes, it's pretty well done, but haven't we seen all this before"},{"rating":"2","title":"Action thriller with kick","review":"I really enjoy well done action stories like this one. Hunter creates great, complex action plots in this very gripping story. I listened attentively though the whole thing and loved it. Excellent story. The book has depth and the characters are real and believable, even the bad guys. There is suspense and violence, but you feel it as part of the plot, not a separate thing thrown in after the fact to whip things up.

I had to buy another copy, that is when I saw the chance to review it. Well worth your reading time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not up to par","review":"First of all, I am a huge fan of Stephen Hunter, but this book is far below usually the edge of your seat thriller. The story line is very unbelievable, the characters are weak, far too complicated and dull. I have read all of Mr. Hunter's novels and I can't believe he even wrote this book. But me being a fan of his, I will continue to read his books, but don't waste your time with this one. Granted this is a fiction novel, but usually you can imagine some of the storyline actually happening but not on this one. Far too unbelievable and far fetched."},{"rating":"1","title":"One implausibility after another","review":"Full of stereotypes, stock characters, mindless violence, and worst--a plot that turns on really stupid decisions by the major players. A big disappointment. Not in the same class as Point of Impact which has a riviting plot, great characters, believable dialogue, and violence that moves the story forward--not just violence for the sake of blowing stuff up and people away."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Bother!","review":"I believe I've read all of Hunter's novels and this one was by far the worst. The story line wasn't remotely plausible, the characters were absolutely flat and utterly unlovable and the writing itself was just plain bad. It was actually so bad (and I may never have done this before) I couldn't get more than a 1/3 of the way into it before I put it down for good. Everything else by Hunter, especially the Swagger novels, I would rate as good at their worst (Night of Thunder). But it seems like here Mr. Hunter got into an area where he lacked sufficient background and he didn't really seem interested in producing a Swagger quality read. I definitely wouldn't bother."},{"rating":"2","title":"Non-Stop Page Turner!","review":"This could easily be my favorite book by Stephen Hunter. An thrilling countdown chase from page one. Hunter overlays the multiple plot lines in a maddening manner guaranteed to keep you reading long after you meant to put the book down. Each chapter ends with the thread of a cliffhanger he won't resolve for another two chapters or so and by that time you've now gotten caught up wanting to follow those threads!So sit back, give in, read it straight through and just enjoy the ride."},{"rating":"1","title":"DID NOT WORK","review":"These speakers did not work for me at all.

There are two cylinder shaped speakers about 3 1/2 inches high with a 3 3/4\\" diameter ...also a dock for the ipod. These speakers are OK. They sound good at a lower volume only. If volume goes much higher they start to distort. They are good size for a desk. My son put them on a shelf at the head of his bed.

Do NOT waste your money on this thing. It is FIVE years old (I live in Seattle and met one of the authors before she left in June '99). The information is totally outdated and some of the campsites no longer exist! My advice is to get a good guide that is updated regularly, maybe get a good idea for a route from the Mountaineers and then get the Michellin map following the scenic (green) routes (or get the special bikes maps from any bookstore (librarie) while you are there).

I loved this book at first, but now is totally out of date and desperately needs a re-do. The first pages of general information about customs, train travel, history, language, cycling culture, etc are great. However, the rest of the book is filled with routes and acomodations that no longer exist and missing many many new routes that have come along in the past decade. For example, cycling along the Loire River is superb along the new EuroVelo6 bike route that did not exist at the time of this book's publication in 2001. It's a paved signed path along The Loire hundreds of miles long and totally separate from cars. France is promoting cycle tourism like crazy, but there is lots of new stuff to know.

The majority of the book is basic repairs that are covered better in other books such as my favorite \\"MX-5 Miata Enthusiast's Workshop Manual\\".

I would have given the novel a 2.5, and I was not so moved to give it a 3. I loved some of the story, but most of it was silly. I work in law enforcement and deal with cold cases, so the whole evidence tampering was possible, but I thought the motive was silly. If someone did manufacture evidence, I don't think it would have happened like this. I thought that the Crime Scene Tech who began initially committing perjury because he believed the people were guilty, but he definately stepped over the line when he killed Mary, his partner. I think the fact that Amanda Jaffe and her father appeared was one of the most redeeming factors in the novel, but overall, I thought that it was lacking."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Read","review":"While there's no mystery to be solved, the real mystery is just how long it'll take for everyone to figure out what's going on -- and that's what kept me turning the pages.The one thing that really bugged me though was the relationship between Amanda and Mike which seemed to move at warp speed. One minute she's lamenting to herself about being alone...the next she's accepting a date from Mike...the next they're suddenly in love. It was unrealistic and I really couldn't care less about them because of it."},{"rating":"2","title":"good writer delivers again","review":"This pertains to the excellent audio book reading by Nanette Savard.

This is my third Margolin book and so far they all have been up to par and entertaining."},{"rating":"1","title":"Proof of Lazy Writing","review":"What a lazy and poorly written book for a writer who has been so thrilling in his previous novels. I cared so little for the \\"good guys\\" that the \\"evil\\" medical examiner was not fearful. The head of the mob and his henchman seemed far worse - torturing, etc.It should come as no surprise that not all readers are going to root for Frank, the boring mob lawyer and his self righteous daughter who are defending characters that are uninteresting. I never was made to feel anxious on their behalf. Breach, the poorly dressed, sadistic mob boss acts like Amanda is his god-daughter or something. There is something very wrong with that. I don't care if his henchman, Prochaska, is wrongfully convicted anyway.For Frank and Amanda to be worth rooting for you need a truly hideous \\"bad guy\\" as was the case in Wild Justice. On their own, they are not intersting or vulnerable enough to make us worry about their cases especially with such uninteresting clients."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can't imagine why he is a best selling author","review":"The writing here just does not live up to other authors such as Connelly, Sandford, Martini, etc. The story seems weak to me. Portland is not that big of a city and yet when a criminalist and an attorney are murdered others in the legal community either barely knew of it or seemed rather unconcerned. If the attorney you were working with on a big case gets murdered, you would most likely talk about it as the first subject with everyone you know.None of the characters were well developed or made you care about them. No tension, no drama, nothing to think about as you pretty much knew it all early on. Except of course why am I reading this."},{"rating":"2","title":"What got me hooked","review":"This was the first Philip Margolin book that I read and the one that got me hooked- it is so far one of my favorites.

This author was touted as \\" a master of plot and pacing\\", and it was said he \\"knows how to pack in the thrills\\". Well, if he does, it certainly did not show in Proof Positive.From very early on, it was painfully obvious what was going to happen, and who would be doing it. But I kept reading, thinking I was just getting ahead of myself and seeing the simpler side of things, and that the twists and turns were coming soon. They didn't. A second grader could have read this and told you the outcome by the third chapter.There are no surprises, no twists, and ultimately, no joy from this book. Bland beyond measure, I found this book absolutely boring and witless. Third grade reading level readers will enjoy this predictable, cookie cutter book. I did not."},{"rating":"1","title":"An unrealistic defense-attorney fantasy","review":"Having read several of Mr. Margolin's previous books, I found this story much weaker than the other stories, and so implausible as to be exasperating. This is a defense attorney's silly fantasy in which all defendants in the account (at least five distinct legal proceedings) are actually innocent; they are only being prosecuted because of craven malice on the part of the police, the DA's office and the criminalist. Granted that the villain is falsifying evidence, you would think that at least in SOME of the cases the defendants would actually have committed the crimes of which they have been accused."},{"rating":"2","title":"Masterpiece","review":"I just got it in the mail a couple of days ago and I'm memerized by it. It was everything and more I hoped for. Somewhat on the same lines as Angel and the Dark River in sound, it is different in the way there are more songs on the album with shorter and more melodic tracks. The guitar sound is also very different. It is a very processed sound with very clean distortion and has more treble then bass.. Reminds me of a early 90's band \\"Anacrucsis\\". The voilins and keyboards are well played and the bass guitar is excellent. My favorite track on it is \\"A Kiss to Remember\\". One of the best songs I've heard from this band. The whole cd is good. There is not one average part in any of these songs. They glare right at you in the face and with passion."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful Metal!","review":"You can not expect MASTER OF PUPPETS from this cd. But this album rocks!

This book is an exception, as I found that all of the stories are first rate, and extremely interesting. The premise of the book is that all are written by females, and the protagonists are females.

Michael Schumacher's book really captures the spirit and energy of this facinating and complex man. I have read most of the other Coppola books and none combines an understanding for both the human and artistic side of Francis.This book, like no other I have read, reflects the passion, energy and chaos of the Coppola world. I can tell you from the inside there is no more exciting experience than being part of the Coppola energy. Francis loves to tackle the \\"impossible\\" and never gives up. I particularly like this book because it is clear that the author, like myself, has great respect for this whirlwind of a man."},{"rating":"1","title":"sad to see an old friend die","review":"For many years I have enjoyed reading Garfield. He was always one of my favorite characters and I own many of his early books.In his latest books (including the 26th) I noticed that the strips seemed different. They weren't as fun to read. They were missing something. Recently I found out what that 'something' was.Being a big fan of comic strips, I bought a book that told about the strips and also about the cartoonist. I read in that book that Jim Davis no longer draws his own strip any more. He now hires someone else to draw it. He still supplies the ideas, but he is now concentrating on turning the strip into an advertisement for Garfield products.The missing part? The strip no longer has a soul.

I have officially had it. I have had it with Stephen Frey's repugnant dialogue, cliched characters, implausible plots, and refusal to research anything outside the financial world. All of which come into play in his latest offering, The Legacy. We are asked to believe so many ridiculous events and characters that it ultimately becomes far too much for Frey to ask of his readers.

How did the rest of the book go downhill -- or was it nowhere?-- so quickly? I'm a fan of all Frey's other books but I was majorly disappointed with \\"The Legacy.\\" For the first time, I didn't find too much sympathetic about the flawed hero; the female characters are still cardboard; and DAMN IT! The entire chase around the tape was built around vague, neverly fully defined or explained motives. If you read this book thinking you're really going to get an interesting \\"what if\\" tale about the JFK assassination, forget it. Go read all twenty-some volumes of the Warren Report, they'll be just as gripping.

It didn't happen, of course, it's fiction. But it could have...The basic weakness of this novel is that there are too many \\"out of the blue\\" plot twists. The reader feels jerked around, manipulated, and the story comes off as completly unbelievable.She's his friend...no wait, she's a government agent...no, wait, she works for the mafia...no, wait, she has a heart of gold. It's too much, even for someone who has signed that silent pact to suspend disbelief.The basic plot here is intriguing. As a JFK assasination buff, I was drawn into the story. But once inside, I found it far less than satisfying.END"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Get Caught Up In \\"The Legacy\\"","review":"This book avoids a one star rating because of the main idea of the story, a second tape of the Kennedy assassination on the other side of his motorcade. Fry could do so much with that story, but instead writes a very bad book. He puts his hero into many corners, and doesn't know how to get him out of them. So, Cole (the hero) always has a gun, knife, or set of keys nearby which appear from nowhere. Another problem is the whole father-son business. Cole's father is dead, then he isn't. His dad as only one copy of the tape, then two. And, whgy would someone who has seen their son less than ten times in their entire life send this tape to him? Why not sell it himself? Oh, his dad is in another agency, caled the DIA. Do yourself a favor, do not get this book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Great premise, bad execution.","review":"A tape proving the conspiracy theory in the Kennedy assassination was an intriging premise, however, the execution of the idea was so contrived that it deserves 2 stars - at best. Within 10 minutes of being informed of his father's death and taking delivery of the tape, the hero is running around New York being shot at, bouncing off taxi cabs and having his apartment blown up. Everyone is a good guy, then a bad guy, then a good guy. Don't bother, this is just too unbelievable to be enjoyable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Toothpicks and Library Paste","review":"What a stinker. I agree with a previous reviewer's point that every time Frey steps out of the financial genre, he stumbles. The finance side of this book, small though it is, is well-done. The rest is plain awful with one deus ex machina after another rescuing Cole. This thing is formulaic, and it's flat. It was probably knocked off in a couple of weekends. I'm a fan no longer."},{"rating":"1","title":"DO NOT BUY OR READ THIS BOOK","review":"Do not read this book, unless you like a diet of dog food. Frey's standard fare of horrific plots and stupid twists continue. Save your $17."},{"rating":"1","title":"A not so good book","review":"Stephen Frey should really stick to his financial triller rather than trying to write some half-pass six type of political suspense.I would recommend the Stephen Frey's fan to give this a miss and to read \\"The Takeover\\" instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a piece of garbage","review":"A halfway-decent plot concept ruined by Mr. Frey. This book is plagued by bad storytelling and poor research. Numerous factual errors about the JFK assassination and the US intelligence community force the reader to questions Frey's credibility as a writer ... he probably cranked out this piece of garbage in a weekend."},{"rating":"1","title":"I thought this one was dumb. He should stick to what he knows","review":"This one is (another) Kennedy assassination conspiracy. Frey is best when he writes about deals, intrigue and all the rest of it. This wasn't bad, but it didn't really hold my interest because of the plot. For those who care, it's alright. But it doesn't fall apart like another book in terms of writing. He's an uneven writer. Some are great insider views into the world of VCs and deals, but the writing falters. Others are better written, like this one, but the plot is silly.Well, if you like that sort of thing..."},{"rating":"2","title":"My first read and favorite","review":"The first novel of Frey's that I picked up, and couldn't put down until I finished it. I found myself drawn through page after page, chapter after chapter, by Frey's excellent style that just sucked me into the book and wouldn't let go. I found the plot interesting and the twists surprising. A great action read."},{"rating":"1","title":"How does this stuff get into print?","review":"Come on. We (book buyers) aren't all a bunch of morons. How this book got agented, shopped, published, reviewed placed, and is probably a better story. Really. It was poorly written and badyly edited and I want my money back.Period."},{"rating":"1","title":"Frey is becoming like Grisham (and that's not a good thing)","review":"Frey is starting to crank out books too quickly like Grisham has done. The Legacy was somewhat entertaining, but there wasn't any depth to it. He needs to slow down and take his time with his next book. His \\"The Takeover\\" was great, but he's been slowly going downhill ever since."},{"rating":"2","title":"Someone on the Grassy Knoll....","review":"Cole Egan, a bond trader in New York, obtains a videotape of John F. Kennedy's assassination. This tape proves the second gunman theory is true. The real story is about the various forces that want to keep this information from the pubic. Many of the reviewers wish it would delve into the assassination plot, but that is not the author's plot. In Cole, we have a vulnerable character that has had an unusual past and uncertain future. He is added and deterred by many well-constructed character throughout the story. The story is fast paced and would make a great movie. The only drawback is the sappy ending."},{"rating":"1","title":"caveat emptor (reader beware)","review":"Cole Egan finds that his dad left more than a videotape of the Kennedy assassination for him when he died. He also left behind a team of killers intent on getting the tape at any cost.Will Cole outsmart these killers or will he fall victim to the legacy?Stephen Frey exploded from the blocks in this fast-paced novel, but ended up sputtering. Cole Egan develops streetsense fromwho-knows-where, everything going according to plan for him. The ending is incomprehensible, with the reader left wondering who killed Kennedy.Forget The Legacy; read the newspaper."},{"rating":"1","title":"Totally Unbelievable","review":"The storyline of this was unbelievable. Every time the central character gets in an impossible jam, he miraculously has anticipated the 'surprise'. How does this stuff get into mainstream print? Yuck."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent, fast past, suspense, edge of your seat thriller!","review":"A very interesting take on the Kennedy assassination. Not a far fetched theory. Fast paced, lots of suspence. Just when you think you know what is happening, and who are good and bad, Frey changes it up!!! Awesome story, would make a great movie! Definitely worth a read!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A \\"Yawner\\"","review":"Celeste Yarnell is beautiful in this production; however The movie couldn't be more boring and the ending more stupid. Clearly low-budget. I was hoping to at least see some erotic scenes including Celeste, but that didn't happen either. Another vampire movie w/o bite and literally no fangs."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Velvet Vampire","review":"Personally I found this movie more than a little wanting. I love vampire movies and have a fairly large collection of them and I bought this one to add to them but am sad for doing so now. I found the acting to be equal to a late night TV movie and the story line that falls just short of poor. I don't need a lot of blood or gore in a movie to make it good but a little bit of terror comes in handy when talking about vampires. I would have to say that if your looking for a movie to kill time with this movie might be ok but if you are looking for a good vampire movie save your money.The Velvet Vampire"},{"rating":"1","title":"One of the worst","review":"Thank god I didn't buy this DVD. I rented here at Amazon after reading some reviews. I wish I had believed the ones who reviewed this movie negatively. This was such a bad movie that I couldn't even give it \\"b\\" status. If there was an \\"f\\" status that's what I would give it. If you're looking for a good Vampire movie don't look for it in this lame excuse. Yes, it is that bad. I watched it all the way to the end just because I didn't want to say I hadn't seen it all. It was torturous, inane, and BORING! The acting was atrocious and whoever directed it must have been working on his first movie ever having absolutely no idea what he was doing. Please don't even waste the $1.99 that I did to watch it. Save your money and your mind."},{"rating":"1","title":"BOOTLEG BOOTLEG BOOTLEG!","review":"LOVE THIS MOVIE. EXPERT ON THIS MOVIE! This dvd is a bootleg.

I have no idea what this movie is about based on what I saw in the trailer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Doesn't disappoint","review":"This is the third time I've purchased this cult vampire classic, and I can finally watch it without all the problems associated with illegitimate dubs. If you must have pristine video quality, you probably won't be interested in this movie in the first place. For those of you who appreciate lower budget seventies-era films, this edition is everything you'd desire."},{"rating":"1","title":"forget it!!!","review":"not worth the time or the money - storyline wasn't much, acting even less so, but atmosphere was non-existent. yes it is a vampire flick, but the best of them have an atmospheric sense of foreboding or menace, something to keep you on edge. these actors were just reading their lines. don't bother with this, look for something with christopher lee!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Love this stroller","review":"If I were to rate this stroller 2 weeks ago, I would have given it 3 stars...but after getting used to it and supplementing it's obvious drawbacks (small basket, inadequate canopy) it's absolutely perfect! I use it for my 5 month old and I love how comfortable she is in it. Lots of breathable padding and generous recline. For $8, I bought a mesh stroller bag so now I can haul more that I did with my old Graco travel system. Yet this bag is so compact that I tuck it in the little back pocket of the stroller and it stays there even when the stroller is folded. I never have to take it off unless I want to. For $6 I also purchased a clip-on sunshade by FirstYears which gives me full sun coverage for my little one (I also use it when she's asleep to keep the light out). I love, love, love this stroller!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Old Games","review":"I was looking for some new casino games. It takes a long time for new ones to come out. I saw these and thought the would be great. THEY ARE OLD. There's much newer up to date games out there. Stay away from these."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hmmm....","review":"First of all, a professional psychologist does not wear a tuxedo to work. The artist should have been \\"clever\\" enough to realize that when Sands referred to a tie and suit, she meant business rather than formal attire. I give Sands a lot of credit because I know (read on her blog) and couldn't imagine how difficult writing this book must have been. Since she already wrote a couple of books in the middle of the series, she had to write a prequel for the first book. Although this was not the best storyline in the series, there were strong character developments. Sands characters are quite risque taking intimacy to unconventional settings. Coming from being raised as a Southern Baptist, I found it quite humorous how she unintentionally pokes fun of \\"Jesus freaks\\" and their hardcore beliefs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dumb and Dumber","review":"The heroine is 200 and never realized if she closes her eyes when she drinks blood she won't faint at the sight of it? How does she manage to dress herself?A problem with this series is these are portrayed as \\"good\\" vampires, but they are disgusting. In all \\"good\\" vampire stories, they differ from \\"bad\\" vampires in that they have some respect for humans. Not these. They call their victims \\"donors\\" and refer to undiagnosed diabetics as \\"sweet treats\\". Offensive, to say the least.This writer has the very irritating habit in all her books of explaining insignificant things in great detail. And if you missed it the first time, fear not, she will repeat it a page later.How on earth did she find a publisher?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"I found this book incredibly boring. I finally had to quit reading it after 1/3 of the way through.It just wasn't for me - and I LOVE Vamp romances, too."},{"rating":"1","title":"JUST PLAIN SILLY!!!!","review":"Like a Jerk I bought the 4 for 3 promotion in this series. WHAT A MISTAKE!!! the story is so predictiable and is suppose to be funny; by making fun of vampires and IT WAS NOT FUNNY AT ALL JUST PLAIN SILLY!!!! I was looking for a similar writting style like the author Kerrelyn Sparks!! who writes Hillarious,but Dangerous, Sensual Romanic Page Turners, that can make you laugh until you cry, so with that said this book was very disappointing!!!! So I guess I will read the others in the series since I already have them, when I just don't have anything else to read!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"LOVE LOVE LOVE","review":"I have purchased Lynsay Sands entire argeneau series!!!

This book is the first of the series, but wasn't published in that order. I can see why. If anyone else, that likes this series would start with this book, they would most likely stop with this book too. I think it's supposed to be a comedy, and does have a few funny parts to it, but not enough to make me want to buy another book in the series. It's like watching a TV sitcom, a laugh here and there, with a bit of silly plot.I've read other reviews on other books in the series, and people really like them. So, I'm at a crossroads as to going on to the next book. Just don't know if I want to invest the time to see if this series improves."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ridiculously stupid","review":"I made the mistake of buying this book for its cover. It was interesting, unique, cute, and sexy. The book? Not so much so.The vampires, who are really old enough to have a little bit more life experience, are all complete bimbos. The male lead was a useless bimbo himself, and I couldn't wait to see him run over by a truck. If characters you want to throttle aren't enough, the desperate rationalization of rape, kidnapping and brainwashing will turn you right off (If they don't remember, you've only really stolen time, and anyway they don't even miss it). If it weren't so ridiculous I might have been offended, but the writing and characterizations are so poor I could only be disappointed.All in all, this may be the worst vampire novel I have ever read. Do not buy this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just not my type of book","review":"Most of this book is spent explaining how vampire life is to a very complacent kidnapped man. I thought we might actually get to have some treatment occur. I thought it would take longer for a man that has been kidnapped to learn to trust his captors. I thought there would be a good plot with this book. I was wrong on all accounts. The characters are all annoying to me, the doctor fits into the family entirely too quickly and way too easily. It all seemed fake-unbelievable, and not in a good way. I just couldn't get into this book. It started out interestingly enough, the doctor is kidnapped, he learns about Lissianna's phobia. Then, 100 or so pages later he is still having conversations and going shopping with the family. Nothing interesting or important was happening at all. I can't read a book with no point or plot at all. Very disappointing."},{"rating":"2","title":"maybe not my favorite in this series, but....","review":"I overall liked this story! O.K. maybe it was a little slow...for the first half, but boy did it pick up towards the end! Maybe Greg wasn't an \\"alpha\\" male, but gee, he sure was sweet! I really liked the way the author handled Greg's \\"turning\\", and it answered some of my questions as to how they were going to be together. Hopefully, the next in this series will be about Thomas! If you could forget the (gasp) \\"spiderman\\" pajamas, he seemed to have one heck of a sense of humor, and seemed quite sexy, also! He needs to have his own story!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Way to easy","review":"The only reason i finished the book is because I bought it via Kindle and though and hoped it was going to get better!The story could be good, but it's all a little too easy.They are supposed to be Vampires, but the main character is nothing but weak and annoying. She is spoiled and a total brat.Her \\"live mate\\" is a loser who would trust anyone. He is a psychologist and a babysitter. He has no back bone and worst of all agrees to everything. What a loser of a Man.The conversation throughout the book is beyond lame and childish.The main bad guys are stand around being confused and helpless weaklings. Besides the fact that the are as bright as a box of rocks.Poor Thomas is over 200 and is such child, who had all the potential."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring Boring Boring","review":"I couldn't finish this book.

I like all her books. I don't suggest sitting down and reading all of the series at a time, they get rather repetitive, as do most romance authors. I like her take on a more scientific vampirism even if it's a little unrealistic. Kidnapping a therapist for a hemophobic vampire is just funny, the extra cherry on top is the bow for her birthday!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Lacking in substance","review":"This and the last book have lacked in substance what the first two books in the Argeneau vampire series had offered. Dr. Hewitt seems so compliant and there was no mention of the brothers except Sebastian. Doesn't even fit with the other books. I would have expected Lissi's brothers to want to grill Greg, as much as the cousins did.

Bad guys were more interested in explaining to their victims how and why they were carrying out their bad deeds than in carrying out the bad deeds. Totally monologuing.Oh and this may be a spoiler, so stop reading if you don't want any spoilage, but how often do you have to be interrupted by multiple family members unexpectedly gathering in your bedroom before you learn to at least lock the door? For that matter, why do the family members think nothing of barging into bedrooms without knocking when their adult cousin is with her new boyfriend?"},{"rating":"1","title":"A boring read","review":"I believe this book has been the most boring book I have ever read.

I have absolutely no desire to read the rest of the series."},{"rating":"1","title":"BAD (ALMOST) TEEN LITERATURE","review":"Omitting the few sex scenes, this was really teen literature. It involved six or so cousins/friends, having slumber parties and constantly answering to their parents. The story itself moved VERY VERY VERY slowly, picking up a little speed late in the book only to slow down again (and become quite silly) near the end. The whole fainting-at-the-sight-of-blood thing got very old and never really made sense (it wasn't the blood that almost killed someone, but the biting and drinking.) The narrator certainly wasn't the worst I've heard, but her monotonous tone didn't help an already dead tale."},{"rating":"2","title":"Finally, the beginning","review":"I've waited a long time to get the first story in this series.

I've read all of them as well as the more recent Hunter books and found all of them to be laugh out loud funny.

He uses some elements of popular music of his time as well as current styles of European classical music. I respect the symphonies, but the four pieces on this album are more enjoyable.

First off I've read books with homosexuals as the main characters, however I never read a book where one of the main characters is bi-sexual (Travis). It's pretty obvious that he likes both men and women and yet has the darnest time making the decission. I thought it was pretty funny with the scene of Beltan and Vani.A lot of people don't like Vani but I happen to find Beltan more than a little annoying, this is just me however. For one Beltan gets all [mad] just because Vani happens to love Travis. One thing I don't understand is the whole destiny thing and find this to actually take away from the book. However over all this was a decent read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Action packed? Page-turner? You betcha!","review":"Another great read from Mark Anthony.

We knew his voice in many songs with the Beach Boys. Carl just has the most beautiful and distinctive voice. He sings each and every song from his heart - the heart and voice of an angel. That is how he is described most often. What You Do To Me is a rockin' song and so different from what you're used to hearing when he performed with the Beach Boys. Carl really stretches out here and shows his stuff and just how powerful and versatile his voice really is. One More Night Alone - a ballad written by Carl's former brother-in-law, Billy Hinsche, is a beautiful love song that digs down deep and emits such emotion. Very Highly Recommended!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A good buy! And a great movie!","review":"A good book on the making of the movie Anna and the King and a brief on the history of the Chakkri Dynasty. Disapointed only that the author did not give details on production of the movie.

A superb CD.","review":"The only reason I give this CD four stars instead of five, is that the latter half of the CD is a better compilation of material than the first. This is an excellent CD nonetheless. I wonder though, if live performances from later in their career will be recorded onto compilations like this one? To get to the point, this is a good CD overall, and a nice introduction into Paradise Lost's older material slanted more toward the doom metal genre as opposed to the lighter Gothic Metal recorded later in their career. Paradise Lost is one of my favorite bands (I've seen them in concert with Opeth), and they deserve more attention. This is the fourth CD of theirs I have bought so far, and I am only more convinced over the years of how diverse and talented this Gothic Metal act is. I recommend this CD to any metal fan interested in one of the most influential metal bands that explores the darker side of metal.

There are eleven discs, and each disc has some nice art on it. The remixes are really great. You have some casual house and techno things, like the Perfecto-mixes and an Underworld-mix - they are good, and will get you moving. But the REALLY good ones are the ones done by Ben Young, Alpha, State Of Bengal, U.N.K.L.E, Brian Eno, Blur, Portishead,... and of course there is the magical Mad Professor ( if you like him, check out \\"No Protection\\" ). And there are some really nice b-sides, like \\"Back/shecomes\\", the superb, almost frightening \\"Superpredators\\", \\"Euro Zero Zero\\", \\"Any Love\\", and the really beautiful \\"Home Of The Whale\\".

In \\"What's Good About Goodbye\\" she conveys the sadness and pain of relationships ending, leaving one wondering 'what happened?' and struggling to make sense of it all. Anyone grieving the loss of a loved one would do well to listen to Ms. Lamott's calming renditions, which culminate with \\"We Live On Borrowed Time\\" -- a kind and gentle nudge toward acceptance and encouragement to move on. Ms. Lamott's vocal exceptionality carries the message with minimal backup."},{"rating":"2","title":"A beautiful recording from an extraordinary talent","review":"I had been listening to Ms Lamott's cd's long before \\"We Live On Borrowed Time\\" was ever sung by Jason Alexander. When I talked to Midder Music and found out this cd was to be released posthumously, I bought it immediately. I have all her other recordings that are out on the market. I loved the cd and the song. Her voice is husky and takes some getting used to, but once you do, you may realize what a talent Nancy LaMott was. That song was sadly prophetic, as she would die from cancer not long after its recording. It was recorded live at an AIDS benefit show. If you like this album, and have her others, Midder is planning more unreleased cd's in the future. Alltogether a classy recording from a life much too short-lived."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cabaret singing at its very best","review":"Nancy LaMott's voice is a wonderful instrument, and she uses it expressively and dynamically. It has a timbre that reaches you. I'm glad that her producer (and a fine composer as well) David Friedman was able to cobble together this, her final album, from performances that remained unreleased that were recorded as demos. Although Nancy always sounds great, you can tell a bit (and I'm a singer so maybe that is why I pick up on it) that these were not \\"final\\" performances but guide or demo tracks. The songs and arrangements by Peter Matz are lush and beautiful.Nancy was a treasure, lost way too soon, and I'm glad for any chance to hear that gloriously warm, rich voice."},{"rating":"2","title":"Programmer's Book","review":"This is a programmer's book. It's heavy on C code, and if you can't at least read C, a lot of this isn't going to mean much to you. However, it does have a lot of general information that is of interest to anyone, and it could be helpful in unmdertstanding how someone else's milter works and how to modify it, etc.I enjoyed it, but I like code heavy books - you may not.There's a surprising amount of detail here; even getting into how to decode mime, and advice on user friendliness. I was a bit amused that they gave advice on how to attract spam to test milters; I don't think too many of us have any shortage of spam nowadays."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Even if You're Not Using Sendmail","review":"As the title says, the bulk of this book is on working with spam on the sendmail software package. If you are using sendmail, there is no question that this is the book for you.The strange thing is, that there is so much information on spam contained in this book that I'd recommend it even if you are using some other software package. The general discussion on spam, its history, its impact on the industry and on individuals, and especially on it's techniques of spammers.I particularly enjoyed his philosophy of setting up a Bait Machine just to collect inbound spam. He then began developing techniques to stop the spam that was coming to the bait machine. Great concept."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very nice watch. Good value.","review":"There aren't many watches this nice, and with these features anywhere near where Amazon has this one priced. Specifically, it looks good, is an automatic, has chronograph, sapphire crystal and a deployment clasp.However, speaking of the clasp, my only complaint is a metal burr (sharp slightly protruding edge) on the clasp which rubs on the inside of my wrist. It's annoying to have a new and not inexpensive watch with such a seemingly amateurish quality issue. Though it is extremely irritating, I'm fairly confident a few minutes with a precision metal file will take care of it. Then I'll move forward with my new life, on time."},{"rating":"2","title":"came upon this in someone's collection: OH MY GOD IS THIS GOOD!","review":"I wouldn't know a Smashing Pumpkins song if it smashed me in the face. So I'm coming into this review with complete objectivity. I got this CD out a friend's collection and thought it looked interesting. I love every song on this album. I thought the singer reminded me of a young Mick Jagger. And I just love the lyrics. I downloaded them and really read them. Oh my, such simple and sometimes complicated emotions spoken of in these lyrics. It has really made my month to listen to this album over and over and over. I am VERY DISAPPOINTED THAT I DON'T SEE ANOTHER ZWAN CD AT AMAZON. WILL THEY DO ANOTHER? OH, PLEASE, OH PLEASE, OH PLEASE DO ANOTHER CD, ZWAN PEOPLE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! OH, and I have to mention that when I was a girl of 14 and Star Wars movie came out, I decided to write my own sci-fi movie. The name of my main character was Zwan Toowan.That's why the CD caught my eye in the first place. It was destiny. Thanks Zwan!"},{"rating":"1","title":"unimpressed","review":"If you miss Smashing Pumpkins and hope to recapture Billy Corgan's original music, Zwan is NOT the CD to buy. Billy Corgan is at fair and unfair advantages with the release of this CD. His name will sell it, but his name will also lead fans to expect more than what they get. For what the CD is worth, it is adrenaline-pushing and intense, but no mellow tones help balance out Mary Star of the Sea. This album didn't jump out and grab me even after 5 listens. I sold mine back."},{"rating":"1","title":"Billy Corgan Runs Out of Words?","review":"I have been a Pumpkins fan since they first hit the scene. That said, this is no Pumpkins' album. This is something wholly other. And mostly, the changes are for the worse. While some of the songs are tuneful, and Corgan's voice still has that raw edge, I found this album to be painfully monotonous. Nearly every song repeats itself over and over and over and over and over, ad nauseum. If you like Billy so much that you simply must participate in his religious experience, get the album. If you get bored easily, and if poetic lyrics mean anything at all to you, steer clear. Some of the lines are clever, even deep and thoughtful, but hearing the same ones repeated continually for four minutes straight seems to suck the meaning out of them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Smashing Pumpkins, Zwan?","review":"I know people don't like comparing zwan to the smashing pumpkins, but the fact is, they sound nearly identical. Billy Corgan reinvents himself again, this time with a new band. I love this album, although it is a little poppy and quirky at times. Billy's vocals are excellent throughout. Much better in fact than most of the SP albums. In reviewing this album I can't help but compare it to machina. Machina explores the dark side of spirtuality and Mary star of the sea explores the brighter side. This is definately more upbeat then machina but if you didn't like machina, you probably won't like this either."},{"rating":"2","title":"ZWAN = SMASHING PUMPKINS","review":"I could not beleive my ears! Billy Corgan just sent me back to yesteryear! The moment you hear his voice there is no denying HE's BACK! The sound is VERY VERY MUCH Pumpkins. I felt like an addict who just got a fix! I am very happy with this album. It has been the only album I've listened to since I got it, 3 days ago. If you like the Pumpkins then you will UNDOUBTEDLY enjoy this album. IT ROCKS! \\"Desire\\" is earily poetic and hearfelt.A rose by any other name is still a rose and ZWAN is just another name! The key I think is Jimmy on drums and Billy's voice.

The truth is, it is Pumpkins just with another name."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not the Pumpkins but it wasn't supposed to be .","review":"Zwan has a really cool sound and decent lyrics but what really makes the band has to be the legend Billy Corgan.

Sometime between Simease Dream and Zwan, Corgan has gone from having one of the most distinctive sounding voices in rock to having one of the most annoying sounding voices in rock. Its not so much that this album is terrible, its just that its boring. Nothing ever really happens, its just kinda bland. Im not asking for Corgan to do another Simease Dream again or anything, all I want is for him to write something that doesnt put me to sleep when im listening to it.

If you were a pumpkin's fame since gish and them early days, Zwan's debut probably isn't for you. However, if you fell in love with the heavenly melodic rhythm of melon collie etc., you will fall deeply and madly inlove with this album. Everything lovely about the pumpkins shows up in this hooky rebirth of its former self. Hooky and harmonic, this ablum's favorite theme seems to be faith, and it's \\"with faith\\" that billy walks back to us. \\"He believes\\" that we'll remind what real \\"love with music\\" was. And here, he's determined to woe us back into the romance that was once the pumpkins. If you were a pumpkins fan, I highly recommend it. If you've never heard of the pumpkins? I'd recommend this just to remind you that music (at one point) meant something. All the bimbos and boy bands pale in comparison with this rich, lush sounding debut of something great.

But now that i have it im wondering what i hear that night! (i wasnt that drunk). This album is a joke! The lyrics just repeat themselves OVER AND OVER AND OVER again on every song. Look, billy doesnt have the sweetest voice. So when he just repeats himself over and over and over again he really gets on your nerves. The music is tight, and brilliant in some songs and some fashions. And there are some great back vocals too that make for an almost \\"gish\\" feel. But .. \\"honestly\\" - this album is a joke.

Billy Corgan/Zwan is suffering a real loss of creative energy here, a common theme in his post-1996 music. How many times do we need to hear the same distorted wall of power chords snaked with feedback that Billy seems so convinced are the recipe for a great musical moment?

There is no investigation/analysis/questioning of what was built and why. It only gives you a small amount of information about the many museums we are already familiar with, and shows plans and drawings that are either too small or irrelevant. I would only use this to become familiar with some of the worlds modern museums, but you could also just find that on the internet. Beyond the case studies there is nothing else, no narrative, no discussion of specific program issues, no technical discussion of lighting, acoustics, way finding, etc. etc. Truly a joke unfortunately.

For Retail, Hospitality and Theater, these three have a lot of generic information such as historical background of building type, space component, principles of design, etc. They also give a lot of examples based on those generic issues, topic by topic. In this Museum book, it is all about examples with plans and very little background information for each museums. There are a lot of pictures and plans which are not of good quality (I actually didn't expect them to be because it is not the strength of the series).

This brings me to my other issue, the zipper is very small for such a large bag. It needs to be upgraded. While zipping up my bag it failed multiple times and I had to back it up and keep trying to re-zip it. This was the only flaw that I found. The bag itself is made of a very nice nylon fabric and is coated on the inside with a rubber/plastic coating.

Photos outside are great, poor low-light photos though, but I paid $100 for it (and with $20 coupon it was $80). Small LCD screen means that it takes less battery power, so the rechargeable AA batteries lasted a long time.White screen of death temporary solution: Turn the camera off, and do a quick rap with your knuckles to the \\"Cybershot\\" logo on the front of the camera.

Then, I chatted online with a representative from Sony who also could only tell me to change the batteries and then recommended me send it in for service. Service is a flat rate of $111 on a camera that I spent $199 on. No thanks.I am so suprised that I've read so many other reviews now from other buyers who've experienced the same problems.

I've not found any recall for service so it looks like I'm out of luck. The other one is still working, but who knows for how long? Get a Panasonic Lumix instead is my advice. It has a Leica lens and great anti-shake along with a good zoom (depending on the $$).

Beside this, the pictures I take comes out very blurry and the only way to solve it is to use a stand, and obviously I cant carry a stand with me everywhere I go lol.

LSO - DECCA","review":"To my taste this is the most satisfying recording of Elgar's 1st Symphony since the composer's own. Interestingly, Solti learnt the work, and prepared for the recording sessions, by making a detailed study of the Elgar recording. It shows. Among post-Elgar conductors (Boult and Barbirolli come to mind), only Davis approaches the energy Solti brings to the piece here. But this, to my ear, is unique. And, in addition to Solti's remarkable feel for the work, and for Elgar's idiom, the recording offers sonics as fine as DECCA ever achieved; gorgeous orchestral sound. The recorded performance of \\"In the South\\" is also very fine, if not quite as distinctive.

I've been a huge Raymond Feist fan for 15-20 years and I can't believe he wrote this book. More than likely, his name and universe are all the input he had. The characters are wooden, one dimensional, and utterly predictable. The main character is wholly unlikable and the \\"tough, moody hero who lost his family\\" thing is way overdone.I was really looking forward to this book because I figured you'd have the world of Midkemia mixed with a writer who has written military books in the past.Chocolate and peanut butter, I mused?

Forstchen. I had to wonder just how different this book would be from the \\"regular\\" books. Well, not too much. The story was crisp and moved along at a nice pace. The authors killed off characters with the usual alomb, and it kept me interested until the end.My only criticisms are that the story was a little too predictable, and I thought they tried too hard to tie this story in with MAGICIAN. It seemed like every once in a while they would throw in a few pages harking back to the classic, just to prove they were still in Midkemia; the story would have been better without. However, it was a mere annoyance, and overall I enjoyed the book and can't wait for the rest of the series!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Honoured Enemy","review":"This story was a great background story to other books by the author. The ending was a little corny, and contrite. Too many bows tied neatly, but maybe that was what Raymond Feist was looking to build, a complete story of two characters - enemies drawn together.

As we (not inexperienced tent campers) were pitching this tent, a seam ripped. We had to find a scrap of sail cloth and sewing utentils to mend it to keep it from ripping further. A stake loop just popped out as we were staking the tent, again ripping the material. Had to jury-rig that, too, to be able to use the tent.

On the 4th and last campout, one of the poles snapped (moderate to gusty wind, not one of the split poles). When it snapped, it caused the pole holding the fly on the side to let loose, which then ripped the fly.It is easy to set up, even for one person. And, it has plenty of room to stand up in.

In particular, I have used them on my son's and my backpack frame to secure bedrolls to the lower frame. The wide strap helps stabilize the loads better than conventional bungees and the plastic coated hook doesn't scratch, rust or corrode.The only downside I could find is the fact that the hook doesn't bend so you can permanently secure a cord to a frame or anchor point, but that's not a big deal. My son did manage to lose two cords (he's 11 and loses everything), but I used zip ties to secure them to his backpack frame. Problem solved. The enlarged hook does allow you to secure the cord to larger anchor points.This is a good cord that works quite well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Zune Wireless Remote","review":"Not impressed with this and I don't recommend it to anyone.

We got about two hours out of it before it broke. We weren't cutting steel pipe with this thing, we were trimming branches off a living, flexible tree. The tool is designed to cut branches about one inch in diameter (you can't fit a larger branch between the jaws). I was trying to cut a branch less than an inch thick and instead of shearing the wood, the fiberglass pole shattered at the business end. I'm glad the break didn't occur closer to my hands or face.The rope attached to the clipper is slightly elastic. Because it stretches when pulled, it takes more effort than should be necessary to cut branches. The telescoping pole doesn't lock well, so the tool will sometimes change length while you're using it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tree Pruner","review":"This pruner is so easy to use.

I have read other of the Becket of Romney Marsh books and liked them, but this one just didn't ever \\"take\\". I confess I didn't even finish it. This is Spencer's story but his restlessness never seemed real, the heroine is a strong, capable woman who turns into a lovestruck, dithering idiot within two or three pages for no reason I could figure out, the whole smuggling plot line just didn't make any sense and then having Napoleon thrown in with everything else just made it all complicated. Too much war plotting, not enough characters. Lots of veiled references to the Becket's history, but nothing that seemed to have anything to do with the current story. I'd give this one a miss."},{"rating":"2","title":"Liked it a lot","review":"I guess I'm really very opposite to most readers of this series. While many people gave the last three books four or five stars and loved them, I was hard pressed to give them a three and felt really disappointed by them. However, this one, where most people are giving it two or three stars or worse, I have to give it a four because I really liked this one.I do think part of my reason for liking this one is that it was the first of the series that I read, so, the whole history of the Becket family was new to me, so that kept me interested. Even though Spencer was a bit moody, I liked him a lot. Mariah was a strong female lead without becoming too annoying, too pouty or too shrew-like.It's possible that if I'd read a few of the other books before this one, I might not have had the same reaction, but of all the books, this one is my favorite."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent machine for the money.","review":"This coffee maker is excellent value for the $$$.

The grinder is built into the filter. So, it's a bit harder to rinse. No big deal really. There is a built in \\"dummy switch\\" so you cant turn the unit on while the top is open and accidentally mince your appendages.The coffee tastes great. I use the programmable function every day.

It sounds like a couple of tone deaf 14 year old girls singing along with \\"Staying Alive\\", while managing to butcher one of the most well respected classic rock anthems of all time. \\"Comfortably Numb\\" should have never been twisted into this hideous beast of trite rythm and harmony, a clumsy regurgitation of what was once good. It makes me sick thinking of the people who bought this twaddle and made it a best selling single. Shameful."},{"rating":"1","title":"Never should have covered Comfortably Numb","review":"Pink Floyd is one of those perfectionist bands- each one of their chords and verses was meant to sound the way it did. Altering the sound just destroys the meaning of the song, which is what the Scissor Sisters did to it. The song has been twisted from a classic song depicting a battle between Pink and his doctor to a cheesy, disco dancing song that has no meaning. The Scissor Sisters completely missed the point of the song, and made my ears hurt on top of it. For shame."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible","review":"Pink Floyd is my favorite group of all time and a few hours ago I heard the Scissor Sisters do a cover of Comforably Numb on Saturday Night Live.

Most likely, you'll never have a power outlet where you want to place the unit. Third, the unit does not support WPA protocol, just WEP, which is not very secure. Lastly, this unit is OLD model. There is a new model that support WPA. Also, if you search Amazon carefully, there is an identical product with a lower price.

I'm a cellist, have heard and played this music for ~6 years, and listened to some or all of most of the major recordings of the Suites. I first heard Bach when I came across a recording of Lynn Harrell playing the G maj prelude. Aside from Pieter Wispelwey's second recording and Harrell's prelude, I've never been too impressed by the major recordings...Starker, Rostropovich, Maisky, Ma. Jian Wang plays a little slowly, with a distinct amount of rubato (pausing or lengthening of a note), and a lot of dynamic contrast. I don't think any of these things detracts from the music, except that he plays the courantes (from the French: to run) somewhat slowly. Also the sound quality and timbre is excellent - it is fairly self evident, even from a cursory iTunes browse. His version is the cleanest, simplest, and most sincere I've ever heard. Not as fast as Wispelwey, but perhaps more patient and open."},{"rating":"2","title":"People should know about what they speak","review":"I have perfect pitch, so it's a requirement for me that the performer have it - this one does. The contemporary Bach Cello Suites of 'a certain very well known, other performer' reputed to be among the world's greatest, are in reality breathtakingly pathetic. In contrast, I was completely astonished at this performance, which equals & exceeds those of such past masters as Janos Starker. I couldn't believe that such subtleties were capable of being evoked on an instrument prone to rough sounds, such light glances & touches in the attack. And the intonation, absolutely flawless! Overall, it was like falling in love with your mother's face, in sound. I don't recommend this for everyone, but I can unhesitatingly do so for anyone cursed with perfect pitch."},{"rating":"1","title":"All the joy of a warmup exercise...","review":"I've been in love with the Bach 'cello suites for about 30 years, so I'm always curious when I see a new rendition. This version was a real disappointment. The sound is rough, scratchy, and harsh -- with just a hint of \\"wolfing.\\" He sounds like he's punishing the instrument rather than making it sing.And then there's his questionable use of rubato. It's as if the performer needs to linger on a note every once in awhile to catch his breath. Maybe it's just an attempt to hide a technical failure. Who knows. It demonstrates a profound lack of understanding of these beautiful suites.Overall, listening to this recording is a really unpleasant experience.

For the same price, you can buy a much better book.I've been a Benson fan for years, but this is the last one of his books I'll be purchasing.

Should of read the reviews before I purchased the game. If your thinking of getting this game, think twice, you will hate it, unless you want to look at someones vacation photos! The box is very deceiving, looks really fun, but it's really not up to todays standards at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Myst...not even close","review":"I too bought this based on the single five star review. I don't know how anyone could compare this to the Myst series. It's not even close. It's more like clicking through your aunt Millie's slide show of her vacation. The voices are amaturish and speak to you as you view their still photo. The music, for the most part, does not fit the scenes. Some of the puzzles are clever and fun but overall it's not a world I enjoyed exploring. It was tedious and often boring."},{"rating":"1","title":"Anacapri The Dream -","review":"If the idea of putting you to sleep was the basis of this game, then they have succeeded. This game is extremely boring. The point and click action in this game becomes tiring. At least later you can flash transport from one area to another. The acting is horrible as well as the music soundtrack. The storyline moves slowly, and I moved aimlessly around for the longest time before having to resort to obtaining a cheat. The game description sounded like it would be fun, but that has not been the case. This has been move like a travel site with lots of pretty pictures. I would not recommend this game but would like to visit Anacapri."},{"rating":"2","title":"A sea adventure.","review":"This game is a lot of fun, I highly recommend it, especially suited for the whole family. My grandchildren and I played it and we found it is a great adventure; not violent like a lot of the pc games nowadays."},{"rating":"2","title":"Relaxing and Beautiful","review":"This game is not for people looking for something fast-paced. This is a game of exploration and patience. Each scene is a static photograph allowing you to wander the island taking in the view. The story builds slowly. If you enjoy exploring new surroundings without needing something to happen every five seconds, this game is for you. The puzzles are fun.The gameplay is fairly standard point and click. There is no way to screw-up. The voice acting, however, is pretty bad. Still, there is a screen that lets you see everything that has been said so you can grab a cup of coffee and then read the dialogue at your own pace.This game makes a nice break if you're stressed out."},{"rating":"2","title":"solid! ....and oh so smoooooothhhhh","review":"If you enjoy hearing the clarinet, there is no better listen than this recording. It's very traditional New Orleans style jazz but Pete's playing is really spot-on and fluid. The songs are very complementary and showcase some very excellent guitar and fiddle work as well. Pete really shines on classics like \\"Walking The Floor Over You\\", \\"Up a Lazy River\\", and \\"Basin Street Blues\\". Easily proves why he may be the best musician to ever pick up a clarinet! His solos go from lightening quick to super melodic! Just an all around great CD to listen to and relax with. Definitely worth buying!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I expected","review":"What I thought would be Pete Fountain playing the clarinet turned out to be not only Pete playing the clarinet but also a mixed mess of trombone solos, horn solos, bass solos, violin solos and unidentifiable solo instruments. If you want to hear just Pete playing the clarinet this not the cd. If anyone knows of a Pete Fountain cd that is just Pete Fountain playing the clarinet please leave a comment and tell me which cd that would be."},{"rating":"2","title":"I recommend this book, I LOVE IT!!!","review":"This book which is Titled \\"The Ghosts\\", Is a COMPLETELY Best Loved book for me.

The bottom line is...if Lucy and Jamie were Sara's great-grandchildren, then they could not possibly have existed at the same time that Sara's grave existed...This is only one of the several inconsistencies in the book. The book would've been much better if the author could have kept up with the story line."},{"rating":"2","title":"Found at last!","review":"Our fifth-grade teacher read this book in a few chapters at a time when I was in school, and it captivated me; I've remembered details of this story when others have long slipped into obscurity. Now, twenty-three years later, I'm so glad to have found it again. It's been frustrating looking for a book called 'The Ghosts'--so general, and yet I never knew the author. You'll find this book draws you into its eerie mysteries, that you'll care about the characters and the outcome a great deal, that you'll step into the action yourself. I highly recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Her Best Work","review":"I have spent the last 10 months reading the Penelope Lively books and have found some delightful; others, good. This book is one that I started reading, then set aside because I simply could not get into it. I recently picked it up and began reading it again. It is quite boring and very disjointed. Time to throw in the towel and move on. I'm sure the next Lively novel on the list will reconnect me with the talented writer that she is. Just FYI, my favorite Lively novel so far is The Photograph."},{"rating":"2","title":"Indesctuctable and you can SEE it!","review":"I have gone through many external keyboards where the key labels fade or wipe off too soon.

Being a librarian dealing with books, where is there a better place to work out one's internal personal demons than by taking a mental trip to a wonderland of one's own devisement.

You still get hamburger meat everywhere and by the time you pack the meat inside this thing, you could have pattied your own hamburger. On top of that, you have to want extra large hamburger patties and use the bigger buns. My kids didn't like the big burgers and my husband didn't like them either.

He joked about beating up women like it was justifiable, had no idea it was wrong, and continuously excused his own faults. When children do it, I can blow it off as just having to grow up and understand responsibility. But how can I respect a comedian who does so many things that aren't funny?

The bios that the author wrote for each person interviewed were great. I especially liked reading the interviews of people like myself who are not famous. Certainly, it is amazing how one event can provide every American with a common thread. The flow of the book was wonderful. I read it from cover to cover quite comfortably.

Does he \\"slight\\" the orthodox story? Not likely. Does the case for Oxford come out better than that for the Stratford \\"William\\"?

Your GPA might be 3.8, but the requirements are college algebra, chemistry and biology 101, etc (for a BSN).

Because she has a vocabulary that she can use, we get to 'hear' what is on her mind (babies, butterflies, dogs, ceiling fans,etc.) on a daily basis.

On the second CD, a perfect example of this is Solarstone's Seven Cities. When you hear it, you'll know what I mean by a song to remember by name. This is a must buy.

Clearly etched and...the tuning is almost perfect! Lots of attack from the violins in the fast movements. Sometimes the viola and cello sound a bit reticent in comparison. True, the four do not always seem to be communicating seamlessly. At times, it sounds a bit like a violin duet, with Viola and Cello accompaniment. But that may also reflect the composition. The dynamics are very sensitive, in contrast with quite a few Romantic chamber recordings where they seem exaggerated.There's a very good essay included (though it's a difficult read, having been translated from German) on Schumann's emphasis on repeated motifs, especially rhythmic \\"aphorisms\\", in framing his pieces, in contrast to Beethoven's perfection of theme and variation.But what makes this disc a winner is the sound. Very clear and open with a good 3d image."},{"rating":"1","title":"daffy cinema tee","review":"They were out of this shirt but still received pants which doesn't have a shirt to go with it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must for WWII Japanese Aviation Historians","review":"Zero Combat & Development by Robert Mikesh, does a splendid job of telling the story of the history and development of the A6M all models are included and a break down of their history and purpose of coming into play are described. The book covers the successes of the earlier A5M and discusses the specifications handed to Horikoshi. It does an excellent job of explaining the structural defect present in the early model A6M's and what corrective measures were taken to prevent more accidents. It shows many photos interior cut away drawings and specifactons. I am an aviation historian and a model builder and I even learned from reading this book. Also valuable is the information obtained from the captured A6M and the test of many American fighters of that time against the A6M. Don't just take my word for it read it for yourself."},{"rating":"2","title":"Politics and the Bureaucracy","review":"The book gave an excellent introduction to the formation of the United States bureacracy.

Thanks to archeological and genetic findings in the years since author Danielou's death, there have been massive changes in our understanding of ancient Indian history. Many of the assumptions he made about cultural conflicts in northern India have been called into serious question by archeologists and historians. At this point, this book is probably more notable for what it reveals about the misreading of ancient South Asian culture by European scholars of Danielou's generation."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great little tool","review":"This tool is actually better than I expected.

The heroine, Clea, was just too flighty, spoiled and a real b-----. Sorry, no other way to put it. I just couldn't relate to her. She's too used to having money and getting exactly what she wants. She's supposed to be saving money, but states she just spent $2000 on a new pair of boots, she wears a fox vest and actually packs her cosmetics bag in her saddle bags. Oh, and heaven forbid she breaks a nail within hours of arriving at her new home. I guess I just didn't see the point in all this. By the last 1/3 of the book she's suddenly become a \\"normal\\" person who's more down to earth. But I have to say it was really touch-and-go there for awhile whether I would continue reading the book. I really wanted to just give up and put it in my give to the Goodwill pile.I can't really recommend this book.

While Amazon sells these at a cheaper price than some other outlets, I would still baulk at paying anything over a couple of dollars for these.I am going to take the suggestion of the previous reviewer and simply manage without wax guards from now on.

Now as an elder, and as a choral fan, I must tell you that you will rarely hear anything more beautiful than the voices of these sisters in harmony. Some of the solo work is a little less perfect, but when they sing as a group, I challenge anyone to find a better, sweeter, more seamless vocal sound. Their best work is in the older ballads featured prominently in this collection. This is exquisite music."},{"rating":"1","title":"Would be better if interesting","review":"The story told in this book is rather dull and boring. I had hoped for much better. It also failed one of my major criteria for a novel; it was never edited. At various points throughout the book Sulu is refered to as the navigator or helmsman. On particular scene has Uhura, seeing Chekov look at her, ponder about the navigator. The very next paragraph she is now ponder about the navigator (Sulu). Very annoying. In order to make this book more enjoyable I found myself visualizing very colorful \\"sign language\\" by various character.

It gives a brief summary of the fighting from North Africa to Rome, and then provides a first-person account of the rest of the Italian Campaign. There aren't as many pictures as I expected, but those that are there are new (to me at least) and representative of the text.

Well this book with its hardcover and hundreds of pages of information does not have anything in it about the online role playing.

I have had this tent for a year now, and we camp as a family 4-5 times a year mostly in spring and fall. On two ocassions last year we slept through rain. Although the zippers and walls didn't leak or \\"sweat\\" the floor is where we have had problems. During rainy nights I noticed some water collecting in the corners. There was no evidence of leaks through zippers or any of the seams. Even in relatively dry conditions I have noticed that our underlay blanket is always wet, so I am sure the floor is where the water seeps from.On top of that two of the poles have snapped by now. One of the rear window poles snapped this spring, and one of the two large grey main poles split this weekend.The tent on the inside is roomy and has lots of pockets for storage, lots of mesh windows for ventilation."},{"rating":"2","title":"Decent Tent - Montanta 12x7","review":"Good construction and easy to set up, but does require two people simply to avoid breaking poles. The bottom is made of a light tarp material vs. standard tent material, making it more durable. I still recommend using another tarp underneath to prevent punctures.Also, the main poles are slighly smaller than a Sharpie permanent marker, but the rain fly poles are right at or thinner than a pencil and require a pretty hefty bend to fit.First time out with perfect conditions, one of the rain fly poles started to crack at male/female connection point.

The special effects range from good to really terrible.In the end what kept me from being able to watch this thing all the way through was the ridiculous number of unnecessary subplots featuring interpersonal drama among a bunch of unlikable characters.I want to like an epic length feature with tornadoes, but I really can't recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"pass ye intelligent","review":"It's pretty bad, not worth the commercials if it were on TV.

The story stuck to the original plot, while adding very few creative touches or embellishments. The characters were very stereotypical and any attempt at realistic characterization seems to have failed. I found this story to be shallow and would recommend that fans of Beauty and the Beast retellings read Robin McKinley's \\"Beauty\\" or \\"Rose Daughter.\\" Both were far superior.

It was nice that Jennifer Baker tried to modernize it. However, it's probably time to come out with a second edition or something. The book was written in 1996, yet she doesn't even mention the Internet.

It has everything a gothic romance should have and much more.

A well described era in New York with fascinating characters you could cheer for. I wish there is more of this in contemporary friction."},{"rating":"1","title":"Maybe only for a collectible","review":"Maybe you would only keep this book as a collectible. The story itself bored me. It felt like Virga originally wrote this book with a man and a woman then just went back and touched up the main character, Robert Whyte, and made him a man so that he could make a gay gothic romance. Maybe he was originally Roberta Whyte. He was so feminine and so frail it made me want to puke at times. I got about 3/4's through the book and then I decided I had just had enough. Maybe if you are into extremely feminine men you'll like.

The author has compiled in these pages an invaluable collection of helpful, spiritual advice for men in the 21st century. I am not aware of a more comprehensive volume that covers so many topics within one cover.Hughes identifies the following life areas: relationships, soul, character, ministry, and grace. He then provides specific disciplines that each cultivate a more dynamic Christian lifestyle. His advice is Biblically sound, culturally relevant, and easy to understand.This book will be very helpful to any man who desires to grow deeper in his devotion to Jesus Christ. While it is only an introductory work, it provides a solid foundation on which to begin a more structured approach to discipleship. I recommend it highly."},{"rating":"2","title":"Definitely a cut above your typical Christian book","review":"This book is definitely a cut above the typical shallow self-help books that one finds in Christian book stores these days. It is deep, biblical, extremely well written, and has lots of fabulous illustrations. It also steers clear of the questionable theology found in the best sellers by Joel Osteen and John Eldridge. Readers will find the survey of well known Christians and the books that mean the most to them in the back of the book to be very fascinating and will spur you on to read other great books.

But it's the reliability and on-the-fly adjustability of the BOA lacing system that elevate these above all other shoes. In an instant you can dial the right level of support and tightness, and you never have to worry about laces coming untied.

The discriptions on Northpark and the Galleria, as well as Highland Park Village is very good. The section on hotels and restaurants is also excellent.

She says that if you stick with it, you'll see results in 6 weeks, but I saw (and felt) the results after just a few workouts. The moves aren't too hard to follow and the target/weight training sessions provide a nice break between aerobic segments. I know some people think that she talks too much, but her motivational comments always keep me moving. It also helps that she's a \\"real\\" woman (wife, mom with 2 kids, in her 40's) and not some teenie bopper who's never seen a fat cell in her life.

I first tried this video after having been going to an aerobic class 3-5 times a week for 8 weeks. Boy did my quads hurt the next day! This video gets your heart pumping, the sweat flowing and the breathing gets heavy. Most of the moves are fairly easy, but some are challenging. The video flows well with a warm-up, intense middle, and a relaxing cool down. Denise Austin has a lot of enthusiasm, but she doesn't get on your nerves like some instructors. I find myself checking my posture when she tells me too, and even pat myself on the back when she suggests it. But she does come off a little kooky sometimes. A couple of times she stumbles over words or isn't with the music. But that makes her more endearing; she's not perfect, so that makes you like her more. My problem with the video is the audio quality. The music could be louder and there tends to be some strange thumping noises."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent workout!","review":"I spotted this video in a 3 pack along with Hit the Spot Abs and Hit the Spot Thighs, it was a great deal at just $15.99! Anyway, I thought this video was fantastic, I worked up a good sweat in no time. The video starts out with a 5 minute warm-up. Next, you move onto about 40 minutes of aerobics combined with intervals of muscle toning for your \\"problem\\" areas. Then, you have a cool-down which lasts approximately 4 minutes. All in all, I felt I got a great workout from this tape. The music wasn't all that bad, it kept me motivated, along with Denise's words of encouragement. I will definitely continue to use this video and I can't wait to try out the other two tapes that came with it."},{"rating":"2","title":"The music put to it is powerful","review":"I have been using this tape, Hit the Spot Sizzler for more than 10 years and it put me in great shape and good health.

Denise works the body cardio-wise, to burn calories, and strength-wise, to tone and tighten the body. It's sort of long and could get boring but I always had my own music playing in the background to help it go by faster. I've just recently begun using this tape again to switch up my workouts. I recommend it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for me!","review":"I bought this video because I had seen Denise Austin do her T.V. show and I thought that I would give one of her videos a try. I was highly disappointed! I felt as though she was making up the routine as she went along. She was not only way too happy, but she didn't seem to know what she was going to do next.

I immediately got on line looking for their replacement. Imagine my surprise when I found the exact same clippers on Amazon ( Golden A5-2 Speed ). I ordered them and just received them in the mail.

They worked flawlessly for these many years on my various pairs of miniature schnauzers until, alas, I knocked them off the grooming table onto a cement floor where the case smashed into many pieces. The new one seems a replica of the old one which is refreshing since I assumed the casing now would be flimsier while encasing lesser quality innards. I'm happy to say that it seems the same great clipper as before. There were two changes I noted however. It now has two speeds and the cost has doubled."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oster Golden A5 2-Speed Clipper","review":"I wasn't very happy with the ability of this Oster clipper when clipping my Yorkshire Terrier and mixed terrier. I had to go against the hair growth to get a good cut. When I purchased sized blades, I found no relief to my problems. Finally I put the clipper away and took my unhappy pets back to the pet groomer. Not at all the quality product I purchased in the 1970's. I hope Oster has better models, but I think I won't try it again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works Great","review":"I use the Oster Golden A5 for my Himalayan cat. It cuts through his hair easily and quickly and the motor does not get bogged down like in a lot of other brands. Like all clippers, the blade gets hot after about 20 minutes of continuous grooming, but I find by then we both need to take a break anyways! I recommend this clipper for anyone who needs to clip down their cat's fur. Can be pricy but worth every penny, and average cat grooming can be $70, so it pays for itself quickly."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where's the case?","review":"When I read the description of the item.

NOPE, just a box."},{"rating":"2","title":"decent clippers","review":"I bought these clippers because we have an older double-coat long-hair cat who does not like being brushed as much is necessary to keep her mat-free. We had bought cheaper clippers from our local big-box store and it just didn't work the way we needed it to. These worked better than the cheaper ones we had purchased but it was still tough getting through some of her mats. This doesn't mean that the clippers are the culprit, it was tough trimming the mats down with scissors designed for cutting hair (sharper that most standard scissors), so it may just be that she has fur that resists being trimmed when matted regardless of what is used.Overall, I think these are good clippers, and the price on Amazon was cheaper than any other site I had seen and much cheaper than buying one from our local pet store. I would say this was a good purchase."},{"rating":"2","title":"Oster Clippers Surpass the Rest","review":"This is my second set of oster clippers.

Other clippers took forever to cut my dogs hair and I finally gave up until I found the Oster A5. They were recomended to me by a schnauzer breeder. They may cost a little more than other clippers but in my experience they are superior in every way and outlast all the others I have tried."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great product","review":"Did some research on hair clippers before purchasing the A5 two-speed clipper.

My personal favorites have to be the Pacific Northwest Light Mussels, which I have served twice as an appetizer to rave reviews at dinner parties (and have been able to scale down the recipe for one when I wanted to make dinner for myself), and the seared salmon recipe, which was delicious and incredibly easy.

It is a scholarly work, which spends much more time talking about things like racism and things like the plight of classism in Central America than about how to give help to a woman in need of guidance.The fact is, there are only a few pages on how to counsel a woman who is raped or one from domestic violence (under 10 pages, actually). This book does not address AT ALL the situation of so many women who feel that several stories in the Bible support rape. Many women I've helped have a problem linking the concept of turning the other cheek/forgiveness with allowing vicitmization.The concept of the marriage vow, as it related to domestic violence is not even covered. Many women feel they have to stay with an abusive husband out of the covenant they made to God. Women often need to feel it is acceptable and preferable to God to divorce, rather than a Sin. This book offers no help at all."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bought one & liked it so much I just ordered 2 more","review":"I bought this over other brands for a kick drum mic. Disregarding the low cost, this is very nice, adding the cost back in and wow, it's very impressive. I just ordered 2 more to use for guitar cabs.

Works perfect; much better than trying to get a normal size stand to reach the base and be unobtrusive.

Will work great for any \\"low\\" stand application."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best small stand you can buy","review":"This is no doubt the best small stand sold out there for under $100 and it cost no where near that! Very heavy tripod base so it's easier to position close in than round base models and it didn't tip even with a heavy mic fully extended. Impressed by the Samson quality.

The reason I chose this stand over others is because of its weight. I wanted a bass mic stand that would not topple over with a heavier mic attached to its end. Product was in excellent shape, looks great and is pretty well constructed! The reason I say pretty well is that the piece that connects boom to stand is made of some type of plastic not steel like rest of stand... whatever.. Still works great and is very sturdy.

It provides a comprehensive treatment of alternatives to punishment in dealing with behavior problems evidenced by human beings at various levels of development and in various circumstances. Based upon their own extensive observations and a thorough-going analysis of relevant experimental studies, Gary LaVigna and Anne Donnellan have put together a document that is at once a teaching instrument, a summary of research, and an argument for the use of positive reinforcement in the treatment of inadequate or undesired behavior. It is also, I believe, a book that can be read with profit by psychiatrists, by educationalists, and by clinical psychologists of every stripe - especially those who are acquainted with the basic concepts of present-day behaviorism.--- from book's preface"},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrendous!","review":"These DVDs have been directly copied from VHS tape.

Instead of focusing exclusively on the crime and investigation as L&O does, Kellerman seems to want to spotlight the family instead. I kept wanting to hear about the case but instead got Decker's religious practices, a very poorly written Internal Affairs investigation, etc, etc. I put the book down twice only to pick it back up (I hate to leave a mystery unsolved) until Decker's son decided to help Dad. That was too much. Very disappointing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mass murder stumps Peter","review":"This book begins with a mass murder in a trendy restaurant. The police think they have found the man who did it and they are ready to close the case. Peter Decker thinks otherwise and he spends the rest of the book trying to find out what was really behind the murders. He looks into the family lives of some of the deceased and finds multiple motives for the murders. Several family members stand to gain financially and personally from the deaths of their relatives. Peter is accused of sexual harrassment when he interviews one of the suspects, and Rina stands by him when he is forced to defend himself.

(Unless I'm on a trans-Atlantic flight and her mystery novels are the ONLY reading materials available.) The characters were boring, the dialogue wasn't funny or interesting, the main character was a sexist pig, and I figured out who did it before I was halfway through. I almost skipped to the last chapter to see if I was right but I rarely put down a book or \\"cheat\\" on a mystery novel. Fortunately, the quick pace (due to a lack of literary description about anything or anyone) kept me going until the lame ending."},{"rating":"1","title":"waste of time","review":"The story was utterly predictable, the characters were self-righteous and boring, the writing was mediocre at best, and reading the book was a complete waste of time. I read the entire story because I expected the author to come up with some interesting plot or character developments; she didn't. I keep seeing Faye Kellerman's name on the best seller lists and thought there must be a reason for her popularity. This book was not it. I suppose that any author may produce a poor story, but this one was so nothing, I wonder why it was published. I trust Ms. Kellerman's other books are something more than poorly written, boring blather. I should have followed my usual rule: if something is poorly written, don't continue to read it. Life is too short to read bad books."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Plot","review":"The problem with this book is the gaping flaws in the plot. The story begins by proving that more than one person must have been involved in the mass shooting, so the hunt is on. But eventually, the plot winds down, and we are suddenly presented with one perpetrator, and we are told that he must have seemed like two \\"with bullets whizzing around.\\" (This is despite the earlier forensic evidence about the direction of the shots.) Seems quite careless plotting. There are about a dozen other improbabilities as well, but I can't go into them without giving the story away."},{"rating":"1","title":"Peter Decker is on/off a mass murder case.","review":"My first Faye Kellerman book, and I feel it was a bad choice. Peter was the only character I had a feel for. His sexual harassment hearing after interviewing a prominent and beautiful witness/suspect was not believable. Rita's testimony was equally unbelievable. In short, the characters did not get developed, there was a lot of trivial dialogue and the transition from place to place, scene to scene, character to character was bumpy and at times confusing. (Let's see, where are now?) The overall plot was great, the build-up was good, but the climax was wimpy. From whence did the title come (I realize serpent's don't have teeth)? Any recommendations on what work captures the (I hope) real Faye Kellerman?"},{"rating":"1","title":"A slightly less than mediocre mystery","review":"An uninspiring look at how simplistic best sellers can be. The book plods, the character development is quite basic and the dialogue is unrealistic. The show-saving teens part of the plot belongs in a Nancy Drew novel, or better yet, a Scooby-Doo script, and I don't appreciate Ms. Kellerman force feeding me a Hebrew history lesson.

His bias is evident as he consistently goes against the grain on what is established and accepted. There is nothing wrong with developing theories and presenting them in books, so long as there is sufficient evidence to support your claims, at the very least enough for people to take you seriously. Osman instead resorts to criticizing Egyptologists rather then refuting their claims with actual evidence for some of these absurd claims of his. There is a reason he is not taken seriously amongst Egyptologists."},{"rating":"1","title":"Moses or Akhenaten??","review":"Ahmed Osman did extensive research on monuments, papyrus texts and the tombs of Egypt. However his basic idea that Akhenaten was Moses is proposterus and his arguments are unconvincing. Despite this, his extensive research in Egyptian and Israelite history is quite helpful. He also follows the western idea that the Egyptians were the first monotheists and that their sun-god had no shape. this is despite much evidence in his book from the time of Akhenaten showing the sun as a disc and that the name aten means disc. However the book is worth reading if only for the extensive research without his suppositions."},{"rating":"1","title":"Startling...to say the least.","review":"I first read this book after viewing an article online on the Graham hancock website. I must admit that I was rather intrigued by the fearless claims made by the author. However having read widely into this genre, including authors such as Laurence gardner, I found some of the information to correlate with the vague historical context of Akhenaten. Certainly for open minded readers this book is highly recommended as a study of the origins of monotheism in an unprejudiced manner. My only criticism is that it wanders from the topic slightly later on in the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"I didn't read it--just intrigued by the thread","review":"Just curious--has anyone considered that Moses may have influenced Akhenaten towards monotheism? If the Exodus is dated more in the 1400s and Akhenaten's reign was in the 1300s, it seems possible.Then monotheism would still have been started by the Hebrews, but it would explain the odd \\"patch\\" of mono/henotheism in Egypt's long history of polytheism.That's actually what led me to this review--I was trying to figure out if anyone's made that connection.

It is largely due to Ahmed Osman that many people now consider the link between the so-called heretic king Akhenaten and Biblical Moses to be self-evident. The increasing popularity of his work has now provoked the jealous rage of institutional scholars as shamefully evidenced in the March 2002 issue of Archaeology Magazine. Sadly, the pioneering work \\"Moses: Pharaoh of Egypt\\" by Ahmed Osman has been out of print and difficult to acquire for many years. But no longer.

I bought an additional 5F blade thinking a bigger blade would help. Same thing.The clipper works wonderful on my hair and my wife's hair. Is there an easy answer, I don't know.

These worked well out of the box, but, since they ran a little hot I'd just clip our dogs half way and give them/me a rest.We have fairly big dogs that have thick double coats so I knew I needed a good pair of clippers. So, $150 or so with shipping later they worked great the first time. I lent them to our friends who have a lab mix and they worked for them. I tried them this year and they cut about 3\\" and stop.

Has nothing to do with blades being sharp or oiled. Can reseat the blade and have it cut like butter for 20 seconds, then nothing. Blades still vibrating, no change in sound etc. Can reseat 10 times or more and MAYBE have it start cutting like butter again. Did note that the #10 blade worked fine, but also noticed that the #10 has 3 tines for every 2 tines on the #3 or #5 blades. Hence, it appears clear that the shuttle is somehow not traveling far enough to actually cut the hair with the #3 or #5 blades. Have had this product for about 3 years and use to trim 2 dogs.Given the cost and inability to diagnose or fix this problem - I WOULD NOT RECOMMEND THIS CLIPPER."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oster A5 should be recalled","review":"The A5 dual speed would have been a fine piece of equipment if not for a cooling vent design flaw.

Amazing that there hasnt been a recall or class action lawsuit."},{"rating":"2","title":"Like a Warm Knife through Butter","review":"It took a minute to get used to the speed of this clipper, but it's my first clipper ever, so that doesn't mean much perhaps.

Over those years I've bought $30-$60 trimmers -- all of which got too hot and wore out too quickly. Basically junk. So I resorted to having professional trimmers take care of my dogs. Had a TERRIBLE experience with our local Petco last year, when one dog came home terrorized, and our second dog injured from their treatment.After that incident, and paying $130 for Petco's terrible service, I decided to go back to doing it myself. This time I wised up and bit and bought the standard, the Oster A-5. What a pleasure to use. It trims faster, cooler, and easier. And that makes the whole experience easier on my dogs, and easier on the trimmer (me).Worth every penny. I just wish I'd done this ten years ago."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy this it's overpriced","review":"Nobody needs 2 speeds to trim an animal. Get the single speed Golden A5 instead. This product does not include free shipping so it's about 50% more expensive than the single high-speed version. Also, don't but any extra blades until you try the #10 blade that is included. The #7 blade is almost identical and costs about $30. The price at over $230 is ridiculous. You can get these trimmers for less that half that price elsewhere."},{"rating":"2","title":"OMG","review":"So this is the way clippers are suppose to perform.

Within the last year I'd notice that the blades would jam up in their coats. I thought I needed new blades and so went out and bought 2 new blades of differing sizes.To my surprize, they jammed up too. Just would not cut their hair at all. Like others said, I did all the cleaning, lubing, adjusting of the blades and trimmers all along. But no matter what I do this unit will not cut my dog's hair. The blades are moving, but no cutting. Bizarre.Now I have all these blades and for what I spent on them I could have bought a new set of clippers. I have thought about ordering a new A5 unit, but after reading these reviews I realize that would be a huge waste of money.I think I am going to look at Andis at Wal-Mart or PetsMart.

I have a bischon & her coat can become matted & difficult to cut. This will go right through it with no problem at all. It does cut very close. Basically it shaves right down vey close to the skin. It does not cut the skin. If you have a dog with a lot of matting this is for you! You may want to purchase a different blade it you would like to leave their coat longer. The blades are expensive. Around $25.00 or more a piece. I ordered the #4 blade that was recommended for a bischon & was very disapointed with it. It would not even penetrate her coat. I am returning it for a refund. I gave 4 stars because it does seem to get hot quite often & needs to cool down. I was able to finish in 2 hours & thats with a dog who does not like to have her hair cut & that also includes the time to do trimming around her face, ears & feet with a scissors.

A diabolical, yet ingenious method of story-telling, I must say, but one that is conducive toward having that tale be indelibly ingrained in one's mind.A nice twist at the end is often what also makes a story memorable for me and Bergeron offers up a good one in his debut novel. At first glance, the title \\"The New Kid\\" might conjure up certain ideas of what the book is about, perhaps making one think of a new kid they remember from school. After the last page is read, however, and the reader is left to ponder the mysterious and frightening events that befall the characters in this novel, the reader will undoubtedly never think of a \\"new kid\\" in the same manner.

If you or your significant other are completely new to the subject (as in have never heard of it) then this book MIGHT have some value to you. Otherwise, choose something else to read.In my opinion, a beginner would want an answer to the question of \\"why\\" her partner wants to play in this way.

It goes through some of the emotional/mental issues that a woman might face in starting out in this sort of scene/lifestyle. It does address the mental issues and reservations that some women might have with beginning to find their dominant nature. The book goes on to lay out a very basic scene to get you started as well, in great detail. I found this book to be very short, well-written, and easy to read, but it made me want to read more. I found the Mistress Manual by Lorelei to be a little more detailed in helping me decide what sorts of scenes interest me, so I would recommend that book in addition to this.

Its sound quality is tinny with no bass control. Its controls are not obvious. Love that it holds multiple CDs & was easy to assemble."},{"rating":"1","title":"Big Mistake","review":"Short and sweet, after a month of use, the disc changer does not work.

I strongly suggest to stear away from buying this."},{"rating":"1","title":"At least it worked for a few months","review":"This product was a disappointment. The cd player quit working after only a short time. If you're looking for a dependable product, keep looking."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Music System","review":"It has been about 13 months since I bought it. Initially, it gave me \\"No Disk\\" error for MP3 CDs. I didn't care much since normal CDs played without issues. Now, it doesn't play even normal CDs and gives a \\"No Disk\\" error. I am clueless as to what I can do. This is really bad workmanship by Sony. I bought the brand because I trusted it a lot."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good until went totally bad.","review":"I purchased this stereo March 2009. It was much larger than I expected for being a \\"shelf unit\\" but the sound was really good. The CD player never seemed to work when loaded with 3 at a time but I usually just had one in so I didn't bother with it (thought maybe I was doing something wrong). May 2010 the CD player just stopped working. I can load one and it just says \\"reading\\" and makes noises but will not work. I couldn't find the paperwork until today and of course it's out of warranty. I am really disappointed with this being a Sony because the last one I had worked for 10 years or more. It's not worth sending it back so now I have to look for another one and I know it won't be a Sony."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent!!","review":"The unit is definitely a bargain with very good sound effect.

Tacky-looking shiny silver and black, all sorts of useless protruberances -- one big ugly stereo unit, two big ugly speakers. Designed by/for bikers? I live in a rural area with iffy reception and this does worse than my puny little kitchen radio in tuning in local FM stations. Add to that complicated instructions for switching among stations and modes and you have a really unappealing product for anyone over the age of 15."},{"rating":"1","title":"Turns off after a few seconds...","review":"I purchased this unit for my dad a few years ago. It worked OK during that period, but now it does not work.After turning the unit off standby, no sound comes out of the unit for any of the audio functions (radio, CD), and after a few second it the standby light turns on again. So, it's not functional anymore.My dad used it lightly, so this is pretty disappointing reliability. I expected better from Sony."},{"rating":"1","title":"what happened?","review":"I purchased this at the end of October it is now the end of February and the unit doesn't work and my CD is stuck inside. I know that it was inexpensive but it still should last more than 4 months I am very dissapointed with this because I was trying to save money and now I have to purchase another one but it surley won't be a sony. I spoke with Sony tech support and they weren't able to help only to ask if the unit was plugged in and then to unplug it and plug it in again. As far as I'm concerned this was a waste of my money. I guess you only get what you pay for and I learned a lesson don't buy cheap"},{"rating":"1","title":"Power Supply Problems","review":"I purchased this unit a little more than a year ago. Everything was okay until this morning when it turned itself off and the Standby light started to flash. I followed the instructions in the manual, which said to power the unit off, then turn on again. I did this, but it didn't solve the problem. I contacted Sony support and \\"chatted\\" with a tech support person. He said there was no solution and gave me a link to a repair site. I got an estimate of $130 to have the unit repaired. Since this is more than the cost of a new unit, I've written it off.

The sound is quite nice but it is very difficult to tune and setting the stations memory does not work. The whole outfit is counter-intuitive when trying to change options as well as channging discs. The last straw was when the tray jamed and refused to open locking in two of my favorite dics. Chat room help was not helpful AT ALL! I ended up destroying the change tray to retrieve my discs.

I was skeptical of it cause I'm used to infinity speakers. I tried it out though and I'm NOT disappointed at all. This thing is totally awesome. It works with my Iphone 4,Ipod 5Gen,and nano. The device just plugs in, nothing else required at all. Interchange at will. The sound is very good. I can't really praise it enough. Heck it's almost the same as my giant infinity towers and that's saying something. The built in EQ is a very nice touch also. I like a good EQ. This one is presets, which I don't like, but at least it sounds good on the presets. Basically to sum up, if you see this around don't be shy and go ahead and get it."},{"rating":"1","title":"not worth it","review":"We bought this stereo to use in a retail store, which means daily usage. A stereo should be capable of that, but the CD loading mechanism has already stopped working. When will these companies go back to making CD players that only take one CD player; the multi-disc players are rarely a success. I would not recommend this stereo to anyone who is a serious music listener. It won't be able to keep up. We have had this stereo for 14 months. What a waste of money!"},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT SOUNDING SYSTEM","review":"I BOUGHT THIS SYSTEM AND COULDN'T BE MORE PLEASED WITH IT, THE SOUND IS GREAT,EASY TO USE,THE ONLY DOWNSIDE IS THAT I WISH THERE WAS A CASSETTE PLAYER INCLUDED FOR THE THOUSANDS OF TAPES I OWN BUT OTHER THEN THAT I DON'T HAVE ANY COMPLAINTS AND SONY HAS ALWAYS BEEN A REPUTABLE NAME FOR PURCHASING STEREO SYSTEMS.IF YOU'RE A MUSIC LOVER LOOKING FOR A GOOD SYSTEM AT A DECENT PRICE DON'T HESITATE,YOU'LL ENJOY THIS FOR MANY YEARS PLUS THERE IS A 3 DISC CD PLAYER WHICH IS COOL TOO."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sony MHC-EC55 Mini Hi-Fi Component System","review":"This was a gift to my niece.

She has an extensive music collection which includes some cassettes and she wanted a system with a sub-woofer. Despite what the technical specs say, this system has neither. I thought it would be a perfect gift as most systems with subwoofers are much more powerfull than she needs (they are also much more expensive) and was very disappointed with what I received. I was also unimpressed with Amazon's lack of interest in resolving the situation. I have returned the unit and will seek another system elsewhere."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book","review":"This is an excellent compilation of articles written by some of the top professors in the field.

The individual articles each cover their own topics well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just okay","review":"This book was okay. It seemed over-exaggerated to me the way everyone was so against her making a quilt, like she was about to go rob a bank or something. I kept picturing her next line being something like, \\"Now you all leave me alone, I'm gonna rob that bank and that's all there is to it.\\"Other than that, it was a sweet enough story. The photography is beautiful, so it would make a great gift for someone. It also makes a lot of references to the Bible for the more spiritually-minded people out there."},{"rating":"2","title":"Covers the state, but there are better books if you day-hike","review":"If you're going to Southcentral Alaska (i.e., anywhere within 100 or so miles of Anchorage, including the Kenai Peninsula) a much more comprehensive and useful book is 55 Ways to the Wilderness in Southcentral Alaska by Helen Niehauser (sp?). Unlike 55 Ways, Dufresne's book does cover the whole state, but it lists only a small number of hikes, and they are all multi-day trips, some of them requiring good route-finding skills. It also appears that Dean Littlepage's (sp?) book on hiking in Alaska has statewide coverage and lists many more hikes than this book, though I have only thumbed thru the TOC of that one. On the other hand, Dufresne knows his stuff, writes engagingly, and describes some renowned multi-day hikes in depth.

I'm not certain it would keep your food warm in such a cold condition but I can't say for sure since I never tried it.

The ice cold thermal factor actually works better than the hot factor. I put ice cubes in overnight at room temperature and they were hardly melted in the morning. I really like the wide mouth, easy to clean. Although you can also wash in dishwasher rack too, although water leaks into the base just a little because of the hot water jets. (it leaks in where the black bottom is against the stainless steel.) But that isn't a problem... I just pop off the base and let it dry out. Can be snapped back on easy enough.

I only use the most basic functions (ie. recording checking acct transactions and reconciling them at the end of the month) and it just feels clumsy to me. I absolutely HATE the reconcile function- the program tries to auto reconcile (which it never gets right), but if a transaction isn't correct, you have to drag it from one box to another and then uncheck it. And it keeps all you statements 'open' so if you accidentally click on the wrong statement and start clearing transactions it throws all your balances off. I pride myself on being computer savvy and able to navigate most programs pretty easily, but I can't seem to reconcile my checking account without making a million mistakes.

It has proper search integration, behaves as you expect a Mac program to behave, is stable, imports and exports quickly and easily, and is designed with care.The product has room to grow--reports are currently limited to a single kind, and I think there might be a few high-end features of <shudder> that other program that haven't found their way into this program, but if there are I haven't noticed yet, as I'm too busy doing what I want to do and not cursing at my computer any more.Definitely recommend."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can not import properly from Quicken","review":"iBank seems like a good alternate to Quicken for a Macintosh computer.

Starting out from scratch with iBank would probably be a good option. However, if you have previous accounts in Quicken it's a lot of work to start all over again especially since the program is supposed to import all of your date.

Check printing is a major chore...you have to manually setup the print onto your check stock. Entering transactions is tedious...no rapid entry windows for that task.

Unfortunately, I wasn't even able to import my QIF/Quicken data. The file imported but most of the transactions were missing. Of those records that imported, iBank overwrote the transaction date with the date of the import. There were probably other errors, too, but I stopped my test shortly after the buggy import.There is a user forum and a quick start guide, but no full documentation.Also, the trial software prompted me to buy it every 15 minutes.So the search continues for some decent financial software. Darn.May 14, 2011 Update - I am currently in my 30 day free trial of Moneydance and it's going well.

It is not as sophisticated as Quicken for the MAC but it is easier to use.So far it is adequate for my purposes.

Quicken for Mac had poor reviews and, from what I read, didn't have multiple currency support, so I elected to try iBank. Unfortunately, it didn't meet my needs.First, it did a poor job transferring in my Quicken QIF files. My investment accounts transfered in with negative balances which I couldn't rectify. The multiple currency support did not seem to function correctly and the program - even after the update - crashed repeatedly (odd for a Mac program).Thus, iBank didn't really live up to the Quicken replacement that I was looking for."},{"rating":"1","title":"After-the-sale customer service was very difficult to find.","review":"I bought iBank and encountered a problem setting up my accounts.

Most of the imported data showed the wrong account balances and many of them had dates for account entries that hadn't even arrived yet in the month. The interface has these large icons all over the page, which I find to be distracting and kind of amateurish. The text size is too large. You're supposed to have 30 days to evaluate it, but I saw one warning window indicating I could use it for 15 minutes. I assume that was 15 minutes at a time but not sure.

Since I had the product I figured I would try it on a couple of other items, but it did nothing. I followed the directions exactly, I tried it twice to be sure and nothing. It did not remove even the slightest of scratches. It does clean (remove dust)nicely, but I can buy a cleaner for less money.Do not bother, it doesn't work.

I used the #2 on it for the heck of it, not expecting much and with just a quick, light buff this stuff worked fantastic. It gave the clock face cover a mirror smooth finish.

It takes a little bit of work, but it gets the job done. Most other abrasives that you can buy in hardware or auto parts stores like polishing compound won't work on plastics and will just make them cloudy.

My old water heater vented with 3\\" vent. This unit take 5\\" and above 2000 ft elevation you must vent with 6\\". I'm just under 4000 ft. So you must install new vent up through the roof. The unit uses more gas, but for a much shorter time, so it must have 3/4 inch gas pipe plumbed to it. All in all quite a bit of work, but I'm sure it will pay for itself in the long run. I did all the labor, if someone had to pay a plumber to install the product it would be a much longer time before it would pay for itself!"},{"rating":"1","title":"BOSCH has no stars in my book","review":"This new unit started leaking gas internally. I contacted Bosch and they refused to replace it or even take it in for warranty repair. It had only been installed a couple of months before.

I got no responce from them. No warranty parts, no unit replacement, and no warranty return for repair.

The first one was damaged in shipping but Bosch shipped a new one within a week. I use well water at a ground temperature of 54 deg. fh. The water coming out of the tap is comparable to the 50 gal tank heater I replaced. However, when taking a shower I notice a slight pressure drop when someone else opens a hot water tap. I also notice a slight temperature change as the water pressure changes with the pump cycling off and on. Overall I can put up with these quirks if I can save on propane. I might try narrowing the working range of the pump. If one had a city water supply they wouldn't have this problem however I know the nearest municipal to me use water from a river which is 39 deg. during the winter.

Place in a secure size-appropriate candleholder such as a latticed metal chamber (air flows through while keeping the candle from overturning - I found two sizes at Target) or a ceramic box-style base which will support even a bumpy-bottomed candle.

Marina's book was so easy to follow that I was able to complete it in only a few days. I gained not only a good understanding of hard to understand concepts in Oracle, but also, found its numerous SQL code examples mostly (hence a 9) practical. I feel so much more comfortable with a new contract requiring me to manage 400 new Oracle Installations on NT. I plan to use this book as a constant review before tackling other more advanced books dedicated to specific areas, covered in Marina's book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for Database Professionals","review":"I bought this book to get a thorough grounding in the basics of Oracle architecture and administration. Unfortunately, this book supplies merely a cocktail-partyish knowledge of Oracle. The author mentions the major points, but she goes on to another subject before she tells you anything practical. You might sound like you know what you're talking about, but you won't know what you're doing. This book may serve well as a primer for someone who has no previous experience with a relational database, perhaps on a High School level. I pity the business that relies on someone whose only knowledge of Oracle comes from this book. For just a few extra dollars, you can buy something longer that 170 pages. If you are actually going to use Oracle, you will need it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Started out as a promising novel!!","review":"This started out as a great book but as the story goes on I find it pointless to tell.

I'll be the first person to buy it when it does come out because, lets face it, the song's absolute genius! I have been a Mariah fan for about 7 years now and while she is great on ballads, she sure can do the fast tracks! 'Heartbreaker' is great- the melody is catchy,but not annoyingly catchy, and the beat is just cool. With regards to Mariah's taste in clothes, she should be able to wear whatever the hell she likes- how many of us can bang out a tune like her? The fact of the matter is, she is highly talented and should be commented on for her musical skill and not her flirty fashion fetish.

Though it was commendable that she broke away from the balladeer role that she'd perfected from the very onset of her career, her voice is simply not suited to energetic, brainless dance music. Her depthless lyrics don't tend to help very much. \\"Heartbreaker\\" follows the same formula begun by \\"Dreamlover\\" and continued with \\"Fantasy\\" and \\"Honey\\", breaking absolutely no new ground while sounding pretty boring indeed. (Her rumoured upcoming movie role, on the other hand, promises to be interesting)I wonder when she'll realize, looking back, that the best up-tempo song in her whole catalogue, blending her strengths (vocal power, muscular arrangements to back up that power) and influences (soul, gospel, pop, rock), is \\"There's Got to Be a Way\\"?"},{"rating":"2","title":"I miss the old Mariah","review":"I think Heartbreaker is a cool song, and it is a cool music video, but I wish Mariah would go back to her old self.

Mariah DID put a lot of time and effort into her career. I think she is absoulutly the most beautiful girl in the world. And i really think she looks pretty in her \\"Heartbreaker\\" video!

Those who hate on her, are those who are only focused on what others have said about her. No one has ever said that just because you dress a certain way, that it affects your music. I think Mariah has thought a lot about what she want's to do as an artist and as her own being. Mariahs' music has always pulled me in, and her new Heartbreaker CD, will be mine soon enough.

And I thought Jay-Z's rhymes in this song were more catchy than some of his other stuff. The lyrics aren't anything to \\"ooh and ahh\\" about but who cares?

Unfortunately the manufacture does not intend to keep the software and drivers current and that is a big problem. For example I bought a new computer with Vista 64. No drivers. I called the customer support people and they told me that they have no intention of providing 64 bit drivers for Vista or for the new Windows 7. Not just that they haven't gotten around to it but that they have no plans to support future operating systems. Hmmm.Also, if you look you will see that they are not keeping current with the latest versions of other software such as ACT 2009 or 2010.It makes me wonder if they eventually plan on dropping these products which would be too bad.

After trying numerous solutions, I figured I would try a new version. When operating properly, the Card Scan is useful albeit not perfect. It speeds up the process of loading cards, although many of the scans do wind up needing corrections.The new one did not work either. When trying to install, it won't make it past the calibration phase. I tried every fix they had on the website to no avail. After reading all the reviews, I wasn't that surprised. The easy returns through Amazon made it worth the shot that it would work, but it did not.If you try it and it works, it's a 3 star product...if it doesn't work, 1 star and back to Amazon. If you give it a shot, make sure you keep your packaging."},{"rating":"2","title":"Incredibly easy to install and sync to Outlook","review":"I found the scanner & software installation very quick and easy. I use Microsoft Outlook to maintain my contacts for both computer & PDA and I found that by using the scanner I've made my contact information more complete (typically I never entered mailing addresses and titles to save time) and I've dramatically cut the time needed to enter and update contacts. A tool exists to find duplicate contacts it was very effective in eliminating multiple duplicate entries in my contact database. Sometimes the scanner has trouble recognizing company names, as business cards frequently have artistic logos in place of written names, so some manual entry may still be required. It does poorly with cursive writing, as to be expected. But it is pretty sharp at taking in phone numbers without making mistakes, and that is most important for my purposes. The online contact archiving tool seems that it would be useful as well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dissappointed","review":"I was very excited about this product but I basically have to correct the bad reads from the scanner.

Easy to use, and the software has synched well with Outlook. I only give it 4 instead of 5 stars because many cards need to be corrected after scanning, although that is always due to graphics on the cards that make it difficult for CardScan to read all of the information. It's probably doing the best that can be done with the technology, but I'd need perfection to give it 5 stars. Definitely worth the money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Need tech support?

Maybe they'll pick up the phone before your Card Scan shows up, but I doubt it. Hours are something ridiculous like only after 10:30 AM.

If 0 stars was an option, I would have chosen it."},{"rating":"1","title":"difficult to get to work","review":"Unit would not work properly. Would not accept the serial number, despite that it came with it! After many emails to customer service (they take 2-3 days to respond) I decided to download the software off their web site instead of using what was supplied. I then had to apply for a new serial number (another 2 days). Finially, the software worked.Then a difficult time getting the scanner to scan the cards propperly. YOu cannot just lay them flat and feed --- noooo.... ! YOu have to lift the card slightly. It takes some practice.The OCR is average. It gets 1 out of 10 names/line incorrect in some manner.Bottom line: If it wasn't so cheap, I would have returned it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great capture, easy to use","review":"Most card scanners seem to get mixed reviews. This one seemed to get the best reviews so I tried it. I have been very impressed with it's text capturing and matching capabilities. How it knows where the name is on some of these cards is beyond me. It misses some characters here and there, but I'm sure they all do. This is the only one I've tried, but I'm very satisfied. I have scanned hundreds of cards and feel so much more organized."},{"rating":"1","title":"I guess I was looking for his first book","review":"This book looked really complete and interesting, but it is actually rather rambling with interesting bits hidden in the midst of semi-relevant anecdotes.I later discovered this is the sequel to another book to which this merely adds detail, perhaps it would be better after I had read that one."},{"rating":"2","title":"You Need This Book","review":"Awesome book, buy both of his books if your thinking about buying this one first.

No one could write a book about your area and tell you exactly what to do. I read both of his books back to back, they are great! The info in his books are the hard part, but even he tells you that you need to know more and you need to look for the info to fill in the gaps.Other books that go along good with this one.U.S. Air Force Survival HandbookSurvival PoachingMantrappingIf your into this kinda thing, you'll like all these books!Hope this helps someone."},{"rating":"2","title":"This was great!","review":"I watched this show growing up and watching it again I still love it.

The bulbs have three embossed groves on the backside and you will not be able to turn and lock them in the housing. You have to sand those embossed groves down (I used a file, took a minute to do). After they are sanded down the bulbs lock right in. This maybe the case in other vehicles as well so don't worry if they won't lock.

I am an amateur photographer who wants to learn to learn morea about digital photography and take pictures of sports, but I found it hard with this book to figure out how to best take photos with my camera, which isn't professional equipment, and then what to do with the photos. The author has some good experience, although it would have been nice to have a wider perspective of both photography as well as various types of sports--not just the big, typical ones. It's interesting to read about this kind of photography, but isn't that practical, at least for me.

There's no way I would sell it now at twice the price! The m604 is my new best friend.I'll just add, because I've seen some confusion about this, that it does work perfectly with my Zune 80. All you have to do is pop out the plastic insert in the stand.Edited a year later to note that the Kicker 500 blows this system out of the water. I just THOUGHT I was hearing good sound.

I originally bought it to take on vacation, to bring on the beach, but it operates on ac power only. That was dissappointing. I wanted something battery operated so that I could use it outside.

D.G. Kousoulas brings into focus the diversity of religious culture and political intrigue that helped to shape Christianity's long standing tradition and doctrinal values. The figure of Constantine is carefully portrayed in the mutifaceted aspects of his ever changing family, political, and social world. Individual chapters grant the reader a well-focused account of specific events without distraction or confusion. D.G. Kousoulas bases his findings on well documented facts without appology for any of history's blank pages. Rather, he uses them to enhance the reader's sense of involvement in the making of history. Also, Kousoulas' gentle narrative style was a refreshing, much appreciated change of pace, the likes of which I hope to see more of in the future."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth your time...for several reads","review":"What strikes me about this book is that Eliot, for the most part, posits blatant assertions without much logical, analytic proof. And yet, he does not fail to convince, perhaps largely because his vision is so clear and relevant. He draws from common experience to validate what he says, and after reading his argument, one is impressed by the lucidity and transformational power of his argument. He does not come across as a man ranting on the apparent decadence and failure of modern society; rather, he leaves the impression of a man truly concerned with the condition of society and with a genuine desire for its improvement. When you look at the copyright date, it becomes even more impressive."},{"rating":"2","title":"Christianity and Culture","review":"Eliot crystallizes the purpose and meaning behind a fundamentally Christian society--the 'Community of Christians'.

I hope there should be better item for me and other persons"},{"rating":"2","title":"An Entertaining Film","review":"While this film is reminiscent of many other made-for-TV film on a form of addiction (drug, gambling, kleptomania, etc.), it's bouyed by an interesting storyline and surprisingly strong acting by Harry Hamlin, and especially Lisa Rinna. Unlike many other \\"Based on actual events\\" films, it actually felt real. I highly recommend seeing it.A warning: There are two or three scenes of brief nudity in the DVD version which was not aired on television (Lifetime Movie Network). While it didn't bother me at all, you rarely see that in a \\"Lifetime\\" movie no matter what medium it's shown. So I was taken aback for a second. Don't take that as a knock on the film in any way; it's still a must-see. I'm just giving potential viewer a heads-up."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Lure of the Flesh","review":"Harry Hamlin portrays a doctor with a loving family (a wife and two sons). From all appearances this is the all american family...except the husband is hiding a terrible secret. Over the course of time he has become a sex addict. His addiction requires that he have a secret place for his torrid addiction which he realizes will cost him everything if he is every caught. However, when he is caught-up in the moment, nothing else matters. Hamlin and Renna (real life husband/wife) show the devastation a family encounters because of one partner's addictions. More importantly, can he get help and when/if he does, will it be to late? This is a must see film. It makes you think. This can happen to anyone in any economic bracket, race, or gender. In this case its the husband with the addiction but women are just as subceptible."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lost potential","review":"I found this band on Pandora.

I haven't seen this film in years. A true musical classic."},{"rating":"2","title":"You'll Love This Musical","review":"Judy Holliday steals the show. In her role as Ella Peterson, a vunerable employee of \\"Suesanswerphone\\", (a telephone answering service in the days before answering machines) she reaches out to help three of her many subscribers with hilarious results. The triad include a dentist that wishes he were a composer, a beatnik actor that no one will hire, and a down-on-his-luck playright. All three of these characters have something in common, as the movie reveals. The music by Jule Styne is memorable and includes the hits \\"The Party's Over\\" and \\"Just In Time\\". Although not noted for her singing, Judy's renditions perfectly suit her wonderful acting. Her songs range from funny to dramatic, and are lovingly done. I can't think of anyone I would have rather had in her role. Dean Martin, as Jeff Moss, is a fine counterpart to Judy. I would love to see this musical released on DVD...is anybody listening??? Highly Recommended.UPDATE: Available now on DVD!!!! It's GREAT!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A delightful interlude.","review":"Having just seen this film yesterday, I was again charmed by the talented Judy Holliday in what was a cute story about a woman who works for an answering service and falls in love with a voice. That voice belongs to Dean Martin who does a good job playing against Holliday's idiosyncratic character.While there are a few weak spots in the picture, the musical score and the engaging performances more than make up for it. The score is singable, if that's a word, and includes two big hits from the past, \\"Just in Time\\" and \\"The Party's Over.\\"In reading the other reviews posted here, I noticed they were all written by men, only one of whom liked the film. Is there a difference between the way men and women see a film? That would certainly seem to be the case here. I've always enjoyed this film and don't hesitate to recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Adorable movie!","review":"I've loved this movie for years! Judy Holliday and Dean Martin together.

Judy Holliday was and is a total acting, comedic and musical talent who can't help but bring a smile to the viewer's face. Dean Martin is a perfect complement as the suave romantic interest to Judy Holliday's \\"Ella, Mal or Mom\\". This is a movie for all ages and like a fine wine, it just keeps getting better."},{"rating":"2","title":"A True Classic","review":"There's a poignancy to this movie because it is Judy Holiday's last. However, we get a chance to see her longtime love in the scene where she goes out to dinner to distract herself from Dean Martin. The story, the cast and the songs are just excellent, and the direction has them all moving along at a great pace. Personally, I love 'Ella's' drive to be of help to people. It's a great theme and carried out flawlessly by the girl from the 'Bon Jour Triestesse Brassiere Company'."},{"rating":"1","title":"Broke 2 months after buying this toaster (only one side works)","review":"Don't waste your money.

One side toasts true to the setting, ie, burns toast at setting 9. The other side barely changes the color on setting 9 and in fact half of the toast remains completely white (untoasted) and cold in both compartments which tells me there must be something wrong with it. I've only had it 3 days and am incredibly disappointed. Also, I have to echo what some other customers have said. It takes so frigging long to toast anything!!!! I mean, I don't have time in the morning to stand around waiting for my toast! I now tend to put the toast in my toaster, go do something else and then come back for it.

Well, this thing is overpriced, oversized, and overweight. Most importantly, it does not toast well. I tried several different kinds of breads and settings and ended up with slow, uneven toasting (usually the top half of the bread was burned and the bottom was barely warmed, or the bread had to sit in the chamber so long that it dried out instead of toasted). I am returning it today and enjoying the Cuisinart CPT-140 I bought instead -- a $50 cheaper, more compact, and even-toasting machine. I have never written a product review before, but I really felt compelled this time. Don't waste your time or money on this toaster!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great product","review":"I love the clean lines and general over all look of this toaster.

(Probably some filaments were not working, but I was not interested in trying to diagnose the problem).A second problem is that large bread, like rye or pumpernickel won't fit. The bread is too wide (about 6\\" across, and the slots only let bread about 4 1/2\\" in)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Toaster for Bagels","review":"Our toaster oven which we had for years finally quit. So we thought we would try a toaster that wouldtoast not only slices of bread but also Bagels, which we like a lot. We bought the Kitchen Aid brandbecause we have a coffee maker of that brand which we like very much. It definatly not a chep toaster,which is O.K. and it is advertised as a toaster that cnn toast Bagels. Well if you try to get the cutside of the Bagel somewhat brown, then the back side comes out black or I should say burnt. What wehave to do is put the Bagel in at a lower setting, wait for it to pop up, take them out and turn them180 degrees to toast the other half. I think it's a terrible design. Not very happy with this productat all. We purchased the Stainless Steel one which is nice looking, too bad it's such a lousy toaster."},{"rating":"1","title":"Are Kitchenaid products really as good as they used to be?","review":"We purchased this toaster in 2006, and paid almost $100 for it. We expected it to work for a very long time. It is now August 2010, and one side has stopped working for us. We paid a repairman to tell us there was no replacement part available. I contacted Kitchenaid directly, and learned that it is cost prohibitive to repair their toasters, and they do not have replacement parts. They offered us a new toaster at a reduced price, because ours only had a one-year warranty.We had always assumed Kitchenaid products to be more costly, but also more reliable. We have NO plans to pay for another Kitchenaid toaster that cannot be repaired, or that has a short life-span."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love It!","review":"This toaster toasts perfectly, especially bagels. Although it has more of a commercial/industrial look because of its size, it's a good choice because of its performance and ease of use. I'm hoping that it continues to toast to perfection for a long time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just buy it","review":"It seems that toasters are the achilles heal of the breakfast cycle. Always waiting for them to get done, never toasting evenly, and then having it pop up and not browned to your satisfaction.Well, since buying this toaster we have 4 slices toast up just the way you want them, The bagel setting works well, and the outside of the unit does not get hot when your using it. All in all it works great.A couple of things to ponder.1. The size is big, not obtrusive, but more like a commercial unit.2. The price. Almost $100 for a toaster is painful, but if it works and you do not need to replace it for 10+ years, than it is worth it. Time will tell."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best toaster ever","review":"We are delighted with this toaster. It works perfectly and I would not hesitate to recommend it. Buy this toaster and you'll never need another."},{"rating":"1","title":"not worth the extra cash","review":"I have been researching 4 slice toasters and found the reviews to give this the tops! Well I am dissatisfied. It takes 4-6 minutes to toast, does so unevenly. Top brown bottom uncooked. Sometimes I set it on 9 and have to punch it down a second time to get browning. for soo much money, I would have hoped for a better product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Retro-appearance lets this toaster blend in with like appliances","review":"I purchased this because we replaced our stove, refrigerator, and dishwasher in December. I wanted a toaster to match. This looks very nice with all the other new appliances, and I like the bagel button. It's a very handy feature.The one drawback is that the trays pull out from the back; this means I have to turn the toaster all the way around to empty the trays. It would have been much more convenient if the trays could be pulled out from the front."},{"rating":"2","title":"KitchenAid Toaster","review":"We had lived with only a toaster oven for many years. Lots of inferior toast, but it meant one less appliance to own. Then I bought a Cuisinart toaster and it worked horribly--uneven toast was the norm.

So, we bought it and it's better, but definitely not revelatory."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dry toast that takes forever","review":"We have had this toaster for over a year now. This toaster takes way too long. I put the bread in before my egg hits the pan and the egg is done before the toast! The bread is evenly toasted but very dry.

Evenly toasts. Sturdy and fits all sizes of breads. We love it. Get one! You'll really like it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Started out strong, broke after eighteen months","review":"This toaster worked well for the first eighteen months, and then it had the same problems others have reported. The right side no longer works at all. The left knob broke off entirely. When I called KitchenAid, they let me know that because the one-year warranty had expired, my only option was to purchase a new toaster. Since I only use the toaster once or twice a week and it broke after fewer than 100 uses, I estimate that I was paying about $1 per use. Given the quality of this product and that the manufacturer didn't offer any accommodations for a known quality issue, my next toaster won't be a KitchenAid."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very well made","review":"This stainless steel toaster is stainless inside and has stainless crumb trays. It makes great toast and does bagels really well. The only thing making it four star instead of five star is that toast and bagels aren't the same color from top to bottom - not enough to affect flavor, just visual. Overall, a wonderful improvement over my old toaster. It's pretty big and takes up a fair amount of counter space. P.S. If you spray a bit of WD-40 on a napkin and wipe down the exterior of the toaster, fingerprints won't show."},{"rating":"2","title":"An effective but somewhat pricey toaster","review":"After years of frustration and expensive repairs to my Dualit (\\"used in Queen Elizabeth's royal household\\"), I decided I needed a more practical toaster. The KitchenAid 4 slice toaster WORKS. It toasts to exactly the right shade of brown and promptly pops up. The bagel/english muffin feature works like a charm, toasting the inside and lightly browning the outside. This model is somewhat more expensive than most competitors, but it is sturdy and I expect many years of use. The appearance is very industrial and boxy, but this goes with our stainless steel/commercial kitchen. We keep the KitchenAid in an appliance garage and leave the nicely polishedDualit 4-Slice Toaster, Chromeon the counter top for decor, which is about its only use."},{"rating":"2","title":"Kitchen Aid Four Slice Toaster","review":"I bought this toaster for my husband for Christmas and we're both quite happy with it.

The song is catchy, of course, because it is a pop song. Jay-z helps make it r&b. The remix with missy and da brat are, in my opinion, better than the pop version. Her upper register is impressive, but in this song it seems very unnecessary, like it was just thrown in to annoy her critics. I guess the high pitch gets on some people's nerves, while others prefer it. It sounds better in bliss, a song on her rainbow album. And, yes, it is rehashed from previous hits (Fantasy, Dreamlover). It actually sounds more similar Dreamlover. Sing the two chorus of heartbreaker and dreamlover and you'll be amazed. No, it is not at all original. But she has an audience and a market for it.

How many incarnations of the same song will Mariah have to make before you finally declare \\"enough is enough\\"?

Her best is behind her. The strongest tracks are heartbreaker and petals. Heartbreaker, because it has the srtongest groove and most memorable chorus on the album (and that doesnt say much) and Petals, for it's upfront honesty, and gentle fragility. Other than those strongpoints, the rest of the albums lyrics, production, and melodies are increbily tired and lagging.

The dust jacket sleeve mentions over 70 some photos. But Lee was only photographed around 40 times. Some photos he counts twice when in reality they are of a same pose. And some photos could have been larger so the reader could actually see the beauty of the photograph. And some photos that have been discovered many years ago were simply not even in the book.

It turned out to be a used workbook, with newsprint type pages (cheap), with a Costco price tag on the front that said $9.49. When I contacted Amazon they told me that Amazon Marketplace sales were different from Amazon sales, but I still am not sure how one distinguishes Amazon Marketplace from Amazon.

I found the writing appallingly undisciplined and amateurish, and after walking into the room and watching a couple of scenes, my wife groaned, \\"the dialogue is so terrible!\\" and she walked out.I did watch the film until the end, and I would give Chaz Palimenteri's and Linda Fiorino's performances each a solid 3 to 4 stars.Why did this film ever get made? It makes me suspicious of indie films in general, and makes me not want to go to the sundance festival, ever.But maybe the point is to give new writers a chance to grow, and maybe this writer, over time, will get better.

His resume of colloborations with the stars of the day is a mile long. This low budget compilation will give you the slightest exposure to his gifted arranging talents. The set lacks any annotation or personel listing, recording dates(I assume late fifties)etc. The poor remastering delivers a watery sound on several tracks, not even close to the quality I'm use to from Columbia or Verve among others.

I'm a Professional Land Surveyor and do a lot of old retracement surveys in our county - Carroll County, Virginia. This book has so much information in it regarding old land transactions that aid in putting together the names of 'old places or areas' that are described in so many deeds or land grants. Names listed in the book have a brief history and often help in our effort of putting the right person in the right area of ownership. It also has many names with their land grant reference listed or county deed reference if other than Carroll County, such as Grayson, Patrick or Henry County.

Anderson presents another adventure in the same mode. Few authors write scifi like this anymore. There is a sense of wonder and a sense of uplifting the human spirit to greatness that you see in Wells, Verne, Clarke, Stapledon, Baxter, Benford, etc. The characters are all well delineated such as the affected hypomanic woman pilot who acts like she is an avatar of Robert Burns. The aliens are wonderfully characterized and multifaceted. One is also left with questions which are left unanswered, contributing to the sense of expansiveness. The book gives you pause to think about the big picture. In my humble opinion, this is what scifi should be, a kind of practical philosophy. \\"Starfarers\\" succeeds at this game admirably. Do not let the archaic language put you off; it is Anderson's tongue and cheek version of future speak!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointing","review":"As a long-time reader of Poul Anderson's work, I picked this one up on faith, with expectations of similar quality. Bad choice. The book is disjointed, the plot contrived, and the horrible specimens who were the best of the few willing to venture into the unknown for such a long time belittles the human spirit."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ugh","review":"I love Poul's books and saw the nice title and cool cover art and went for it. 48 pages and three days later I decided to check the reviews. No wonder I could not read it. It is dull and the charaters are poorly developed and really no idea of whats happening. I just saved my self a week of my life not waisted. I quit. If I only had checked the reviews sooner. The last book I finished in one day, I am sure I could not have ever finished this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"dull as dirt","review":"I picked up this book because I enjoyed Anderson's _The Boat of a Million Years_, and because the plot outlined on the back of the book looked interesting. Unfortunately, the book takes a long time to develop, both in terms of plot and pace. It plods along. I almost gave up at 50 pages, but things started to be happening, so I continued skimming for anything interesting. At 100 pages, there's now something going on, but I still have to suffer through way to much description of way too many boring events. I've given up on the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Poul Anderson rocks!","review":"Once again, origional ideas presented in a brain-candy coating. Of course it probably won't be our real future, but it is fun to entertain the notion that our true heroes who sacrafice everything are forgotten, hated, and looked down upon for their ignorance. A story that keeps you thinking, impecable layout and presaentation, and unconventional theories make this book the new pinnacle of star exploration fantasy novels!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Tau Zero, NOT","review":"TERRIBLE! Where are the editors who should have told him, cut out about 200 pages. The endless pseudo-deep thought, the 1960's free love motifs, and a lot of material that did absolutely nothing to move the story forward made this volume extremely tedious. I have considered myself an Anderson fan for many years but I have to tell him to stick to shorter novels, he never has handled these epic tomes well. Don't bother with this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unfinished","review":"Black box science. Unbelievable sociology.

The book drags on and on in spots and that makes the whole experience of it less than enjoyable. If you like Anderson then you may love this book, but if this is your first Anderson novel then I'd suggest reading this one when you can't find anything else to read."},{"rating":"1","title":"SOS","review":"Another exercise in maintaining a mind numbing political correctness by the numbers - a latino, a black, an indian, a Jewish scientist, an arab, a russian and the two white european males who turn out to be an insane killer and a wimp. Why do white males of european descent write books primarily for descendants of white europeans, making the bad guys descendants of white europeans? The science fiction is, well, been there done that. This isn't one of his better works. If current sf writers would can all of the feeble attempts to be politically correct to the point of absurdity, and concentrate on the story, maybe they would have more entertaining stories.

The plot is threadbare, having been used so many times before. The rationalizations, assumptions and conclusions laughable. I saw not a single new idea or innovation on an old one here. Anderson appears to have fallen victim to the malady he predicts for mankind a few millenia early.One can read the first page and the last page and fill in the rest in a far more entertaining fashion than did the author."},{"rating":"1","title":"tortured writing, disjointed story","review":"I've read Anderson in the past and always had a problem with his crappy writing style. In this book he continuously refers to aliens as a different race rather than species, he uses inappropriate words when a different word would be a better choice, and his sentience construction is horrible.The redeeming factor is that Anderson presents some interesting ideas. Unfortunately he does so in a very clumsy manner. Even so, this is a better sci-fi book than much of what passes for sci-fi today.One of the biggest problems with this book is that it is put together from a collection of short stories published over many years and many of the asides have nothing to do with the main story, nor do they connect on their own. It is basically filler so they can fatten up the book. You could skip them and not lose a thing from the main story. The main story itself is long and boring and all of this together is why I am only giving this book two stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Knowledge of relativity may help","review":"I picked this up after reading that Anderson was a 'hard' sci-fi author. Having little understanding of science, I did not understand this book. Why do sci-fi writers write as though they are explaining ideas to get grant money? Anderson's ideas seemed cool, that we could draw near-infinite energy from a substrate universe, but still perplexing. Besides this, the story was boring, and Anderson used an irritating technique for dialogue. He'd state the character's attitude before the dialogue:\\"Angrily: Go home, Beatrice.\\" I hope Anderson's other books aren't like Starfarers as I am interested in reading Tau Zero."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing and dull","review":"Long and disjointed, I forced myself to finish this book, hoping against hope that the ending would rescue it. Not worth the effort to read and not in the league of Anderson's other work.I've never written a review, I actually felt the need to warn people about this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"This CD is a real JEWEL","review":"Erin McGrew is an extremely talented songwriter and this album shows just how diverse she is.Just listen to \\"Melinda\\", one of my personal favourites, and you'll be amazed at how original and bloody clever this is.

I've seen Diana Ross at least 10 times in concert from her performance in Central Park in 1983 to a few years ago during the tour for her last CD release. Ironically, one of her best live performances was during the ill-fated \\"Return to Love\\" Tour back in 2000.

The concert was one of Diana's performances back in the late 1970's - though the front cover depicts Diana Ross as she looked in the 1990's. Also, the picture quality of this DVD was very poor, which was a shame, being the concert seemed to be one of her best, at the height of her solo career. I also ordered another Diana Ross DVD: \\"Diana Ross In Concert\\", it having a \\"different\\" front cover, depicting when Ms. Ross was much younger, though this DVD ended up being the exact same concert as the other one, with same poor picture quality. Felt I got \\"duped\\" with these purchases, and have learned from this experience not to purchase items that aren't more explicit in their \\"descriptions\\" of merchandise."},{"rating":"2","title":"Diana Ross Live From Las Vegas","review":"This was Diana Ross on 'top of her game' in 1979, this is the reason I gave it 5 stars. However, the newly packaged cover had me fooled though because I thought it was a different concert from Las Vegas, a more recent one from looking at the picture. I should have read the Songlist before ordering and then I would have known that I already bought this concert about a decade ago. There is also another one I purchased that has a different cover, again not of her as she looked in 1979 and it just said \\"Diana Ross Live In Concert\\". When it arrived along with this one, they were both the same 1979 concert. So now I own 3 copies of the same concert.

The Krinner stands are great in concept--they use a cable mechanism to tighten a \\"claw\\" that holds the tree. It is much nicer than the cheaper, \\"bolt type\\" stands; however, locking mechanisms and the release are a bit confusing. The major problem is when I went to use the stand in 2007 the pedal mechanism would not tighten the cable. Either something was jammed or the cable had come loose--unfortunately there's no way to take the thing apart to find out. The build quality of the tightening mechanism is poor (note: my stand was marked \\"Made in China\\").

When you have a hole in the middle of a piece of lightweight plastic where the wire cording goes through, it doesn't take much tension over time to make them break. Another plastic prong broke after the tree was in so had to run out and get a different stand. Not worth the money it costs for this one!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Works great! Breaks Fast!","review":"I used this for four Christmases and must say it was true love. It made putting up the tree so much easier than the screw type stands. This year I pulled it out and noticed that the pedal would not tighten the cable. Looking at the metal mechanism I noticed that it was completely worn and would not be able to work. I can't believe that the metal work inside is so flimsy that it wore out after using only four times. Yes, this works great and makes putting up the tree so easy. However, I can guarantee you that most of the positive reviews are from people who used it for the first time and were so happy at how much easier it is to put up a tree.

Now, I don't have a problem with anyone wanting to tackle someone else's culture, but I found the author's continual use of Spanish and worse, her translation of Spanish idioms into English unendurable. I think it doesn't really matter if you speak Spanish or not, either, since I lived in Spain and speak Spanish (though of course some of the Mexican words were unfamiliar to me) The \\"Do you have long nails, daughter?\\" phrase finally made me slam the book shut! Someone should have told both the author and the editor that using a foreign language in a narrative is like putting salt in a dish--a little goes a long, long way."},{"rating":"2","title":"I'm grateful for this book","review":"I love this book because it makes me see the world through the eyes of someone who can't take food on the table and a roof over her head for granted.

For her to be able to remain grateful for her life both humbles me and touches me deeply."},{"rating":"2","title":"Authentic Mexican Woman","review":"The Magda of Donna Gershten's Kissing the Virgin's Mouth is someone who has known the harsh beauty and cruel truth of life for women in Mexico, and I believe that Gershten must have done so also. Her characters are vivid and real. The blood that Magda's mother and her tia Chucha offer the baby Jesus blends with the blood of thousands who have gone before her. The language that Gershten uses to describe their offering is authentic, lyrical, and compelling. I trust it, and trust that the author knows Mexican women. A BEAUTIFUL tale, with heart and poetry and a cadence I only hear when I am in Mexico."},{"rating":"2","title":"words that only Gershten can string like musical notes.....","review":"The book is beautiful from page one. The non-spanish speaking reader may have difficulty with the many Spanish phrases throughout the book. The story is as true to life as if you were living in Mexico today. To this day women are as they are in Gershten's book. A society full of wishing and magic, Mexican women see the world from a window no American home will ever have. The strength of these women is as of warriors, though untrained, they don't give up. I wish the pages would have continued forever."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing....","review":"I was originally intrigued by the back cover comments of this book and the fact that it one the Bellweather Prize. However, I found it hard to follow and the author's view of a foreign culture to be disturbing in that she puts herself forward as a native expert, which she is not and could never be since being that she is North American and not Mexican; people who live abroad (like the author) often think they have a stronger grasp on a foreign culture and/or language than they really do.... I would be interested in a native-Mexican Spanish speaker's opinion of the book's use of Spanish.The beginning is quite detailed but the latter part of the novel skips over various events quickly and therefore seems more disjointed. Second, the white, North American author's narration in the voice of a Mexican woman makes me uncomfortable and I felt like I could not trust her view of Mexico.

I expected from the title, to find a book full of martial wisdom, but although there were a few interesting things found throughout this book, overall it contained very little useful wisdom for anyone who has done any studying at all in martial wisdom or worldly wisdom. The wisdom I did find in this book was very generic and can be found in almost any book on martial arts wisdom or philosophy.The beginning martial artist may find some use in reading this book, but if you have been in the martial arts for a while or have read some of the other books on martial arts wisdom and philosophy, I would recommend passing on Dojo Wisdom.

I teach at an alternative school for at-risk teens, and if it works with my kids, it'll work with nearly any kid. The exercises were designed with at-risk teens in mind and incorporates realities and interests from their lives.My only caveat for this book is that some of the writing examples may or may not be appropriate for your own students.

It is presented in a way that suggests that black and Hispanic kids are the only ones who need this program, and that all black and Hispanic kids live in slums. Most of the writing examples are about inner city violence, drugs, and despair. The bias begs several questions: what about black and Hispanic kids who live normal lives in suburbia? What about white kids who live in slums? What about kids of all genetics living in all sorts of conditions?

Needless to say he does and while Matt and \\"Mary\\" heat things up (much to Karen Page's dismay), Daredevil and Typhoid duke it out.

I had to get it because at the time I was getting ready to see the band live at Ground Zero in Minneapolis. All the Project Pitchfork albums that I had listened to (and at one point owned), Daimonion is my personal favorite. The songs are definitely slower than on the other albums that I had heard. Asides \\"Timekiller\\", I really enjoy listening to the songs \\"Jupiter\\" (a beautiful ballad) and \\"We Are One\\". The melodies stands out more with me and the lyrics resonates with me more so than other Project Pitchfork albums. I think the album certainly could have been edited better.

Eventually I realized that it wasn't making a clear distinction between the editorial content and commerce (items offered by companies advertizing in the magazine, workshops sponsored by the magazine, books sold by the publisher of the magazine). Eventually I figured out that the publisher was Australian.

I love this topic, but after 100 pages I found it all too easy to put this book down. Two things made it less than stellar reading: (1) There is probably too much disjointed trivia (I say \\"probably\\" because some readers may want every word of it). The writing simply didn't flow for me. (2) Roberts should be taken to the woodshed for his pretentious vocabulary, such as using \\"punition\\" when \\"punishment\\" would be the appropriate word. This happens on every page. He reminds me of a very insecure professor I had who would say such things as \\"the largesse of the Greek theater,\\" when he meant the \\"largeness.\\" The goal of every writer should be to communicate, not to exhibit psuedo-erudition.

The material concerning Kit Carson could be written in an afternoon on a word processor by any knowledgeable western historian. The Preuss diaries were published in 1958. Of course the absence of citations in a book like this is especially annoying when the author makes such accusations as Fremont having two mistresses.

Characters are two- and one-dimensional, the plot is less exciting than the opening credits from the television show, and the prose itself would not be deemed publishable anywhere else.There are a lot of good media tie-in novels out there.

But putting it simply, this is a complete and utter failure musically as compared with past albums. And yes, the catchy songs with great melodies are completely gone. The Autumn Defense was right on the verge of a musical breakthrough and they totally blew it--so frustrating and disappointing. This album is heavily influenced by jazz inflections in just about every song--especially the piano and guitar work. This direction does not serve The Autumn Defense well at all-- being that there is not one distinct melody to be found anywhere. I was absolutely shocked when I first listened to this cd because it really doesn't sound like the music that came before it in any way. And on the edge of greatness they have thrown themselves into the dark void of the abyss in creating this abomination. Most likely The Autumn Defense will never recover from this gigantic error in musical judgement."},{"rating":"1","title":"Please stick with Wilco only!!","review":"First off do not purchase this album if you think it will have any sort of an Alt-Country influence. I love all types of music and thought I would give this album a try sense it got so many good reviews. Wilco is one of my favorite bands and I figured the base player from such a great band would have carried over some of his musical influences. I found the music to be very blah and the lyrics uninspired.

The book is poorly written in a disjointed manner. He tries to integrate tales of his own family with the story of the Collyers but fails to weave them together in a cohesive, understandable manner. It is rare that I don't finish reading a book, but this one went straight to the archive after I got about a quarter of the way into it."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is not a biography or an intense study of the Collyer brothers","review":"The book jacket is hauntingly beautiful. But the insides are disappointing. Rather than place the focus on the Collyer brothers (known for not coming out of their brownstone forever...like in that Peter Sellers movie, \\"Being There,\\" now that I come to think of it...) he uses them to tell a story of his life.

There is almost a whole chapter about the author going to a flea circus. ??? What does that have to do with the Collyers?I was hoping to get a little insight into why people live this lifestyle, but Lidz doesn't really touch on any of that. We learn nothing about the psychology of the Collyers, and in fact, Lidz tells the story about them from the perspective of a reporter, police and other outsiders.

I don't really care about the author's strange Uncles and his family. That should have been a separate book that maybe his children would be interested in....not the general public.

Conservatively, 60% of the book is simply New York history. The story is not cohesive, and when not relaying New York history the author only devotes about 20% of the book to the \\"Ghosty Men\\" while the other 20% is devoted to the rest of his rather eccentric family. It's almost like it's been written in peices. Some paragraphs are very entertaining but they seem to be stuck in the middle of a history lesson on the city.Very choppy, not on topic. Wouldn't recommend to anyone unless you're intersted in an abbreviated history of Harlem & old New York city."},{"rating":"1","title":"Invest Elsewhere","review":"I'm not a fan of fiction, but interest in the Collyer's story led me to read My Brother's Keeper, Marcia Davenport's account based on the lives of Homer and Langley. Beautifully written, this book stayed with me for years until I tracked it down and added it to my personal library. Therefore, when I learned that Lidz had written a non-fiction account, I was eager to add it to my collection. I had to order it sight unseen, (entirely my fault) yet I looked forward with great anticipation to reading it. As I dove in, I was deeply disappointed with the way the story unfolded. (Not to mention the overall size and length of the book)Lidz barely scratched the surface of the complexity of their lives. I understand the personal parallels that led Lidz to intertwine his uncles' story with the Collyers', but frankly, if I wanted to read about his uncles, I would have purchased his other book. As a result, you get half the book (in length and story quality) for twice the price. ...."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful, Fascinating,","review":"Two stories of two different brothers in two different time eras ~ I fell in love with all of them.

Her father is Catholic and brings to his daughter a sense of mystery and the ability to enjoy life to its fullest. Her mother was brought up Methodist/Southern Baptist, and brings with her a sense of moral order and righteousness. As a girl growing up, Molly struggles with these two divergent points of view, both in her parents and in her very strong and influential grandmothers. At the same time, she struggles with all the challenges of adolescence that we all struggle with. Skinner's writing is multi-layered as she challenges the reader to move with Molly through the challenges of coming into herself.Unfortunately, the plot is almost secondary to the psychological and spiritual aspects of the book. This leaves long passages where nothing much happens, so the story tends to drag. But these shortcomings are largely overcome by the great writing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Only if you want to rip your hair out","review":"It does not take a 200 page book to help you plan a wedding.

It was 90% liquid after the full baking time and it never set afterwards. Next I made the cranberry orange tart. I felt suspicious about the large amount of orange peel to put in the cranberry filling mixture, so I halved it and went to make the tart.

First, I'm getting pretty tired of him re-doing old songs. At least with last album's Private Eyes, it had completely different music. However, with this one Jamaican Funk is a straight copy. It's a song that I never liked in the first place anyway. The other songs on this CD are mediocre at best except \\"Butterfly\\". Which is one of two songs I can even stand to listen to. He even messes with Butterfly's beautiful melodies by putting in a terrible bass line which sounds as if it should be in a drum and bass CD. What happened to Mr.Tei's unique ways with \\"Future Listening\\" and even with \\"Sound Museum\\"? They have appeared to be gone with this effort. Track #6 is a pathetic instrumental full of SILLY noises from what sounds like garbage cans. This my friend is not fun or any sort of a delight to listen to.

There are better headphones out there if you desire some amazing bass; but make no mistake - you'll pay for it. Cost wise, these are pretty sweet! No top-of-head padding is my biggest complaint with these phones. Also, it may just be my stereo receiver (expensive Pioneer 7.1), but when I plug THESE headphones into it, they emit a faint (but noticeable) hissing sound.

The ear cups swivel up and down and side to side, so you can align them perfectly without any discomfort. The cups are nicely padded, and I have been able to wear these for upwards of 3 hours without any discomfort. Also, the headphones come with a 3 meter cable (about 10 ft.)

No not just regular gods super gods who 999 represent because 999 is 666 upside down?OK now you understand???Then in every book he has to get into his theorys of life and reproduction as being evil blah blah please stick to the topic. I do not buy history to be force feed religion for no reason. I respect this man in one aspect he seems to be great with mathmatics. But on the other hand he's one of those people who if you divid this by 4 x 360 +2x the sacered Phi +15 you come to the number of the super god?

This is NOT the first book about Indian mythology to read, and perhaps not even the second or third book - you will be utterly confused unless you already have a very good foundation in Indian mythology AND some knowledge of Indian sacred writings.

I know his voice anywhere, and it sounded terrific. She can go a long way if she continue singing her songs in Spanish, even if she mixes a little bi-lingual It would be even better.

The fine animation from Madhouse (Hellsing, serial experiments lain) again proves that they have a lot of style. The problem, however, is that the casual viewer (as well as the die-hard anime fan) will have some trouble getting through this first disc. Perhaps in the next DVD releases, one will learn what's going on but the first four episodes feel like two episodes worth of material stretched out to improbable lengths. The show drags and wanders and never quite gets to the point.Did I enjoy the show? Not really. I bought the disc based on rave reviews and probably should have found a way to rent it first. The concepts are dull and the pace is spotty and it never quite lives up to its potential. Perhaps it gets better in subsequent episodes but I don't care, I'm not picking them up."},{"rating":"1","title":"Undependable","review":"I have to comment on this book because it's not reliable anymore.I enjoyed the array of hikes that the editors chose, but it looks like they just translated some out of date Japanese books. Some of the trails in this book have been long closed and you will find yourself confused at night in the mountains if you attempt them. For example, the suggested descent from Aka-dake hasn't been maintained since an earthquake at least five years ago.On the other hand, the book covers a fantastic variety of paths and makes it easy to find what you want. If you want to try a hike in this book, make certain you get current info on the state of the path as well as lodging along the way. This means call yourself, and ask specific questions.But really, you're better off just getting a good Japanese book."},{"rating":"1","title":"You'd Think They Would Try to Update a New Edition","review":"I was looking forward to the updated edition for some time but when I picked it up today I was very disappointed to see that very little was changed from the last edition. Most troubling was that information which was long out of date was still included in the guide. For example, the Kumotori hike which is described in the Tokyo section recommends taking a cable car up to the starting point for the hike. Unfortunately, the cable car stopped running several years ago and so anyone following this guide book will have a much longer hike on their hands than the one they may have planned (an extra 800 meters of climbing to get where the actual hike in the guide book begins). It is a useful book for those new to Japan but I am very disappointed that LP did not make the effort to make sure the information in this new edition was still accurate."},{"rating":"1","title":"cancer","review":"Written to sell his stuff.

While understanding the GoF Design Patterns is useful, this book goes into sufficient detail to explain them (and online searches for the DP's is easy enough). The book expands into naming the various refactoring so as to have a shared language describing (naming) those refactoring methodologies. Overall I have been pleased with the level of detail and content."},{"rating":"1","title":"Really important topic, disappointing treatment of it","review":"There seems to be a common misconception that Refactoring and Patterns are disconnected things. I had high hopes that this would be the book that cleared this misconception and tied them together.But I found the examples to be contrived, and often not deserving of the patterns that were applied. The step-by-step examples were hard to follow as they constantly gave tiny snippets of code that were missing proper context.As important as I think this topic and message is, I can't imagine this book convincing anyone who wasn't already convinced. At best, this might make a passable supplement to someone learning patterns for the first time from another source.On the bright side, some of the stories in the early chapters were entertaining, but not enough to recommend this derivative work."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dumb readers like me need complete before/after source, not snippet","review":"A number of times I thought I understand the refactoring after I read the summary at the beginning of each section, as well as the benefit and liabilities.However, I got myself into trouble when I started reading the source codes.

When I was studying on Martin Fowler's Refactoring to make my code more comprehensive and improve its clarification, I see, Martin Fowler's techiques are generalized techniques, I found Joshua Kerievsky's techiques in Refactoring to Patterns are more specific techiques concern of purely Design Patterns. While Design Patterns itself high-level abstracted, it is easy to find concrete examples in Recfactoring to Patterns and that makes programmer easy to understand Design Patterns. Special thanks to Joshua Kerievsky and to his study group for a this kind of work."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Must Read for All Programmers","review":"Kerievsky has written a very useful book and I recommend that all programmers read it. The unification of the two worlds of \\"patterns\\" and \\"refactoring\\" makes perfect sense, and I find this book an excellent companion to the GOF Design Patterns book. While the original Design Patterns is a classic, it's presentation of finished patterns made it difficult for programmers to relate these abstract concepts to their own everyday experience. Kerievsky addresses precisely that problem, and my only criticism would be that the source code associated with each refactoring is not available online. Hoewever, even in the absence of digital copies of the source code the book is extremely useful, especially for the legions of programmers who must maintain legacy code from earlier systems. An issue that every programmer faces on a daily basis to a greater or lesser degree."},{"rating":"1","title":"A must-have book for software developers, but...","review":"This is a very good reference/utility book for any software designer, developer, maintainer... Unlike the traditional design pattern books, which talk about how to apply various design patterns under various situations, this book focus more on how to find badly designed and implemented code and apply simple yet effective patterns to make the existing code better. The author starts with listing some common problems in the existing code, such as conditonal complexity, long method, etc. He goes on by suggesting some possible solutions to the problems, such as using a strategy pattern to reduce conditional complexity, etc. He uses some very good examples and shows the detail steps involving in the refactoring process.This book deserves \\"*****\\" if the complete source code before and after refactoring is available. Without the complete source code, it takes much more time and effort in trying to understand what is involved in the refactoring process."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good book, very readable, needs fuller source examples","review":"I found this book to be very readable. It combines refactoing and patterns. The refactoring shows how to improve existing code in order to improve maintenance and start on the road to patterns. I find the ideas can be used in practice and a group of us are using the book to see how we can improve the code base. The book makes extensive use of ideas from the Martin Fowler book, so it may have helped if I had read that book first. The examples tend to be small subsections of java code and you see how to change by applying a series of refactorings.

I find this book to be a great extension to Fowlers basic priciples. It requires you to have some knowledge about basic refactoring terminology and techniques, and you should also have at least skimmed through the Gang of Four patterns book. Where this book has it's force is in helping you to identify when to do what types of refactoring and when NOT to do certain refactorings. It has a nice list of smells and their appropriate refactoringsI would recommend this as a reference book to all programmers that appreciate the value a well applied pattern has."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice hat but.........","review":"I\`ve had nothing but great comments from my friends since I received the hat.

Anyway, as I don't want to run the risk of eating food that has been cooked over lead and barium (not that I know for a fact that this barbecue has either of those in), I had to buy a Weber which appears to be the only American-made barbecue available, despite the abundance of barbecues called \\"American this\\" and Texan that\\".

I can't find a stamped serial number anywhere on the thing. I then went and put everything together and when I pulled out the cooking grates, they were ALL broken. Some in pieces and some just broken at joints, barely holding together. I don't know what they did to this thing, but it looks like Amazon opened the box and smashed up individual pieces.

The charging mechanism does not stay in the phone (most of the time you have to set it at an angle and oh-so-gently put the phone down). And it continues to break in the same fashion (first, shutting off at random times; then unable to turn on). I only got the Motorola because my old StarTac lasted for years.

I was told the problems with the Motorola phones had been resolved. Needless to say, this was well..bu...innacurate, shall I say?I will never ever buy a Motorola phone again. The present one I have, a second replacement and only 2 months old, is again exhibiting this problem. And to make it worse, because it constantly fluctuates in the car between being connected and not, not only does it make it hard to speak, but it sometimes \\"freezes\\" the phone and disconnects the caller.I can't wait to start looking into what Nokia has to offer."},{"rating":"1","title":"This phone sucks","review":"No need to write a long, drawn out review.

The first one I bought quit working after about 3 months. The ear-piece quit putting sound out and the only way I could talk to someone was with the speakerphone. Then, I got a new phone, and it worked pretty well for about 4 months, but now, it will randomly power off, it will hold a charge for a good 12 hours (without using it), and barely charges when I plug it in. Apart from that, sometimes it won't send text messages, and it's not the service. The screen is so small that it's hard to see things. The camera takes decent pictures, but nothing to write home about, and unless you send it to your computer you can barely tell what it is because of the small screen.

I went to the Verizon store, and they acted like they knew this was an issue with the phone, that they had been receiving many complaints.

What a mistake. The V265 is the worst phone I have owned. The buttons are very small. The clip that ships with the phone does not hold it. I lost my phone several times before buying a leather holster, which still does not prevent the phone opening when you don't want it to. I receive lots of voice mails now, because practically no one can reach me directly. Battery life is about the same as on the old LG. Overall I traded my LG, which sometimes dropped calls, for the V265 which hardly ever completes them in the first place. I am seriously considering reactivating my old LG. I have not been able to transfer pictures from my V265 to my wife's V265. Verizon customer service told me \\"huh, it should have worked!\\".

Screen is a little small (only comparted to the next gens that are out there now) but its not like you have to squint or anything to see. The camera is not that great, but anything VGA really isnt worth even taking pictures.If you're sigining up for verizon, and dont really care about what phone you have as long as you can call people then definitly get this, dont worry about sprining the extra cash for the v710 or e815. But if you're looking for something more stlyish, or with more advanced featuers or a better camera, go for those."},{"rating":"2","title":"nice display and good reception good carrier","review":"this phone has all features that much more expensive phone has.. right now verizon is offerin this phone for a low price of 49 after rebate.. its perfectly worth it.. the phone has impressive display with atleast 6 color options the blue key light is nice especially in the dark it stands out perfectly clear.. the speaker phone is very good, its clear and easy to hear.. i have had this phone for two weeks and i only charge for about 1/2 to hour at night b4 i go to bed and its on 3 battery bars the whole day.. the only poor qualities i can think of are the camera phone, but if u think about it u are buyin a phone not a camera its only an accessory the other thing the shinny black face plate is easy to scartch smudge with finger prints.. also the name dial feature is totaly usless unless u us standard names like william andrew gary etc.."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great carrier, Great phone!","review":"First off, Verizon Wireless has superior coverage and a great network.

It has these random glitches where I won't receive incoming calls, it just sends them to voicemail (no, it is not the service) and it has erased items that it was never told to.

He lived in the fourth century, AD, and writes of the Christian Church in Jerusalem, Antioch, Alexandria, and Rome. He gives extensive and sometimes bloody details about lions, disemboweling, crucifixion, the gruesome deaths of decadent Roman emperors, a basketful of heretics, some courageous virgins, and so on, ending with Constantine. Paul Maier, the editor, has included some good photographs, helpful historical summaries at the end of each chapter, and a list of popes and emperors. Some of this will be familiar to anyone interested in Christian history, but the details will not be familiar. Recommended reading for any curious reader with a taste for history, and for all those involved in Christian education.Early Christianity was not for the faint-hearted."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic Read","review":"I had never read Eusebius until I bought this book, so this was all new territory for me. I thoroughly enjoyed the translation and it was easy to read, and I found the footnotes and end of chapter summaries to be interesting, well written, and informative. I did find one spelling mistake in an end of chapter summary(contrasting spelled \\"contrsting\\"), but that really wasn't a big deal.I would recommend this to anyone who is interested in the early church. It has a lot to say about early church activity, and I personally found the chapters on the persecutions were what made reading this book really worth it."},{"rating":"2","title":"church history","review":"I read this book and I found it to be very useful in doing research on the record of Eusebius. I read some unfactual based reports of the Faith. The chapter on Book One has some statements that are in question as in regards to what the early Disciples taught.All in All it is a good book to read for any student."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too much edited out","review":"After discovering an older translation of this book at our library i decided i needed one for my own.

Paul Maier translates Eusebius' works into very understandable English with unobtrusive, yet insightful, comments. The book is well organized. You can read by section or by book pretty easily. The book itself is quite marvelous. Eusebius gives us a history of what happened in the church after the writing of the New Testament up to the conferences of his day.It is from Eusebius that we gain a lot of understanding of Christian thought from that time. Eusebius did have a few factual errors in his works, but that's OK given that they did not have a library system like we have or the internet..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Characters undeveloped / Weirdly PC","review":"I absolutely agree that there were too many characters in this book. The 6 factions fighting over Romulus were waaay too many, considering that we spend the majority of our time from the perspective of the Titan crew, we really learn very very little about the Romulans, which ultimately makes the intrigue a little boring.One reason there are so many characters is because Titan is supposed to be the \\"most diverse\\" crew yet. One of the things I like about Star Trek is that this is usually taken for granted. Here it it's not. In this book, we see Deanna harping Will about being more tolerant, and the crew reacting badly to one particularly different member. It's always in the context of the crew quickly getting over it, but I just found it painful.The characters weren't developed enough or real enough to pull off this kind of interspecies conflict on the ship."},{"rating":"1","title":"$7.99 for an electronic version of a book you can get used for $0.01?","review":"I've read this in paperback and the story is quite good. This review, however, is in regards to an e-book price that is out-of-step with modernity. Seems to me Pocket Books is missing an opportunity here. The Star Trek back catalog prices ought to be $2.99 for out-of-print titles IMHO. That's what would get me to buy. $7.99 is a ridiculous price, considering that the paper book is no longer in print, I can buy a used copy for $0.01, and the ebook doesn't have X-Ray enabled."},{"rating":"2","title":"Riker finally gets his due!","review":"This has been a long time coming. A great book, a great lead character that the author captures beautifully. A great read. Twice already, first time in two sittings. Fantastic story, okay lead in to the next book.

Could be a whole new Star Trek TV series."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good, not great.","review":"This is a well-written story, well above average for the Star Trek genre, but is far from the most gripping Star Trek story I've ever read. Solid, worthwhile read but nothing special. I do give it credit for managing the cliffhanger ending in a better-than usual, acceptable way: the main plot for this book was over, properly providing a conclusion, and the cliffhanger ending is essentially a result of an epilogue that gives us a preview of the next story."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Exciting \\"Pilot\\"","review":"\\"Taking Wing,\\" the first in a new series of novels, chronicles the exploits of Captain Riker and his diverse crew as Starfleet returns to its old mandate of exploration. The plot of the story isn't overly complicated and the end resolution is a little out of left field. However, fast pacing and plot progression make \\"Taking Wing\\" quite the page turner. There is a plethora of new characters to discover which adds to the book's appeal, especially if you're fond of origin stories.One gripe I had with the novel was a tendency to overemphasize the diverse number of species that make-up the Titan's crew. While having such a prodigious number of aliens could be interesting, the authors put too fine a point on the subject. And the phrase, \\"Celebrate our differences,\\" is a sure way to induce eye-rolling. Nevertheless, the story is brimming with political intrigue and tense action. Highly recommended for all Next Generation fans."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just not fun to read - confusing characters","review":"I really wanted to like this series. I bought the first three. the characterization is what kills it. I know the author is trying to take advantage of the diversity of species in populating the starship with an amalgam of species that we've never heard of. However, there comes a point where the reader needs to relate to the characters. I cant relate to a sentient arachnid, or a doctor who looks like a walking dinosaur, or an intelligent bovine creature. If this was it, i could deal with it - but there are at least ten non-humanoid characters one must keep track of at a time. Visualizing each as the plot grinds along gives me a headache!

I purchased the first three books of this series, looking forward to reading all three.The writing style of \\"Taking Wing\\" is not one that I would start a book series with. I found it incredibly hard to get through, not at all like the usual ST book. Things like: \\"the question took him off guard, forcing him to grope blindly for an answer\\" describing normal conversation between Riker and his wife Deanna. In hindsight, I have to question how this passed the editor's muster.The plot isn't terrible, and the book is somewhat entertaining, but if I were a new ST reader, I would go for one of the other series of books, like the Vanguard series lead-off, by David Mack called Harbringer.This book is okay, I would have preferred a different writing style, without the sickly syrup writing...."},{"rating":"1","title":"Political correctness shoved down throat","review":"I love Star Trek!

If you have a hard time talking to something that looks like a nightmare out of your worst dreams then you must have missed a class in the Starfleet Academy!

This kind of one-sided 'women-good, men-bad' thinking makes it impossible for a man abused by his wife/girlfriend to be taken seriously.

First, the author like to use a lot of you-may-see-it-once-in-your-life words in his description, some words aren't even in the dictionary. I used online Webster dictionary, not a elementary school student dictionary. As an example, can anybody tell me what \\"co-optation\\" means in English?

Any practitioners of Asian martial arts who were offended by this book have either not read it thoroughly or have never been in a real fight. I've done both. I've also studied Karate, but I've never used a technique as effective as the ones taught here. These are the techniques of the old time fighters, when boxing was a bloodsport, and they work! Furthermore, Beaumont does not negate the use of martial arts. Instead, he suggests the reader combine boxing with any fighting arts he/she may already have learned. I cannot recommend this book too highly."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Complete Boxing/Streetfighting Manual","review":"Perhaps the most complete and well written treatise of its kind. Beaumont demonstrates in a clear and concise manner exactly why fist fighting is a very effective martial art. \\"Lessons from the Champs\\" are employed by the author to clearly illustrate the skills taught in 'Championship Streetfighting' as used by some of the greatest fighters of all time. You would be hard pressed to find a more effective exposition of a truly hard hitting and practical method of self-defense."},{"rating":"2","title":"Most practical book on self-defense I've ever read","review":"Beaumont advocated boxing as the most (but not only) effective form of self-defense (though he preferred the term controlled aggression instead) and rightly so. Though he mounted heavy criticisms on the self-defense value of other martial arts, he did not dismiss them all as useless. Instead, he proposed to supplement them with practical boxing skills to make them more effective. The book covers both the physical and technical aspects of boxing pretty well in a very personal and informal way. It also draws inspiring lessons from the greastest boxers of all times. Insufficient comprehensive illustrations maybe the only possible flaw of this fine piece of work."},{"rating":"2","title":"You need Practice..A Grapplers advice","review":"From a Grapplers stand point this is cream knowledge for a guy that does know how to strike.

I'm really not a fan of eastern martial arts (being that I practiced Karate for years) Beumount seems to share my sentament. The book gives a good history lesson, and \\"Lessons from the Champ\\" that explain the reason why Beumount endorses his plan of action. Fom experience Beumount gave better advice in one book on Boxing than 4 years of American Karate blending with \\"Boxing Concepts\\" gave to me...If your a Grappler or a Martial Artist Buy this book and Practice these techs..If your a boxer you probally aready know about this...but It's still a good read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Add Boxing to your Martial Art.

Principles of Boxing are well explained (Something that is hard to come by). Good Training routines are suggested. Very good section on combinations.

While I found his discussion of boxing techniques thorough and helpful, I was put off by the tone of this book and some of his derogatory terms (he actually uses the word \\"pansy\\" at one point). One of the first things a student of any martial art learns (or should learn) is not to underestimate his or her opponent -- by negating the effectiveness of kicks, etc. in fighting, as well as by generalizing about the qualifications of martial arts instructors, I think this author does a disservice to his readers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Author is disingenuous....","review":"This author, in this book, extolls the wonders of boxing, claiming it is the ultimate martial art.

His constant bashing of 'strip mall karatekas' and harping about 'real combat' and 'bone-crushing blows' should have been a little more aggressively edited. His point is sound, but gets tiring after the first chapter and doesn't quit until the last page. As an ex-bouncer and bartender, I have encountered plenty of tough guys, fights, ambushes, and general mayhem, and the authors words have the ring of authenticity to them.

My only complaint--and a minor one at that--is that there is some breaking in required, the top portion of the shoe tends to rub the top of your foot.

There are no parts that fall off, but the one issue I did have with it is that the feet don't stay flat in robot mode. The springs tend to snap shut, and that makes him a little bit difficult to pose in robot mode. Altogether, I'd say he is one of the better toys from the Transformers Movie line.

But that's all... the diagrams, presumably drawn by the author, are quite frankly terrible. It is possible for an experienced origamist to successfully create the models from these diagrams and instructions, but they are as much hindrance as help. I have so far finished the witch/wizard and Shiva models and am working on the long-tailed dragon and Cerberus models, but in every model I have done so far I have found multiple mistakes in the diagrams and instructions. If you like these models, I would suggest you seek the diagrams elsewhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"Grab Bag","review":"As its title indicates, the value of Jay Ansill's \\"Origami Sourcebook\\" is not its originality, but the diagrams of models not easily available elsewhere.

One or two exposures is simply not enough to assimilate what he is trying to do.Second, Van changes elements of his music from CD to CD. He evolves musically and as a person. The challenge for the listener is to get to where he is at rather than stay stuck in what he did in the past - be that two years or twenty years.Third, even with the changes (evolution/maturation of the artist) the same fundamental styles of Van Morrison music are always there. And he said it best: jazz, blues, funk, and a little bit of folk.So other than the criticism of his harping about the music industry (justified, but the songs are still great) What's Wrong With This Picture is Van's submission of where he's at musically, done is his own inimitable style. May it always be such.Who could ask for more?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Van Morrison \\"What's Wrong With This Picture\\" used CD","review":"I loved but lost this CD, and it's about $50.00 to replace new.

The media intrusion into celebrities personal lives IS truly appalling and reprehensible. So if you must... rail on Van...especially if done in with the musical verve on this cd.I'd especially like it if he'd do his blues/jazz stuff,say, on a label such as Blue Note.... and record his other folk/pop/soul/r&b stuff on Polygram.His 'Down the Road'could have been A+ classic Van but ended up only very good because of the 'by the numbers rote blues tunes in the middle of the cd...(unlike most of these blues cuts)."},{"rating":"2","title":"What's Wrong With This Picture?

That aside, it's another soulful,jazzy (in the good sense) workout for The Man and his always excellent sidemen. Sure he's still grumpy about fame (or lack of it or whatever), but the grumpiness is all in the lyrics, and I suggest you ignore what he's singing about and just enjoy the singing.There's not a stinker in the bunch and Van fans will treasure it.

Three decent tracks, Once in a blue moon, St. James Infirmary, and the title track. Otherwise the CD is barren, and far from Van's best.Complaining about fame seems a bit odd to me-it's not like he's a superstar-the equivalant of Don Adams or Barbara Feldon bitching ...I have liked most of his albums-Into the Music or Astral Weeks can be argued to be some of the strongest efforts in the history of pop. I like almost all his 80s albums and therefore he is probably only the only 60s star who continued to put out outstanding efforts decades later. Yet since the early 90s his efforts have all been subpar. He seems to have abandoned the celtic background his music has had since the late 70s and he has not found anything adequate to replace it."},{"rating":"1","title":"I love Van... but","review":"I have every Van CD.

The real let down though, is the design or lack of design between the smaller sections and larger section. My previous bag had elastic along between the sections on the sides that kept the smaller section in place, the lack of this on this bag allows the top 1/2 of the section to flop down and fold over even with the straps clipped.

But the Targus fit the bill. The heaviest thing about the bag is the actual computer you put in it. There is plenty of room for all the equipment and supplies needed to a meeting and it travels wonderfully. The only problem I have is getting the rolling handle out - arthritis in my fingers sometimes makes it a challege. Nothing Targus can do about that issue."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Large Student Backpack","review":"This is the largest backpack I have ever used. It has room for everything.

The 17\\" XL Notebook Backpack was however WAY to BIG for normal airport traveling. Looked like I could backpack in the moutains for a week. Definately would have to be checked luggage at the airport. My laptop is an 15.6\\" Gateway which is typically too big for the average 15.4\\" laptop bags. The smaller version of this 17\\" XL bag the \\"Chicago Citypack\\", fit my laptop perfect with room to use my neoprene laptop sleeve.

It is very similar in design, but it is about 1/2\\" narrower, making it a really tight fit for my gear. Also the internal pockets of the Foray were more 'hidden' helping me to secure my passport and some cash from someone who might open the zippers looking for stuff to steal. The internal pockets in this are quite obvious, and not quite as large. The design is good, but not as good as the Foray. Unfortunately, I cannot get a replacement from Foray, so I am adjusting to this option."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed in TARGUS","review":"I had a previous rolling case that I really liked. I bought the TARGUS rolling case based on their reputation. I am very disappointed due to the covering tearing after 30 days of use. I work in Washington DC and use the Metro so the case is rolling both on sidewalks and in the Metro. The bottom of the case is torn and is becoming unusable due to the tears. My last case which I admit was leather, lasted 7 years and only after the zipper failed did I get the TARGUS. I guess I made a bad mistake. I would not recommend this case and I am now suspect on any TARGUS product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Exactly what I was looking for","review":"This backpack was exactly what I was looking for.

I am very glad that Amazon had it so I took a risk and purchase it because it said it only supported up to a 17 inch screen. Once I got it I loved how it felt, how the zippers worked, and even how it looked. I use this bag everyday and have not had any problems with it. It holds my laptop comfortably and I couldn't be happier, plus the price was great.

It is much wider than similar models, allowing the laptop to go in sideways with extra room on the side for cables, etc. While that is a good feature for the laptop section, it turns out to waste space in the folder section. Once you load all your files in, there is about 6 inches of dead space on the side. What you really need is a bag with less width and more depth so that you can roll it down the aisle of the plane and fit more folders/papers inside.Overall it is too big and the wrong shape and you'll be very irritated when you end up lugging your wheeled bag through the airplane."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great backpack for laptop and school books/supplies or just for a LAN party","review":"XL is an understatement.

Quality construction; feels very sturdy. Comfortable even when stuffed full.

I use it for the following items:1) 13-inch laptop and power adapter;2) MICR reader with its power adapter and USB cable;3) Expandable binder for documents;4) Two collapsible baskets (with wooden handles); and5) Several pens, pencils, etc.The straps are very comfortable, and the sturdy top handle is well positioned, providing stability when in use. The numerous zippered pockets are a great feature, too.The only negative comment is that the prongs of the adapters can get caught in the netting/mesh of the interior compartments. I have to be careful to position the adapters, which isn't a deal-breaker.All in all, this is a great back for anyone who has lots of stuff to lug around."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great design for a backpack","review":"The compartments were quite useful.

The seams are starting to separate after just four months of using it three days a week.I had a XL Swiss Army bag for my last laptop, but it would not hold this particular unit. If they start making a Swiss Army bag that can hold the new gaming laptops, I will buy it and retire this bag. Right now, if you have a gaming machine, this particular bag is the only choice out there.

The front storage is limiting as it does not unzip to open completely, and has a pocket opening on the side that pushes into the inside of the bag blocking use of some of the internal pockets. The back storage area, near the handles, limits usable space for items although it does hold files and accessories for the laptop. The pocket in the center which holds the laptop does not unzip all the way either, but allows you to slid the notebook into the slot, it would be more useful if you could open these sections fully."},{"rating":"1","title":"Handle Problem","review":"I read several reviews about this item.

I can say I am very happily surprised at exactly how well it has worked out. I have room for my laptop, tablet and peripheal gear with enough room left over for a couple of days clothing. This bag is HUGE. I use this bag as my carry-on for travel. It is comfortable and while large still meets the restrictions of the airlines.

I'd say the backpack is as advertised. It holds my 15-inch laptop easily. The backback itself is very light weight, and hardly seems to get any heavier when the laptop is added. I carry my makeup, hair dryer, curling iron, etc to work with me every day. So, I wanted a backpack big enough to carry all that stuff, plus my laptop, plus my planner and a notebook. This bag handles all that with ease. The shoulder straps are nicely padded and distribute the weight evenly. I also have a 17-inch laptop and it fits in the padded slot with no problem. If you're looking for a good quality backpack, that will carry a laptop and a lot of other items, this is a good buy. I also think it looks stylish, with the combination of blue and black. I'm very happy with my purchase."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cavernous but useless for organizing","review":"This is a very large backpack but not well designed.

Unfortunately I have to send this back.I've saw a large Targus backpack at Best Buy that appeared to be better quality, thicker padding, mesh, etc. I was thinking this was that model but evidently they make a cheaper version of their larger laptop backpack."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect multi-purpose pack","review":"I purchased this backpack for school, and I love it. Its rated for a 17\\" laptop, but I haul around my 13\\" MacBook, along with all my textbooks, notebooks, and folders for college. What's more, with all the space this backpack allows, it doubles as a weekend pack for carrying clothes, etc, if I go hiking, or just if I want to pack light when we hit the road to visit family out-of-state.The only thing that can be said against it is the front flap, which is designed to drop down for easy access to the pouches beneath. It is only held up with plastic buckle clips, so it still droops down a bit if its weighed down too much. However, I just use it to hold pencils and notes, so it doesn't get weighed down enough to droop.All in all, I highly recommend this backpack to anyone who wants a pack with lots of space for college stuff and wants to be able to tote their laptop too."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome","review":"After looking around in stores for what seemed like forever, all I could find for laptop backpacks were for 15.6\\" laptops or smaller.

I recently went out of town for 3 days, and carried my 17\\" laptop and all of the accessories, along with all of the clothes and toiletries I needed. I could have fit a ton more stuff in there! It seems well built, and is very comfortable to carry. It will strap on to a motorcycle very easily as well. After looking at what seemed like hundreds of backpacks and laptop cases, this is the best of the bunch. I am very happy with this purchase!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Plenty of Space","review":"This bag is actually big enough to accomodate a 17.3\\" laptop, and then some!

I love all the compartments so you can store your stuff separately. This is a rugged bag that takes a lot of licks and all you have to do is give it a wipe down and it is good as new!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent find for large laptops","review":"17\\" laptops are not really designed for travel, so when I needed to take mine on a trip I purchased the Targus XL Backpack. This backpack fits my Dell Inspiron 1720 perfectly. All of my cords stored neatly in the mesh pockets in the computer area of the backpack. Another compartment was great for my portfolio and a sweatshirt. Yet another pocket was an excellent space for my iPad and a hardcover book. And there are even more pockets to describe. Instead of doing that, let me say that the Targus XL Backpack is a great looking, sturdy, comfortable backpack that is perfect for those of us who need to travel with an oversize laptop computer. You'll be thrilled with this product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent case!!","review":"I have a large 17.3 inch laptop and got this case to haul it around in. LOVE it!! Works great and has lots of room left over!! Highly recommended!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Notebook Backpack","review":"I am replacing a very expensive backpack from Booq Bags. This targus is made just as good, if not better. The Booq Bags was $200.00 and lasted for three years. The Targus is warrantied for life and I expect it to last much longer and at a far better value. Love all the pockets! It holds more than I need or would want to carry around!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Targus TX617 Notebook Back Pack","review":"Great product for the price. I am in field service and this back pack allows me to carry everything I need to the job site. Highly recommend especially for those out in the field."},{"rating":"2","title":"the best one for 17\\" notebook computer","review":"A while ago my comapny upgraded my laptop to DELL Precision M90 which is a good one but very heavy on the road with a case. It's ok with a carry case when you transfer at a small airport like Harrisburg,PA. But if it's like Philly or Boston's Logan airport, carrying the case and walk half a mile is painful. So I decided to go with a backpack.This backpack got a good number of people reviewed and with a excellent rating, I want to give it a try when I saw it on the Amazon's today's deal with a attractive price. I am happy with it. My dell laptop fit perfect in this backpack and it still has many pockets for other stuff. The padding is thinner compare to most of the carry case. But the computer is still well-protected. Most important, carrying it is very comfortable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Too much for you","review":"I was looking a backpack for an over-sized Laptop (18,6\\") and the market has not a big variety to choose from. So i bought this one because i needed it.Overall the bag is very good to take a lot of stuff with you. It also serves as a camping backpack if you plan to camp taking your big wide-screen laptop with you. (Big Bang Theory idea, and geeks like me love that kind of stuff) You can also take two Laptops in the bag if you have one smaller and a sleeve.Pro: The compartment for the Laptop its fine, very spacey and cushioned. The other compartments (it has a lot) are very convenient. Has a cushioned pocket for an Ipod or a cellphone.Con: If you are not needing it, it is too much for you. It is not the type of bag you want to carry to the office nor on a bus or metro. It is XL."},{"rating":"2","title":"Targus XL","review":"this is a very good product. However, where the handle comes up from the briefcase, it doesn't allow much room to put things in. I would have appreciated more padding for my laptop. A separate compartment for the handle would have been excellent. Otherwise my 17 inch notebook fits comfortable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Overall very good, but funky front \\"flap\\" setup","review":"Overall, this backpack is well made, and has tons of room in it. My 17.3 inch notebook fits in it with NO problems.My only gripe/complaint is the bizarre front flap setup. Several of the pockets on what should be the front of the backpack are actually on a flap which can be disconnected at the top, to access some mesh storage on what it turns out is really the front of the main body of the backpack. The problem is that if you put hardly anything in the pockets of the flap it pulls the entire flap down and away from the rest of the backpack, so that the flap is then hanging on its two clips, and pooches out away from the main unit. Frankly, if I had been able to tell that this was how it was set up, I probably would have tried to find something else. So, build quality good, volume good, but what is the deal with this flap???"},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth every cent!","review":"The bag is XL, without a doubt! Very sturdy, more pockets than I may ever use, and comfortable. I have purchased Targus products over the years but this is one of the best! Well constructed and the price here on Amazon..$46 while $76 on their website. Quality, to sum it all up!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Unsatisfactory","review":"Padding in the laptop sleeve is completely insufficient.Plastic adjustment components on straps have all been broken.No cross chest straps."},{"rating":"2","title":"Targus TXL617 is a solid buy","review":"Great bag. Large enough for my 17\\" laptop. Lots of pockets. Nice fit on shoulders. Good price."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disapointed","review":"I was very disapointed in this back pack. It's extreamly big, the strange place with the two nets is practicaly useless, and even though it appears that the zippers are hidden by a weather gaurd to help protect the computer from the rain, they aren't. All in all i would have liked a different pack."},{"rating":"1","title":"GIGANTIC - much much too big","review":"I purchased this bag because I needed a bit of a larger bag for my laptop but it was SWIMMING in this bag. Plus, the bag is 150% bigger than the bag I was trying to replace, which means it would not be great to use on an airplane. Lots of pockets/zippers/etc. Probably too many. Seems like great construction but just not logistically great."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nive product, fell apart within three days, however","review":"The item arrived new with tags, and was in great shape, but without out overloading it, at all, the latch ( I do not know what you call it) broke.

Fox will tell you so much about what happened that you will shake your head saying, \\"I didn't know that.\\" He tells his story eloquently. The breath and depth of his knowledge in some popular areas is awesome, especially his account of the evolution of the jump shot. I was left impressed with the degree of research that was necessary for such an interesting book. While his selection of pictures is interesting, it is the factual research concerning little known facts that will leave you a more knowledgable student of sports in America."},{"rating":"2","title":"great gun","review":"this gun is one of the best gun i have. it has really good fps. over all buy this gun if you want a really good gun. full metal inside some plastic on the outside and it has very good range."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great gun if you dont want to spend alot","review":"This AEG has an amazing look to it. The only problem with it's looks are the few plastic parts including the rails, front handle, mag, and stock. The one part that I like about the gun is that the orange tip can be taken off and put back on, thus making the gun look more realistic. I was impressed with how strong this gun can shoot, also its aim is right on target, from about 20 feet away I missed the center of the target by about half an inch on my first shot. The power is amazing on a half charge it can dent drywall pretty well. Another thing that is good about this gun is that it can use .2 and .12 b.b.s. although the manual says not to I still do it and have had no problems."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth It but don't expect alot","review":"I've had this gun for about 4months now it's okay the selector switch wobbles easy fix look online.

It still works great and has a good FPS and Rate of Fire."},{"rating":"2","title":"WOW.","review":"This is fantastic! I cannot express how cool this gun is. The full automatic feature is INSANE. The semi-auto feature is also pretty good. This gun is held together by metal and plastic parts. It comes with a grip that is kind of hard to open, but works just fine.The only bad things are is that the battery does not come charged, the gun is hard to set up, the battery takes FOREVER to charge, the sight wobbles around so it's hard to shoot straight, and finally, the gun is very heavy and hard to hold up especially if you're not that muscular like me.Otherwise, great product!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing gun","review":"This gun is great. i love it. it is heavy like the real gun coming in at about 9 pounds. very great gun. blasts right through a full soda can from 30 feet with .12 gram bb\\"s. i highly recommend this airsoft rifle. it has a very good rate of fire, and is mostly metal.the folding foregrip rocks and the gun hurts alot when shot at with. haha. i play all the time and this is the best rifle i have ever owned out of all of mine"},{"rating":"1","title":"great gun....at first","review":"I got this gun, the day i got it i charged the battery for about 4 hours, shot about 30 rounds and the gun made a weird grinding sound and wouldn't shoot.

The mechanism that selects between semi-automatic, and automatic became loose and stopped working. The gun is in semi-automatic mode all the time now. Another problem was the magazine. The magazine is only plastic and stopped working after about a week of use (After the gun was dropped). I'm not sure what a good replacement would be.

Within an hour of use, it would not go to safe either, and only semi auto would work. I removed and replaced the lever hoping to tighten whatever was loose, but with no luck.

It is very good when it comes to replica's but you can tell something's going to go wrong because it comes with an extra fuse, and is made in china. there is a section that tells you in the manual \\"ONLY USE OUR BATTERY.ONLY USE OUR BATTERY CHARGER.IF bb'S ARE REUSED, IT CAN RESULT IN SOMETIMES FATAL DAMAGE TO THE GEARBOX.\\" so basically, if you reuse a BB like i might have, it basically breaks your gun. i really don't recomend this gun. if you want something fast, non Co2, and cool, look up the TSD TACTICAL G5K AEG, it is an mp5k that is only $90.00. yea, it comes in april and i probably can't even get it because this was my birthday present and it broke.THANKS AMAZON/CHINA FOR RUINING MY 13'TH BIRTHDAY."},{"rating":"1","title":"worst gun","review":"I got this gun being excited as i played with my friends.

Both provided exceptional customer service and quick troubleshooting tips to help address our issues w/ the item purchased. We followed their instructions and the gun appears to be working perfectly.

Seems like it would only fit a mirror that is a 1/4\\" thick and about 3 inch in height. I tried to put it in my 2009 Scion xD and it does not fit because my mirror is 1/2\\" thick. The plastic surrounding the mirror glass is not smooth, it's actually too big for the glass also, so it shows the rough edges in the inside(the glass edges showing on one side). The worst part is, the glass broke on me when I try to rig it to work with my mirror. Stay away from this item. Way too pricey even if it will work for you.

Yes, the set-up is a bit ridiculous (M/F identical twins? Nun-in-training posing as member of a boy-band?) but if you can get past such inconsistencies/unlikeliness (as anyone familiar with Asian dramas probably already has) I'd say this one is worth checking out. I initially watched it via fansubs but liked it enough to fork over the money to show real support and buy the proper, R1-licensed release when it was available (partially in hopes that YA Entertainment will also license/release lead actor Jang Geun Suk's current drama Marry Me Mary! as well). I hope to see more K-dramas available for purchase and this is a nice start."},{"rating":"2","title":"I Will Promise You","review":"I've only recently been watching K-dramas, and I purchased \\"You're Beautiful\\" along with \\"Boys Over Flowers\\". I feel in love with \\"Boys Over Flowers\\" instantaneously, so my expectations for your \\"You're Beautiful\\" were pretty high, and I wasn't disappointed. The music is catchy, the acting at times is a little over the top, but I've come to expect that with Korean dramas, and if you don't fall in love with the A.N.JELL's then something is seriously wrong with you. The characters of Shinwoo, Jeremy, and Taekyung all have their tender moments with Minam that will leave you on the brink of tears-especially Jeremy's bus (You have to buy it, sorry no spoilers here). This is a definite must have to any DVD collection. Highly recommended!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This is still my favorite","review":"This was the first Korean Drama I saw.

Many times I have thought. \\"This drama is so good, maybe this one is my favorite.\\" But then I go back and re-watch You're Beautiful and quickly realize it has not been surpassed. This remains my favorite drama. Give it a chance. I disagree with the review that said you had to be under 20 to enjoy it.

This is done to protect a sibling and she replaces him in a Korea Pop-Rock Group that is successful. Most pleasant and very enjoyable. There is love, the implication of sex and comedy. This makes Asian films to me so enjoyable. There is very little outwardly expressed sex except for some kissing. However, the implication is very prevalent which makes for getting into the theme and plot a lot more interesting. This is a very young cast, most of them are younger the 25 years; most are in their 20's; one may be even 19 years.
