Hemingway really had a way with words it made you feel you we're out in the sea with the old man."},{"rating":"2","title":"Outstanding Narrative Performance","review":"Donald Sutherland's narration of this classic Hemingway story is simply the very best narration of an audiobook I've ever experienced. The story is classic and the combination of Hemingway's words and Sutherland's performance transported me on to that skiff with the lovable old man.A novella of only 128 pages and an audiobook of only 2 hrs 28 minutes; this is a listening experience everyone should take the time to enjoy."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good read","review":"Hemingway's The Old man and The Sea was an enjoyable book for me to read. I appreciated his simplicity in writing, and his to the point style. At first I was unclear about the purpose of the book and was unfufilled after finishing it, but after thinking about it in depth I began to appreciate the book more and more. Hemingway's simple language and uncomplicated storyline make the reader strive for the deeper meaning. This meaning is found within the symbolism of the story and anlysation of events. Within this simple story about a man who catches a fish are an array of complicated issues and deeper meanings. To me, Hemingway's genius is deeply apparent."},{"rating":"2","title":"Autobiographical insight","review":"So much of Hemingway's work paralleled his own life, this story is no different. Santiago the old man losing his ability to fish as he did in youth; Hemingway the aging writer without quite the literary prowess of his earlier years. Yet both of them are tied by the unpopular opinion that they have one 'big one' left in them. As the pages turn and the story unfolds, the reader discovers the poorly kept secret that they were both right. A lyrical story of poignance and import. An elegy for our greatest narrator. Well done."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great first read of Hemingway","review":"Those who haven't read Hemingway, this novel is a great way to start. It is short but you get an idea of how much Hemingway's novels make you think about life after you finish it. Is it worthwhile to be greedy? What makes a person good and what makes him bad? What is the definition of son and father? etc. You can find all kinds of questions running through the book that makes you think."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book would be better for adults, not kids.","review":"From a kids point of view, \\"The Old Man and the Sea\\" was about as boring as it could be. There was about one hundred pages about a fish. Why would anyone care that much about a fish? If the story had a little more action and a little less about the mans' cramped hand, it would be a tiny bit better. If you wanted to read a book about a fish, this is the book for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"This book is very boring. In the beginning it didn't even spark my interest. Because the book was written without chapters, it is kind of hard to tell whats what and whos who. I fell aslleep every 10 minutes, or made up an excuse to do something else. There is no suspense or adventure, but only an old guy talking to himself. This book is written nicely, but only in one way-(thats where the 1 star came from)-because you could picture all this in your head, because of his very descriptive writing"},{"rating":"1","title":"BORING","review":"I found this book incredibly boring.

The man did not shut up about the stupid fish. Hemingway was one of those authors who never got to the point If he was going to write about a sruggle could he write about one in real life. Comparing life and struugle to a fish suggestts serious problems some of you will say it was the struggle with the fish that was important but it wasn't. Joe DiMaggio was a bad code hero because he lived in the characters fantasy. and heros have to be in real life to all of you having to read it for school invest in CLiff Notes if allowed it'll save you the time and annoyance."},{"rating":"1","title":"God, This Boring Book About Fishing Should Be Banned--","review":"it could be single-handedly responsible for narcolepsy.

Well, I for one will not call invisible talent talent just because it was written by \\"literary\\" royalty. Please, spare yourself the misery of this dreadful waste of trees.

The marlin puts up a fight, and the old man's astonishing bravery and incredible wisdom allows him to put up a fight. Who wins? Read the book to find out! This is a truly fishy tale that tells of one man's courage and defeat. I would recommend this book to readers around middle school and up. Be warned, though. The big is rather dry, and goes along at a slow pace. But its marvelous descriptions and easy-to-follow plot makes it a book suitable for all readers, even me!"},{"rating":"1","title":"! WARNING!

I recommend this book only for: Hemingway fans, those who like symbolism in a novel (this one is perfect for u guys), speed readers (read it and you'll find out why), if you have to ( book report, required by a class). If your one of those people that is always reading, ex. once they finish a book they look for another good one, what I call a \\"relaxed leisure reader\\",this is not for you! Also one last thing, if u do read it, make it a \\"bed time book,\\" so you can focus easier on the symbolism, details, etc."},{"rating":"1","title":"Have Not, if it's all the same to you","review":"I am no fan of The Old Man and the Sea, but it's worth publicising more widely the little-known story of its genesis. The Old Man and the Sea was actually an allegory of Hemingway's doomed attempts at wooing Norma Jean Baker (Marilyn = marlin: geddit?). He saw himself as the \\"evolved\\" being of man against the \\"shark\\" of his contemporary Arthur Miller who nipped and nipped and was the ultimate victor of her affections."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is a great book","review":"The Old Man and the Sea by Ernest Hemingway is a great short novel. Hemingway's vividly describes every aspect of the book from the setting to the thoughts of the Old Man. The story begins with the man ending a day of fishing in the gulf off of Cuba. This day was just like the last 84 days for the man, he had not caught a single fish. The man went out the next day with the same intentions as the as the day before and the day before that. He hoped to catch a large marlin that he might find in the deep waters of the gulf. He didn't know that he was to embark on the most significant fishing trip of his life. The main character Santiago is the old man that battles nature. The boy that assists the old man is the only important in the beginning and end of the book and not the climax. The book is short and goes into great detail about the old man's struggle against nature."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hemingway achieves in 127 pages what most can't in 1000","review":"Before reading this book I was not a reader who looked for deeper meanings of books, but rather tried to take them at face value. This book changed everything! Ernest Hemingway's simple sentences managed to enchant a teenager who rarely cares to read. The enormity of what Hemingway does has been replicated by few in history. THe struggle of the old man against himself makes each of us examine more closley our own existence and helps us face the challenges that each of us are faced with. Hemingway is classic, and I would suggest that one would take the time to read this great work of American art."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good delivery","review":"It was a good product and it was delivered on time.

If only it had been a full length novel !"},{"rating":"2","title":"good book","review":"im a student and i just read this book and i thiught that it was written well and told well. i must say at some times it was a-little boreing. any way i hope eveyone will read this book...."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the finest short stories ever written","review":"The realism of the main character and the intensity of his predicements makes this one of the best short stories ever written. Don't listen to the nay sayers. Besides, would you listen to someone that writes something like, \\"this book is a fine book to read if you like reading.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"A Wonderful Journey","review":"The Old Man and the Sea was my second experience with Hemingway, and I loved it. It was vastly different than The Sun Also Rises, which I read just before beginning The Old Man and the Sea.The writing was clear, sharp, and evocative. As perfect as the writing was, it was the story that floored me. I think that what makes the The Old Man and the Sea a classic is that each reader can find some unique reflection of his or her own life in the story. The Old Man undergoes a universal struggle, and we are with him the whole time, rooting for him, but in the back of our minds, knowing that the odds are against him.I recommend it highly. This one is going into my re-read pile."},{"rating":"2","title":"2 hours well spent!","review":"I saw this book at the library and thought, \\"Hey, I never read this Hemingway in high school.\\" I remembered liking the other required readings by Hemingway so I picked this up. It was a bit slow, but as Santiago fought with the massive fish, I became consumed in his battle. I cheered for him as he fought days and nights with the fish, through hunger, thirst, and pain. I cheered for through more battles with sharks. Ultimately, I cried for him when the fish was gone.I could not believe that such a simplistic story drew me in like this. Life does not give us what we want materialistically all the time. But if you give it a go and fight honorably for it, you gain something much more."},{"rating":"2","title":"Engaging Classic","review":"I haven't read classics since school and decided to take a break from commercial and contemporary fiction to read a few. I'm quite surprised that a story about a fish could have me wrapped up and engaged. This was my first Hemingway book and I enjoyed his simple storytelling style. Because it was straight forward, I was able to get into the old man's dilemma of not having caught a fish in months and then battling with this great marlin, only to have it attacked by sharks. I like that I was able to get into and feel his struggles within his mind and against his body. This was a very engaging classic."},{"rating":"2","title":"Inspirational","review":"One of the best ever, this is a book full of emotion, from the first page you can feel the Old Man's inspiration and determination. The book is not very long, it is just right, many times during the reading I stoped and imagined him at sea fighting the marlin and then the sharks, the old man talking to himself and remembering better times, when he was young, when he was stronger.The old man finds the strenght to come back victorious even in defeat.This book is a must read for all ages, simply a great short novel."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good book","review":"This book arrived on time and in good condition. It is a classic and worth the short read, not as good as some other classics though."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good book","review":"The Old Man and the Sea was a very good book. I like it. It's really adventurous, and the old man is funny in it. I like how he talks. It's a great book."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Old Struggle","review":"The Old Man and the Sea is the classic tale of a man's struggle against the one obstacle which never seems to take care of itself: the pursuit of happiness. In the novel, we are taken through a three day journey with an old man named Santiago as he tries to capture a fish for the first time in 83 days. The novel shoes excellent symbolism, along with Santiago's struggles with himself, and the fish he has hooked. The Old Man and the Sea is a quick easy read, and although some might not enjoy it, the novel present itself as a classic, and turns out to be close to that."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great Book","review":"The Old Man and the Sea, by Earnest Hemingway was a good book overall. The things I liked about this book was that the whole book was exciting. Basically every part of the story wants to make you continue reading it. The author describes the characters in great detail in this book. In describing the \\"Old man\\", he says, \\"his eyes were as blue as the sky and his face was as pale as a ghost.Some of the dislikes I had in this book was that for basically the whole story the old man is in the boat. Also, when the old man sees the big fish he keeps trying to catch it for a long time. Another dislike is that the old man almost dies trying to catch the fish. Overall, this book is excellent and I would recommend it to any type of reader."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Old Man and The Sea","review":"Santiago is an old man who loves to fish. He dreams about catching a large fish and returning to his former days of glory.He goes out one day to fish and catches a large marlin. The long struggle between the man and marlin begins. After a long time at sea, sharks eat most of the marlin. The old man is left with only its carcass and returns to shore.I throughly enjoyed this novel. I felt Hemmingway's personification of the sea was a nice touch that made the book even better. You also couldn't help but like Santiago. His hard work and sacrifice was noble and he kept his humility throughout the book. Well, I give this book 4 stars and recommend it to anyone who enjoys reading about the struggles we all have or will face, and the effort that one put forth to achieve his goal."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"This book though short was very motivational. It is an excellent tale of how a man can overcome great tasks and survive terrible tragedies, while still having a will that is not defeated but rather presses on. The great task in this story is catching an extraordinary and noble fish. The tragedy however is having that great fish being stolen from Santiago, the fisherman, by hoards of blood lusting sharks. Santiago displays great courage and honor while he gets dragged out to sea by this gigantic fish. So if your looking for a good book to read and don't have a lot of time I recommend The Old Man and the Sea as an exceptional book for all ages."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"The book is about an old man named Santiago who has been on a fishing slump for 84 days. Since, he hasn't caught any fish he is very poor, and all the people in town make fun of him except his trusted friend Manolin. Santiago then goes out to sea and goes on the journey of his life. I would recommend you to go and read this book and see what happens."},{"rating":"2","title":"A guidebook to the natural world","review":"After over 500 reviews, what else can be said. Not much perhaps, but the one thing that struck me about this book was Hemingway's grasp of the natural world. Of course, Hemingway was addicted to the outdoorsman's life - but his narrative and descriptions show such incredible attention. Not only to detail, but more importantly to the details that count. This old man is in tune with nature's brutality and beauty, and his thoughts - which are really Hemingway's - are a guide to life."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointed","review":"this book was really, incredibly horrible. it was horrid, even. it was by far the worst book i've ever had the disgust in reading. i hated this book with a passion. i recommend it to no one. you will be disappointed. after all the awards it has recieved, you'd think it would have been better."},{"rating":"1","title":"I actually fell asleep!","review":"i actually fell asleep reading this book & it wasn't even 3 a.m. & I wasn't even tired!

I kept thinking..Santiago, let that fish go and row back to shore. Was it really worth all that trouble? I gave this book two stars because the book had one or two genuine moments in it that inspired me, but I did not care for the story as a whole. The book left me disappointed, so I started reading \\"A Brave New World\\". It is a much better book, in my opinion."},{"rating":"1","title":"A fisherman tries to catch a very big fish.","review":"I think this book is not for young people to read.

Personally, when I read this book, I felt a bit seasick. I love novels of colors and flavors, novels with variety and awkward sentences. The Old Man and the Sea would certainly get an 800 on the SAT II, but, well, Shakespeare would've barely gotten the 200 for his name. Still not comprehending? Once upon a time, in all of our lives, we have had to take a course titled \\"grammar.\\" If you enjoy simple sentences that get the point across quickly and bluntly, this book will by far exceed your greatest expectations. Hemingway is for the impatient readers. However, if you, like myself, love writing that is more poetic than 8th-grade-english-class, I would highly recommend reading a brief summary of the book and getting on with life."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"I being a 14 year old girl found this book very boring because it is about a fisherman catching a big fish. It also had no chapters so it just kept going on and on."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of Hemingway's best Novels","review":"The Old Man and The Sea was a good book all in all. Ernest Hemingway's style of writing is very detailed, you would know that if you read some of his other books.The book starts off talking about the old man named Santiago, and how he hasn't cought a fish in 84-days, but one day when he goes out to fish, he ends up catching a giant marlin that starts dragging him out to sea.

I found this book to be repetitive and everything is always linked to something else. It seems to drag on with descriptions and may seem as if it could be written in a few pages.

So- unless you can't get yourself to sleep at night- DONT READ THIS BORING BOOK!..."},{"rating":"1","title":"What's so interesting?","review":"The book is based on one fishing trip in the middle of nowhere with an old man and a giant marlin. The only inspiring thing about this book is the old man's ability to stay strong enough to capture the marlin. Other than that, this book was so, so boring. First of all, why didn't they just summarize those three days with a couple of pages. Instead, I was forced to read an endless amount of pages that seemed to get longer about him catching and losing his prize fish/trophy. What's the point? He was already poor, and now he's lost one of the most important things to happen to him. It was a lost phenomenon. I would have cryed and jumped off the boat if I had been the odl man. That's how depressing this book is. You can't help but feel sympathetic when you read this book. This book doesn't teach any morals or writing skills; it teaches us to avoid reading anything by Hemingway.

It is certainly a profound story, but it also happens to be a very dull one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great classical reading","review":"One of Ernest Hemingway's earliest short stories that will captivate the reader with layers of meaning and symbolism. A very short and easy read that I recommend to all classical story readers."},{"rating":"2","title":"a nice story that holds your attention","review":"I'm not a fiction reader, but I had to read this for a class. It's not bad if you're at all interested in the subject matter (fishing). A little unbelievable, who tries to catch a 20 foot fish with a 10 foot boat? That's just asking for trouble. Overall though, it wasn't a bad read. It's short, easy to read, and keeps your attention. A nice little book if you read fiction."},{"rating":"2","title":"the Old Man and the Sea","review":"This a great book for Advanced ESL students to read and comprehend.

Amazing"},{"rating":"2","title":"Pleased","review":"Greetings,The Old Man and The Sea is a book that should inspire each one of us. The Old Man is a fisher that hold two things close, The Sea and a Little Boy.The Old Man is one of patience, and endurance. As he heads out to Sea, he makes a catch that turns out to be one of the greatest tests of his life.Since he has perfected the characteristics that comes with maturity he is able to handle the Sea at her worse. He listens enough to understand the language of the Sea, the movements of birds and the shining of the sun.This book is not so much about the Old Man and the Sea as it is about how wise, mature, patient, and able-bodied many of us should be when we reach Old Age.With Old Age there is no fear, only trust in yourself."},{"rating":"2","title":"Overall a good book but too lengthy for such a simple topic.","review":"\\"The Old Man and the Sea\\" by Ernest Hemingway was an overall good book. I would not want to read this book in my free time, because it isn't very exciting, but considering it's a book I had to read for school, it's not too bad. The only drawback of it is that it is too lengthy. The same thing could have been written in half as many words and portrayed the same idea. Because the book drags on for a long time about the same idea, it starts to lose the readers interest. If it were shortened by about 50-70 pages, it would be a lot better book."},{"rating":"1","title":"A snoozer!","review":"Yes, this book has lots of symbolizm. Yes it has universal themes. Yes, Hemingway employs a great use of symbolism. Yes his sentences are short and he uses simple, easy to understand vocabulary. BUT this is one of the most boring books I have ever read!!! Hello! The guy sits in a boat in the middle of the ocean for a hundred pages trying to get a fish. If you love fish or just happen to love any book you read, then you'll love this book. However, I, personally, was not fanscinated. Had the book not been required for my Honors English class summer reading list, I wouldn't have finished it. I gave this books two stars because I realize it had deeper meanings and so forth, plus, thankfully, Hemingway spared us and kept the book fairly short (as opposed to some boring books that are 400 pages) but on a surface level it was an unbearably drawn out book about a fish."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothingness","review":"The book wasn't too long, in fact, it was incredibly short. And while it is full of symbolism that a person may not catch in the first read, it still wasn't worth it. I'm not a person that hates reading books, in fact, I enjoy it, but when I read this one, it was a struggle to continue reading. I did not find it too enjoyable, and I doubt if any people who do not enjoy reading/fishing/symbolism are going to really want to pick this one up."},{"rating":"1","title":"One of the worst books I've ever read","review":"I read this book with great expectations. Hemingway has been billed as \\"one of the greatest writers of the 20th century\\"! I figured it must be good, to have so much publicity. I was wrong.The book starts out in Havana, where a poor old man lives. He fishes for a living and has not caught a fish in a while. He knows that he is near the end of his life. He knows a boy who comes over often, but can't fish with him anymore. The old man decides to embark on a fishing trip.Once this happens, the pages drag on. And on. The grammar is supposed to be \\"cutting edge\\" and \\"of powerful simplicity,\\" but it's really just incorrect. Call me a stickler, but in the end it's plain annoying.After a hundred pages of time at sea (with not one interesting page), the man returns with no fish. Oh, what great writing? No, just a boring \\"novella.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Mini-\\"Moby\\"","review":"Hemingway apes \\"Moby Dick,\\" recasting Ahab as a \\"black sheep\\" shaman who constantly yearns for his overly emotional boy slave and has self-destructive tendencies he takes out on his loved ones and those who seek to possess said loved ones. Everything is emptiness, like brainpans fried away, ornaments without luster.At least Idaho Spud keeps his aimless ramblings brief, unlike the constipated \\"A Moveable Feast,\\" in which Papa Longstocking trained a spotlight on the mundanity of social hour at the writers guild."},{"rating":"1","title":"old man and the sea","review":"I thought this book was pointless and had no meaning to it. All its about is some guy who goes out on a boat and chases a fish around for three days.

I dont reccomend this book unless you have a book report and want to read a short book."},{"rating":"1","title":"I was extremely disappointed with this book.","review":"I found The Old Man and The Sea very boring. It lacks any real plot. It is exactly (and only) what it sounds like: an old man fishing. The book is very simple, but even a 2nd grader would not enjoy it for lack of excitement or suspence. True, many people say that there is a deeper meaning to it. I, for one, happen to enjoy books with a deeper meaning, but this book does not have one. Everything is just what it appears to be. Basically, do not waste your time on this book when there are millions of great ones to choose from."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"The Old Man and The Sea\\"","review":"While this book was well written as far Hemingway's style is concerned, I fail to comprehend the point of a man trying to catch a fish (which is what the book basically focus's on) If you are looking for an easy fast read, and enjoy the sport of fishing, I would then go on to say yes, read it if you like. But if you want a comprehensive book...this book is NOT for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"i couldn't keep my attention on this book","review":"I had to read this for a project in school, and I thought that it was boring.

I thought the beginning was good and captured my attention, but as the book went on it got very dull. When he was following the fish the imagery was good, but it was boring. I also didn't get the comparison to God. I really don't think that it was intentional of Hemmingway to have Santiago to appear as a Christ-like figure. I think that people just read into the book to far. I would not recommend this book to anyone and I only read it because it was required for my English class."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great book - poor production","review":"Review is on the manufacturing of the book, not on the content - one of Hemingway's classics.

I was in 9th grade when I read it for the first time. The novel can be summarized in one sentence: It is about a man struggling to catch a fish and eventually failing. The true meaning of the novel goes so much deeper than that though. This novel taught me not to judge a book by it's cover. Since reading this novel, I have read several other pieces of literature by Ernest Hemingway and he has become one of my favorite authors. I strongly recommend taking the time to read this novel."},{"rating":"2","title":"We are heroes... in our dreams.","review":"(My review contains a major spoiler)When Santiago, the old fisherman, finally decides to try his luck far away from the shore, he probably did'nt realise he would meet his destiny both as a fisherman and a human being. As a human being because after all his troubles he comes home empty handed, a fate most of us humans will find at the end of our life, we will ask if this is all we have done.But it seems to me that the story has a second meaning. When a huge sword-fish takes the bait an epic battle starts between the two. The fish swims away, forcing the old man to taut the cord for almost two days. During this moments one could ask who's the hunter and who's the hunted.In my point of view it's this duality that makes the story a masterpiece."},{"rating":"2","title":"Read it in an hour, think about it for a lifetime.","review":"I read \\"Old Man and the Sea\\" nearly three years ago as part of a Meaning of Religion course, and for good reason. The depth of the writing and meaning in this book, in the midst of a simple writing style truly makes this book a masterpiece. Although I'm not willing to say it's a book that will make you believe in God, it's certainly a book that will make you think about the possibility. It's a truly beautiful and wonderful read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Review of The Old Man and the Sea","review":"From the start to the end I really enjoyed this book. This is because of Hemmingway's writing style. I really enjoyed the simplicity of the way he wrote this book. It doesn't really have any challenging words or phrases that make the book tough to read. Im am usually turned away from those type of books. But this book is different. It really makes you feel like you are with the Old Man through his adventures with the Marlin dragging him. There is a lot of emotion running throughout this book. The brotherly love the Old Man and the boy share with each other and the pride and determination the Old Man has throughout his journey in the sea. It really sent the message to me to never give up in anything I do. That is why I am giving this book a 5 star rating."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"We must kill our brothers\\"","review":"I really enjoyed the movie (1990) with Anthony Quinn as Santiago. So I decided it was time to read the book. Well I found the book and the movie paralleled pretty well. How ever I was getting bored with the book it seemed a bit repetitive. The old man kept going on and on about Joe Dimaggio's bone spur.There were a few places that made me squeamish. One such place is when he gutted a dolphin and had his face stuck in it.The story is too short to go into detail without revealing the surprises; however it is about (you guessed it) an old fisherman, that should be over the hill, going out to sea from Cuba to catch fish. He has 84 days of bad luck and with any luck this is about to change (or is it?)The reader helps bring the story to life.The Old Man and the Sea ~ Anthony Quinn"},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing!","review":"What is really amazing about this book I first read in elementary school, is that after all this time so few people have realized the metaphor.Hemingway and Faulkner were bitter rivals, and Hemingway wrote this piece after Faulkner recieved the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1949. Ironically it won him the Pulitzer in 1950, which Faulkner had yet to win, and surely helped in his 1954 Nobel.Now go back and read it again, and see what the story is really about, and don't forget to think who those sharks represent, just by writing a review, you may be one of them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth Reading","review":"Hemingway is not a famous author for nothing.

I was forced to read it in an English assignment. It is 90 percent endless blabber about unnecessary and unwanted detail. Many call this one of the greatest books ever written by Ernest Hemingway. I can say that thanks to this book I will probably never read another Ernest Hemingway novel again. Filled with unending blabber the book is really pointless. There is no lesson to be learned, it is not exciting, funny, dramatic or moving. I would not recommend this book at all, unless you were someone who wanted to waste a few hours of their life. Overall this book never did anything to make me fell that it was a good book."},{"rating":"1","title":"This Book got a Nobel Prize?","review":"I was forced to read this book in reading class. I found it to be a long book about nothing. Half of the time the book talked the old man's wandering thoughts which had almost nothing to do with the story. And my teacher told us that every thing that happened to Santiago was related to Jesus's crusifiction. I could see that in some areas, but in others it seemed far feched."},{"rating":"1","title":"It was sooo boring!","review":"This novella was just plain boring. The many different allegories hidden inside the story is fascinating but I think that for young people, this is NOT the thing to read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Definitely not Field and Stream","review":"This is one of those gems that I had to suffer through in high school. It was a short read but an annoying, boring and depressing one. If the school system in their wisdom had decided to make us hormonal, easily depressed kids sit down and read about fishing, I could have picked up Field and Stream or else something by Patrick McManus, likeKerplunk!: Stories.At least that way if the fish is caught the writer gets to eat it, and if it didn't get caught, the way it got away would be hilarious, and if it got caught and eaten by sharks, there would be an amusing conclusion. (But it wouldn't have enough deep meaning and pessimism to satisfy my teachers... Who wants a bunch of happy, laughing kids? At least at the time I attended high school?)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Why didn't he just drown?","review":"This book is meaningless. It's pointless. It doesn't say anything about society, it doesn't bring up thoughts or opinions, it doesn't take a stand on any issue. It's a story about an old guy in a boat. This book was assigned to me, and I am now wondering why. Literature should have direction and goals it aims to accomplish when people read it. This is a randomly composed book about some old guy who goes fishing. Maybe if this book was set over the mans lifetime, and it described the trials and tribulations of his fishing as he ages, then it might be good. But the whole book was about one fishing trip. I don't suggest it unless you enjoy books that are essentially pointless. If you don't want to think, if you don't want to be inspired, if you are looking for something to read that won't give you any new opinions on anything, please read this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ummmm....Not my favorite book EVER!","review":"This book was not on my favorite list at all. I was forced to read it for english and all it did was frustrate me. I think that kids cant relate to it as much. Mabey if i wait until i am older and then i read it again i will appreciate it.

I just think this isnt good reading material for high school students."},{"rating":"1","title":"zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz...","review":"This is the most boring book I was ever forced to read (for an English class). I cannot describe how mind-numbing and pointless it was. I couldn't have cared less what happened to the old man, the fish, the boat, or Ernest Hemmingway. It was a titanic struggle to get through the book--way harder than anything the old man had to face. James Joyce does stream of consciousness a whole lot better--and I hate Joyce's writing too. Don't waste your time reading this one when there are plenty of books out there with an actual plot."},{"rating":"2","title":"Most heartfelt but not his best","review":"\\"The Old Man and The Sea\\" is not in my mind Hemingway's best work but it is the one story that I feel he felt the most for while writing. Hemingway lived life on his terms and he paid in many ways for that lifestyle. The old fisherman to me represents Hemingway's lifelong struggle to write clearly and simply. The story has a lot of heart in its depiction of an old man's struggle to never give up."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simple and classic","review":"Anyone who denies that Hemingway was a genius is probably either 1) a fool or 2) a dilettante intellectual trying to impress you.This story is about the incredible impact work has on human beings.

It really helped me to understand how trich feels for my daughter and provided some great insights into parenting a child with trich. Cheryn Salazar mentions her own Chrisitanity once or twice, but I did not feel that she was pushing this as a solution as one reviewer did. This book does not get into detail about meds and behavioral therapy but it gave me great insight into what it feels like to have this disorder and I have not yet found that in any other book/article.

They had a great opportunity to do a cute Spring-themed show here and all they could come up with is this? The other episode on the disc (Donald's Hiccups) is amusing and she'll ask for that repeatedly. I'd say this DVD is for older Mickey fans (5 yrs +).

The slide barely stays attached for one or two treks down by one of the figures included. The movable ear falls off if you even look at it wrong. The lever to rotate Toodles barely works only ever giving 1 to half a rotation.

Paul Siebel was one of the truly original voices of the sixties \\"folk/country\\" movement. While critics comfortably fall back on plaudits for Gram Parsons, the Byrds etc., artists like Paul have gone unnoticed and underappreciated. It is a shame because he was probably a far superior songwriter than Parsons whose legend has truly outlived his musical legacy. Ain't it funny how death exagerates the importance of some while others fade with age and lack of recognition. Listen to \\"The Ballad of Honest Sam\\", \\"Louise\\" and \\"Then Came the Children\\". As an aspiring folk singer in 1969, I found great inspiration in Paul's work. I'd love to hear Paul again!!

She never, before or after her conversion, comes off as a stained-glass, holier than thou person.

As I read it, I was tempted to pull out my red pencil and edit as I went along. The repetition was more than I could bear and the writing was so elementary as to be insulting to the average reader. I can't believe that a writer with the kind of experience that Danielle Steel has doesn't even use quotation marks correctly. Unbelievable.The sad thing is, this could have been a powerful story. Ms. Steel lost her own son and certainly knows a mother's pain. That is where the problem lies. Her character Alice is strong and well developed. But no one else is. If she had spent more time on this book it might have been different. But, as usual, she power-wrote yet another and it didn't click."},{"rating":"2","title":"tear jerker","review":"I really enjoyed this book. I told all my friends to read it.

She had an ulterior motive for writing this selection."},{"rating":"1","title":"Is Danielle Steel really this bad a writer?","review":"This is literally one of the most poorly written books I have ever read, which came as somewhat of a shock as it is Steel's 58th bestseller.

Did she hire an intern to compose this book for her??"},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointed","review":"I bought this book thinking that it would be like some of her other books, but I agree with some of the other readers. This book was like reading it over and over again. Had the same sentence over and over just in different sequence order. It was a childish story. We had a death in a family member and it's been over 7 yrs and we still cannot get over it. My ex-sister in law took her more than 5 yrs to move on and start dating again. So this book is not even close to reality. If you love someone so much, it doesn't take you just 4 months to get over that person. I do not recommended this book to anyone to read.

It's not hard to get into right from the beginning but it becomes a little far fetched. At first I thought \\"oh this isn't my type of thing\\", but I was drawn into it anyway and it was a very quick read. I didn't think I was going to enjoy it after it took a rather unrealistic turn, but it was interesting enough to keep me going and the end left me with a very happy, peaceful, and satisified feeling so I'm glad that I kept going. I believe that other Danielle Steel enthuisasts will also enjoy this if they are willing to keep their mind open to a rather unrealistic plot and wait for a very sweet ending.

I've read the vast majority of her books - purchased and listened to many of them as audio books...and even seen the ones that have been made into movies. This was pretty disappointing! I had purchased \\"Dating Game\\" the same time I got \\"Johnny Angel\\". \\"Dating Game\\" was everthing that \\"Johnny Angel\\" wasn't! The book was thin in every way - the story line and the characters were lacking...and the whole thing reminded me of a beefed up short story. Hardly worth the $7.50 I paid for the paper back! Also, the entire time I was reading it, I felt like someone was pulling my leg. It was somewhat entertaining - but I certainly would never be interested in re-reading it - which I often do with her other works! It has the same silly fantasy of \\"The Klone\\". I guess every once in awhile Ms Steel blows a mind fuse! Hopefully, she'll get back on track with the next book! Let's keep our fingers crossed!"},{"rating":"1","title":"let down","review":"I have read every one of Danielle Steel's books...however...this one was a real let down. Very predictable and boring.

I didn't give it a 5 because I'm very picky about my books."},{"rating":"2","title":"This book was a very good book","review":"I really liked this book because it was different from the normal Danielle Steel books that she rights. I've never read a book like this and i thought that it was very interesting. The way that everything ended was very good, I don't like it when books end sad so this book was a very good book to me.

It is not - they are completely new arrangements. The recording quality of the tracks is superb, and while I was not thrilled with ALL the track selections, the important thing that Morricone fans will appreciate is that there are at least 4 rapsodic masterpieces. \\"On Earth As It Is in Heaven\\" is given the definitive treatment, and that annoying repetitive piano in the original of the Love Theme from \\"Cinema Paradiso\\" has wisely been excised by the Mastro in the new arrangement here.

So, it's clear that this guy knows his business.The trouble with Hysteria is that, in my opinion, the catchy songs featured here would still sell millions of copies if they were recorded with heart, not with total commercialism. As it was, this is a robotic album, devoid of any feelings in the approach to the songs, not the songs themselves.

The only thing that I would have liked included would have be the electric version of \\"Miss you In A Heartbeat.\\" It was a B side on one of the singles (off the top of my head I am forget which one). I suspect that it was not included because Miss You In A Heartbeat was a song on Retroactive but it was the accoustic version. Unfortuately, this was my favorite B side and it is not on this CD.

Listening to this album after listening to High 'N' Dry is like going from a steak and bar-b-que diet to eating sushi and broccolli. It just doesn't go over well. I might have to go and puke out the over-produced and over-thought out \\"licks\\" of this album. Perhaps if i had gotten this album before Pyromania then it might have gone over better. Thank goodness i bought Pyromania first! Pre-Hysteria Def Leppard rocks, sushi Leppard sucks. The songs on this album are just too slow, or sound \\"fake\\" per-say. Def Leppard must've been *Wasted* when they made this album."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the Best Rock Albums Ever!","review":"This is Def Leppard's best album by far and no mean feat considering the drummer only had one arm by this time! Every track is brilliant and every pain-staking detail was taken in the recording which means the sound quality is also very, very good for a 1987 disc. It's frightening how much better it'll sound once they get around to remastering this thing. Maybe in 2 years' time we'll get a 20th anniversary remastering/repackaging of this classic/masterpiece. This album represents Def Leppard at their prime and as far as the Commerock genre (for definition, see my Whitesnake \\"1987\\" review)goes, this is way, way on top of the list. Among my top 10 favourite albums of all time. Highly recommended!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Album","review":"I bought this album back when it came out in 1987.

I would highly recommend this CD to anyone who is a fan."},{"rating":"2","title":"Memories of Summer Camp!","review":"We played this album to death in summer camp. Man, we loved this cd.

A sure hit a at party! Enjoy Angie"},{"rating":"2","title":"The best album of the 80's","review":"Simply put, the best album of the 80's. Over 10 million copies sold and 7 hit singles. If you like power pop metal, then this is a must have in any one's collection. The song-writing strength of the group is at it's peak with all songs wrote by Clark/Collen/Elliott/Lange/Savage. Mutt Lange is one of the greatest producers of all time and this is simply a masterpiece. Most of the singles today are regulars on any classic rock radio station. There is no weak song or filler on the album."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best albums ever!","review":"This band developed into a great band in the 1980s. I think Hysteria was their peak performance. It marked the beginning of Def Leppard's amazing soft songs, but still kept the amazing hard sound too. An absolutly great cd. I like every song without a doubt. I cant listen to one song without listening to the rest!"},{"rating":"1","title":"This cd is OLD.","review":"Please save your money. Do not buy trash like this.

Mutt Lange's fingerprints are all over this as producer/writer. Contains a number of smaller hits not on \\"Vault\\", including \\"Women\\" and \\"Love and Affection\\". \\"Gods of War\\" is great anti-war album cut. Set the bar for pristine pop-metal(Even Lep couldn't match it). The \\"Thriller\\" of the genre(that is meant as a compliment). Who from the late 80s doesn't remember any of these tunes?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Hysteria - CD","review":"Everything about this transaction was good. The only down side is the song I was looking forward to the most doesn't play and will not rip. I've cleaned the disk, but no go. Everything else plays just fine tho."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hysteria","review":"Hysteria being Def Leppard's 1987 release and their 4th studio album is a prime example of 80's Hard Rock music. The booklet contains no lyrics but a list of whom plays what. The album was a massive commercial success when it was released and topped the charts on the Billboard 200, UK Top 40 and the Australian ARIA Albums Chart. To me this is not heavy metal but rock with metal elements to it being that I am used to listen to groups like Megadeath and Metallica. One could even say that it sounds a bit like glam rock or glam metal since it definitely has glam rock elements to it. Tracks that standout are \\"Love Bites\\", \\"Pour Some Sugare On Me\\" and \\"Armageddon It\\". The critics loved the recording and Allmusic and Rolling Stone both gave it high marks. 4/5."},{"rating":"2","title":"far from my favorite yet undeniable as a classic","review":"Hysteria isn't my favorite Def Leppard album (I rank Pyromania #1 and High N Dry #2) but it's impossible to deny the impact or popularity the band achieved with this release. There are a ton of great hit songs on here, and no Def Leppard collection should be without Hysteria. My favorite tracks include: Women, Rocket, Pour Some Sugar On Me, Hysteria, Armageddon It, and Love Bites."},{"rating":"1","title":"The sellout that shook the metal world","review":"Def Leppard started out churning out pretty respectable metal that skirted the pop edge of the genre. On Through The Night and High And Dry laid a solid foundation for the excellent Pyromania, and it's success on the pop charts apparently left a taste in the mouths of the Leps because that was obviously where they were headed with this lame followup. This was hands down the most awaited album and the biggest disappointment of the 80's for me. Pop metal I can stand, but if I want squealy girly metal, I'll listen to Poison or Vixen, maybe even Journey. The only Journey path that the Leps didn't follow on this was a tour bus video. Bad beyond belief."},{"rating":"1","title":"destroyed listed ike new","review":"purchased item because it was listed like new but when arrived the item was anything but!

To call this pop-metal is a slap in the face to anyone who likes the volume set on 11. Or 5. Plop-metal is more like it because it's the sound these turds make when they start the trip through the waste treatment system. No wonder Steve Clark drank himself to death. He probably couldn't stand to look at his sold-out face in the mirror."},{"rating":"1","title":"Go figure why...","review":"Def Leppard records their two first albuns, ON THROUGH THE NIGHT and HIGH 'N DRY. THe two of them are hard rock at its best. Then they release PYROMANI. Already utterly commercial, but still a sdtrong album. THen they hit the jackpot with the worst album so far, HYSTERIA. Go figure... An album filled with flat drumming, commercial production, sugary and awful ballads, the worst possible ingredients from hair-metal...."},{"rating":"1","title":"awful!","review":"i cannot describe how much i hate this album and this band! this is one of the most commercial albums ever made! this is for the girls only!"},{"rating":"1","title":"It has to be said","review":"When Pyromania came out it was a breath of fresh air. In fact, even today that album sounds great. However, I blame this album for great deal of the cheese factor of the 80's. I know that it sold more copies than the bible but it really was a disappointing follow up. It hasn't worn well with time, and while I can respect that some people love this album and its songs, I think it's fair for me to say that just hearing the phrase \\"Do you take sugar, one lump or two\\" gives me tremors.(This review was edited to give two stars. Some friends convinced me I wasn't being completely fair. It gets an extra star for meaning so much to so many, whether or not I \\"get it\\" or not.)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Lange = midas touch","review":"Producer Robert John Lange got the midas touch. Working with very different type of artists, he managed to produce three of the best selling albums of all time: AC/DC's Back in Black, Shania Twain's COME ON OVER and, on a lesser scale, Def Leppard's HYSTERIA and PYROMANIA. SO, the guy knows his craft, no doubt about that.But that does not mean that HYSTERIA is such a great album, no way! Much on the contrary, it marked the end of Leppard's \\"hard rock days\\", and tranformed them into a totally commercial outfit, full of ballads, cliched love lyrics, all fruit of an totally focused effort to appeal to MTV audience and girls.Also the sound production is terribly glossy, rounded, polished. The drums were the worst part of all (I'm not taking awaya the merits of drummer Rick Allen hard recovery after his accident. I'm talking about the highly reverbed drum sound, not the drummer's technique!)Is imply do not like this album.

With the help of the album's straight-out 80's rock vibes, sweet lyrics, catchy tunes, harmonious choruses, and solid grade-A rock ballads, Hysteria is commended as one of the greatest albums ever made. The album features Leppard's finest work: the monumentally popular Pour Some Sugar On Me, the hair-raising Rocket, the heartbreaking Love Bites, the spine-tingling Hysteria, the elusive Animal, and the awesome Women.The album will leave you with the impression that 80's hair bands weren't so dreadful after all, and Def Leppard are to be taken nothing less than seriously!RecommendedA"},{"rating":"2","title":"THE BEST THING THEY HAVE EVER DONE.....","review":"SAW THE CONCERT IN GOTHEMBORG AND WAS OVER MY HEAD OF JOY.

Even though some reviews mentioned it had a few cuts for the US exhibition, I bought it, and to my great disappointment I realized that, with the exception of the last sequences of Christians massacred at the Colisseum (an impressive display of realistic and wonderfully directed section of the film), the whole presentation was marred not only by big cuts but also by its unrestored images, which appear badly scratched and showing the film's age.However, it was great to see old-time French and Italian stars as Michele Morgan, Henri Vidal, Michel Simon and Gino Cervi.The experience was like acquiring an Old Masters painting discolored by neglect and carelessness."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fabiola","review":"Saw this movie years ago, happy I could see it again, wish it was in color, still enjoyed it as years ago!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Rip off!","review":"Now don't get me wrong, I an a HUGE Kansas fan.

In most cases, these songs are just live versions that are about the same length as the original studio versions.Beware of anything from BMG Special Products. It is almost always repackaged music with deceptive packaging, with the sole purpose of stealing your money. If they were honest, they would include notes about the source material so you knew what you were getting."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not that great","review":"My mother-in-law cracks on me every time I wear this hat!

It is in fact a compilation of performances, kind of like a 'best of' CD, except all of these performances are available on the other DVDs. There are a few from the Montreux DVD, the Live (1994) DVD, the In Concert 81 DVD, and the Greek Theatre DVD. Nothing new here.

The man's definitely not capable of singing only blues (as he himself likes to say). Sheer excellence!"},{"rating":"2","title":"ANOTHER WINNER","review":"One of EC's best albums, every track is great, especially with the awesome SHM.

I own the Canadian import but disliked the inferior sound and mix. When I purchased the reissue I was disappointed to find the guitar solo missing from \\"Tougher Than The Rest\\" and the preamble missing from \\"Chimes Of Freedom\\". However, the versions of \\"Be True\\" and \\"Born To Run\\" are excellent. I wish Columbia had chosen to release the full length version. Stick with the import."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buy the import","review":"The domestic version is the same as the CD3.

My younger sister introduced me to his music when she was a teenager. I had first heard from others, that his music was boring, trite and over done. I was listening to Mott the Hoople, Quicksilver and Humble Pie and I had it all going on. My friends did not care for Springsteen and still most of them do not.I saw him in concert in 1984 in Worcester, Ma and I cried almost all night..It was soooooooooooo wonderful. My sister and I, were hoarse for 3 days afterwards. Every song, he played for us. Every move, he made on stage..was for us.I have not seen him perform recently, but would if the chance came about.I love this album, I love all his albums. I love him with and without his band and with and without Patti.He is a great artist and a great musician. I want to thank Mr. Springsteen for being there when I needed him and my sister for making the whole thing possible, in the first place."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Boss Will Always Be The Boss!","review":"Chimes of Freedom is a great addition to any Springsteen fan's collection! The six plus minute version of \\"Tougher Than The Rest\\" is the real treat of the album, and the title track \\"Chimes of Freedom\\" is a great cover of the original Bob Dylan hit. Chimes of Freedom isn't just a free for all music album, it's classic Springsteen - reminding listeners of a bigger issue. Amnesty International and Human Rights Now! were to benefit from the release of this album. It's The Boss at his best - the album's worth every penny."},{"rating":"2","title":"Magnificent!","review":"Bruce offers up a magnificent and epic version of this Bob Dylan composition, obliterating any previous versions, including Bob's. A lot has been said about how amazing Bruce is live and this CD demonstrates this wonderfully. The live version of \\"Be True\\" far surpasses the studio version in \\"Tracks\\". Highly recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Avoid the Domestic version, get the Canadian Import","review":"I give this one star based solely on the fact that this transfer should have been complete. Instead, like the CD3, the guitar solo in \\"Tougher\\" and the intro in \\"Chimes\\" are missing. The Canadian import has no edits and the same cover art as the original EP (unlike the new US CD, which has a new pic of Bruce). Sure it costs a little more, but worth it. If you're a die hard like me, you'll probably buy them both anyway (like I did)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not Enough People Know This Record!","review":"This is an essential EP with acoustic version of Born To Run that brings a tear to my eye, an amazing cover of Dylan's Chimes of Freedom, a flat out sweet live version of Tougher than the Rest and a steal at under ... bucks.

A LOT of it.","review":"I've had this tape for a while and it's the bane of my existence. Every time I pull it out of my gear closet, it leaves residue where it was laying, just from the excess stickyness on the side of the tape.Don't bother with it. If you tape anything down with this, its going to leave a streak of glue when you pull it up. I picked up a roll of gaffers tape PRECISELY so this wouldn't happen."},{"rating":"2","title":"Magical Tape","review":"this stuff is great for around the house and for use on the set. wont damage delicate things you stick this tape to. glad i bought it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing - need to use scissors to cut it.","review":"As I DJ, I use gaffers tape to prevent people from tripping over my wires and to keep wires out of sight. This tape was functional, but it was very difficult to rip by hand and too sticky. It pulled off the roll laboriously. When I tried it rip it, the tape stuck together to other sticky parts and functioned nor looked good. I couldn't even cut this tape with my teeth. Very frustrating for something that SHOULD take a few seconds to execute.If you like carrying around a pair of scissors to cut your gaffe tape, then fine. However, I discontinued using it and bought a different brand that comes off the role smoothly and rips easily by hand."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gaff Tape Review","review":"So i got this gaff tape because it had good reviews and the reviewers said it was actually Gaff tape unlike some other products available. It is in fact gaff tape with a fabric mat black finish. It is a little cheaper quality wise then other gaff tape I've used and that is why i gave it 4 stars. It seams a tad thinner and the adhesive doesn't seem to stay on the fabric backing as long as it should. It is still quality tape and I wouldn't hesitate to use it on the XLR and DMX cables. I wouldn't keep it on the cables for longer then 10 days. Then a residue will most likely form. It's still a far better option then any other tape for stage work."},{"rating":"1","title":"A big dissappointment","review":"Here is the main point: the game has promising concepts but is poorly executed. The dialogue is mostly emotionally flat. The game was shipped with many bugs, including quiting when trying to finish the 5th major quest, the sound effects are so poorly done as to be annoying. There are balance issues as well, there is no happy median between parts which are too easy and others which are to hard. If they properly patch it and redo all the voice acting and sound effects and the many bugs, then it might be a decent game (in the 3 star range)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not Deep but Enjoyable","review":"Well, this game is not what you would call real deep though the plot has good details. Most of the other reviews have addressed the issues of the product both good and bad in one way or another. I would only add the following points:1) I enjoyed the game enough to want to finish it and that says something in today's game market where only about one in ten games is actually worth playing.2) I passed the game on to my eighteen year old grand daughter. She thinks it is the greatest thing since sliced bread. Then again, she has been game starved for the last year or so and is just comming out of that GOTH phase.3) Because it is a 2006 game, just about any PC people own will play it today, including those 300$ laptops people are snapping up so no issues with minimum requirements for this one.We all know there is down time while we wait for the next game on our list of desires. In this period we look for something to fill the void. This is a good choice for that.Hail Flavius!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Crash","review":"This is a middling role-playing game. The plot was OK and it was holding my interest. The game ran too slow on my 3-year old XP machine. It ran OK on my new Vista machine, but got buggier as I got further into the game. I finally had to give up, because the final quest crashed both computers. There are better games out there."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hope they stop at 3-not a 4th sequel, please!!!!","review":"This movie is a complete waste of time --bad acting, very predictable plot-The original Wild Things was pretty good and it went downhill from there. If you just like to look at hot babes then you might be able to sit thru it-but the babes in here are really stupid-they act stupid and the script is pretty lame. Does this really happen? A real waste of 90 minutes--avoid it except if you turn the sound off and look at the chicks."},{"rating":"2","title":"You Make My Heart Sing!","review":"WILD THINGS (the original) is the best film in this set; the film has a real cult following, with its twisted plotline and humid sexuality. The menage a trois featuring Neve Campbell and Denise Richards in a blue swimsuit has attained the same cinematic immortality as Sharon Stone's scene in BASIC INSTINCT where she crosses and uncrosses her legs, sans panties. Time for a cold shower!The rest of the WILD THINGS movies are direct-to-DVD releases that copy the original but never match it. Still, they are very much worth watching if you're in the mood for some titillatingly mindless time in front of the TV eating popcorn and wishing you were there."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pornography","review":"This is a pretty bad movie. The acting is mediocre, the plot is recycled from Wild Things 1 and 2 (as previous reviewers mentioned). The only thing this movie is good for is a lonely night when your only companion is a tube of KY Jelly. After the initial threesome, the only thing the two starlets seem to do is make out, including an additional topless make-out scene after during the end credits.Also, the way the doctor talks about himself in the third person is hilarious. Seriously. If you don't have a case of serious blue-balls, but want a good laugh, rent this movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"hardly worth one scene","review":"a boxed set with 3 discs in slim cases. the first movie is unrated and the other two are \\"r\\" ratings. the first movie is relatively clever with the one menage a trois scene, which is good. it also had a theatrical release. the other two movies follow the same plot, and same one menage a trois scene done worse and worse. seeing three movies milk one scene isn't worth the price of the discs. if you're into seductive type movies, check out the \\"poison ivy\\" series. they have much more to offer."},{"rating":"2","title":"1st was the best.","review":"The 1st Wild Things movie was the best of all 4 of them, the other 3 are pretty much copycats of the original.

I was just curious so I rented it one night and I thought the acting was just bad enough. I fell asleep though this one just like wild things 2. Don't waist your time!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Such incredible descriptions","review":"Ok, ok, I have read the rest of the reviews of this book and will admit that it is not the fastest-moving book out there. But come on, folks, has there been a better book in recent past as far as its ability to actually transport the reader into the story? Not in my mind. The sense of what was coming was palpable, and the efforts and struggles of the Aquarius in the face of so many difficulties were so realistic. I could smell the sulfur, feel the heat, the dust, the dirt. I could see the characters in each scene. I only felt that the book lost a bit of steam when the volcano erupted (no pun intended). I felt that the escape efforts actually dragged on a bit. But just a bit.One of the best books I have read in some time. It takes some work to get through it, but is is well worth the effort."},{"rating":"2","title":"awesome reading","review":"This is an excellent book. Very factual, but easy reading. On the edge of your seat kind of book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Recommended for lovers of water, volcanoes, or the Roman Empire","review":"'Pompeii' is a highly readable historical mystery set in Roman Pompeii in 79 C.E. just before the 'you know what' happens. Robert Harris has an eye for historical detail and can spin a good yarn. The reader of Pompeii learns a bit about Roman aqueducts, the Roman empire and, of course, volcanoes.The protagonist, Marcus Attilius Primus, is the new 'aquarius' sent out from Rome to take over the care and maintenance of the Aqua Augusta, the immense aqueduct that served the Bay of Naples area. Figure out just what did happen to the former aquarius, why the water has dried up, and how did a former slave become the (apparently) richest, most powerful man in Pompeii. Meet Pliny the Elder along the way.A fun read. Highly recommended for lovers of water, volcanoes, and the Roman Empire."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointing considering","review":"The book started out okay, but went down hill from there. I don't think characters and plot lines were developed as well as they could have been. Very disappointing considering how interesting the subject matter is. I found my mind wandering countless times while reading the book. It almost became a chore to pick it up where I left off. I just felt like something was missing throughout the read. I definitely do not recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"A bland writing style hampers a fine tale","review":"From the pedestrian dialogue to the adequate prose, Harris attaches lots of research. But there's a reason he opens each chapter with quotes from texts on volcanoes. He's too inadequate an author to incorporate this material into the actual text. No Leon Uris he! All the characters are cardboard with the possible exception of Pliny, but Pliny's views as expressed here on sexuality do not seem bona fide. Additionally, the hero's behavior and thoughts are inconsistent. A better writer would have used this book as an outline for a much richer work. The basics are here, but little else. Don't be surprised to find yourself skimming towards the end."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Hollywood B Movie","review":"Pompeii was the first Harris novel I have read. I had looked forward to it based on some reviews only to be disappointed. He did a fine job with the historical and scientific material, but his plot was no better than the plots of Hollywood B movies of the 1940's and 50's. The central character, the young aqueduct engineer, was able to go without sleep or food for three days and survive the fantastic forces of the eruption of Vesuvius - more than once! Moreover, the moral stance of the novel is that it really did not matter what happened to all the other people in the path of the eruption - not just vile former slave now rich and manipulative land owner - as long as the young engineer rescued the young woman he met briefly just two days before the catastrophe. I think Harris really knows what are the geophysical consequences of a volcanic eruption, but not the human, and that is a serious fault as his central theme is the human response to the eruption."},{"rating":"1","title":"Drama & disaster dulled","review":"How is it possible for an author to take one of the most dramatic and destructive natural disasters in Western History and render it so flat and lifeless? One-dimensional characters are the problem. Harris's people have no personalities and no nuance; they wander through a book that has the formal tone and stilted style of '50s gladiator movies. The only way to read this book is on fast-forward. Or better, wait for the movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"My favourite Robert Harris book","review":"A very enjoyable historical fiction book that takes you back in time and creates an interesting sideline plot in the last days of Pompeii."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Read, Pedants Aside","review":"This is a good read though from the start you know the ending. Personally, I don't care whether Corelia should be called Ampliatria or Lady Gaga for that matter. The book is very enjoyable"},{"rating":"2","title":"Got me very interested in Pompeii","review":"After completing the book, I was inspired to learn even more about Pompeii even though I've visited there! There's a plethora of fabulous books at Amazon. Wish I'd read this one before I went. I am really thrilled to know that Roman Polanski is now making the movie version of it.The aqueduct system detail-upon-detail was of less interest to me, and I found myself skimming through some of it, but with the inspiration to read more on life in Pompeii, this book is close to the top of my reading list this year."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another Good Read From Robert Harris","review":"Though I actually preferred his earlier novels this was still quite good. His research into the Last Days of Pompeii and the workings of volcanic eruptions was quite extensive. His key characters were nicely developed. The book kept my attention."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not much of interest.","review":"I read this in part because of the favorable reviews and after finishing the book I have to wonder what the favorable reviewers read. The book is composed of two or three barely related stories. The first is about a young roman water way specialist as he works to restore water to a town. The second and least important story is how the young engineer developes affection toward the daughter of a villain, and the third involves the destruction of Pompeii as a result of Mt Vesuvius's eruption.None of the stories was especially engaging and I could have set the book aside at any time as the story and it's ending were completely predictable."},{"rating":"2","title":"New twist on last days!","review":"Captivating. I was unable to stop reading until I completed the novel. I regretted having reached the end. Looking forward to reading more from Robert Harris."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good read","review":"Harris did an excellent job of merging historical fact around fictional characters and events, all set within the larger and all too real volanic eruption.The author has a very good writing style that I found very easy to \\"plug\\" into and was taken away by the story.This is a good page turner and anyone interested in Pompeii will find it an enjoyable read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Entertaining and Historically Accurate","review":"If you're like me, you've been fascinated with Pompeii since you were a child. Who doesn't remember staring at pictures of the plaster casts of the people who met their demise during the eruption?This book brings back all of the facts and more to the forefront. It tells the story of Vesuvius and the surrounding historical characters from the viewpoint of the Aqueduct Engineer. Harris includes interesting tidbits concerning the appetitites (horrific food), depravities and other social aspects of Pompeii.If you've ever wondered what the ancient Roman's were really like; I'd definitely recommend this exciting, and quick read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pompeii","review":"Great story line, based on extensive research on the history of the era and of Pompeii and the bay of naples.

I gave up!","review":"Being an Italian who loves the Roman empire, I was quite excited on Pompeii and I bought it on the very first day. Unfortunately the book is boring boring and boring. Honestly, I gave up reading after 200 pages.... Though I am not used at, why waste your time on an unlikely love affair set in a corrupted Roman town? Just read Italian newspapers to find more actual love affairs in an even more corrupted Italian economy...."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too dry.","review":"I liked the way it starts out painting a picture of Ancient Rome that is visually. But the characters soon turned dry.Especially because the main voice was a an Architect who had a very modern feel to him.Much like Michael Chricton's \\"Eaters of the dead,\\" It lacked an Ancient point of view."},{"rating":"1","title":"pompei","review":"Pompei, by Robert Harris, is terrible. It is written in a childish style like you used to get in the Weekly Reader in third grade. The plot is lighter that pumice. Do you think our hero, Attilius, will live through the eruption, go back to Pompei and find the girl? Do you think Exomnius was on the take and Ampliatus is behind it all? As soon as you meet these characters it is clear what is going to happen the writing is so bad. I was hoping that our hero would have to solve some intricate math in roman numerals, like in the Da Vinci Code, to add some interest. Don't buy this in hard cover, wait for the comic book. Even Russell Crowe would turn down this movie, the plot it is so dumb."},{"rating":"1","title":"Did I miss something?","review":"I've read many books, in all genres, but I can only remember a few which made me throw the story aside half way through. The story set up far too many scenes dealing with nudity, homosexuality, and sexual fantasy. I thought the story was about a very entertaining aquarius and his quest to get the water running again in Pompeii. This story was too much for me, and I would never suggest this novel to anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good historical novel on a fascinating subject","review":"\\"Pompeii\\" by Robert Harris is a fictional account of the four days leading up to the erution of Vesuvius in 79 A.D. that buried the city of Pompeii and killed many people. This is a fast-paced, easy-to-read novel, and I found it very interesting and entertaining. The description of the eruption in itself makes the book worth reading. I think this book would make a terrific movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"a little disappointing","review":"Unfortunately, the book neither gives adequate information about the life of the people at the time, nor is the information about the Roman aqueducts really coherent. So, itb seems to me,this book is neither fish nor fowl.It is simply very superficial!It is still interesting and easy reading, only, after you've finished, you do not really know, why you read it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just one word...","review":"I chose this book for a book review for my humanities class. The absolute BEST review I can give it is exceedingly tedious. It was a monstrous waste of my time and effort."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dull","review":"I read \\"Fatherland\\" and liked it. Terrific premise--that Hitler had not lost WWII--and reasonably well-made characters.Then I read \\"Enigma\\" and hated it. I kept expecting it to get better. It never did. Unlike \\"Fatherland,\\" \\"Enigma\\" merely stuck to facts--the breaking of the German code in WWII. The characters were lifeless and the plot a snore.\\"Pompeii\\" is more like \\"Enigma\\"--no messing with actual history; just a fictional rendition of it.And it is equally dull. I teach Latin, so I know the history and the details. The fictional characters are one-dimensional at best; more like zero-dimensional. They are predictable and uninteresting. And the plot, of course, is known beforehand. The romance has no sparks.If you want to learn some history, this book will teach you. But as a novel it is dry, dry, dry."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not very good.","review":"I enjoyed Harris' \\"Fatherland\\", but I'm afraid I can't recommend \\"Pompeii\\". The plot was linear and predictable and the one-dimensional characters were just not very interesting. For a historical novel I expected more insights into Roman thought and culture, but those aspects of the book were pretty superficial.It's not a horrible book, but it's just fluff. Fuff with a touch of history, but fluff nonetheless. I expected better."},{"rating":"1","title":"it sucks the life out of the doomed city Pompeii","review":"its ok, but it gives you to much information to soon, i mean the city of Pompeii is thrilling and so is teh thought of how the people must have felt about it, but this information filled book sucked teh life out of the doomed city, personally i think he could have done much better and his past books support that. I wish he couldve made some of the information just disapear then maybe it couldve made a better turn-out. I was throughly disapointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Simple plot, simple book","review":"I cannot say I liked this book. It had its moments, but they were few and far between. Basically the plot is about an Aquarius(A guy who manges the aqueducts of Rome) and a Volcano with a little romance mixed in. Very boring indeed.Premise: The entire story is about the aquarius and his quest to go to Pompeii to fix the aqueduct. Along the way he makes enemies, you don't really know why. He meets a girl, who he likes, but she comes and goes in passing. You meet one really bad guy, but he doesn't come across as really that bad. The main character instead comes off as a panzy woose.There is poor writing and very poor characterization. Each character is briefly described if at all. The ending comes off very fast, and not properly dealt with. In the last 1/8 of the book the mountain explodes, a round about rescue is performed, the bad guys dies and the girl rescued, the end.Avoid this book if possible."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ancient Rome Rocks!","review":"I loved this book for so many different reasons. The history is rich and detailed. I feel like I'm right there with the characters and Ancient Rome is so interesting. Then throw in the volcano and the action really revs up. Anyone interested in Ancient Rome should read this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Fast and Fun Read for Ancient History Fans","review":"I read this one in one night and enjoyed it greatly. There's an action packed plot--politics, greed, and a lovely romance all move it right along plus there is lots of accurate historical detail regarding the eruption of Vesuvius. The author puts you right in the thick of it in the days leading up to the eruption. The reader knows what is coming but the characters in the novel don't....very exciting--fast paced and an absorbing read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Vesuvius","review":"I had to read this for my class and I ended up liking it. The book is historically accurate for the most part and the story is engaging for the reader. The main character is very human and easy to identify with. He has a background that isn't over done.The story really picks up in the last hundred pages!"},{"rating":"2","title":"If You Love Historical Fiction and Thrillers","review":"If you love history, thrillers, human drama, this is a very good book. The research is impeccable, the action very strong, the characters interesting. I read voraciously and just finished Pompeii; Isaac's Storm, about the Galveston hurricane in 1900 (excellent); and James Dalessandro's 1906, about the great San Francisco Earthquake, which I discovered after reading a review on Bookideas.com.

I opted for the audio CD so we could listen to the story while in the car.Often, my mind wanders when listening to audio books. However, that wasn't true for this audio book. The story of this historic trip, as well as the narration by various individuals, has retained both my interest and attention.I would recommend that anyone not familiar with the means of travel at that time and road conditions, become familiar with it before beginning with the audio CD...

This is one classic cd reissue, of Reed's finest lp. This cd is full of energetic and upbeat tunes, and the pace never deidles down, a real rocker of a blues cd. As usual Reed is in fine voice, and plays harp and electrifyingly wild guitar!

This album is representative of the brilliant lyricism of Costello. It includes both poppy upbeat songs like \\"Everyday I Write the Book\\" and also throws in a little bit of that angry young man in songs like \\"I Want You\\". The Best of Elvis Costello will leave you hungry for more."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good starter CD","review":"Unlike some of the previous reviewers, I can't comment on how accurately this reflects the Costello canon; I'm only 20 and I was hardly musically conscious when these songs were originally released. I got interested in Costello because one of my favorite songs on Aimee Mann's \\"Bachelor No. 2\\" was co-written with Costello; the song is called \\"The Fall of the World's Own Optimist\\" and also because I heard this CD playing in a friend's place. In my novice opinion, this is a good starter for young beginning Costello fans like me. I knew a couple of the songs before; there were a few more I recognized but hadn't previously realized were by Costello; and the rest were good discoveries. My only gripes are not with the music; I just wish there was more in the liner notes than pictures. Well, maybe I'll spring for the import version some day..."},{"rating":"2","title":"It is the best album ever made.","review":"All of the songs are masterpieces.

I rate it \\"1\\" star only to get your attention here before making a hasty decision! It is still quite good of course. The better collection is available at Amazon as an import (see below) and is called \\"Girls, Girls, Girls\\" on Columbia. It consists of 2 CD's containing 50 tracks hand-picked (with comments) by Elvis himself. The only \\"hits\\" missing are \\"You're Not the Only Flame\\" and \\"Peace, Love, & Understanding.\\" For 20 bucks you're gonna get the artists' pick of his best material. It's not chronological and is sequenced quite nicely. Elvis' liner notes are insightful and funny.

I really do like every track on the CD, and they collectively give the listener a really great, but not perfect, look at the first ten years of Costello's music career. There are definitely some better collections of his early works out there, but you can only represent any one album so much on a single CD that represents 10 albums.Overall, this is an excellent collection, but I think it would helpful to maybe listen to a greater variety of Costello's songs on YouTube or the equivalent, and decide whether you want to buy this album, buy a more extensive collection, or download a variety of individual tracks to make your own Elvis Costello collection. The last option is what I myself ended up doing."},{"rating":"2","title":"MISSING EXTENDED \\" I CAN'T HELP IT\\"","review":"There was an extended version of \\"I Can't Help It\\" out back in late 1987-mid 1988 but this cd doesn't include it and instead has extended remixes that weren't heard.These girls were the best dance artists of the 1980s and made great music."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow id Right.","review":"This is a really great album.

These history telling monologues inform and reinform the reader about the mores, foibles and existence of this \\"elite\\" group of African-Americans as if their existence were a revelation. It was repetitious and preachy and the characters tended to speak as if they were clones of the author. The Pride was also incrediably slow-moving because it lacked sufficient interaction and believable dialogue between the characters. Thus, what I recall and detest about the characters is that they all graduated from Dartmouth, Harvard or Mount Holyoke ? ( are these the author's favorite best ? colleges) and use adjectives such as \\"knucklehead\\" or \\"chucklehead\\" repetitively to describe foolish acquaintances. How quaint ! I struggled to complete this novel, and by the time I did, I cared not at all about the outcome of the so -called plot."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful!","review":"I did not enjoy \\"The Pride\\" at all.

National Geographic chose to contrast the British monarchy with a set of third world monarchies (Uganda, Nepal and Tonga I think) in what seems to be a deliberate attempt to further belittle Queen Elizabeth, the British people who like the monarchy, and building up an idea that republicanism is rampant in the UK when in fact it hovers in the 20% range for years.

It is unfortunate that many people often misunderstand Edwards sermon. His sermon is often used by some to criticize God as angry because His Law is broken.

I had tried most other protein bars and they did not measure up to Met-Rx.After shipping, etc., the price comes out to about $2.67 per bar. That certainly beats the $4 - $5 at a store.One thing to watch out for: occasionally I receive the box and all of the bars have been exposed to heat and have melted inside their wrappers. They are warped and turn to some crystallized goo. I am assuming that the shipped has let my package get exposed to too much sun/heat. Each time it happened, though, Amazon replaced the box.

You can get that from these, but don't expect great taste. If the whole bar was covered like it was supposed to be, then these would be great.

I found the book at my local library in the teen section. The story is creative and interesting but the editor did a very poor job on this book. It was really more annoying to read than anything because I felt like I should be editing the book as I read. There were long, over descriptive sentances that I had to go back and read over again to understand. There were even sentances in the book that made no sense at all; Just a bunch of words put together.

It is worthwhile to go back to the series if you have not read the novels, or maybe to read them again to visit old favorites. The best-buy is probably to buy the sets unless you are a serious collector.

If you want good noir, see, Hammett or Chandler (both pof the Macdonalds are great too).

It was every bit as lurid as advertised, but is generally a very close cousin to Raymond Chandler's Marlowe novels in character and tone, though the plotting is much less convoluted and we don't get quite as entangled with secondary characters or setting. Spillane emphasizes Mike Hammer's incredible toughness and verility on every page, with all the usual gumshoe vernacular, and as with the best detective novels, character counts more than crime. That's a polite way of saying I figured this one out pretty early, despite trying hard not to, and it didn't diminish the reading experience at all.Spillane has the last laugh on his critics- this is good stuff."},{"rating":"1","title":"Maybe Marriage Isn't for Everyone","review":"Mandi Norwood is an angry woman. Through the lens of resolute feminism, Norwood presents a venomously skewed scenario of modern marriage and relationships. Blatantly anti-establishment, she balks at traditions such as taking one's husband's name, nurturing and caring for one's family, and taking on the responsibility of creating a healthy home environment.

The result is a collection of tunes far removed by the most extreme complexity of the \\"scene\\", yet entirely immersed in its typical serenity and humour. Richard Sinclair plays bass and some guitar, Hugh Hopper bass and keyboards. Recommended once you already possess the other Canterbury milestones."},{"rating":"2","title":"Unknown, but upbeat and good to go!","review":"I'm a Beehive fan, so my view is a little biased, though not as much as the other reviewers I've read here. I wouldn't rate them as a classic or an all-time great, but I agree with the sentiment of the other reviewers. If you want a band that gives you a really alive, fresh feeling when you listen to their music, Voice of the Beehive will do it. They play music that mainstream listeners like, but it's just that little bit different from everything else on the shelf that it will keep you coming back to its originality. They are fresh, with a humorously cynical view on life. If 'I Walk the Earth' and 'Trust Me' were given the airplay they deserve they would have gone top ten. It may seem like a risk because you've never heard of them before, but if you buy this album, or 'Honey Lingers' (I haven't been able to listen to their third album yet) you won't be dissapointed. Fresh and vibrant and new to the senses."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Well-Considered Five Stars","review":"I'll chip in my five stars for this album. As noted by a bunch of reviewers, every song in this collection is strong, catchy, sharp, bouncy, and fun. You know you're listening to good songwriting when you're grooving along with the song, feeling great, and the chorus kicks in and elevates it to a whole other level of great. Nearly every track boasts this sort of turbo chorus. I'll make another point in favor of the fiercely feminine point of view that is still able to see both sides of the world. Disappointingly, none of Voice's later releases approaches the vitality and catchiness of this one.

I would certainly not recommend it for teens and younger people. It's very confusing dialect and the story has no plot at all. In fact, if you read the preface by the author, he actually says that the book is pointless. Heres what I mean. In one chapter, the chacters sat by the side of the road ALL DAY. Well good for them, but nobody wants to read 39 pages about it. Everyone that I have talked to about this book have all dispised it for it's lack of..well...anything. In fact, I had to sit and force myself to read a chapter. When the author ends every word with a \\"th\\" it makes it very hard to understand what is going on.

Though it has been made into videos & books for juveniles, it is actually a subtle adult piece of literature. It was Kipling who coined therein the phrase:\\"The Great Game\\". History repeats itself, as now America has replaced England in this spider web set in India & the high mountain passes leading to Central Asia. As always, Kipling helps us to stand back & laugh at our human foibles, while yet being dead serious.Had I the funds, I would have preferred a better quality edition, as I plan to keep this for re-reading. This is a cheap edition, with print too close to the inner margins --- very stiff & annoying to hold open."},{"rating":"2","title":"The colourful novel of a journey and a quest","review":"Throughout this novel, one senses that R. Kipling was a loyal British subject though he was born in Inda. He believed in the imperial authority of his queen and country and his defence of the British rule in India gave rise to controversy at the end of the 18th century. Interestingly enough, as one progresses through \\"Kim\\", one feels the author's passion for his beloved India, a country he nevertheless believed should be ruled by white men since, in his view, they are superior. In fact natives are routinely depicted as inferiors but Kipling's racial stereotyping was not outrageous more than a hundred years ago.Like Mowgli in \\"The Jungle Book\\", Kimball O'Hara in \\"Kim\\" is a self-reliant and resourceful boy called \\"little friend of the world\\" and the author perhaps equates the brutal indignities he suffered in his boyhood with the humiliations inflicted upon the natives of India."},{"rating":"2","title":"a kipling classic","review":"This is billed as one of Kiplings greatest short stories, and I must agree, Kim (little friend of all the world.) is for me a great story and as I am also a Freemason and a member of the Kipling society.

James leaves the readers fully satisfied. Recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Death by fire","review":"I neglected to add the following to my previous review. The author would have the reader believe that the murderer simply poured gasoline on the victim then disposed of the gasoline can, lit a match, all while the victim stayed still waiting his fate.

Would not the victim at the very least moved or gotten out of the vehicle since he would not have died instantly?I fould it hard to enjoy this book based on a false premise."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not one of the better books","review":"I was very disappointed in this book.

She almost immediately recognizes the voice of the person speaking as the one who hit her.I presume the editor caught this and other unbelieable incidents, but it would have perhaps been difficult to make changes (after all James is 85) and still make the publishing deadline. In fact I would go so far as to say there could not have been a book if incidents such as the above were eliminated.This is probably James' last Dalgliesh book."},{"rating":"2","title":"MORE THAN A MYSTERY NOVEL","review":"The writing of P.D. James is very fine and has a depth & maturity that few other mystery writers have. It is thoughtful and measured but highly suspenseful at the same time. It has that \\" interiorness\\" that sense of place that has always been a hallmark of good English writing. There are also subtle criticisms of modern English society ( and Western society as a whole) and its increasing lack of morality. This is a novel that comes from the pen of a believer (refreshing in itself). The quality and depth of this latest James offering is in sharp contrast to the action oriented American mystery - even the very best American mystery writers don't hold a candle to the great English ladies of mystery - James. Rendell, Christie, Ngaio Marsh, Marjorie Allingham, Dorothy Sayers....I loved this book and couln't put it down. I hope she has another one in the works."},{"rating":"2","title":"James has a winner","review":"which from me, says a lot, because my opinions of her books vary greatly. This book happened to follow another favorite of mine, Death in Holy Orders. She's on a roll. After the first 100 pages nobody had been murdered. I didn't care, I was so interested in the characters by then I wanted to see what happened to them. The setting for the murders and the suggestions of them being copycat crimes of killings during the 1920s and 1930s should arouse sufficiently creepy feelings. The later developments as to what is going on behind the scenes at the museum were great. A very stimulating read. What remains to be seen is how Dalgliesh and Emma make it as a couple. This is definitely in the top third of James's books for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"BORING","review":"I always finish a book and I tried very hard to stick with this one. But half way through it, I realized that I was wasting precious time so I gave up on it. There are just too many descriptive paragraphs that add nothing to the story or the characters.

Don't waste your money or time with this one..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Been There, Done That","review":"The usual detail on room decoration, depressed characters and dysfunctional families, without an inspired or original plot to support them. The crimes themselves, despite some attractive trappings, turn out to be flat and dull, while also implausible--a problem in a \\"realistic\\" crime novel. The characters mostly are the same stuffy, wealthy, well-spoken elitists we've seen before, too many times now, with the usual wrangle taking place over the attempted closing of some august and architecturally distinguished building. Dalgleish fans I guess are happy to see him romancing Emma, the only problem here is we don't see much in the way of romance. Their romance lacks any of the charm and appeal of the classic romances in James' much admired Crime Queen trio of Sayers, Allingham and Marsh. It's a shame, because one can tell from her personal appearances and interviews that James is a charming, amusing woman. Too bad she snuffs out these qualities in her books."},{"rating":"2","title":"Golden Age classic w/ superfluous bridge","review":"After reading Tau Zero years ago, Poul Anderson became one of my favorite sci-fi authors.

Hesitant earth lets a colony fall to conniving aliens. The main character Heim says, \\"Oh oh... hell no! Not while I'm alive! I'm gonna go mess 'em up.\\" And does so. Chapters 1 and 3 are pretty much part of a linear story and would have been a 5-star read if it hadn't been for the second chapter, which is out of place.

The pumping mechanism slips sometimes, so the handle sinks back into the top without gaining momentum... and the plastic tip on the bottom is too wide or slick or something... This is not a quality item - it is cheaply made and is barely functional. It doesn't have the heft of an old top, doesn't balance properly, and doesn't work right. On the bottom of the toy, on a little paper label, it says \\"Made in China\\".I really want an old fashioned top for my kids to play with!

The book features two boys, both of whom are handicapped in different ways, who formed a \\"unit,\\" Freak the Mighty, based on a deep bond of mutual needs. The writer of the screen version, Charles Leavitt, completely misses the point of the novel. He obviously did not understand the significance of how a great need finally met can form a strong relationship based on trust--\\"you are there for me and I am there for you. Together we can discover and embrace the world.\\" The movie had to make up hackneyed conflict scenes that were not in the story and not necessary to tell a good story. In fact, they spoiled it. Philbrick wrote an excellent book. I fervently wish Hollywood hadn't ruined it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Everyone Needs to Read this book!","review":"The first time I read this book, I laughed, cried, and felt every emotion possible.

Even more pleasing is the fact that so many of the reviewers admit to having read the book. But for the last six months I've been waiting for the other shoe to drop: no moive, or book for that matter, appeals to everyone. Surely there was some poor, shriveled soul out there who hated 'The Mighty'? Finally 'David from Seattle' described at length how much he despised the movie. Thanks, David, for ending the suspense.

The book touched my soul deeply, but this was just plain bad. Max and Freak did not look or act like I would have imagined, nor did they have the true feelings you could sense from the book. Also, the movie missed many huge points that the was in the book which were crutial to understanding the plot and how close they were. I was very disappointed by the performance of the all star cast with Gillian Anderson, Sharon Stone, and o couple other people.

Here we have another 'strong friendship between two outcasts and one of them dies' movies, which I believe is a difficult genre to do well. The problem is that the friendship doesn't start until after the movie begins, and 2 hours (or however long it was) is too short to develop that. If you want to see a movie with the same general idea that is done well, rent 'Simon Birch.' One reason it does well, aside from its strong story line, is that the friendship is already established and the viewers can get on with the events of the plot. Acting was decent at best in the movie. Many times it looked prefabricated, such as the sewer scene and the ambulance scene. And the knight motif got real old, real fast. There's plenty of other movies worth your dollars out there-don't waste them on this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your time !!!!","review":"This movie is horrible. The emphasis here is on horrible. You'll catch yourself rolling your eyes as the ... imagines he is in Camelot. Can someone please tell this kid to get a life? Real children do not act this way. This movie lacks drama and creativity in place of blunt realism. Its not a movie that picks you up and makes you dream. Rather this movie makes you think the world ... You'll question why someone would make such a film. Pretty much all of the characters are seedy and trashy. Watch this movie if you would like to know what takes place in the lives of trashy people. For inspriration and beauty into the better things of life look at my favorite movies Shakespeare in Love and Gone With the Wind. And if you really want some blunt realism at least watch a quality film like Good Will Hunting. Moral of the story, DONT WATCH THIS MOVIE!!!.

I have to say this is one of the few \\"Drama\\" movies I can watch over and over again. The ending had almost all my friends in tears. This is such a good family movie. It really makes you think about what you have and others do not. It also makes you realise even if you get called a \\"freak\\" or you have a disabillity, physical or mentally, it doesnt mean you cant get out in the world and have fun. Both Max and Kevin had problems but that didnt stop them from going out on their quests and having fun. This movie will move you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pure joy to watch!","review":"This is a story about all souls, lives and beyond.I bought this because I am Gillian Anderson's big fan from, of course, the X-Files, but it was far beyond my expectation.Gillian Anderson is real surprise, and the rest of the cast are all fantastic.Excellent film!

Kevin {freak} did a really good job acting for his disability, because we all believed he was disabled. Max did a really good acting for his learning disability. Plus he is really large and he has the physical features for the part. They both had a really good relationship with each other even when people are teasing them. We loved the action especially when Max's dad was in the room, that really scared us. Our favorite was when Max's window was open, and Max closes his eyes and then opened them, and his dad was there.

Kevin was a teenager with strong physical disabilities but a very strong mind. He is able to help Max overcome his learning disability through immagination and creativity.

This film is the only drama that didn't make me cry, because everything that happened was expected. Sharon Stone who plays Gwen Dillon (kevin's mother) did a fine job with her part. Gillian Anderson (scully from the X-FILES) fit her part very well as an ex-cauns girlfriend, who gives max a helping hand. My favorite quote from this movie was said by Stone \\"Congratulations, you must be proud. You've just given birth to a healthy seven pound dictionary.\\" I think this movie is much like \\"Simon Birch\\". Both Simon & Kevin were born with birth defects, and both found one very special friend who was always there for them. I think this movie was very good and so was the book.

They become friends and form the mighty which is that Max puts Kevin on his shoulders so that Kevin doesn't need his crutches. Max describes it as, \\"It was like at that moment he became my brian and I became his feet.\\" They bring justice and help people out with struggles.

The drastic drop in quality from the brilliant, affecting \\"Honky Chateau\\" LP makes it clear, in retrospect, that this is where Elton made the tacky transition from \\"Artist\\" to \\"Entertainer\\". Sure, \\"Daniel\\" still sounds great; but \\"Have Mercy on the Criminal\\" is just horrid, and \\"Midnight Creeper\\" is quite possibly the most embarrassing Rolling Stones imitation of all-time.

A cohesive, youthful, expertly arranged collection of delightful pop, this recording is the first that purposely added the glamour, outrageousness, and pure showmanship that defines the 70s, platform-shoe Elton we all remember with fondness. Besides the delectable retro-pop of Crocodile Rock and the opaque melancholy of Daniel (the hits), this record also features the gorgeous, spirited and dramatic Blues For Baby and Me; High Flying Bird, which is heartbreaking, and Teacher I Need You, a serio-comic adolescent fantasy. Paul Buckmaster's stirring strings add much to the arrangements, which are like confections made for your ears, and Elton's confident vocals soar over them."},{"rating":"2","title":"A CD you'll want to listen to over and over.","review":"This may be Elton John's finest - certainly Honky Chateau, Goodbye Yellow Brick Road, and this one are his best.

While bass and drums remain in the background of this excellent CD, Brown and Thigpen were great players, and add a lot to the success of this effort. The opener, \\"Green Dolphin Street\\" is relaxed, but \\"Heartstrings\\" and \\"Work Song\\" jump. Then comes the wonderful, almost eight-minute take on \\"John Brown's Body\\" that soars. The final two cuts, \\"A Wonderful Guy\\" and \\"Reunion Blues\\" are also superb. Milt and Oscar, of course, went on to do great work up to the mid-90's, but they were already old pros 41 years ago.

Lenin assigns above all a class role to the State, and therefore ascertains correctly the necessity of a socialist state assuming a proletarian viewpoint. At the same time, Lenin's socialist state lacks a truly political dimension, as it remains, above all, a means for strictly administrative decision-making. Something that would gravely hamper the subsequent understanding of the political character of a future socialist state, specially when you think that this book was written while Lenin hid from the Kerensky government, that's to say just before the October Revolution. Neverthless, the problems put by the book have enormous present value. Therefore it must be taken as entirely questionable the decision to choose as translator an anti-communist like Service, something that would be quite like choosing a neo-stalinist to translate Trotsky's \\"Revolution Betrayed\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Top-Shelf Marxist Literature","review":"What is the state?

That is not always a given with Marxist literature.If you have read Marx and Engels or even just some introduction material on Marxism, this book might help you fill in the gaps around the role of the state, which is always a tricky subject when facing a population fixated on Stalin.If you, like me, always seem to find yourself in debates with anarchists, this book will help you understand the subtleties of the Anarchist vs. Marxist rift.

Nichole has probably got to be one of my favorite female characters out of the hundreds of books I've ready & the McLain brothers are a real treat & Jodi sure knows how to make you anticipate the rest of the series.

The cast, headed by Betty Buckley, George Rose, Cleo Laine and Howard McGillin, is terrific.

It has become one of my all time favorites and might become one of yours."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rupert Holmes' Scored with DROOD","review":"In January of 1987, I saw Edwin Drood on Broadway and I was awestruck. The energy of the score and incredible creativity of the ending caused me to return the next day to see it again. The ending was chosen by the audience, which I thought was super cool. I recently saw Les Miserables and Phantom on Broadway. While those productions are elaborate and thier songs are flawless in light of their portrayals of the storyline they follow, I still feel the music of DROOD is incredibly uplifting and more fun. The revolving and precision timing of the staging of Les Miz and the pyrotechnics fo Phantom are the highlights of those productions. The highlight of Drood is its music and isn't that why they call them musicals anyway?

Her music moved me and made me think of other artists who have been down that mournful road, but didn't make it back; I thought of Phyllis Hyman.

At that time, the book was still out of print, but for some reason, this lady's request stuck in my mind.I was very excited when I saw that 'Babette' and other Newberry titles had been reissued and were on display in our store. I love cats, and the charcoal illustrations in these books are simply precious (I have made my coworkers sick, gushing over them as I do!).

I'm an unabashed fan of McMurtry's Texasville trilogy. While I feel The Last Picture Show,(my all-time favorite) and Texasville had more substance, Duanes's Depressed has to strike a note with most men over the age of 50. You know, the running away from home syndrome. And I can't see ANY of the men over 50 that I know wading through Proust!Whatever....hurry and make the movie before Jeff Bridges and Annie Potts get too old.

True, the character of Duane is fascinating, and there is a good deal of wonderful humor. However, Duane is never really depressed except in others' eyes, and I found that assignment almost insulting. The fact is that he shows no signs of depression, he is sort of goaded into visiting the psychiatrist, he falls in love with her almost instantly, has a flood of tears and a great understanding far too soon in the doctor-patient relationship, and in general the entire psychological development, from the \\"walking\\" start to the \\"pyramidal\\" finish, is written in an all-too sophomorish manner. Perhaps I would have enjoyed it more if I had reread \\"The last picture show\\" or read \\"Texasville\\". Surely one the story in \\"Duane's depressed\\" could (and should) have been told in far fewer words."},{"rating":"2","title":"Surprisingly strong conclusion to the Thalia trilogy","review":"As a long-time McMurtry fan, I approached Duane's Depressed with caution given the quality of the 'Last Picture Show' and 'Texasville' and the disappointing 'later'sequals 'The Late Child' and 'The Evening Star'. However any concerns that Mr McMurtry has lost his touch are put to rest in this surprisingly strong and touching conclusion to the Thalia trilogy.McMurtry's storytelling is always entertaining, and what makes Duane's Depressed so worthwhile is this ability to keep readers interested and involved for over 400 pages. This is certainly one of his more mature works and well worth reading."},{"rating":"1","title":"Loved the first two in the series but not the last","review":"I have read many books by this author.

Just coming to the conclussion that old age sucks seems too easy with no real depth.Duanes interaction with his wife and his friends are absent from this book and I really don't care about the doctor's character at all.

I can imagine Woodrow doing everything Duane does, saying everything Duane says, and thinking everything Duane thinks. Even Duane's task of reading Proust mirrors Woodrow's hauling Gus back to Texas.I was also disappointed in that so many of Duane's acquaintances are eccentrics. Pervasive eccentricity is believable in the context of frontier Texas; it is not in modern America.And finally, Woodrow/Duane just aren't interesting without Gus. \\"Duane's Depressed\\" lacks a Gus."},{"rating":"1","title":"Duane's depressed....","review":".......and so am I, after reading this. Well, almost reading it. I gave up in the middle. Yaaawwwn. Too bad McMurtry has lost his touch. I read the two reviews preceding mine but found I totally disagreed with their opinions. I, too, had previously read The Last Picture Show and Texasville. I've seen the movies that go with the books. I adore Jeff Bridges and had always thought he made a terrific Duane. I like quirky characters as much as the next reader but I didn't connect with any of the ones in this book. The little kids were big-mouthed brats, their \\"parents\\" had never grown up and probably never would. I had always liked Karla and Duane but I just didn't feel anything for them. Maybe I'll just re-read Lonesome Dove, my all-time favourite McMurtry.

He didn't ride in a car again for about 3 years. The thing is, this was just not normal behavior for a successful Texas oilman, and everyone had a hypothesis about what was bothering Duane. Duane himself couldn't really explain it. Thus Duane's Depressed : A Novel is author Larry McMurtry's exploration into the mind of Duane.It is part light comedy, part serious reflection, and part Henry David Thoreau (you have to read it to understand).Duane goes through a LOT during the 3 years of this book.

Having felt like I've known Duane, Ruth, and Sonny since the early 70s, it was like reading about old friends. McMurtry is unparalleled with his use of the English language in the way he paints pictures with the characters' thoughts and dialogue. All of his characters are so real - perhaps quirky, but real. There are a number of laugh-out-loud moments in this book as well as a couple of heart-in-your-throat ones. McMurtry fans, enjoy this one! Newer readers may want to begin with another of his masterpieces. (\\"Horseman, Pass By\\" is a great start.)"},{"rating":"2","title":"a fitting end to a well loved trilogy","review":"Living in the area that McMurtry hails from and writes about in the Duane Moore trilogy has made me a bit biased in regards to this series. I never-the-less found each of the books in this series to be entertaining and well written. This last book has given a fitting end to characters that we have come to love and feel for. The characters each have traits that many of us can relate too. Duanes depression and Karla's attempts to understand and the reaction of the children and grandchildren all combine to make this a wonderful story. And even if you don't find it to be a story that you would want to reread in the future, it will definately make you realize that no matter how hard to live with your own kids are, that they are not so bad compared with Duane and Karla's kids and grandkids."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Waste Your Time","review":"I tried.

Don't even pick it up...just walk on by!!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Existentialism, Texas Style","review":"This is one of the finer works by McMurtry. It is a touching tale about a man on the wrong side of 60 finally thinking about who he is. You see Duane break things down to the essentials with who he is and what he needs. He gives up his truck. He gives up his fancy house. He gives all that up for something greater: Actually getting to know himself.It's one of the finer pieces of American existentialism out there. I highly recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"McMurtry and Thalia's Swan Song","review":"If your looking for plot,or a treatise on depression, you won't find it here. What you will find, in what is probably McMurtry's final novel, is a character study about missed opportunities (and the lack of opportunities)in a small town in Texas.

This stylus absolutely works on the screen, but I don't think it helps much with my intended purpose. The tip of this stylus is squishy, and for the contact to register on the screen, the tip must be completely squished. You have to press a little harder than feels natural. Also, the tip isn't very fine, so I end up drawing thin lines with the same unpredictability experienced with using a finger. I still like the stylus and perhaps with more practice it will be a superior writing implement.This does come with an audio jack tether, but the cord is too short to keep the stylus attached while using it on the screen.

Being 13.5 inches in diameter, this pan give me some extra room for stirring and turning. The sides are nice and high too. It's also very easy to clean!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Does the job...","review":"I bought this pan so I could fry/saute up 4 vegi burgers at a time, a 12.5\\" pan might have been big enough. The pan does not let food stick and it is big enough to fry 4 burgers at a time. I wasn't sure about the disk in the middle of the pan and I pretty much ignore it, it turns a solid red when the pan is hot. I did not give this pan 5 stars because of its weight. it's very light and i did notice the cooking oil bubbling in the center but not out at the edges. Maybe that's my technique or maybe it's because it doesn't hold heat well. So....4 stars because it does what it's supposed to do but only 4 because it's so lightweight."},{"rating":"1","title":"Warped","review":"The bottom of the pan gets warped after a couple months of regular use. Now the center of the pan is higher than the outer edges. I have never washed the pan with cold water while it's piping hot, I always let it cool down before washing. Even with this precaution, it still get warped considerably. It's not only annoying to cook with uneven surface, its also reducing the effectiveness of heat transfer from my flat electric stove. Now it takes forever for the pan to get hot due to bad surface contact.I have a different T-fal pan which has thicker material, and that one does not warp at all. I guess you get what you pay for."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice pan, but actually 13.5\\"","review":"I bought this pan because it was one of the largest frying pans I could find at a reasonable price.

D'Mob really broke Cathy Dennis and the songs that she is featured on, \\"C'Mon and Get My Love\\" and \\"That's The Way of The World\\" are some of the albums best. One thing I noticed about the CD, the version of \\"That's The Way of The World\\" is different than the cassette single which was released way back when.

It was funny, witty, and insightful. Here is a person who knows and cares something about planetary astronomy! I have also liked \\"Four Bitchin' Babes\\" since my wife bought me one of their CDs. This CD combines the best of both, Christine Lavin as one of the \\"Four Bitchin Babes.\\" I like the humerous songs best. \\"Bald Headed Men\\" is a tribute all those so challenged, singing the praises of the likes of Yul Brenner, Patrick Stewart, and Michael Jordan. \\"Butter\\" is an ode to fattening foods of bygone times. Other cuts are not quite so memorable, but the album is always entertaining."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lots of fun...and stunning!","review":"The version of \\"Sealed With A Kiss\\" is worth the price alone. The original version is fabulous, but the Babes' version will absolutely blow you away. Lavin's guitar releases the true emotion the song was meant to have and is litterally stunning as you are stopped dead in your tracks and drawn in. It's unfortunate the song sample offered here does not highlight that guitar work...just a hint. I listen to this song over and over. It really draws you in and keeps you there. Certainly not the feel of the rest of the CD. Out of place? Maybe, but a good song is a good song no matter where it is or what style it's in. This piece is incredible.Most of the other songs are comical and fun. Like \\"Sealed With A Kiss,\\" Julie Gold's \\"From A Distance\\" is an exception. It's always nice to hear a songwriter perform their own songs. They always have more of a personal feel. Very nice CD."},{"rating":"1","title":"Jane Jacobs disappoints in thesis about moral foundations","review":"Jane Jacobs was the grand old lady of urban planning. It was delightful to read her The Death and Life of Great American Cities. She turned the professional world of urban planning upside down. Professional and traditional urban planning were once and for all discredited. In later years she elaborated on the economy of cities. Jane Jacobs was a true believer in the cultural and economical primacy of cities. In Systems of Survival she researches the moral values in society. Her form is the Platonic dialogue. She introduces two distinct moral syndromes , the commercial and the guardian. The crossing of the borders and the resulting moral dilemmas are the main issues that Jacobs addresses. It is a disappointing book. I missed the fresh insights of earlier work and thought Jacobs is drifting away from her main themes. The book lacks focus and is unclear in its conclusions. Good luck we still can cherish her other books. Luuk Oost"},{"rating":"1","title":"Too confusing","review":"I was attracted to the author's premise for this book, as I have recently been struggling with the conflicting moral perspectives from which colleagues can view the same issue. But I found the book too confusing, and couldn't find compelling support for the author's hypotheses.The book is framed as a Socratic dialogue among characters. Although this style seemed plausible, the characters' personalities were not developed enough for me to distinguish them and identify them with their arguments. Overall, the author's plausible premise was not supported clearly by illustration or research and I remain un-persuaded."},{"rating":"1","title":"alright","review":"this book can be very introspective at times but digging to deep into a subject can get boring after a while. the format could have been better"},{"rating":"2","title":"Why Regulators and Businessmen CAN'T Understand Each Other","review":"A very interesting dialog on paradigms which helped me understand better why \\"commercial\\" types and \\"government\\" types so often see each other as just plain evil and can't get past that emotional reaction.The book explores two moral systems with very different ideas of honor, which is at the emotional root of how we perceive each other. Should be required reading in high school political science and social studies classes.The reader needs to look past the cardboard cut-out \\"characters\\" which are there only to present the arguments, and focus on the insights produced from the arguments.A quick, yet very informative read.

Then imagine Mr. Toer telling you and other prisoners a long story about a young man's political awakening, Indonesia's colonial history - years, days, places, players - and a whole host of other fascinating characters.

But being in the US, I'm able to get access to the ban books in Indonesia and have been rewarded from reading his books. This book is a start of an \\"anti-christ\\" series that exposes our bad sides honestly. This, and the following books, clearly narrates the dutch rule in the late 1800 and early 1900 that is used in the exact same manner by Suharto during his rule (i.e. oppression). It also brings out our (esp. Javanese) bad character, submissiveness, in a painful but awakening way. So, for my fellow Indonesians, read this book as an instrospect!

He has no trouble with Poincare's secret encouragement of Russia and his counsel of \\"firmness\\" during the July Crisis of 1914, which could have only one outcome: a European war.

When a lady shows up at his door claiming to be a princess, she is made to unknowingly take part in a small and interesting test to see if she is really a princess. The logic behind why this test is important is a little silly, but after all, it is a children's book and a very entertaining one at that.

Willis' compilation includes a selection of both fictional and true stories that I found to be a balanced combination of very funny, poignant, sad, and--best of all--inspiring.

The author's premise is valid: Human beings who have looked at the earth from space return with a different view of of our planet not only literally, but philosophically as well. However, rather than expand on this idea, he simply repeats it. Page, after page, after page. I stuck with the book hoping the last section containing interviews with space travelers would redeem the work, but each interview was merely a copy of the first, which went something like this: \\"When I first glimpsed the earth from space, I was overwhelmed with its beauty. I gained a sense of how everything on earth was interconnected, and I knew I would never look at life the same way again\\".

When the dresser fell apart two weeks after my 8 year old granddaughter started using it, we took the drawers and used them as storage boxes under her bed so that my money would not be a total loss.

He defends the proposition that logic must be valid because its denial is self-defeating. On the otherside, he rejected the idea that theism could be deductively proved. Therefore, he challenges Thomism's belief of a deductive approach, and finds that it cannot be validly proved.Natural knowledge of God's existence doesn't take a person very far, not far enough. Thus, he centers on an evidentialist, experiential approach. Here he latches onto systematic consitency, the lack of internal contradiction coupled with external agreement in one's experience.He proposed in other works and this that one's apologetic approach should mirror the times, as he stated: \\"an apologist must play it by ear.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"I was surprised by the beauty of this CD","review":"I must confess I'm not a big Nascimento's fan!

The strength, beauty and gentleness combined in musics as \\"Noites do Sertao\\", \\"Lagrima do Sul\\" and \\"Vidro e Corte\\" are absolutely astonishing.

Yes, I understand that Maddy had to come to grips with leaving her religion behind, and yes, I get that Christian was angry, but still, their story held and delivered about as much interest as watching paint dry. As the Italians say, \\"There is no worse thief than a bad book.\\" I agree whole-heartedly. I also just finished Lessons in French, and I am amazed that someone didn't tell Ms. Kinsale to chop a good 100 pages off of either of these novels, in the name of common sense. Gah.

The re-issue of Flowers From The Storm brings back a book that is remarkable as both a great Laura Kinsale novel and a blockbuster romance.FFTS is a joy. It takes readers places that most writers are afraid to venture. After all, love between a stroke victim and a timid Quaker girl? Fear not. Laura Kinsale makes it work with jaw-dropping style. Everything in this book jumps off the page in exquisite, engaging detail. This book reaches out and holds the reader captive until the last sentence gets it's period placed. As a reader, FFTS enthralls me. As an aspiring writer, FFTS inspires me.I envy the reader who gets to discover Laura Kinsale's work for the first time with FFTS. My recommendation? Buy several copies because you will read the covers off of this book. Don't let yourself ever have to live without this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Unique and moving story","review":"This book gets major points from me for being so unique in presenting a hero who is not completely self-possessed, perfect and in control. The heroine is also unusual, given that she is not a teenaged hoyden. This only makes the characters all the more real, and their developing relationship has believable depth and passion.I would say, though, that although you can really sympathize with Maddy's attempt to bridge her Quaker life with the life of an aristocrat, it gets a bit annoying toward the end when she so strongly resists her marriage. This suffers a bit of the \\"forced plot\\" so common among romance novels (although I love them dearly), where the hero or heroine has exaggerated issues that they stubbornly cling to in the face of obvious happiness.All in all, though, very worth reading and enjoyable."},{"rating":"1","title":"flowers from the storm annoys","review":"The premise was terrific, the setup was lovely, the heroine was the most annoying, milk toast, un heroic woman I have ever had the bad luck to read about.

There was more script devoted to describing things then allowing us to get to know the characters. I found myself skipping over the excessive descriptions more than once. I found the heroine, Maddy, more annoying then anything else. She was very inconsistent and I felt bad that Christian was \\"stuck\\" with her. She was great in the beginning of the book, but just annoying as things progressed. Nothing but hope for major recovery kept me tuned into this book.

But, unlike 50 Shades of Grey, the Duke shined in his transformation. By the nature of his affliction he had to learn and grow, and watching his character arc up from the dregs of lunacy, solitude, abandonment, and ridicule was heart-breaking, gripping, awe-inspiring and just wonderful reading!...Maddy got on my nerves in the middle.

I love re-reading them. I find her characters interesting, and hope she has some more books out soon.I would like to say something in Maddy's defense. I like her, and understand that for a devout Quaker there would be a bone deep conflict of life styles, religious doctrine, and personal beliefs, in many ways large and small between her and Christian a member of the Church of England. The Plain Folk, Quakers, believe in a simple life. They do not believe in military service, preachers in church, personal adornment, or titles. In a marriage even small differences over saying grace at dinner, or not, can cause trouble.For Maddy to commit to a lifetime of alienation from fellow believers, to be shunned, by her life long friends is no small matter."},{"rating":"2","title":"RitaSV","review":"What can I say?

It portrays real life conflict between doing what your brain says is right versus what your heart feels is right and the choices one is forced to make as a result.

Not to mention the actual physcial torture the patients received at this institution. Sadly, this is probably how stroke victims were treated.The characters were not likeable in any way. The author delved way to deep into Christian's mind and some of the things he thought were startlingly scary. I just don't think a mental institution is the place for a romance even if the patient isn't really insane.Maddy was so consumed with guilt that everytime a rare romantic moment did appear it was ruined by her thoughts of God.

After all this they somehow live happily ever after at the end. Oh also he totally doesn't care that a former mistress of his had his baby and wants him to take care of it. The end.

Christian has had a stroke and has been confined to an insane asylum. There are sweet and emotional interactions here but their time together in the asylum went on and on and on and on. We get the point. Maddy is Christian's \\"rock\\" and he comes to depend on her. Christian helps bring Maddy out of her confined Quaker world and she feels romantic love for a man. These two are codependent on one another for pages and pages and pages...... Soooo boring.It is also not terribly romantic watching a young , handsome man attempt to recover from a stroke. It made me wonder about the depth of illness in the Duke. It is not that common for a very young man to have a stroke without having some underlying vascular or cardiac disease. Not exactly what good romance stories are made of."},{"rating":"1","title":"COULDN'T FINISH IT","review":"I was very excited to get this book because it rated so well, but I quickly became very disappointed.

The Duke has a stroke and ends up in an asylum lost to the world. Fate happens to bring Maddy to the same asylum in which she ends up taking care of him. He falls for her through his struggles to regain his speech and comprehension. However, that is about the last time we see compassion from Maddy. While the Duke continues to grow and become a better person, Maddy becomes even more cynical and holier-than-thou. The Duke loves her and she repeatedly tries to 'escape' her situation. I could not stand her! All in all it was a well written book with the exception of the frigid heroine. I felt she did not deserve the Duke."},{"rating":"2","title":"Outstanding in Every Way","review":"This is a novel that deserves reprinting, and a much more sophisticated cover treatment! Everything about this story is outstanding, thanks to the top-notch writing of Ms. Kinsale. Many a romance has a handsome man and beautiful woman falling madly in love. This is one author who isn't content to dish up a traditional fluffy fantasy. Instead, she gives us a reckless playboy of a nobleman, hardly admirable in any way. A sudden seizure leaves him with the behavior of an apparent madman, fighting for his life and his sanity. Not your ordinary hero! His salvation comes in the unlikely form of a devout Quaker woman who couldn't be more removed from the kind of world he struggles to return to. These characters actually develop and grow in the process of discovering their need for one another. With powerful characterizations, remarkably authentic dialogue and rich sensuality, \\"Flowers from the Storm\\" is truly an oustanding romance from an exceptionally talented author."},{"rating":"1","title":"Insipid heroine","review":"I must agree with some of the previous reviewers.

But then a friend convinced me that I would love it, and she was right! This book has me sobbing at the end. Perhaps my favorite scene of declaration of love is found near the end of this book.I've also discovered that while I may not like a flawed character, if it is one invented by Laura Kinsale, I will learn to absolutely love that character. Kinsale writes with pure magic - the way she puts words together and describes characters thoughts and emotions has completely captivated me. I can't wait to read all of her other books. At the same time, I don't want to speed through them. It's like eating the richest dark chocolate. It's soooo good, but I want it to last."},{"rating":"2","title":"Superb!","review":"I've read a LOT of historical romances. This is one of the very few that do equal, delightful justice to both the history and the romance, with very real characters that were *not* made for each other, *without* a romance that's telegraphed from the very first page. Nothing about the outcome is certain until the very end. The device of the hero's stroke, which transforms him from careless rake who sneers at another's difficulties with the pronounciation of his own name, to helpless hero unable to remember or pronounce his own, is briliantly executed over a realistic and fascinating narrative."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved it!","review":"I loved the story almost as much as the historic details! This is the best historical romance novel I have read. (Unless you count Outlander in the same category.)"},{"rating":"2","title":".","review":"Like most people, I liked this book. It had a lot more going on for it than most romance novels, but you can read about that in everyone else's reviews; I just want to give a tip of my cap to the way Kinsale portrayed the leading man's illness and mental deficiencies. Mental illness is one of my literary fetishes and Kinsale pulled it off effortlessly.The down side of this book is that it is too long. There is nothing I would have taken out or shortened, per se, but about 100 pages before the end I would have been fine skipping ahead just to see what happened and moving on to my next book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Utterly devasting; utterly Kinsale!","review":"I read Flowers from the Storm after reading about 20 other romance novels. What impressed me about Flowers was that for the first time in a romance novel, I encountered an author who assumes that romance readers have intelligence. Not only does she challenge her readers to follow the Quaker thee/thou speech, she also puts her readers inside of Jervaulx's mind and forces us to see and hear the world through his stroke-damaged perceptions--a world where simple English words have little meaning. She then takes this one step further, challenging us to follow along with her, by letting us feel Jervaulx's frustration and rage and letting us hear what he hears as he tries to understand Maddy's thee/thou Quaker speech. Ingenious! I've read somewhere that Kinsale's greatest skill is in taking a hero that no one could love and making you want to lick his boots by the end of the story. This is never truer than in Flowers from the Storm. This book needs to be reprinted!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Historically and medically accurate","review":"Exploring love between a quakeress helping a nobleman after a debilitating stroke, this is a compelling tale with an original take on a rake's redemption. Unlike most most authors who take a ridiculous amount of \\"creative license\\" with their medical plot devices, Kinsale is spot on in her medical treatment of the hero(which is refreshing for me as a physician). I can testify both from professional and personal perspective of watching a friend survive a cerebral aneurysm (the type of stroke Christian has)that Kinsale accurately describes this type of condition from coma to almost full recovery months later. But what I really love is that she does this in the setting of a 19th century English romance novel in a way that is both emotionally compelling and satisfying."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Buy This!!!","review":"I bought this shade and it has no support and constantly falls down out of the windshield.

The shade seems to be of high quality and keeps the sun off the dash (and the car cooler) when ... and I repeat WHEN it stays up. The shade reflects the sun well but is not sturdy enough to remain in-place (especially with the car's sun visor down). It simply wilts like a lettuce leaf and falls onto the dash.The truth be told the windscreen of the 2006+ Civic is very large, requiring a large sunshade but this shade will not retain it's shape after repeated uses.

In most of his books, he makes history an enjoyable romp, writing books that are engaging and hard to put down.However, this book is one of the biggest rip-offs I've seen. It has a price from Fantasyland and the text is about as detailed as the leaflets you pick up from a museum. For example, the 'Chapter' on Pagan Temple architecture has a total of 488 words. It has over 100 pages only because there are full-page title-pages introducing each section.Considering this is supposed to be a book on Roman Art, the text tells you nothing, and the price is so high you think you are getting something of quality, rather than a hardcover museum leaflet. Michael Grant should stick to books on historical figures, (Eg. Nero, Cleopatra etc) and leave Art History to the experts."},{"rating":"2","title":"JUMP IN DVD","review":"Very happy--great bargin.

It is rated PG and there is nothing that would make it inappropriate for kids. I give it 4 stars out of 5. The movie was about a young boy named Izzy who was a boxer for most of his life until some friends asked him if he would sub for a missing jump roper in a competition group. Izzy falls in love with double-dutching and it ends up taking most of his time. He has little time for boxing and his dad loves the sport. His mother recently died and it makes his father try to bond with Izzy more through boxing. Izzy finds that he wants to double-dutching and wants to give up boxing. Because he cares so much about Izzy, his father accepts the decision."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fast Food for the Soul","review":"This DVD was a gift for my wife, who is one of the \\"Jump In\\" fans in this house. I don't have quite the enthusiasm for this movie that they do, which leads me to believe that it is something of a \\"chick flick.\\"A tight plot, engaging characters, and quick pace put this show several notches above \\"viewable.\\"I enjoyed the story of a boy learning how to deal with conflicting demands and responsibilities.The jump-rope contest choreography is impressive, and helps make this DVD a good buy, although sports purists might question the fusion of jump-rope tricks and boxing in another scene.Disney Studios seems to be re-discovering the bourgeois inhibitions that made it a global success, so those who require relevance, naughty words, and people with the self-control of an ADHD tomcat in their entertainment will be sorely disappointed in \\"Jump In.\\" Aside from these deficiencies, this is a highly entertaining musical."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fresh Cake hits the spot","review":"Despite their name, The Trash Can Sinatras sound about as fresh as you can get. Their debut album shows off John Douglas's and Paul Livingstone's lush and intricate guitars. Singer Frank Read, and his lyrics, provide a worthy voice to it all.Their first single, \\"Obscurity Knocks\\", is probably the best example of their bright and breezy sound. While the delicate guitars are further highlighted in \\"Even The Odd\\", \\"The Best Man's Fall\\" and \\"Only Tongue Can Tell\\", the quintet gives percussion a good airing in the stomping \\"Circling The Circumference\\".This album should be listened to at home with all the windows and doors thrown open.The Trash Can Sinatras got their name after playing for beer at discos where they sang Frank Sinatra covers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Still sounds fresh","review":"The Trash Can Sinatras' 1990 debut, Cake, mixes intricately intertwined guitars, in the spirit of a more charming, less gritty Johnny Marr, with lush strings and sophisticated harmonies. Touchingly clever wordplay (\\"You came into my life/Like a brick through a window/And I cracked a smile\\") abounds, as on \\"The Best Man's Fall.\\" The clean production -- necessary for such elaborate orchestration -- is extremely warm and inviting. Singles like \\"Obscurity Knocks\\" and \\"Only Tongue Will Tell\\" as well as \\"Maybe I Should Drive\\" prove to be the tastiest pieces of pure pop pleasure"},{"rating":"2","title":"Far from \\"Trash\\".","review":"I don't know a single other person who knows this band, but I sure am glad I do. This is one of those special albums that came out at a great time in alt-pop. They sound alot like other bands from that era (1990), but also add a very smooth and melodic touch to their music, almost shoegazeish, but not. The best tracks in my opinion are \\"Obscurity Knocks\\", \\"Even The Odd\\", \\"Funny\\", and \\"Only Tongue Can Tell\\". All wonderful. If you like bands such as The Ocean Blue or Mighty Lemon Drops, you should like this album. It might be the best \\"Cake\\" you ever had."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliant collection of pop songs.","review":"One of those few albums where every song is outstanding.

It was very frustrating how it rolled up almost immediately and it dried up very fast because it took so long to apply because I kept having to unroll it. Then I got the idea of keeping it folded, and then unfold it a little at a time while applying it. You have much more control over it, it doesn't roll up at all, and it is faster to apply it so it won't dry up so quickly. You still have to use 2 or 3 to cover your whole body but it is definately easier this way!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Tan Towels","review":"This looked so good on T.V.that I ordered these single use tan towels.While the resultant color was good, it took more than one towel to cover the whole body. Additionally, the towels roll up as you use them so several times during the application you have to stop and unroll it before you can continue. It is easier than the self-tanning creams but not the fantastic product I anticipated. Thank you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a fan!","review":"Hate this product!

Driving Home is her most compelling album, due to the wonderful melodies and reflective lyrics that one finds in such classics as Driving Home, Seventy-five Septembers, Orbiting Jupiter, and the heartbreaking Almost. It also contains her wry wit, as with \\"Don't forget the guns\\". If you can't get to a live concert, this album is a must."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Right Stuff for Maximum Human Progress","review":"If you are interested in the best way for people to work together in organizations, you must read Dee Hock's account of the founding and development of Visa. His thinking has played a key role for those who are trying to apply chaos and complexity theory to organizations, and to seminal thinkers like Peter Senge and Arie de Geus. Now, you can read the simple, humble thoughts that can turn ordinary people into extraodinary combinations of effectiveness. I loved the aphorisms interspaced through the book and the down-to-earth way that Dee Hock shared his experiences and thoughts. Think of this as the opposite of Chainsaw Al, and with greater results. Anyone who wants to move beyond the command and control culture that tends to dominate in most organizations should read Dee Hock's account of Chaordic Organizations in the new Chaordic Age. If you liked The Fifth Discipline, The Dance of Change, or The Living Company, this is must reading for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Flowers for the \\"People\\"","review":"Hard to believe as it may seem now, in the late 1980s Hothouse Flowers actually challenged the popularity of U2 (in their native Ireland, anyway). Released in 1988, \\"People\\" was their best studio album. It combines the jangly guitar-pop typical of college rock from that period with the bombastic soulfulness of fellow Irishman Van Morrison. The highlights include the single \\"Don't Go,\\" the spiritual \\"Hallelujah Jordan,\\" \\"It'll Be Easier in the Morning,\\" and \\"I'm Sorry.\\" The only flaw is that the album is a bit overlong at 15 tracks, and flags a bit in the second half.Overall, an excellent period piece of late 1980s rock and soul."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good find.","review":"I don't know a single other person who has ever even heard of \\"Hothouse Flowers\\", but I'm glad that I know them. I wouldn't call this a must-have, however it's still really good. Being from Ireland, they do remind me some of \\"The Waterboys\\", though not as traditional, and some of 1980's \\"U2\\", but less rock. Many of their songs do have a passionate, and anthem-type feel. I haven't heard much else from them, but I suspect this is their best release. Overall a great album, and perfect for the person who likes their music with a Guinness."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Start","review":"I think this is a great starter piece of equipment.

It doesn't show in the description that the handle is not solid underneath. It is hollowed out in a channel shape that runs down the handle to the scoop portion. After working with for about 30 minutes, your hand will tend to rub against the edges which aren't cast too great. The ridges are hardly noticeable at first but once your hands are soaking wet and you have been digging a while, you really start to think about it more.While uncomfortable, it is not overly so. My thought is that it was done this way to make the scoop cheaper...

Momentum has the similar problems. Early into the recording you three guys lost. Dewey blowing something silly without much rhyme or reason. Elvin on a different path. CT gives in and just mocks the affair with a bunch of silly chords. Eventually, the music gets better, then worse. Momentum just should have never been released without a little more rehearsel, but that cost money so screw the art.

Spare me!!!If you really want to read a great book about blacks pioneering the West, read \\"The Personal Story of Rachel DuPree\\" by Ann Weisgarber."},{"rating":"2","title":"All glowing book review cliches apply","review":"Page-turner, can't put it down, tour de force, and all those other cliches apply to Gabriel's Story. Actually, I could put it down, but only because I had to. Couldn't wait to pick it up again.Gabriel's Story is an amazing adventure -- perfectly plausible -- of a teen aged African American in the 1870's who leaves his family's Kansas farm unannounced. He and a friend join a crew of cowboys headed for Texas....How to tell more of the book without giving away bits and pieces of the story that is best discovered by the reader? Can't be done.Suffice it to say that Gabriel sees and experiences more than he could ever had imaganed. He is handicapped by racism, his youth and inexperience, but boasts the distinct advantages of intelligence and a good heart.If you're overly sensitive to violence, beware; but it all rings true to the times and is never gratuitous.Now stop reading reviews of the book and buy it, you'll be glad you did."},{"rating":"1","title":"A disappointment . . .","review":"As a collector of the entire series, no one awaited this book more than I. I feel let down. Of the 13 stories, (and it's only 318 pages, not 352), seven are fiction. These were not well chosen: selections from Treasure Island and Moby Dick are not even set at sea, but are the land-based openings of the books. The non-fiction does not live up to the billing of the editorial reviews that preceded it on this page. There is not much shipwreck or survivial: several are more like philosophical essays as opposed to stories with an edge. The story on diving the Andrea Doria is perhaps the best in the book, but many of us will have seen it elsewhere, as it is recent. Why a fictional account of the Titanic and not a true one? For a book on treasure, why nothing of Mel Fisher and the Atocha? If you want sea adventure, the earlier book in the series, Rough Water, delivers a bigger punch. This volume, regratably, is one that you can put down between stories."},{"rating":"1","title":"More adrenaline, please","review":"As a passive individual, I live through the words and experiences of first hand authors for my adventure. This narrative simply scratches the surface of those before it. \\"Ship of Gold\\", \\"The Fatal North\\" and \\"Abandon Ship!\\" come to mind immediately as adrenaline rush examples. Any of the several publications on \\"The Endurance\\" far exceed the expectations of \\"Deep Blue\\". The human spirit has greater tales to tell."},{"rating":"1","title":"Apollyon Sun's Sub is not worth listening to","review":"This album has a sheer lack of good taste that haunts Thomas Fischer (a.k.a. Satanic Slaughter, Th. Fischer, Tom Warrior, Thomas Gabriel) since Into the Pandemonium, regarded as avant garde but, in my opinion, just out-of-topic-metal.It isn't metal, it isn't industrial, it isn't pop. It is just bad music in all senses. Messiah should not be cited in such a way. What is the necessity of something called R U Morbid, with some \\"Uh\\"'s? The album (and the band) has a severe lack of concept.The listener remains with a strange feeling (in a bad sense). If Thomas doesn't want to be remembered for his earliest work, then why all the citations? Listen and get irritated."},{"rating":"2","title":"Actually, this really is a good record.","review":"Although this is not a perfect record, I hardly aggree with the previous review. Apollyon Sun and Sub are definitly a step forward for 'ol Tom G and crew. The album is quite heavy and layered with pretty cool grooves throughout. There is a more predominant electronic element than in Fischer's past work and it is perhaps a little less sophisticated (the programming, not the live stuff), than much of what else is happening out there. Also, there are times when the mix and amount of elements seem crowded together, instead of smoothly layered and complimentary to each other. Since I recently purchased this record, I won't go into the specifics of each song. However, I do really like this record and see a lot of potential in Apollyon Sun. Sub is a worthy purchase and possibly a \\"must have\\" for older fans of Celtic Frost such as myself. Check it out!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fans of Celtic Frost will be surprised big time.","review":"When Tom Fischer(aka Tom Warrior) first disbanded Hellhammer, he took what was best of it and incorporated it in Celtic Frost. Then Celtic Frost was put aside (they are working on a new album), and came Apollyon Sun.So what's Apollyon Sun like? It's..umm..'different'. VERY different. If you were expecting another Celtic Frost incarnation like I was, you'll be blown away. This sounds more like something Marilyn Manson or Ministry would create. In a sense, this album is bleaker and darker than the aforementioned bands. It's danceable industrial, but the music is creepy. I was surprised.Did I like 'Sub'? Yes, it is a solid effort. The interesting thing is the way Tom sings. He sounds like Marilyn Manson, especially on 'Naked Underground'. I think he could improve on his vocals and probably start singing an octave higher, though. And not all songs are good. But overall, a good album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Happy","review":"My granddaughter was very happy with her Granny because she got the movie she wanted.got the movie in time for her 5th birthday."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Movie","review":"Great movie.

Crummy acting, dumb dialog, silly plot. There's no reason for an adult to sit through this unless the kids insist that you stay there. All that said, my kids did enjoy it, even to the point of drawing pictures about it afterward, and my wife tells me they're watching it again today.

Not so this one. The adventures of Sharkboy and Lavagirl had to be one of the most ill-conceived, poorly developed projects to ever make it through Hollywood. Riding on his success with the Spy Kids movies (which were so superior to this it isn't funny), Rodriguez must have found himself in a position where he didn't need to get script approval from anyone. It shows. If an unknown scriptwriter had tried to present this to a studio she or he would have been laughed right out of town. Unfortunately, Rodriguez managed to bypass all the checks and balances that veto bad stories and pushed this project through. I sat through the entire movie, as painful as it was, with my neice. Nearly a third of the audience walked out before it was over. They were the smart ones."},{"rating":"1","title":"terrible","review":"You can't call it anything else but terrible.

One,who thought of a brainstorm,that was stupid. Robert Rodriguez did terrible too. The acting was made out of poo. There's no bright colors because the bad guy wants \\"darkness\\".

All kids should see this!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Wait while I find a container for my apathy...","review":"As other reviewers have no doubt noted, this movie is a modern-day reimagining of The Neverending Story. The primary difference that sets this movie apart is that the visual effects are much better (as you would expect given the time between the two), but the story limps.The characters were cardboard 2-dimensional caricatures and felt forced and contrived as did the dialogue. The worst was when Max finally began to realize his power and began mouthing platitudes that felt stilted and awkward, having no believability coming from the mouth of a boy that young.On the positive side, the CG was done fairly well, and for all the pain that I endure sitting through this turkey, my 5-year old son loves it. That makes since I suppose since this movie comes in strongly at the 5-year old maturity level.Parents, your young children will probably love this, but avoid the agony of having to sit through this tripe yourself if at all possible."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the best movie...","review":"I saw Sharkboy and Lavagirl in 3-D awhile ago. The commercials made it seem pretty exciting, and the fact that it was in 3-D, also made it cool... but this was one of the worst movies I've ever seen. It just wasn't interesting. They said the word \\"dream\\" over and over and soon they broke into a song at one point in the movie, which now gives me nightmares. Also, the movie sort of rambled on. I would not suggest this movie because I didn't really enjoy it, and it was actually very boring."},{"rating":"2","title":"Through a kid's eyes...","review":"...this is a good movie. All of my friends LOVE this movie and think that the 3-D is much better than Spy Kids 3-D. Hopefully what Robert and Racer Max said in Disney Adventures about a sequel is true. What I think of The Adventures of Sharkboy and Lavagirl in 3-D is that kids can understand it, but adults really can't.

The acting is horrible, the dialog is horrendous, the plotline is pretty much non-existent.

I wanted to upgrade so that my daughters could enjoy this movie with the 3D TV. What was shipped to me was not the 3D blu ray. It was blu ray, but not 3D. There is a distinct difference and this seller refuses to acknowledge this fact. Not only was it not 3D, but the packaging had Spanish translations, and the blu ray itself did not even have a menu. Upon inserting the disc, it goes right into the movie. When the menu button is pressed, all that appears is an audio option. Not only did they not ship me the 3D, but they shipped me a completely bogus, pirated copy. Do not buy from this seller."},{"rating":"2","title":"My girls love this movie!","review":"My girls have always loved watching this movie. Unfortunately, when it is on TV it was always in 3D so they didn't get the real effect without glasses.

Now my 5 year old daughter is obsessed with this movie! She was renting it so much I finally picked it up on here for her. And the adventures don't stop on tv, oh no! Like any great movie, they inspire her imagination! And Ella has Sharkboy and Lava Girl over quite regularly, let me tell you! But to the movie itself, it is full of childhood imagination (a dying breed), dreaming, and the special effects are out of this world (literally!) I love all the color in this film and the plot is fun and not too scary either. Ella loves reacting it out over and over and over again. Can't have been too bad if Taylor Lautner got his first big break from this one to go on to play Jacob Black! Highly Recommended!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Movie","review":"My 6 year old granddaughter and seen this movie on television and wanted a copy.

This movie was very boring, contrived, silly, and devoid of comprension. No one over 10 years old will like this movie. Parents shouldn't take their kids to this pathetic movie unless they think bad movies is a good way to punish their kids. It was so sloppy much like an artist who throws paint on a canvas without judgement and calls it \\" art\\". The 3-D glasses drowned out the colors and left the viewer with shadows of blue all over the place. This film was terrible.

The 3-D version is pointless though because unless you tweak your tv just right it is poor quality. Don't bother with that, just watch the 2-D version that is on the same disk.

It won't even eject the disk at times because it is locked up (especially since the automatic firmware upgrade was made). I have spoken to Panasonic about the issue and as others have stated, they know nothing about these problems. They suggested I hold down the channel up and down buttons simultaneously to perform resets. That doesn't work and why should I have to perform \\"resets\\" in the first place.

(I already own a DMR-E85HS and am familiar with its capabilities.) This particular unit has one flaw: it hangs up on an attempt to view a program when is busy recording. One is supposed to be able to view other recorded programs, or the beginning of a program currently recording, while the unit records. Editing programs and transfering programs from the hard drive to a DVD-R disk is possible as well. The hard drive has more than enough space to record whatever is necessary. It does not record high definition programs in high definition, though.The unit also has a \\"TV Guide\\" feature, by which it downloads program data from the cable or satellite server. This simplifies setting a schedule of programs to record, and is apparently a popular feature on the unit. I wish there would be a way to turn off the downloading while still retaining the ability of the recorder to control the cable box."},{"rating":"1","title":"panasonic dvr","review":"I purchased one of the first panasonic dvr with the lifetime membership.

My first mistake was not returning the unit and, as requested by Panasonic, delivering it to one of their authorized service retailers. It's been several weeks and the service center is still showing the parts as on backorder. Panasonic's customer support center has not been helpful in the slightest. If you have an issue make sure you call customer support early in their workday, because I had two instances where they had stopped answering their phones before their listed closing hours. Now I'm stuck waiting for a unit that will take who-knows-how-long to get the parts, and, given the experiences of others I am unlikely to get a unit that works properly.I highly recommend avoiding this unit and the Panasonic brand."},{"rating":"1","title":"U99 problem makes unit completely useless","review":"I've had my unit since february, and have recorded a lot of tv with it.

Well, I got the unit back about two weeks ago and now I get absolutely no TV guide listings and every hour or so while I am watching something, the unit just shuts itself off.

Always taking ballads at a crawl--she seems to have slowed down even more on some of these tracks--if such a thing were possible. The singing is also somehow more raw--one hears the vulnerabilities of age slowing being etched into this heaven-sent voice.

The story line is exciting especially when Con and Kenneth separately work on the investigation. Though some of the subplots add little to the main story line, they too generate much excitement and energy.

I've been an occasional Slim-Fast consumer since the early 1990s (I think) and feel that the flavor has not improved much since then.

The very first time I put him into it one of the feet gave out (and my guy was probably only about 14 1/2 lbs at the time). Don't get me wrong, he loves the toys and sounds that it makes, but I have had to prop various items under the lip of the base to keep him from toppling forward and/or backward depending on the little red foot that decides to give out at the mnoment.

This one had the best ratings and reviews. The reviews were so right. She loves it. She will play in it for hours. When she was 3 months old we put a phone book under her feet for support. She even figured out how to turn it to play with each toy.Now this is her favorite toy we own. I recommend this for any new parent to entertain their baby."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful Entertainer","review":"My husband and I bought this for our son Cameron when he was 3 months old. He was holding his head up well and we thought we could just try it. His feet touched but not quite enough so we placed a book beneath him. He initially just sat in one place and played, but eventually he learned to turn himself around in it. It took a few times of putting him in it until he got use to it and now at almost 6 months he is still in it. He LOVES it and not only does it entertain he now uses the sun and star to chew on to help his teething. This activity center has been well worth the money. It has a great variety of toys and the animal sounds with english, spanish and a song are great. I highly recommend this. It is great and grows with the child!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Dangerous!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","review":"Do not buy. Legs broke the first day and my baby hit the floor."},{"rating":"1","title":"WE DEFINITELY DID NOT GET OUR MONEYS WORTH!","review":"our daughter was five months old right around the holidays and was looking like she was ready to do her own thing. we decided to pick out an exersaucer for her. i read all of the reviews, checked them out in the stores and decided this one was the best. i don't really know if these are good for the kids or not, but i figured ten minutes or so in the morning would be o.k.. mom's got to brush her teeth! anyways she seemed to like it at first, but after a few weeks she was already bored of it. i didn't put her in it for a few more weeks to see if she would find interest in it again, but no luck. she had no interest in the toys and would cry until i took her out of it. my daughter is ten months old now and every now and then i try to put her in it, but still the same reaction. she hates it! a bit dissapointing at one hundred dollars. it takes up a lot of space and my husband has stubbed his toe on it one too many times. get a doorway jumper instead!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Investment!","review":"My husband and I took weeks looking at all of the available exersaucers out there! We compared number of activities, price, etc. Ultimately we ended up ordering the Baby Einstein Exersaucer and our son loves it! He is 5 1/2 months old and loves to play in it. The activities are great! I like that it has the height adjustment so that he can grow into it. I would reccomend this to anyone who is looking for an educational/fun toy for their infant."},{"rating":"1","title":"Baby only played with this for 2 weeks - babies want to move not be in one position.","review":"My baby only played with this for 2 weeks and she became bored. She loves her walker better. She can move around and explore in her walker. The activities in this piece are limited to the small toys attached to the top which would get boring for anyone after two weeks. She did play with it for up to 20 minutes at a time but quickly mentally outgrew it. She needs more stimulation then the toys could provide."},{"rating":"2","title":"Babu Einstein center was fine, but there were other issues.","review":"The first time I used your service was in August 2005. I paid for 2 day delivery and the item took 2 weeks to be delivered.This time, when the original box was rec'd it was totally opened and was refused due to the fact that parts were missing.The second time this package was delivered, the box was left in the back of the house with no note on the door. We never rec'd packages in the back of the house. No one was home so no one even knew it was there. Also, again the box was totally ripped and opened. Only this time all the parts were there. Either there is a problem with the packaging of the items or it is being totally destroyed during shipment. Either way THIS IS A HUGE PROBLEM and I AM TOTALLY UNHAPPY WITH AMAZON."},{"rating":"1","title":"SOMETHING TO CONSIDER !!","review":"The height of this product is good for babies that are taller of length than the original age. As my baby is 30\\" tall of 10 months age, she outgrew the length of the step and play piano. I had to buy her an entertainer which is higher so she won't fall out of it when bending over. But as me or my family never had pets, we didn't know that she would be scared of the sounds it would make, such as cow, dog, duck and lion on this product. So please take this into consideration when buying the product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Couldn't live without it!","review":"This is in the top 3 MUST HAVE items for a baby. My son has used it everyday for the past 6 months and he's not tired of it! (The key is to only have them in it for shorter periods of time so it's always new to them.) We even schlep it up to our summer house (we would have bought another one, but he'll be out of it soon) and the top and bottom disconnect easily, although it is still pretty big...I love the music box that has a cow, cat, dog and duck and when the child presses one of the buttons, it will say the name of the animal in English, then in Spanish and then play a part of a song--all the songs are different for each animal and best of all, they're not annoying! My son also likes the plastic book of the four animals and since it is a little difficult to turn the pages, he'll concentrate for several minutes on that activity. I'm so sad he'll be outgrowing this--it has been a lifesaver!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great investment!","review":"My 6 month loves it! The side toys are very stimulating for her and it gives the opportunity to be upright for a good amount of time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great except for legs--watch out!","review":"Our 8 month old has been using this for a couple months now and still really likes it. It has lots of things for him to bite and put in his mouth. The only bad thing is when you don't have the legs down, they stick up and are pretty sharp at the corners. One time our baby was on the ground and fell over, hitting his face on the leg, just BARELY missing his eye. After that, I couldn't get one of the legs to stay down, so we had to tape it down but it still comes up part of the way. Just be careful about the legs. Otherwise, it's a great product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Entertains my baby for hours","review":"Grandpa bought this toy for our baby girl for Christmas. She was 4.5 months old and able to hold her head well. She loved it from the beginning. At first she could only play in it for a few minutes at a time but day by day built up that time until she would play in it for at least an hour at a time and probably 3 hours a day. Now that she can crawl, she doesn't enjoy it as much, but still plays in it each day. I wanted this one versus others because it has a taller height. My baby is now 9 months old and still has another adjustment before she will grow out of it. She loves it, I love it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Purchase","review":"We bought this for our 6-month-old son not because of the \\"Baby Einstein\\" brand, but because it only had one battery-powered feature out of nine items around the circle for him to play with. Our son had not really taken to many \\"gadgets\\", i.e. his bouncy seat, swing, etc. until we bought this. It keeps his attention, he can chew on most of the toys (a big plus as he is teething) and he always smiles when we put him in it.One (wierd) aside, the triangle top on the three-shaped stacked toy has a realistic picture of a fire-engine on it with engine number \\"69\\" prominently displayed on its front. Maybe this is just my adult mind running wild, but is this some kind of sick joke by the company, or only a coincidence??? I didn't find it funny, or cute, or however they intended it or not...Other than that negative, it is well designed and our son loves it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Incredible!","review":"This activity center is amazing! We took our 5 month old daughter to the store with us to test all the various brands and models. This center was the only one that she was able to reach every toy in. In addition this center provided her with multiple interesting toys. The other centers had toys that she could care less about (this might have to do with the fact that all the charectors and songs were straight out of her Baby Einstein DVDs). We have had it for about a week now and it is by far her favorite toy. I would buy one for a friend in a heartbeat! By the way, I read some of the reviews regarding hazardous ribbons, I bought mine almost a week ago and it came without ribbons on the three tier plush toy. I believe that the manufacturer has taken care of the problem, so no worries!"},{"rating":"2","title":"LOVE THIS","review":"As soon as your baby starts to get tired of bouncy seats - this is the next product! My daughter started loving this at 3.5 months. You can put your baby in it as soon as they can hold their heads up well. YOu don't have to wait until they can sit. They can use their hands to turn themselves in the toy before their legs are long enough to touch the floor.Hours of entertainment! I like how the toys are more interactive than all the other play activity centers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Product's engineering stinks.","review":"I'm sure many people disagree with me but I think how this activity area's made is very poor. I wonder if its just me or does the seat snaps seem cheap. The eyeholes to the fabric don't fit to the clips on the seat and they break or warp. The company sent us a new plastic seating and they still have the same issue. The plastic seat seems so cheap compared to the rest of the product.The rest of the stuff looks great but our daughter can't use it because of their seat design flaw. Any company can make toys now, but making the structure to hold it needs to be relooked at by this company. I give this a thumbs down. I'm returning it."},{"rating":"2","title":"AMAZING!!!","review":"As a teacher, I registered for this because of the Einstein name. I COULD NOT BE HAPPIER WITH IT!!! My son is four and a half months old and loves it! I can't say that about all of his toys!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Safety Concerns With Seat and Rings","review":"My wife and I were happy with this product until we had an issue where the seat came undone from the rings while our 6-month old daughter was using it. Since she ended up falling through along with the seat we decided to stop using the product. We also had previous issues with the legs and base where one leg does not stay extended to the floor, causing the product to be out of balance - not a safety issue but certainly a bit inconvenient. We had received the ExerSaucer as a gift and had been using both but now just use the ExerSaucer exclusively and are much happier with that product. I would not use the Baby Einstein Activity Center again nor would I recommend this product to anyone. Certainly not typical of our experience with either Graco (the manufacturer) or any other Baby Einstein products."},{"rating":"2","title":"my son loves this","review":"Any toy that can give a new mom 10 to 45 minutes of time is great.

As soon as i put it together i was confused as to what my son would find entertaining (especially for 80 bucks!!) Kellen loves some of the Baby Einstein books so i thought this might be something he would enjoy, but really it dosen't do anything! He is 6 months old and LOVES his Jumperoo but just kind of stood in this thing and didn't really know what to do (maybe because there really isn't anything to keep him occupied!) I did take it back and buy him the Evenflo/Smartsteps exersaucer active learning center which has made the world of difference to him! He is having a wonderful time in his new exersaucer!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A walker does its job","review":"We have both SmartSteps Exersaucer and Baby Einstein walkers. One is at my MIL's place, other is at home.In my opinion, SmartSteps Exersaucer is the ultimate walker, while Baby Einstein, 20 dollars cheaper, does its job fine, too.While assembling, my husband noticed that SmartSteps Exersaucer had a few designs are better than Baby Einstein.For example, SmartSteps Exersaucer has extra springs in its legs. My son likes to jump, the SmartSteps Exersaucer would bounce with him. Some toys are detachble so it is like having extra toys around.As far as fun for the baby, I feel my son had just enough fun in the Baby Einstein walker. Though SmartSteps Exersaucer has a lot more toys, I am not sure if it makes him happier."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"1st time mommy\\"","review":"This activity center was a great choice for our son. He loves it, and we do too. It keeps him occupied for quite some time. It was very easy to assemble, and it is easy to clean! We purchased it for our son at 4 months of age. At first, we thought it was too early to introduce it, but it worked out fine. As he got older, he interacted with the toys more and more, and now at 7 1/2 months he is still not bored of it and uses quite frequently. We haven't had any experience with other activity centers, so its unfair to say that this one is the best, but I would highly recommend it as a first choice! You can't go wrong!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Super","review":"We love this activity center. It's very educational and is great at teaching hand/eye coordination.

It arived without all of the pieces, so they had to send me another one. The second one was missing pieces too. Between the two, I finally got everything. After putting it together, I noticed the top leaned to one side. The large peice that makes animal sounds is too heavy for the unsupported placement. The stuffed piece with the shaped did not last long. My baby pulled it off right away and it would not go back on."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's not really that interesting","review":"Our baby got bored after only a 15min. There just isn't that much stuff to interact with. He just figured it out and then was done. It's really just stuff to look at with a few things that make sounds. I would try borrowing one first before you buy. It is a big item to have around the house if your child won't get that much use out of it."},{"rating":"2","title":"LOVE Baby Einstein!","review":"Just another Great product by Baby Einstein! My baby loves this activity center. It is bright, colorful, educational and entertaining. Worth every penny!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Love the product, but needs some work","review":"I purchased this activity center a couple of months ago and my son loves it. The only problem is when you need the activity center to stay stationary you need to push the legs down. The product came with two defective legs. I called Graco and they gladly sent me two new legs. Within a week the third leg would not stay in position, again I contacted Graco and they sent me the third leg. I would have given this product five stars if it wasn't for the leg issue. I still recomment this product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great","review":"We bought this for my son when he was around 5 months and he loves it.

We started putting her in it when she was around 4 months old. She will play happily in this for at least half an hour at a time at least twice a day. She squeals with happiness when she's in her activity center. She \\"makes music\\" by randomly hitting the animal keys. She twirls around in her seat and she rocks back and forth. She's had all of the toys in her mouth many, many times, and everything is still in excellent shape. I don't know what we would do without this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thank God for Baby Einstein","review":"This is a lifesaver. I originally purchased the Leap Frog Learning Station which my son absolutely loves, but he is a big boy. At 30 inches and only 7 1/2 months, he has far outgrown the Leap Frog, so we needed something just as fun and educational that would work with his height. Fortunately, this entertainer grows with your child up to 32 inches which still gives him time to play and learn. All of the other enteratiners have a max height of 30 inches =( I highly recommend this product especially if you have an above average child as we do!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Choking Hazard-Product Recall","review":"BEWARE THIS PRODUCT HAS BEEN RECALLEDMy baby choked on the plastic coating of the blocks on this toy.

CHOKING HAZARD!!!","review":"This morning our 11 month old granddaughter was in the activity center watching TV with my husband right next to her. He noticed that she was choking. To make a long story short, we did the back blows on her back and kept her tilted on her tummy upside down. Waiting for the paramedics to arrive a piece of cellophane finally came out of her mouth and she was okay. After examining the play activity center we were horrified to discover that the piece of cellophane had come off of the 3 stack toy. The cellophane covers the pictures on the toy and our granddaughter had picked the cellophane off and put it in her mouth. We wanted to warn other users of this choking hazard. This toy should be removed from the activity center immediately. We will be contacting Graco, and everyone else that we can think of to get this problem resolved. It makes us sick to think of what a senseless tradgedy could have occured, due the activity center that she enjoyed so much."},{"rating":"2","title":"A MUST HAVE!","review":"Thank goodness we have this! Our son LOVES it and will play in it even when he's falling asleep on his feet! The only \\"bad\\" part of it, in my opinion is how hard you have to press the pictures of the animals to get the sound or word. He's got it down now, but at 5 months when he started using it, he just couldn't do it. He loves all the toys and works his way around the entire thing at will. I like the adjustable legs that will allow this to grow with him. After reading some comments about choking hazards, I immediately checked his exer-saucer and found no cellophane anywhere, no paint or anything peeling and no ribbons on anything, and he chews on everything. We especially love the hand puppet to play with him while he's in it. The tray is big enough to put cheerios on, for when he wants to keep playing through snack time. We can put him in this and actually sit down and eat dinner (with him nearby, not unsupervised) or watch a TV show!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Plastic Covering Tearing Off Shape Tower - Hazard!","review":"While I have been very pleased with many Baby Einstein products - from videos, to books, play gyms, etc. - I was extremely alarmed this evening when I sat down to play with my 6 month old son who was seated in the Exer-Saucer. Upon inspection, I found that the plastic layer covering the pictures on the Shape Tower (square, cylinder, triangle) was flaking away! I would expect that all the items on the Exer-Saucer should tolerate normal \\"teething\\". We immediately removed the Shape Tower from the tray, but I am now concerned about the remaining items durability.

Called Graco, ordered replacement parts. They arrived within 10 days. However, even after we replaced the hinges, the legs would buckle - the area were the hinge is aparently has gotten wider and the hinge doesn't stay put. I agree with another reviewer that 4 legs would be better than 3.I also agree with other reviewers that the 3 language feature is useless.My son is 14mo now, over 25lb and he still plays in it for 15-20 min stretches.

Yes, the seat is hard to remove, but most of them are.

I wouldn't have bought it if it were easy to take apart, to me, that would not be safe. My son is 11 months old and we have had this since he was 6 weeks old and he still plays in it occasionly.

He seemed to really enjoy it...he especially likes the music that he can make by hitting the same animal button 3 times. However, the buttons are very close together so a wildly smacking hand can't necessarily hit with precision...he'd get very frustrated if he accidentally hit a different animal and started the process over again rather than make music. It'd probably be a little better if the buttons were spaced a little further part for little uncoordinated hands. I think my son would have also enjoyed a slight bounce function that some of the other saucers have. However, I still think this is a great toy and definitely recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"mildly entertaining for baby, but wicked ANNOYING to clean.","review":"We have one of these and it does keep the babies interest somewhat. Though I don't see the point to the hand puppet, and the blue spinning thing with the metal in it sounds as if they didn't put more than 1 washer in it. Also the sun isn't quite flexible enough for baby to chew on easily. But our daughter LOVES the sound generator.Anyway, compared to other brands I dislike this product on two grounds.One, it is damn near impossible to clean. Nothing snaps in or out, it is VERY annoying to disassemble. 1/10 for cleaning. Anyone who's even been around children realizes how important this is, no idea why this is so awful.Two, it isn't portable at all. Many of the competing products fold down shorter for tossing into the trunk or front seat. This is fixed in size or taller if needed. the top and bottom do not easily pop apart without tools either."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best one yet","review":"I have 3 boys, the oldest 9, the youngest 7 mths. Each of my children have had an exesaucer of some kind, and this one is by far the best that I've bought.

My 2 year old dances to the music, and my 7 mth old just loves to sit and play.

My son loved it, but the problem we had was that the toys (the ones that were pre-attached and the ones we attached)are not anchored well and keep falling off. Some I was able to re-attach after getting creative, others, like the star and the soft blocks I can't get back on at all. Also, the screws for the animal sounds toy weren't long enough and so that toy (the one that makes the animal sounds & music and says the animal's name in 2 languages) kept falling off as well.I gave my other exersaucers to my daycare and after 3 years they're still in one piece, if this one would just stay together it would've been great."},{"rating":"1","title":"Baby Einstein Blah","review":"I recently received this as a gift. I usually enjoy Baby Einstein products but this was the worst one I've encountered. I have barely had this toy for two weeks and the mirror on the book is peeling off! The musical and talking button are far too low to hear even on the high setting. My son is very uncomfortable in the seat with the thin cloth covering the hard plastic backing.

The Baby Einstein is much too high even at the lowest level. She could not touch the ground until about 6 1/2 months and cannot turn the seat easily. The toys are fine, but for double the price of some of the others, my daughter still will only stay in this one for about 10 minutes where she goes crazy in the other ones for 1/2 the price.

The next day, he wasn't interested in it anymore. Then I got him rainforest jumperoo by fisher price, much better choice! The jumperoo, he could play for hours, but when he plays with the graco einstein, he's bored after 10 minutes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Baby Einstein Entertainer","review":"I would recommend this product to parents.

It's too bad really as she simply loved it but it is too dangerous for her to use."},{"rating":"1","title":"not that great","review":"My son has beheaded the sun and one of the legs does not stay put on the non rocking feature....but what a pain to bring back to Babies r us......and he really does not last long in this thing...consider something else..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wouldn't & Couldn't be without this!","review":"This is a wonderful toy. Our 7 month old daughter has been enjoying this since she turned 4 months old. We bought it because she loved the ones similar to it at her day care. She is entertained for upwards of 30 minutes. It is sturdy and I feel very comforable with her in it. There is plenty of room to grow but still gives her stabilizing support while she learns to balance and support her upper body. It was more expensive than most of the others but the quality of this product is well worth it. I have washed the seat a number of times and I clean it with lysol and it shows NO signs of wear at all, its like new!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Problems with base and legs","review":"Although my son loves this playcenter, we have had continous problems with the three legs that are suppose to hold the base off the ground. We have been using the toy for about a month and a half and I have had to contact Graco twice because the red legs keep popping which drops the base to the floor. Un- fortunately, it doesn't happen simultaneously which leaves the playcenter uneven and dangerous for my son to be in. At this point I wish I would have purchased an exersaucer that was a bit bouncy so that this problem would not occur. Graco has already sent me three need legs and I am now awaiting a new base and new legs. Even though Graco has been helpful, all I want is my money back so I can purchase a safer toy for my son."},{"rating":"1","title":"Defective Parts Galore","review":"I have to agree with the Dad from Maryland. I have purchased numerous Baby Einstein products for my son including all of the DVDs and most of the toys. We love all of them, but this item.This product is a nightmare and has numerous defective parts. The round musical box fell off the first time it was used (the screw would not hold it on), the cloth seat would not go back on after we took it off to wash it the first time and will not stay in place making the product unusable. A big disappointment to my son and his parents. It would also be great if the parts came off easier and were all machine washable. Don't waste your money on this one until they make some serious design changes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect","review":"My 6 month old was always a fan of Baby Einstein videos. So, I decided to purchase this entertainer because he loves the videos and characters. He fell in love with it since the first day. Unlike other exersaucers, this particular one has toys all around the saucer. It also has more toys than most.This is why I decided to purchase it. He loves it, and of course he's familiar with the music the toy plays. The first day when the music was playing he thought it was the T.V. and looked at it (it was off) it was pretty funny.I love this product and would recommend it to anyone whose baby loves Baby Einstein videos/products."},{"rating":"2","title":"Developmentally Divine","review":"My daughter is almost 4 months old & at the stage where she needs to be entertained all the time. My Mother & I went shopping & after exploring several different exersaucers, we decided on the Baby Einstein Caterpillar Discover Play Center & let me just say it was a lifesaver. Not only does it help develop my daughters fine motor skills but it helps her learn \\"cause & effect\\". I also loved how it says the types of animals in spanish. The only drawback is that it needs wheels on the bottom to move it from room to room easier. Other than that, it's great & I would recommend it to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"AAAAHHHHHHH!!!!!!","review":"Where do I begin... My son loved this at first until my sister got another brand and I saw all the lights and noise that one had. He got bored very fast with this one. One of the pieces came off so easily that I dont even know where it is abymore. I am giving it away so that my Daughter does not have to use it. Also one of the feet on is became so lose that when you would try to push it down that when you alked away it would just pop back up. It is also very hard to clean. The seat is very hard to get off to wash. Also when I would pull my son out the seat would always... I mean always come with him. The side that has the noise part is so heavy that now that side is warped down. Also not to mention most of the the other brands are easy to break down so that you can take them places. NOT THIS ONE. If I would have known about all of this I would NOT have bought it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Harrys mom","review":"Love this product! My baby loves to sit in this and watch the Baby Einstein movies.

We got it as a gift for my baby shower and put it together last month. Evan loves to sit in it and grabs at the toys. He can't quite reach the bottom yet, but that doesn't stop his enjoyment. We had no problems putting it together, and have had no problem with the top coming off the legs. As for the 3 stack toy, I will watch closely to see if there is any fraying at the sewn edges. I recommend this toy to keep baby occupied and happy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Free kindle book has portion missing","review":"This is a collection of stories held together by a central narrative (think Canterbury Tales) But don't bother downloading this free book. You just get past the preliminary narrative and into the first tale and a large part of the first tale is missing! So you can make absolutely NO sense of the first story. (This was not a download problem because I re-downloaded and the segment was still missing.) Plus the formatting is bad throughout the book, with half lines of print. I reported the missing portion to Amazon and eventually it might get fixed, but for now you can download another copy of this book (Annotated version) for $2 which has a working Table of Contents allowing you to access any of the tales directly. I love Wilkie Collins and this book is worth reading if you are a fan, just skip this free version."},{"rating":"1","title":"Two defective units in a row!","review":"I purchased this MR16 from American Musical Supply. It was defective from the start. I pressed power, the LED screen lit up for 1 second and immediately shut off. I exchanged it for another one. This happened on both the original return and the replacement. Ridiculous. This was not a refurbished item. It was BRAND NEW! I am shocked that a brand with Fostex's reputation can churn out this defective garbage. If it was only the first one, I would write it off as a fluke, but this is clearly more common than that."},{"rating":"2","title":"THIS BOOK DEMONSTRATES THE GENIUS OF POE.","review":"EDGAR ALLAN POE WAS PROBABLY THE GREATEST AMERICAN AUTHOR WHO EVER LIVED.

As a matter of fact, I still remember some of it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Information on Becoming One With the Universe","review":"While it goes without saying that it's unlikely that a person could achieve enlightenment through a single book, I think this work is an excellent introduction to manifesting your desires through Unity Consciousness. This book has good, practical advice on Meditation, the use of Mantras and Sutras, and the utilization of the Vedic spiritual tradition as a mean of becoming aligned with universal intention. I have yet to find a book that gives an understandable account of the link between Quantum Physics and manifestation of personal desires. This book makes a good effort and is interesting, but I remain, sadly unenlightened. Maybe it's more about the journey than the destination."},{"rating":"2","title":"Spontaneous Fulflillment of Desire","review":"I am loving this book, it's such a great buy! It definitely helps you see in a whole different way how we are all interconnected and we are all ONE. It also makes you feel part of everything and to see the world and personal situations in life as \\"miracles\\", even the \\"negative\\" stuff in life...I'm loving it!

These tapes were listened to so many times that I just about wore the tapes out. So I ordered this CD set The Spontaneous Fulfillment of Desire\\", and I was even more impressed.

Long before the so-called-secret came around, Dr. DeePak Chopra was writing about the science of vibrational levels, about the frequency of objects, about the power of thought and meditation. For many decades Dr. Chopra has lived the life, walked the talk and written the volumes from the most acceptable viewpoint of a scientist. He seems to be ahead of his times with a large portion of the planet certainly coming to the same focus. This book truly is an act of courage and an act of love. The reader will ponder life from a wonderfully fresh perspective, and will soon realize there is no such thing as coincidence. Coincidence is but a mirror we draw to us through our individual frequencies of the law of attraction. This book deserves far more stars than 5!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Listening towards Enlightenment","review":"This is for the audio version. Chopra shows new ways of thinking to help us down our path of enlightenment. His thoughts are wise, in line with other masters yet with a new perspective, doable. In this audio book he has practical and interesting excercises to help you realize many of the perscriptions he reccomends. It is a bit frustrating to rewind on the iPod to get to the correct section to do each excercise but worth it since his voice aides in acheiving the meditative outlook he often suggests. As a listening expereince, he reads his book with clarity, interest and emotion - very well done and very enjoyable. Overall this was an excellent experience."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love this book","review":"Leave it to the venerable Deepak Chopra to subtly explain Quantum Physics in words that make ME understand the whole concept for the first time.

Part punk, part ska, part classic rock, part -- uh -- bluegrass, the Meat Puppetswill move your body and challenge your brain in ways you didn't think possible. Although later albums garnered more commercial success, Forbidden Places is by far the most solidly crafted album that the now defunct band released. Tender ballads alternate with searing, smokingly fast guitar-driven rock, all united by lyrics that are half acid-rock free-association, half TMBG-style wordplay. They were even covered by TMBG (whirlpool), and it's indicative of their talent that I like the original better than the cover, even though TMBG is my favorite band.

The system still had R12 in it so all I had to do was have the R12 evacuated and then install this kit and charge. The local garage evacuated the system for free, likely because they got to keep the R12. Using this kit was basically as simple as screwing on two fittings and charging the system. Because the capacity of the F150's system is so large I did have to add an additional can of 134a, but for most cars the 33oz included in the kit should be plenty.One of the things about this kit is that you are supposed to leave the original oil in the system and there is supposed to be chemicals in the included cans that make it compatible with 134a. In addition there is additional oil as well as stop leak premixed in the cans. This certainly simplifies the process. I will not know though how reliable this \\"mix\\" ends up being for some time, but I can say that the vents are blowing cold which is a major improvement."},{"rating":"2","title":"good western","review":"This western is prettygood, doesn't have a lot of foul, vulgar language that most people seem to enjoy hearing in a movie these days.

This is a definite must read for fans of mythology and epic heroes. The story centers around Gilgamesh, the partly divine ruler of Uruk, who is troubled by the fact he will one day die. Through the course of his life he goes on great adventures, slaying beasts that dwell in the forest and trekking through darkness in search of immortality. The feats are not without their effects, however. By the end, Gilgamesh will have become a different man than he was before. Symbolically, the story addresses issues of friendship, bravery, how we are changed by living our lives, the relationship between refined culture and nature, and how we constantly deny our own mortality. \\"The Epic of Gilgamesh\\" is an excellent, philosophical tale of one's search for meaning in a brief life."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Epic all should read.","review":"The Epic of Gilgamesh is a classic that all people should read regardless of age, language, or regional location. The Narrative provides an insight into the culture and story telling ability of early man, and should be held in great regard. Complaints about this epic are frequently about the omissions of certain parts of the text and the content being difficult to grasp. These arguments with clever thought do not stand the test of time it is truely a wonder that this work has survived as long as it has and that the content is still an epic that produces excitement and wonder."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good intro from diverse sources","review":"Although not an original translation, this redaction by N.K. Sanders combines versions Sumerian, Akkadian and Hittite texts. The prose flows very well (almost like the King James Bible). The introductory history and map provide helpful background information.Its amazing though over 4,000 years old, that there are very modern elements. Here man first begins to define a \\"self\\". There is dream interpretation that historically is continued with Joseph in the Bible and still alive with Carl Jung. Some symbols, such as the slaying of the Lion are ancient and almost universal. The Flood story shows up here, and perhaps latter repeated (or in a new form) in the Bible and Noah, with new meaning. What's fun about these myths is that they are compact and open to interpretation. For example, I perhaps see the defeat of Humbaba (the guardian of the Cedar Forest), as the start of our environmental crisis."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great epic, bad edition","review":"First off, I have never thaught I would give Gilgamesh anything less than five stars. However, I recently received Andrew George's translation (the more reccent translation in the Penguin Classics series) and earlier today got my hands on a copy of this edition and decided to compare them. I found this edition very incomplete (George's is currently the most complete form) and like another reviewer said an unneccisarilly long introduction (at least for a translation that short). So while I do recomend Gilgamesh to everybody I would not recomend this (N. K. Sandars) translation and would instead recomend the one by Andrew George (unless you want more myths from Babylon and that area in which case I would recomend Myths From Mesopotamia by Stephanie Dalley her translation while not as complete is still one of the best I've read)."},{"rating":"1","title":"DO NOT BUY THIS... NOT THE CURRENT PAPERBACK EDITION","review":"Warning. Do not buy this edition. It is NOT the current Penguin edition translated by Andrew George, but the digitization of the elderly N.K.

Literature gave this work a rave review, however I found it cliched and with many references that have not aged well. It is very derivative and employs most of the generic stock events from B-grade paperbacks.Also, most of the jokes will be lost on readers, as they refer to events that long ago passed into the historical record.However, probably the novel's biggest problem is its attempt to do 'too much'. A lot like the recent film \\"Clash of the Titans\\", the author appears to have relied on introducing sensational mythical creatures in place of a well-fleshed-out storyline that engages with the modern reader."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'd prefer \\"The Odyssey\\"...","review":"This \\"book\\" was a bit hard to read. The introduction was longer than the actual story. It provided some good background information, but also gave away much of what was to come. Perhaps some of it could have been saved for the end of the book? The story itself is very confusing. Gilgamesh, a god-king, is hated by his people so they pray to the gods to make an equal for him. His equal and him basically fight, go on \\"adventures\\" that seem to have no meaning, and visit people/gods with similar hard to pronounce names. If you are studying Mesopotamia, you should probably check out this epic. Otherwise, try something else..."},{"rating":"1","title":"School Related","review":"I had to read this book for school. I was tired of it after the first page. How was this story so popular back then? It's boring and unreal. C'mon! One guy lived with animans most of his life anf Gilgamesh was part god. I know a story of a real hero, Neo from The Matrix. That guy is cool and interesting. Also, he is cool to watch. Gilgamesh would never become a movie. People would fall asleep. Besides, any school book isn't fun to read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Draws From Different Gilgamesh Texts","review":"Rather than simply relying on the version of the Epic which survived in Assurbanipal's palace in Nineveh, the author picks and chooses her sources, relying usually on the Ninevite Recension but sometimes on other extant Gilgamesh texts such as the Sumerian poems which were a source for the Assyrians.A disappointing aspect is that the author has not translated the work herself but rather collated and rewritten existing translation. She is quite upfront about it, and views her contribution as having created a very readable version of Gilgamesh to supplement the academic translations available. And that she has."},{"rating":"1","title":"Missing parts of story!","review":"I bought this book on my Kindle for class, and it was missing several parts of the tablets!

From the beginning when King Gilgamesh \\"tames\\" a savage man by sending him a priestess of the temple dedicated to the god of eros. The text explains repeatedly how priestess was assigned to throw off her cloak, lay before the savage in the wilderness with her legs open and convert him with her \\"arts.\\"The direct sexuality between Enkidu and the priestess, which lasts for a full week is entwined with homo-erotic discussion about the relationship between Gilgamesh and Enkidu. Prior to meeting Enkidu, Gilgamesh had stolen the virginity of every bride in his kingdom, but the tamed savage apparently tames the insatiable lust of the king as after meeting Enkidu, caressing him as he would a woman and becoming \\"the best of friends\\", the king no longer harasses his subjects.I never expected this story to be so sexy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good book","review":"fine book arrived on time good shape as expected done with review etc etc etc and so forth and so on"},{"rating":"2","title":"Not Much Has Changed","review":"The beauty in reading this is the understanding that not much has changed in the past 2500 years.

I recently threw it out after less then two years of use because it was just garbage. Its a nice style, but the product itself is not good quality and not worth the money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Style - Poor Quality","review":"Although the design is wonderful, I am very sorry to say I am greatly disappointed with the quality of this dresser.Many of the interior pieces have no finish applied to them, most notably the drawer backs. The back of dresser is a piece of cardboard which is nailed in place.Also disturbing is the top was damaged in several places, despite no damage to the shipping container. This seems to be a recurring problem, which other reviewers have mentioned. Most of the areas could be touched up, however one area in the left rear edge is dinged badly and is defying any means of touch up.One plus in addition to the style of the unit, is the drawer glides. They were challenging to install due to an error in the instructions, but they work wonderfully.For the money I would expect at least quality with all pieces finished inside and out and a laminated back to the dresser.I would also hope they package the top better to prevent the damage that seems to occur from shipping."},{"rating":"1","title":"Looks are deceving!!!!

Once it was finished we noticed a ll the chips, cracks and scratches from shipping, and all we were provided was a black marker to conceal them.

I thought the market for traditional metal and Power metal died by the end of 1991 because it refused to expand into new territory. It seems that in the past seven years though, legions of new Power metal/traditional Metal bands have managed to resurrect two Metal subgenres that died for a reason. This music makes me want to bury my head in the sand (the same way an ostrich does).P.S.: Come on metalheads, stop being such tools and support Death metal. I recommend starting out with Death's \\"Symbolic\\", At the gates' \\"Terminal spirit disease\\", Dark tranquility's \\"Skydancer/Of chaos and eternal night\\", Amon amarth's \\"Versus the world\\", and In flames' \\"The jester race\\".

I never thought epic metal was really appealing, since I doubt electric guitars mix well with medieval atmospheres. But I do think people like Ronnie James Dio were wise enough to keep the music somewhat on a different level than what it tried to represent. Imagery is one thing, being a parody is somewhat different. This CD sounds like a group that's actually trying to make fun of epic metal. Unless you're into this stuff (being it COMPLETE devotion to the most cartoon-like wannabe Superhero Knights) I recommend to avoid this like the plague."},{"rating":"2","title":"Truely a Sovereign Band","review":"If you like neo-classical then this album is for you.

The cd flows along wonderfully, however I could do without the narration stuff in between songs, but other that, it's total magic. The musicianship is top notch and the melodies are simply awesome.Wings of Destiny has to be the greatest ballad ever written!! Every time I play that song it just hits me like a Ton Of Bricks (Metal Church reference!!). It just so full of emotion, it's down right moving, touching is what it is.Simply put, this cd is a great release from an amazing band."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent","review":"The second album from Rhapsody kicks it better than the first, more epic sounding and the last song spans many genres of music from metal, classical to medieval chants and the woman's voice in the middle sounds excellent.

I'd definatly buy their fourth soon."},{"rating":"2","title":"beautiful, haunting, and evocative.","review":"I write in order to counter the article written by a Mr Gill. I am a big Jarrett fan and have many of his albums; this is by far my favourite. Mr Gill is correct in the sense that yes, the general interpretation of the standards is \\"looser\\" than usual. This looseness allows for greater creativity within the bounds of the structures. The piano playing on this album is especially lyrical, and as for his own solo introductions (such as the preface to \\"My Funny Valentine\\"), they are moving in the extreme. I barely notice his alleged \\"burblings\\", so magnificent is his improvisation. As always his statement of the melody carries that Jarretesque roundness and clarity of tone. This album is an essential for any jazz lover, who wants to hear standards as they should be played."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ranking at Best.","review":"I'm not sure what prompts certain professed \\"purists\\" to low mark Jarrett for grunts or play the dismantle-his-genius game pursuant to other alleged impurities. Want no grunts? Sterility in plastic piano capsules? Want perfecto piano playing by stiff aficionados who, like the \\"purists\\" they cater to, are also too timid to let out a good soul-body grunt? The music world is asphyxiated with them so no need to look far. Or do you want a Jarrett bright as an angel and way up on his wing? Then look no further and grab this CD set.

It's not that easy to deploy, unless you are highly proficient at slipping on tight fitting covers (for reasons that perhaps no one else should ever need to know).2. There is an opening (duh), so it's by no means full protection from all 6 directions.3. The thin cover does not protect against the school of hard knocks; just against scratches.Pretty satisfied with the product overall since I knew exactly what i was buying into."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent as always","review":"Have read all of Goddards books, and definitely recommend this one, (as all the others!). Shows the pain of his old friends suicide but also reflects on the law of the issue. Shows a realistic view of England, and the area. Great read, that had to be read in one sitting!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"great english mysteries","review":"Goddard follows in that fine English tradition of crafting intense mysteries that are, prehaps, more refined than their American counterparts. This book was recommended to me by a British friend as being 'very British' and indeed it is so. For those who wish there was one more Agatha Christie novel."},{"rating":"2","title":"Haunting tale of lies and intrigue","review":"Today, Chris Napier must make a final decision. A decision that was set in motion the day his childhood friend Nicky Lanyon asked him, \\"Who killed my father?\\"It is a bizarre, but sincere, question from a broken man because Nicky's father was hanged years earlier for the murder of Chris' great-uncle, whose death was the source of the Napier fortune. A question that nags Chris and demands an answer when Nicky commits suicide. A question that sets Chris on a long journey through three families' histories and the ramifications the truth brings.Robert Goddard has written a twisting haunting tale of lies and intrigue much in the style of Kate Morton's The Forgotten Garden or Iain Pear's Stone's Fall. A good story that will linger long after the final page."},{"rating":"1","title":"No sting","review":"I admit it -- I never of Merritt before 69 Love Songs, but now I know why. The incredible songwriting and humor of Love Songs came out of nowhere -- there's nothing on this record that would even hint at it. The songs here are mostly flat, the singing incredibly tame and insipid for a bunch of \\"indie\\" heroes. Barbara Manning, e.g., should be recording children's albums. Three or four songs are somewhat memorable, but this is strictly for diehard fans."},{"rating":"1","title":"bland","review":"I liked:2:Aging Spinsters6:Pillow Fight13:Puerto Rico Waythe rest sounded a bit bland. The song lengths are not to long which is good because even if these songs were any longer they would start to be boring."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lush synth-pop with hipper-than-hip vocal support.","review":"Pop Kulcher Review: Stephin Merritt writes sensitive pop-poetry, and his band, the Magnetic Fields, has put out some albums of melodic ditties with lovelorn lyrics and lo-fi (primarily synthesizer-driven) instrumentation. But far better is this one-shot effort as The 6ths (the band name & album title were chosen as a tongue-twister: try saying it out loud), in which Merritt turns over vocal duties to a Who's Who of alternative rock heroes (including Dean Wareham of Luna, Lou Barlow of Sebadoh, Mac McCaughan of Superchunk, Georgia Hubley of Yo La Tengo, Robert Scott of the Bats, Mitch Easter, Barbara Manning, etc.). So the album manages to sound a bit like a cover-song compilation, with Merritt's sweet melodies, quiet keyboards and guitars, and simple but moving lyrics being the constants holding the whole thing together. It's a lush treat that should not be missed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Warning - Perfect Pop Song Included Here!","review":"Falling Out Of Love (With You) is the perfect pop song on an exceptional album.'Nuff said."},{"rating":"2","title":"superduper!","review":"A friend lent me this CD and I couldn't give it back until I'd bought myself my very own copy. It's tunes and lyrics are addictive and even though most of the songs are about sad topics, they make me feel as though that sadness is something to celebrate. It is *very* 80's and that's a big plus in my book."},{"rating":"2","title":"No. 1!!!","review":"This book was so easy to read. You come to love Precious. Every case is different! It lets you see into present-day Africa. I enjoyed this book very much and look forward to reading all the others!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I love the whole series!! Read them all!","review":"I'll keep it brief, since there are plenty of other reviews here, but hands-down, one of the best books I've read in the past ten years. The prose is pure joy. The mysteries Precious Ramotswe uncovers in her detective work are wonderful looks inside African culture and the human psyche. The humor is life-affirming and lovely. Read this book first, then the whole series. You'll be glad you did!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply delightful!","review":"Everyone loves these books, and no one can really narrow down why they are so utterly lovable.It would say it is in part due to the sheer simplicity of the writing, the divine descriptions of nature and the beauty of the image McCall Smith portrays of Botswana. The foriegn-ness of the themes and the exotic-ness of the main story relating to the witch doctor, as well as the colours and life of the covers.Additionally, the lovability of characters, particularly the main character, with her completely un-Western notion of the body beautiful, her enduring sensitivity regarding the death of her baby and her enchanting love of her father. The devotion of her fiance is also gorgeous.Perhaps the appeal of these works is the fact they suggest a fundamental life we essentially aspire for. Simplicity, kindness, nature, beauty. Such a different life than we of the Western world."},{"rating":"2","title":"Charm","review":"The lady detective of Botswana is utterly charming. She pursues her cases with logic and diligence. The local color in the story is delightful. It even seems that the political scene is correctly drawn when allusions are made to the rather step-child relationship Botswana has with South Africa. The cases for which clients seek solutions include an incident of witch craft, a matter of insurance fraud for an amputated finger, an instance of blurred identity in the medical profession where twins function as one physician, and a tale of a straying husband."},{"rating":"2","title":"Charming, well-written, interesting","review":"This is a charming story, with funny bits, a pleasure to read. So good in fact, that I immediately bought the other volumes. I hope the author writes as many books about the No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency as Agatha Christie wrote about her sleuths. Not only are these good stories about interesting people, the information about Botswana is intriguing and makes me curious. I'd like to learn more. Like another reviewer of this book, I have an additional recommendation to make. If you really like mysteries and good writing, be sure to read Robert Barnard's books. They are excellent."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing, a bit condescending","review":"I'm not sure why this book got such raving reviews, I certainly don't need to go on and read book 2 in the series. Perhaps it is because I listened to the audio version, but I found the tone of the writing condescending toward the culture the author is supposed to represent. Moreover, the main character is hardly compelling, and the unfolding events during the story perilously close to being simply boring."},{"rating":"2","title":"Charming, delightful and funny","review":"I loved this book. The names of people and businesses brought a smile to my heart. Having lived in East Africa for a few years, I felt a real bond wth Mma Ramotswe. She remeinded me som much of the dignity of the African women I had met. You will enjoy this book if you have any sense of whimsey."},{"rating":"2","title":"Even better aloud!","review":"I read this book to my 93 year old father. Pretty soon he was telling me he wasn't quite sleepy and hinting for another chapter. The connection that Mma Ramotswe had with her father while he was alive and even after his death was beautiful and I am sure was even more meaningful to a very old, loving father who may now think that his love will go on after he is gone. I will start the next book on my next visit and he can't wait. Good luck on pronouncing the names!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A wonderful character and feel-good book","review":"This is a character I wish I knew in real life. Warm, wise, witty -- have just ordered the three sequels because I just can't get enough of Mma.Ramotswe, the main character of this series. I also appreciated the African experience; it whets my appetite for more. If you need a lift, read this novel. You'll come away richer for the experience."},{"rating":"1","title":"Un-developed","review":"I read this in my book club; otherwise, I wouldn't have finished it. The book never gets too involved in any one story. There are many cases Precious solves, too many. I was interested in the case of the missing boy and kept waiting for that to be developed. It wound up being anti-climactic. As I read it, I thought, this is it? I did enjoy Precious life story, and how she got to own her own agency. Some of the writing is very beautiful. Other members of my book club, said the other books are much better. Sadly, I'm not interested enough to find out. As for women detectives, I LOVED Maisie Dobbs by J. Winspear"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"Having read so many glowing reviews, I picked this book up and promptly signed my name in it. When I was done - I wished I hadn't written in it, so that I could return it!!! I found this book slow moving, trite and uninspiring. Maybe if I had more knowledge of Africa and the every day slang used there, I would have become more involved in the stories. I'd say if you want a book to read that's \\"just a book to read\\", and not something you become immersed in, then this book would be ok."},{"rating":"1","title":"It was Okay","review":"This book was okay, not one of my favorites. Probably won't buy anymore. Only read it because it was my Book Club pick, but wouldn't buy another one."},{"rating":"1","title":"I Don't Get It","review":"I decided to read this book for a couple of reasons: My wife had heard a lot of good things about it and I normally love books about Africa or set in Africa as I have spent quite a bit of time there.Unfortunately what I found in this book was a poorly written, boring story with no plot. I certainly don't get what so many people seem to see in this book. Wilbur Smith it is not.I certainly don't recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"umm...am i missing something?","review":"I do not understand why this book is so popular. I am about 1/2 way through it and I am still waiting for it to catch my attention. It is such a struggle! I feel like I have to force myself to finish it because it just doesn't seem to have a plot or any sort of big story that draws me in. Maybe I am just missing some major appeal, but I would save my money and buy some other book instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Expecting More","review":"I was expecting an exciting mystery so I was somewhat disappointed with this book. The main character is an African lady thay has had some hardship in her life but she remains upbeat. She loves her Africa and in that vein, she introduces us to her Africa. That I did enjoy. The author's imagery is quite good. I guess the cases she receives are typical of Africa; but they lack any real mystery or excitement. Her approach to them is rather homey. If you would like to be introduced to Africa in a different way, then you will like this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"A master of place","review":"Funny, engaging and totally non-western. Botwsana comes alive as the stories unfold. Smith is a master in the creation of place."},{"rating":"2","title":"The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency Book 1","review":"I bought the first 3 books and couldn't put them down, so I ordered 3 more and then 3 more. They areentertaining, amusing, heart warming and teach you a lot about African way of life. Loved them all!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun, light read with sprinkling of insightful nuggets","review":"This is a really fun and light read, a perfect vacation read or when you're in the mood for something light but meatier than chicklit. It's very exciting with an event occurring in each chapter. The characters are very likeable, especially the protagonist.I liked the effective description of the setting and mood of Botswana through out the book since I haven't been to Africa and it was as of I was being transported there. I also like the nuggets of introspection by the protagonist, much food for thought.Smith's ability to write in the voice of the female protagonist is impressive, incredibly convincing."},{"rating":"2","title":"give us more books about Africa!","review":"I liked this book a lot, but I also think the fact that at least three of Alexander McCall Smith's books are on the bestseller list right now says a lot about our desire to read entertaining, dare we say hopeful stories about Africa. I am fascinated by Africa, but can only bring myself to read so much about war, suffering, drought, and starvation. Smith shows the human, day-to-day life of the continent -- may he be only the first of many!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Sweet and Simple","review":"The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency is a sweet and simple tale--an easy read that despite its simplicity will have you pondering what goes on in the novel. The novel doesn't have much of what one would call a plot, but rather contains a series of vignettes in which Mma Ramotswe recounts various clients she has helped in her detective work. She is an unconventional detective, and goes about solving the riddles posed to her in surprising ways. She also shares her personal history, telling us how she got to where she is. It is a charming tale, charming and enjoyable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Okay, so I really prefer thrillers.","review":"Call me simple, but I couldn't get through the first tape of the unabridged audio book. I tried to be patient, but after an hour, the plot still hadn't begun to take shape. Although I can't offer much in the way of a review, I nonetheless felt the need to post one, because I bought this book BECAUSE of the rave reviews. It may warm up, but all indications pointed to ramblings of cultures and complications in simple lives, and I was absolutely bored to death. The slow speech and accent of the reader may have contributed to the coma this book attempted to put me in."},{"rating":"1","title":"Review on cover of book is a lie!","review":"This is the first time in my life where I have bought a book, based on the printed reviews, and found them to be totally misleading!I am VERY displeased. The review on the cover of this book was definitely misleading. There was not one hilarious or even mildly funny episode in the ENTIRE book. I unfortunately kept reading it until the very end, thinking it has to get better. Where's all the funny stuff!!It was not written well. The story did not flow well. It is nothing but short stories about a few investigations and then WAH--LA she decides its time to get married...the end. This has to be the worst book I have ever read!I am really sorry I forked out my twelve bucks at an airport bookstore for this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"so boring","review":"I bought this book after reading all those fabulous reviews ,it was so boring that no matter how hard I forced myself I couldn't go on reading after the 40th page .You could feel that the writer was a novice from the start"},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring!!!!!!!!","review":"This book was very slow moving and lacked the ability to hold my interest. I'd recommend the Poisonwood Bible instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"A somewhat laborious read","review":"I wanted to read this book because of the positive reviews it had received. The book was hard for me to get into. I wanted the mystery to present itself sooner than it did. Too much time was spent on the main character's history, which I suppose was to set up the series. When she finally got a case, it was resolved very quickly. I realized that this book would describe several simple, quick cases she had worked on rather than having a main mystery that would serve as a plot. It was interesting to have Africa as a backdrop, but that is not enough to make me want to read other books in this series, the first book of which disappointed me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Couldn't finish.","review":"I really tried to like this as I knew someone who thought it was great. Unfortunately, I could never get into it. I must have read half the book before I finally just gave up and gave the book away."},{"rating":"1","title":"charming from start to finish","review":"Mna Ramotswe is the most colorful character to grace the pages in a long time. Her wonderful vivid accounts of Africa and its people are splendid and warm. I discovered her quite by accident and can hardly wait to find our her next excellant adventure. The audio books are a wonderful way to immerse yourself from the stresses of a busy day or a wonderful companion on a piece of exercise equipment. I hope you will enjoy the No 1. Ladies Detective agency adventures as much as I have."},{"rating":"2","title":"Entertaining story that had me transported to Botswana","review":"A truly entertaining story that had me transported to Botswana. Fascinating characters, particularly Mme Ramotswe, and such vivid descriptions that I felt as if I were there. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Moments of brilliance","review":"Moments of brilliance mixed with a nice gentle story. Quite a change from the average \\"mystery\\" or \\"detective\\" novel.A good read, but don't expect a fast pace."},{"rating":"2","title":"I was sorry when it ended","review":"No greater compliment can be given (in my opinion) except that the reader is sorely disappointed to say goodbye. I am living in a country where books in English are rarely available, and I am sometimes forced to endure dribble and pretend to enjoy it.Boy was I pleasantly surprised when this book passed into my hands. I loved the main character before the first chapter was over.The writing was charming, endearing, and unique.One of these days, I hope the second book will find it's way here."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply wonderful stories and evocative descriptions","review":"It took a few weeks for me really to get into this book. For me, it started slowly, but then I began to love the descriptions of Africa as much as the gentle mysteries that move this book along. The best proof of the book's general appeal is that I have given away at least a half dozen copies and have received warm thanks from everyone. It is a marvelous book and its episodic aspect makes it well suited to reading aloud."},{"rating":"1","title":"Simple...Charming...nothing else.","review":"After all of the hype, I had to read this. I was very disappointed. I suppose I was expecting too much. It's a light, comfortable, easy read I would feel good about putting in my child's (teen) room for the summer or taking to the beach for something quick. However, it was too light for me. No plot, short, poor dialog, very little depth to the characters. The author would start to touch on the charm of Africa, then simply abandon it in search of a story that never seemed to take hold.I am pleased to have met the charming main character, however found I could have put the book down at any time without feeling the loss. I won't be looking to read the rest in series. This was pleasant....but once is enough."},{"rating":"2","title":"A truly relaxing enjoyable read","review":"I wish there were more books written this way. I love the story and love the entire series. I've read the entire series and can't wait for the next book to come out. This is a relaxing enjoyable read with no violence, profanity or sex. A welcome change these days."},{"rating":"2","title":"A special sort of detective story.","review":"If you're looking for Arthur Conan Doyle, Agatha Christie, or Patricia Cornwell here, don't bother. This book is as much -- or more -- an extended excursion into the mind-set of Africa and especially of its female population as it is a set of sleuth puzzles. It's hard to believe that this book was written by a Scottish male. It's also a very rich and rewarding socialogical study of life in what the author considers to be one of the most successful post-colonial nations in Africa. It is episodic -- a series of cases rather than one single extended case -- and there is so much time spent on the background of the protagonist and the lifestyle of Botswana that the avid mystery fan is likely to be quite frustrated. But it is a story with its own wonderful rewards, a singularity that should be judged on its own merits rather than how it may fit into an established scheme."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wondeful","review":"At first, I was not sure if I would like this story but I ended up loving it. It was a very easy read and I fell in love with the character of Mme Ramotswe. This detective story has alot of heart and there is really good advice in it also. I recommend this book to anyone looking for a light hearted, good read."},{"rating":"2","title":"I love it, I love it, I love it!","review":"I bought this book to take on vacation, but couldn't wait and I'm so glad that I couldn't resist the temptation. I love the story of this beautiful independent woman who does what she wants with her life. The author made me feel that I was there in Botswana with the main character who \\"detectives\\" with love, wisdom, kindness and humor. This is true...I read it through once and then immediately read it again...the language is beautiful and I liked the twists. I RECOMMEND THIS BOOK 100 PERCENT and I'm going to buy all the sequels tomorrow...so I'll have some guaranteed good reading on the plane and on my two weeks in Europe... When I'm in the room in Switzerland overcoming jet lag, I'll be in Botswana!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Pleasant easy read","review":"I enjoyed this book because it was a light hearted change of pace from the darker more dramatic books I have been reading as of late. It was fun and well paced. It was easy to put down and pick right back up again, which is especially important if you are a mother of small children and have to steal away to read in small moments.I agree that there were some editorial errors as mentioned in other reviews, but I found them easy to recognize and move on. The errors didn't really deter that much from the story or, more importantly, the place the story takes the reader.After finishing the book in no time at all, I found myself eager to buy the sequels. I would recommend this book simply for the wonderful whit and observation of Mma. Romatswe and the simplicity of reading a good old fashioned detective novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Atypical mystery novel","review":"I was looking for something more like an Agatha Christie or M.M. Kaye when I picked up this book. In contrast to those books, this had little-to-no suspense. The characters are warm and the setting is interesting, but the book reads more like a series of short stories about Botswana and its people rather than a mystery. In themes, it's sort of a cross between \\"The Color Purple\\" and a Harlem-renaissance book called \\"The Conjure-Man Dies\\", but much less interesting than both. I finished the book, there were some amusing vignettes, but overall it leaves much to be desired."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lovely, lovely stay in Africa","review":"This is a delightful novel.. Life seems so peaceful in Botswana, in spite of the problems brought to Precious's delightful detective agency. You will love the setting and the characters."},{"rating":"1","title":"Slow Reading","review":"The book is too \\"wordy\\" Names and items are repeated too often. ie. \\"tiny white van\\". The characters are not believable."},{"rating":"2","title":"The No. 1 Ladies Detective Agency","review":"I had this book sent to my sister in Arizona. I know it arrived in good time, so I assume it all went smoothly. It did on my end!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I don't get it either","review":"I agree with the previous reviewer...I'm halfway through and nothing is grabbing me. I'm reading it for bookclub and hate not finishing a book, but this one for me is done. I really like a deeper storyline."},{"rating":"2","title":"THE COOL BOOK!","review":"I think this book is a really cool book. I think it is meant for older people though. The book tells about Mma Ramotswe and how she over came her past and looked for a bright new future. throughout the book, many of her cases at the No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency is described. i would recommend this book for people who like entertainment. it shows many of her thoughts and feelings that are pretty interesting. Hope you enjoy the book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"More than enjoyable","review":"These little books, charming and disarming as they are, are more than a pleasant read. They are chock full of theology. Precious Ramotswe, as human a character as you will find, teaches us the meaning of humility, gratitude, forgiveness and love."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pleasant But Tediously Thin","review":"This book received two Booker Judges' Special Recommendations in 1999 and was voted one of the International Books of the Year and the Milennium by the Times Literary Supplement, which can either be explained by British sentimentality or British condescension, but not by any special literary qualities. If you're looking for the Botswana version of Miss Read, this is your book. This isn't Inspector Morse transposed to Africa but tales of English village life, and the result is, to say the least, disorienting. Furthermore, the \\"cases\\" that Mma Ramotswe, No. 1 Ladies' Detective, investigates make the Hardy Boys look like Sam Spade. Mma Ramotswe drinks bush tea, not Twinings, but reading this book is like slowly drowning in a weak brew with far too much milk and sugar."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Mess","review":"With all the hype surrounding this book, I expected to love it. I didn't. The story begins with a slow narrative about Africa, which is where Mma Ramotswa, the main character lives. We then get a very short anecdote about a case Ramotsaw handles through her detective agency. From there, we get many pages of background information from her father's life, in her father's voice - and her father is already dead. By the time the story got back around to the detective agency, I had forgotten the book was supposed to be about a a female detective. I found the book slow and lacking in focus. Honestly, 2 stars is being generous for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"LOVED THIS BOOK!","review":"I just loved this book. It will quietly draw you in and take you to another world. I went to Botswana for a brief trip last year and fell in love with the country and I love reading McCall's descriptions and his own love for his country through Precious. This is not a book full of wild, bloody action, so if you're looking for that, you will be disappointed. Rather this is a wonderful escape from the harried world of the U.S., written with charm and love with characters that are fresh and that you wish you could meet in real life. I read the Tears of the Giraffe last week too and it was even better, introducing more wonderful characters."},{"rating":"2","title":"I Want to Visit Botswana","review":"This was such a nice surprise to find when doing my usual browsing at the book store! And so exciting to find there were three more books in the saga!Right after reading all four, I met a woman who had been in the Peace Corps in the 70's and had stayed in Botswana for eight years. Her description reaffirmed my desire to visit.It is not so much a description of the land and atmosphere that makes you want to hop on a plane, but of the people there and how straightforward and uncomplicated everything seems to be."},{"rating":"2","title":"Read knowing all the rest of the books in this series are FABULOUS, even though this first in the series is a bit weak","review":"The rest of this series is WONDERFUL. This first volume falters a bit, but it is best to start with it. Don't give up, head to the next book and devour the rest of the series. When you re-read the series over the years, as you surely will, you will probably skip this first book.I absolutely love this series and hope the first book doesn't deter people from falling in love with the rest of the series and these wonderful, wonderful characters."},{"rating":"2","title":"fabulously atmospheric","review":"The wonderfully imaginative, absorbing and playful plot of this novel is almost as fabulous as the brilliant creation of Mma Ramotswe, in my opinion one of the best characters in print. With all the gorgeous quirks of culture and language her nationality entails and her penchant for red bush tea, as well as her total integrity and endearing personality, she makes for a series one can dip into as if hearing the stories of an old friend, albeit a very interesting one.The heat, smells and beautiful details of life in Botswana are instantly transferred into the living room, train carriage or damp bus stop of the reader in this amazingly atmospheric book."},{"rating":"2","title":"no. one ladies book","review":"The book was for my son's school reading assignment. The book arrived on time and he was able to do the work he needed. I was pleased with the fact that after looking all over the place I was able to get the book from you in a matter of days."},{"rating":"2","title":"Certainly a different setting!","review":"I picked up this book because I thought it might be different, and it certainly was. It is set in Botswana, and the heroine is Precious Ramotswe. She certainly is Precious, and this book is a delight. The book is very well-written and the cases that Precious works on as she sets up her detective agency in Gaborone in Botswana are complex and interesting. These cases are presented as vignettes in the book, and I found that each one was remarkable in its own right. And Precious herself is a treasure. She is portrayed as a full-figured African woman who is terribly interested in everyone else's business. And really, shouldn't a private detective be interested in everything that is going on? This looks like a promising series."},{"rating":"2","title":"funny","review":"I loved her thinking--common sense and morals! I had trouble with the names. The descriptions of the surroundings were great."},{"rating":"2","title":"A real pleasure","review":"Mma Ramotswe - a true heroine in an intriguing part of the world whose tales will leave you craving for ever more of her entertaining adventures in crime and mystery."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice, light reading","review":"I enjoyed learing more about the Botswana culture from this book and the short, mini mysteries were interesting and humerous at times. It was a very quick and easy read. I'm not so sure what all the hype is about this book...it is not one that I would say is a must read, or even a book that I would pass on to a friend. I wasn't drawn into the book or touched in any way by this story, but it was a nice, relaxing read. I did also read The next one in this series and feel the same about The Tears of the Giraffe."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works for me","review":"My mother in law turned me on to these books. I read the first one in a day and went to the library for the rest. I am dying to know what Bush Tea is like. I loved the simplicity and honesty of Botswana. I'd love this whole series to be on PBS or a movie. And the main character had better be a 'traditionally built' Botswanan woman! It's fun and entertaining to read. I love these characters."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Story","review":"This book is not a deep difficult book to read. It would be a great book for a plane or doctor's office because most chapters tell their own story."},{"rating":"2","title":"Heartwarming book","review":"The No. 1 Ladies Detective Agency is the delightful first story of Precious Ramotswe, a single woman in Botswana who opens a detective agency and is immediately besieged with calls for help. Precious helps a woman to find her husband, shows another that a man is really just after her money, and tries to determine if someone has been the victim of witchdoctors. Precious is a likable character, and I think it is her warmth that makes the book work so well. She was once, at a much younger age, the victim of bad judgment herself, when she got married too quickly to the wrong man. Precious now has the attentions of a few men who aren't so sure she should stay single.This is a fun, quick read - a delightful story."},{"rating":"2","title":"Refreshingly different...","review":"This review is more for the whole series than for the first book itself.If you're looking for something light, entertaining, and well-written, this is the series for you. The books are short, and the stories and characters are easy to follow and remember.Flaws I find in the series include a tad too much melodrama and one-sided villians.Check these out from the library and read 'em all in one day. You'll be sad to leave Africa."},{"rating":"2","title":"Terrific!","review":"Just a great book about everything and nothing! The characters are rich with tradition, the plot is fast moving and interesting, the backdrop of Africa is unforgettable.I will be looking for the sequels to read and enjoy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enjoy them with Roibos tea!","review":"I tired of gory, death-on-the-doorstep-everyday mysteries years ago, so was very happy to find this lovely series. Gently and mindfully written, the stories are funny and endearing, the mysteries gripping. Different, refreshing, and a nice view of another way of life. I've also listened to this book on tape and it's read by just the right person!To enjoy them even more, order some roibos (redbush tea:fruity, non-caffeinated and healthy) to drink while you read them, and share both with friends!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A pleasant surprise from the usual banality of bestsellers","review":"My typical reading habits usually steer me clear of the current bestseller list. For the most part I find them overhyped, and patently disappointing. Not so with this refreshing little foray into the engaging world of domestic intrigue that is the detective agency of one Mma Precious Ramotswe. Lovely evocative writing, wonderful characters and a simple yet intriguing story. What more does one want in a bestseller? I was so taken with the first installment that I shall certainly be reading the entire series. 4.5 stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Had potential","review":"In consideration of the book's title I must admit that I was somewhat suprised and excited when reading the first few chapters because there was a glimpse of the culture of Mme Ramotswe's Africa. We learned about customs and acceptable and unacceptable social practices and those items that are \\"taboo.\\" Unfortunately, as the author continues with Mme Ramotswe's journey as a detective I found that the author could have indulged us more with an exploration into the \\"whys\\" rather than teasing us with shallow information."},{"rating":"2","title":"THE COOLEST BOOK EVER!","review":"I THINK THAT THE NO. 1 LADIES' DETECTIVE AGENCY WAS A COOL BOOK. I LIKED IT BECAUSE THERE WERE MANY CASES THAT SHE SOLVED THAT WERE ACTUALLY REALISTIC. IT SHOWS HER THOUGHTS AND FEELINGS ABOUT THE CASES AND HER LIFE. SHE DEALT WITH MANY PROBLEMS IN HER PAST AND SHE OVERCAME THEM. I THINK SHE IS AN ADULT WHO PEOPLE CAN LOOK UP TO; EVEN THOUGH SHE IS JUST IN THE BOOK. I THINK SHE IS VERY CLEVER THROUGHOUT THE BOOK. SHE MAKES REALLY SMART PLANS I PROBABLY DIDN'T KNOW EXISTED. ANYWAY, I WOULD RECOMMEND THIS BOOK FOR ANYONE WHO LIKES TO BE ENTERTAINED. THIS BOOK IS ALMOST REAL. HOPE YOU ENJOY THE BOOK!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good book, but not great","review":"I like this book because it is simply written, has interesting characters, and an uncomplicated plot. The setting, Botswana, and the use of a lady detective, are what make the story stand out. The reader gets a feel for what it is like to live in Botswana. The cases, the main character solves, do not involve elaborate plot twists. There is a simplicity to the book that is refreshing. I recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"The feel of life in Africa","review":"Like all of Alexander McCall Smith's books in this series, \\"The No.1 Ladies' Detective Agency\\" captures the \\"feel\\" of life in Africa. So much of the printed material that Westerners come in contact with about countries in Africa has a negative or impersonal focus. The \\"No. 1 Ladie's Detective Agency\\" series gets beneath the politics and the news stories about \\"incidents\\" and poverty and disease to give a sense of the beguiling rhythm and charm and fullness of the daily lives of the ordinary people who make up much of Africa's population. McCall Smith captures all of that through stories that are fun to read and memorable in simple ways. His characters are universally recognizeable and at the same time, quintessentially African. He's a great storyteller.Sherry Norman SybesmaAuthor of \\"Two Weeks in a Land Rover, On Safari in Tanzania\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"\\" A very unusual and fun detective story\\"","review":"A very unusual and fun detective story, it was voted one of the International Books of the Year by the Times Literary Supplement. This is the first novel in Smith's very popular series about Precious Ramotswe, the only female detective in Botswana. There is a warm human element-matriarchal, even-about the tales that combine to make this novel that is unlike most other detective fiction that you'll read. Smith lived in Botswana and there's a real authenticity to the stories about witch doctors, missing husbands and con men. The book is a bit like the sign Precious has outside her office: \\"Satisfaction Guaranteed for all Parties.\\" The good news is that this is an ongoing series, and the fifth story, The Full Cupboard of Life, has just been released."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good time was had by all","review":"I had a good time reading this book, from page one right up until the end. Written in a simple style that evokes African fable, the book is episodic in construction, offering several different tales from Mma Ramotswe's casebook--tales that emphasize the culture in which she moves and the thoughtways of her fellow citizens with remarkable elegance. This delightful novel is set primarily in Botswana's capital city of Gaborone. This story follows the life of Mma. Precious Ramotswe as she sets up shop as the No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency. Colorful, inspiring, and easy to read, this is one book you'll want to recommend to friends. Also try The Bark of the Dogwood, Sam's Letters to Jennifer, and The Five People you Meet in Heaven."},{"rating":"2","title":"Heart warming and Humorous","review":"Mma Precious Ramotswe is not your typical 34 year old Botswanian woman. She has her own house, her own detective agency and has no husband. It is with pleasure that the reader is treated to her world and the beautiful descriptions of her native Africa. Alexander McCall Smith has delivered a series of enjoyable vignettes in which the reader is witness to Mma Ramotswe's common sense and considerable intuition as she solves both large and small matters of mystery for the local community. What makes the pages so enjoyable are the descriptions of the characters, local lands, traditions of the African people and the humor in which the mysteries are solved. It is not often that an author can combine beautiful prose, well developed characters and humor in a simple story that touches the heart. I look forward to reading the sequels."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fast paced, entertaining read","review":"This book was a pick from one of my book club members. I didn't know what to expect but I was pleasantly surprised by the simple and yet poignant stories. At times funny and at other times heartbreaking. I've been looking for a fast paced page turner for a while now and I found myself enthralled by this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Justice-Mma Ramotswe Style","review":"I probably wouldn't have read this except that my mother threw this one my way, plus most of my family's read at least this one of the series by Alexander McCall Smith.Mma Ramotswe's detective agency, the only one in the entire country of Botswana in southern Africa, is, (by American standards), short-staffed and sparsely equipped; she's the only detective, her only equipment a phone, her white van, and a typewriter. She has one employee. She purchased her one room office building with inheritance money she received from her father who had been a small-scale cattle rancher.My favorite case which she solves is a scam, commonplace in Botswana, where an elderly man shacks up with a young female pretending to be her long lost father and whose sole objective is to drain her of her time, energy, and finances so long as he abides there.How she obtains her first confession was my first lol, laughing out loud, incident while reading this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Entertaining, Enchanting and Satisfying!","review":"Satisfaction Guaranteed for All Parties\\" reads the sign on The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency and so should the cover of the book! Following the adventures of lady detective Ramotswe was a delight. The short adventures, insights to human nature, and the matter-of-fact approach to her work will charm any reader. Smith captures and conveys some of the subtle African nuances of life in this book. You will definitely like this entertaining work whether or not you like mysteries."},{"rating":"2","title":"Life in Botswana","review":"What a delightful look at life in Botswana. after finding the seventh in the series at the airport, i just had to know how it all started."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't live up to the hype","review":"I enjoyed The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency, although I don't feel it lived up to its mystery label. I felt this more to be a fiction story about Africa, with simple mysteries a way of moving plot forward and allowing back story highlighting African history and culture. Still, Precious Ramotswe is a likable character, and fans of Agatha Christie's Miss Marple are likely the readers who drove this book to the top of the National Bestseller lists."},{"rating":"1","title":"Obviously in the minority here...","review":"I have read the overwhelmingly glowing critiques of this book and wonder if I read the same book. I thought this was an uneven, predictable novel that made me wonder what could have been done with such rich material and such potentially interesting characters in the hands of a better author. I am certain this will show up as some equally inept made for tv movie. The bestseller list is not usually a barometer of good literature, and this book proves it to me once again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not All It Was Cracked Up To Be...","review":"This novel came highly recommended to me by a friend whose book judgement I trust, but I was halfway into it when I realized, \\"My god. This is African Encyclopedia Brown!\\"I like the way the author describes Africa, and it did have a sense of place, but it seemed like such a gossamer thin plotline throughout. Silly even. I always knew what would happen next.Liking a book is a very personal experience, but for me, \\"Poisonwood Bible,\\" was a more substantive, enjoyable and dimensionalized view of Africa."},{"rating":"1","title":"I tried to love it","review":"I give the author points for character development - the heroine is so human with all the good and bad that goes along with that but the plot is painfully slow! Precious is clearly a 3 dimensional character as are the people she meets throughout her journey but I found myself thinking \\"do something - anything to move this story forward!\\" In all, the book failed to hold my attention and I found it rather boring."},{"rating":"1","title":"The No. 1 Mystery Writer Wannabe","review":"The author in his time has written several children's books, and, well, actually this is a children's book as well. It reminds me most of any Disney story where Mickey Mouse and Goofy set out to catch a mastermind of some kind.On average, you'll have figured out the whole mystery about five pages before the heroine, Mma Ramotswe, has. Unless you're a seven year old, that is. Then you'll probably just about be solving mysteries alongside the lady detective.Unless you're annoyed by details like every second paragraph beginning with \\"She\\", you'll find this book an easy read. And there's no doubt the author knows Botswana/Southern African life and everyday language very well, and he demonstrates it through his writing. If you're a sucker for anything African, including the occasional crocodile and snake thrown into the story for no major reason at all, you'll like this book. If you're a grown-up and looking for something Agatha Christie-like, you will not."},{"rating":"1","title":"A junior's book selection","review":"This \\"mystery\\" was placed in with the adult literature at the bookstore. It really is geared to about 5th or 6th grade with the exception of some discussion of almost explicit sex. I'm not sure of the author's intent, but the story and the writing was not of the complexity for an adult. I might rate it higher if thought intention was to gear for children, with a warning about the sex inferences.The story is set in Botswana. A middle-aged woman starts a detective agency and investigates the regular cases that a detective agency would investigate. No complex crimes, etc. The woman is pretty simple and leads pretty simple life. She solves the cases by using common sense, kind of like you would expect in Tom Sawyer or from Dear Abby."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overrated and bland","review":"This book's success in sales beguiles the fact that it is banal, poorly written, and horribly edited. The interesting plot premise of the adventures a woman detective in a patriarchal society has been developed into a boring story with cliched characters engaged in underwhelming activities. The stilted and choppy writing style could be an attempt to reflect the relative simplicity of life in Botswana, but it is tedious and patronizing. Obvious mistakes were rife in the paperback version (which, by now, should have been corrected from earlier editions). For example, a principal character, described early in the book as a consummate bachelor, has a dead wife mentioned later in the book. Surely better mysteries are out there?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Ashley & Mary Kate all grown up in Botswana","review":"If this was listed as \\"junior reading\\" and eliminated the minor sex references, I'd probably give this book a couple of more stars. The cases do not have much complexity and the stories are not rich in Africa life."},{"rating":"1","title":"Main Character","review":"Main character achieves all her good results from lying, hates dogs, uses one as crocodile bait, has super human intellectual powers and extreme pride in her abilities. Not my type of heroine."},{"rating":"1","title":"How did this get so popular?!","review":"Every once and awhile I am seduced by the popularity of a book... and every time I am disappointed- only this time I am really disappointed. Little originality, poor prose, lame story lines- it has it all!!!! I am thinking of heading my own investigative team into who markets this crap- perhaps its Karl Rove."},{"rating":"1","title":"no way","review":"I finished this book in July for my summer reading. I'm a sophmore in high school. I was THOROUGHLY disappointed. There was not one ounce of humor (although the cover claimed so) and the stories were mishappenly thrown together. There was no central plot. I do NOT recommend this book to anyone, old or young."},{"rating":"1","title":"No plot, and too much sex.","review":"This book was highly recommended to me, but I'm afraid I was extremely disappointed. I realize this point of view is becoming old-fashioned, but the immorality was very offensive to me. Her new fiancee basically rapes her, in plenty of detail, and she marries him anyway. It should come as no surprise to readers that he continues to abuse her until he finally leaves her. There is not a single chapter that doesn't refer to sex in some way.Besides that, the book is quite simple. Every mystery is easily solved in one chapter, with no twists anywhere. The first five chapters are spent telling every detail not only of her life up to that point, but also her father's. But none of it ties in with the rest of the book. Basically nothing \\"ties in\\" at the end of the book. It just rambles on until it finally stops, leaving the reader craving a book with some kind of plot. If you are looking for a good lady detective, try Mrs. Pollifax."},{"rating":"1","title":"The No1 ladies detectiv e agency","review":"One of the most boring books i've ever read, if not the most b oring.My own fault, I fell for an article written about the author who spokein this area recently."},{"rating":"1","title":"Short and silly","review":"I had to read this book because it was selected by my book club. Had I read it when I was 12 it might have been fun. The stories are written at a childish level and to market this as anything other than a Nancy Drew level book is astounding. Fortunately it is over and done with quickly."},{"rating":"1","title":"Uninteresting","review":"Read this for my book club, across the boards we were unimpressed. Easy to read but pretty surface level stories. Elementary plots."},{"rating":"1","title":"BOR-ing","review":"If you like strictly episodic books with no character development, no dramatic arc, and occasionally trite prose, this is the book for you. What's more, the solution to each of the little \\"mysteries\\" (and I use the term loosely) was, by and large, predictable, including the sappy ending. I don't generally read mystery books, and maybe that's the problem -- but so many people recommended this thing that I tried to ignore the hype and dove in. What a waste of time when there are so many really good books out there to read..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nine books later, I revise my view!","review":"I had originally written a much less positive review after reading the first book of this series, but something about it stuck with me and kept me reading the next one...and the next...and so on. I'm up to the tenth now! These stories will definitely not be to everyone's taste, but Smith is a highly skilled writer and there really isn't anything else like this series that I've encountered. They are sweet and lovely, as everyone says, without being condescending to characters or reader. They're also just plain fun to read, and I've really enjoyed them a lot."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Superlatve Series","review":"I stumbled onto this series because of the title and have been richly rewarded.Thoughtful, quirky, gentle, evenly paced -- this is not a Jason Bourne novel. Each novel builds upon the one previous, and as each book is added to the next, the reader immerses him or herself further into Precious Ramotswe's Botswana, where red bush tea is ready any time of the day; where there is much to be learned by standing against the fence and contemplating cows; where Mma Makutsi talks to her shoes.In some ways, this is a 21st century African Jane Austen series -- McCall Smith through his characters muses on life and death and gladness and sorrow, and though the land is foreign to many of us, the thoughts and the experiences are universal.The \\"mysteries\\" are incidental to the story, providing impetus for the rich, rich telling of the lives of a series of funny, kind, intelligent, bizarre, thoroughly human people.Superlative!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Charming","review":"I don't know how many times I have walked past the latest in this series and thought to myself 'Perhaps one day I should read his books'. Well I finally got round to doing just that and I'm so glad I did. At times this book was moving and a little sad, but overall it was the literary equivalent to a delicious slice of Apple Pie, warm, homely and comforting. Best enjoyed with a cup of hot Red Bush tea."},{"rating":"2","title":"Charming Foray into Another Culture","review":"My friend, who has spent time in Botswana, encouraged me to read this little story because he said it was true to the culture he encountered there. Precious Ramotswe is certainly nothing like American black women. Large, stoic and self-effacing, she looks at the world patiently but relentlessly posing questions in her own unique way. The pleasure she takes in her simple life - the backyard vegetable patch, her friend the car repairman, and of course, her quiet self-chosen profession as a lady detective, which is unheard of in her culture, made a satisfying read. Not until the end is there any real danger, but I found I didn't miss all the action of other detective novels because I was visiting Botswana, and the Alexander McCall Smith does possess the ability to evoke this setting subtly and consistently throughout this fine story."},{"rating":"2","title":"So Down to Earth, it's Uplifting","review":"This is Alexander McCall Smith's best work - his story revolves around an independent, intelligent, admirable Botswana lady, Precious Ramotswe. This proud African lady solves life's little (and big) mysteries using nothing more than her brains, senses and the instructions of a mail order detective book. Delightful and moving, the characters that inhabit Precious' eventfully uneventful life not only teach us about ourselves, but also give us an appreciation of a lifestyle more about living and less about scheduling/acquiring/gossiping - while the landscape inspires a feeling of peace and longing for something simple and pure.I cannot recommend this book highly enough. Please check it out - along with the rest of the series - all of which are worthy of your time and attention."},{"rating":"2","title":"Charming doesn't even begin to describe it! Life-affirming!","review":"Personally, I'm not a mystery fan, and I only read this at the urging of a friend. Imagine my surprise when a book I thought was about English ladies meeting in a parlor over tea to solve crimes turned out to be about a African folk hero and role model to women everywhere (who just happens to solve mysteries, in addition to fixing her friends lives, and running her business, and helping her community). To recount the pure joy of reading this book, I would have to cut and paste every line into my review. So what are you waiting for? This is a true gem not to be missed by readers of all ages! My high school sister, my mother, and my grandmother all adored the tales. I also highly recommend this as a book club selection (the Today show never disappoints with their selections)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great expectations","review":"I knew it would be a light read, but I came undone by how light it was.

But I began reading it when I couldn't find anything else in the house and it was simply delightful!

I ordered the 5 pack. I received the one keyboard and was charged for the 5 pack. When i contacted customer service they cheerily said send it back. Well i didn't want to return it I wanted the 5 PACK just like it is offered. I run a busy office and this should have been a good deal for a great keyboard. Instead, it turned out to be several worthless emails and one very unsatisfying telephone call. Sorry Amazon....I usually love you but you FLUNKED this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fantastic keyboard, but not this 5 pack","review":"I love this keyboard and have been only using this keyboard since at least 2001. It is sturdy and doesn't have extra features, it isn't wireless, and it is a bit of a quirky key layout that bothers some people (the arrow keys are smaller than on many keyboards) - but I love it.The reason for my low rating on this product is not on the keyboard, but on this actual sales page.It says that this is a 5 pack of keyboards, and when I ordered it, a single keyboard came. I sent it back to Amazon, they apologized and said they would send the proper 5 pack. They then sent me another single keyboard. I sent it back, they refunded my money, and I bought the 5 pack elsewhere.Hopefully that is all resolved now, but after talking to other people who have had similar issues with Amazon when buying multi-packs and only getting a single unit - be wary.I love Amazon and buy a ton of stuff from them, and will continue to do so, but I will not be buying multi-packs from them."},{"rating":"1","title":"don't bother","review":"I tried twice to order this item.

The Rippingtons are one of the reasons I like Jazz, and with this album, they affirm that status."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another GREAT CD from the Rips!","review":"They absolutely COOK on this album. What I like most about it is that it is different from their other stuff. The Southwestern flavor is fantastic. The songs touch every emotion.

On every Ripps cd (even Wildcard and Let it Ripp) there are at least a few tracks I like. This is one of the few cds I dislike from start to finish. I listened to it twice. Once after I purchased it in 2003 and once earlier this year. I've yet to put it back in the cd player."},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic Rippingtons","review":"Die-hard Rippingtons fans will be pleased with this latest release.

Excellent."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Rippington Fan for years......","review":"This is another dissapointment for me. I do belive this CD is too \\"Latin/Spacey\\" type and lacks movement like the early years of the Rippingtons. I borrowed the CD to sample and it looks like I'll pass on this one. Are the Rippingtons turning into a New Age type of Fusion Band? Could be, to go along with the Windham Hil label. oh well keep up the good work guys and pump out a good one that COOKS next time!"},{"rating":"1","title":"'Wish I were more enthusiastic....","review":"I've liked or loved all but the last three studio CDs that Russ Freeman and the Rippingtons have put out. I hope that I don't offend other lovers of the Rippingtons and Russ Freeman, but I guess that I'm hooked on their latin flavored songs. I've listened to this CD three times and don't remember anything specific about it. I, by no means, want to discourage others from checking out this CD, but this is a place to review their work so it seems appropriate.I really miss Jeff Kashiwa's playing. The fact that Russ Freeman played so many of the instruments on many of this CD's songs might tend to homogenize the sound somewhat, too. I do like Russ Freeman's CD with David Benoit and Craig Chaquico and all the older Rippington and/or Russ Freeman CDs."},{"rating":"1","title":"I really can't. I haven't receive the book.

I'm still waiting for the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not inspiring","review":"Not inspiring at all! I have to echo the sentiments of some of the previous reviewers, it reads more like what money can buy for a bunch of insufferably boring CEO's. And the author, should have got a better editor and concentrated more on the climbs rather than glorifying Bass & Wells.For truly inspiring and touching mountaineering books, read Into Thin Air or Touching The Void.I should have really been forewarned given that Clint Eastwood, recommends the book.(At least on the cover of my book).Although, to Bass's credit, its extremely cool that he managed to climb these after he was 50."},{"rating":"1","title":"What Money Can Buy","review":"This book, in the main, is nothing more than hubris in print. Wells and Bass typify the attitude of today's wealthy elitists: the belief that because they have lots of money, they are somehow ennobled and entitled to everything the world has, including the world's highest mountain peaks.Skip this book. If you want to read good mountaineering lore, try \\"Annapurna\\" by Maurice Herzog, or Hillary's account of his climb of Everest."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poorly written","review":"This book reminds me of athlete biographies written for kids. All the characters are presented as totally one-dimensional cliches-- business leaders who refuse to lose, tough-acting butchy women with hearts of gold-- all your favorites are here! You're forced to read page after page of detailed conversations that are clearly fictionalized. The author bends over backwards in an effort to elevate Bass and Wells to superhero status. All of this can get very annoying! The bottom line, as I understand it, is that Bass and Wells did something that they should be very proud of. By treating their adventure as a world-class mountaineering accomplishment (which it clearly was not) the author actually detracts from the story."},{"rating":"1","title":"Less Mountains, More Sap","review":"This book is definitely not one to purchase if you are looking for detailed accounts of climbing these mountains.We read far more about the planning and personal lives of these men; neither of whom is interesting enough to command this attention. The dialogue between the two men is incredibly canned and sappy and Ridgeway tries in vain to capture the true feelings resulting from these ascents. You would probably be better off reading individual guides if you want to get a feel for these climbs. There are definitely better books on the subject."},{"rating":"2","title":"Funny and inspiring","review":"Unlike most mountaineering books, I found this book filled with a great sense of humor. It is impossible to read about Frank Wells and not desire to have met him. His relationship with Dick Bass reminded me of \\"The Odd Couple\\", and their humorous adventures propel the reader throughout the book (the best is the 'almost frostbite' on Denali). But these two guys are also inspiring and it is hard to put down the book and not want to tackle those summits!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A BOOK ABOUT MONEY NOT MOUNTAINEERING","review":"I thought when I reached the end of the book, the \\"heroes\\" would change their mind that money is everything and their natural arrogance.

This is nothing to do with mountaineering, just what money can buy."},{"rating":"1","title":"True heroes but lousy author","review":"After reading \\"Into Thin Air\\" by Jon Krakauer, I was eager to read more about the experience of climbing the tallest mountains. While I admire Frank and Dick's success, particulary considering their age, I couldn't help get the impression that this book was one long accolade to the men rather than the accomplishment. It felt like two very ego-driven, very successful men had manipulated a two-bit author into writing about how wonderful they were. I never once got the sense of loneliness and fear of being above 26,000 feet (the \\"Death Zone\\") that Krakauer wrote about so well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad Return","review":"The item came to me broken and when I returned it for a credit, was only given 1/2 of my credit back.

The SHM-CD sound is a disaster, as it clearly demonstrates, by its extra clarity (can anyone say \\"boosted-treble, boosted-bass three times fast), that there has been no remastering of the material save the boosted parts of the sound spectrum. The classical releases in this format--try Karajan-Mahler on DGG for a truly memorable earache--are disgraceful. After many tries at finding one \\"really better than the original\\" SHM-CD, I've given up on what I perceive to be a marketing ploy to pawn off older recordings at a \\"boosted\\" price.Even though the original release of \\"No Secrets\\" didn't have the greatest overall sound, it was more-than acceptable do to Ms. Simon (who in the photo leaves \\"no secret\\" to the fact that she isn't wearing undergarments--excellent!) and her immense talents.Buy the regular CD and skip this expensive turkey.

I originally bought this camera as a gift, but have subsequently borrowed it and used it for my own trip. I'm not sure if a cheaper camera could produce such vibrant and high quality pictures, but I seriously question whether a more expensize one would. I was originally concerned that the zoom would not be enough, and I'll say that the zoom isn't too dramatic, but it is a nice feature. But the quality of indoor, outdoor, landscape, close-up, etc is really quite surprising. The camera has been to Asia and Europe and back, owned for over two years and still produces great pictures. When looking for a camera for myself, it's difficult to even think of buying an Olympus with more zoom. More zoom may be a trade off for better pictures. How much zoom do you really need? Lots of features, some I use, others I don't find useful. Again, the quality is astounding, very durable, no complaints."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not bad, not bad at all.","review":"After buying the Olympus Stylus Epic Zoom 80 QD CG Camera I was pleased by the results of the picture quality of this slim line camera. Other features like turning on/off flash saved on the battery life. I liked being able to include myself in the shot with the timer delayed option. Red eye reduction worked great. This is a good camera for folks who just like to aim and shoot.Focus and flash is automatic. Red light in view finder tells if your to close, but it does take good close up face shots. Yea, this camera is a keeper. Would buy again."},{"rating":"1","title":"nice pictures, not durable","review":"I have purchased this camera in 1999. I have used it for a few times. The pictures came out great. However, it did not work like 13 months later. When I moved the shell to turn the camera on, it did not turn on at all. I can hear the motor is running. But it was not working at all. Since it is already over one year old, I have to pay to get fixed. It will cost me like almost a hundred dollars. I just bought another camera then. I was disappointed that it did not last as long I want it to."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is my second Stylus!","review":"About five years ago I bought one of the first Stylus cameras.

Three things about this Olympus camera that made me fond of it: small size, fits into about any pocket you an imagine, easy to handle, just point and shoot, very smart gadget, and finally, the quality of prints exceeds most daring expectations. If you plan to spend $150 on a camera with 24-80 zoom range (which is enough for most purposes, unless you are trying to get pictures of small objects on the moon), this is one of the best choices. Add to this all-weather protection, slick design, and a remote control (optional) and you get one of the best comapct cameras ever produced. One small disadvantage of this camera is that it will give you only a little warning if you will be shooting pictures without a film loaded. So watch for that letter E for error on your screen carefully, otherwise you may end up like myself shooting with an empty camera for several days."},{"rating":"1","title":"don't buy it","review":"We bought this camera 1 year ago and it does take great pictures, but it has 1 major flaw. The lens cover which slides over the lens has a bearing and a spring under it which serve as the mechanism which holds the lens open or closed and tells the camera whether to retract the lens to off position or leave it out for a photo. The mechanism gave out on our camera and upon taking it to a store for repair the service rep. says he sees the same problem a few times a week and that it is so common that he is having a hard time getting replacement parts. This causes the lens to suddenly retract as you are about to take a pictue at random intervals. I know two other people that have the same camera and the same problem. It appears to be a design flaw in the whole Epic line of cameras. It is around 70-80 dollars to fix and for that you might as well buy a new camera."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good design, poor execution","review":"Great camera as long as it works.

They both worked for about a year, then they would not load the film any longer. When you close the film door, the motor will spin, but the drum that is supposed to advance the film does not turn. We liked the size and style of the camera so much that when the first one failed, we bought another one thinking it was just bad luck. We will be replacing it with a different brand."},{"rating":"2","title":"great camera!","review":"This camera is excellent. I bought it with a couple of doubts because of reviews.

The camera is really nice and seems pretty sturdy. My chief complaint though is that it is super slow opening up. Well, it seems really slow.

Overall, however, I am very happy with this purchase."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pic quality bad-do you want Zoom really?","review":"I bought this camera for my wife. She wanted a tiny but reliable camera so I read all reviews here and got it. But when I picked up the first printed pictures, I was really disappointed. Was it a problem of mine? I think the picture quality is the most important feature. It is not sharp at all. My wife used to have cheaper (no zoom) Canon but she lost it. I think that made much better picture. If it didn't, I wouldn't have purchased autofocus camera again. I suspected Zoom function. The moving of lens part looks unstable.

But after 2 years of use, it's rewind mechanism suddenly stopped working, and I don't think it was dropped or mishandled in any way. It usually has automatic rewind feature, but one day, it made a funny whirring noise as it \\"rewinded\\" when in actuality it didn't rewind at all.Needless to say, I opened the cover to take out the film and the roll was ruined from the light exposure. I was very disappointed not only because the camera broke, but because I lost some great photos.

Being so compact you can take it anywhere."},{"rating":"2","title":"An excellent little camera","review":"If you are looking for a 35MM point-and-shoot zoom, don't look any farther than this little beauty. It takes great pictures, the flash is automatic and unobtrusive, and the little extras (timer, extra flash modes, water resistant, date&time stamp) just make it better. What I really like about it is its small size. It easily fits into a pocket or comfortably in your hand, so taking quick snapshots is a breeze. No fumbling around in a camera case (or even removing it from a carrying case) is necessary ... just open it, point, and click!One note: It doesn't come with the required battery (DL123)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good when it works","review":"I purchased the Zoom 80 upon the birth of my now 2-yr old daughter. We immediately had problems with the film not loading. The store convinced me that I was not feeding it in properly. Needless to say it often took me 2 or more times to do this simple task. I then had problems with the camera not turning on all the time, requiring that I open & close the cover several times until it did turn on. Of course, when I took it back to the store it worked. This was a recurring problem during its short life.On the positive side, the pictures were generally sharp. The best features of the camera were its compactness & clamshell cover.However, don't let the \\"armored\\" case fool you. I just took the camera in to a repair shop where it was declared dead. The camera circuit board was damaged and would be too costly to replace. The repairman said that his guess was that it was knocked around too much. Granted, it may have been handled roughly at times but it was never dropped."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"After reading all the wonderful reviews, I couldn't wait to go out and buy this camera.

Bottom line, DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY."},{"rating":"2","title":"Don't be fooled by the size - It takes great rich pictures","review":"Wow, what a great little camera. I needed a 35mm to go on vacation, certainly glad I picked this one. Small in size - easy to carry. Easy to load the film. Several different flash modes. Good zoom lens. Tricky on/off method (you have to slide the case open and closed). Self-timer so that you can take pictures that include yourself (so many of my families earlier pictures didn't include Dad, he was always behind the camera).But the best part of the camera is the developed product. I could not and still can not believe how great the pictures came out. I used regular Kodak 200 speed 35mm film, and the prints came out clear, detailed, bright & sharp.

But, for someone who wasn't taught to be a writter, it's a darn good read. For those into the SAS, check out Cameron Spence's Sabre Sqd. I don't see it listed on Amazon and I picked it up in greece, but it's also about the Gulf War and he does a good job too."},{"rating":"1","title":"How many \\"f\\" word useages do you need to ruin a good book?","review":"This had the making of a great book. A good story line, explosive action, human interest and well written. Why did the author have to use the \\"f\\" word so regularly, so out-of-place and so off putting that it became too difficult to continue reading?"},{"rating":"2","title":"McNab knows his stuff","review":"I read one of the early McNab books in which he relates details about his time with the SAS, but with a strong narrative style. Kept me turning the pages when so often non-fiction bio-based books can be stale, so I was intrigued how this entry into fiction might go.For the most part McNab pulled it off as we get sucked into a tale whereby our hero has to protect the life of a seven-year old girl, Kelly. One criticism is that we could have seen a bit more from the girl's POV, and the depth of detail was at points a bit too heavy and so slowed down the action. But overall this was a sterling effort and I'm sure more will be seen of McNab in the fiction arena."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Huge Fan of Andy McNabb's!!!","review":"This is the first book in a long series of Andy McNabb's fictional character Nick Stone.

The story is about an SAS Soldier working undercover following two PIRA Soldiers. They are followed to Washington, where it all goes terribly wrong."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tedious, Predictible","review":"You know how some people, when they tell a story, have to give you every...single...detail and by the time they get to the point, you are past caring. That's how McNab is -- only to add to the misery,his main character is dragging a little girl around with him. And we have to hear about every street they go down, every hotel room they inhabit. And, on one hand, the author makes you think that capture could come at any minute. Yet, the character has time to buy clothes for the little girl, right in the heat of the chase. Spare me! The book just plods along with little excitement and little plot development. In fact, the plot seems to go nowhere. McNab is better writing non-fiction. I can't understand all the positive reviews here. It must be a British thing."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Fugitive's Manual","review":"With all due respect to Andy, I think he should stick with writing true crime/non-fiction books as he did before (\\"Immediate Action\\" and \\"Bravo Two Zero\\"; both great, especially the latter one).There is a good thing, though, that comes out of this book. I learned how to go into hiding, how to evade the enemy, how to conduct survaillance, how to lose people in the crowds, how to lie when checking into hotels, how to ditch cars and never use credit cards while on the run. Not to mention how to make home-made bombs using kitchen cleaners. It's a good guide on what to do while hiding from government agencies or 'other organizations'. \\"A Fugitive's Manual\\".Otherwise, as a fiction novel, it's not all that good. But I still appreciate the tips!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Outpaces Dean Ing, Out \\"Tradecraft's\\" Tom Clancy","review":"You can read synopses of the story above - probably already did. I'd like to share my response to this book: I found it so gripping that my jaw was tight throughout the entire read - which, by the way, lasted all night since I couldn't put it down to go to bed. This is a suspenseful drama with characters who grow on you. (Did me, anyway.) An exciting story with what looks like real tradecraft sprinkled throughout the book.If you liked Clancy's Without Remorse, I think you'll love this book. If you like Clancy, look up McNab, and then Dean Ing. Ing used to write SF (which is so good that many non SF'ers enjoy them) but now writes (damfino what to call them. Let's try:) Techno-Thrillers.Can't say too much about Remote Control. If you like adventure, spy type novels, this is one of the best - most gripping and exciting."},{"rating":"1","title":"Blah","review":"I guess it doesn't surprise me that the intellectual level of what one assumes must be an average SAS operator is fairly low. Given the political dirtbags who run such agencies these days, McNab probably quite accurately represents the conformity of thought and uncritical mindset of killers for hire.Tradecraft? Well, I'd love to see a veteran OSS operative run circles around this bozo.It's an interesting read if only for a look into the British soul. It reminds me once again why I feel revulstion towards most Brits; so thank you, McNab.As a purely technical criticism, directed more to the editors than the author, it's always a good idea to have an ending in a book. This one just sort of stops.... Maybe the last couple chapters got lost somewhere?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Adventure Reading","review":"This guy seems like the real thing. The special thing about this series is the hero's relationship to the little girl in his care.While much of the action seems fantastic, it never crosses over to unbelievability.Obviously, the author has been there and done it.Escapist reading of the highest order. First of the series."},{"rating":"2","title":"Remote Control","review":"Remote Control was one of the best books I ever read. I couldn't put it down. It involves an SAS agent named Nick Stone who flies to the States to find his best friend and family murdered. The only one who survived is Kelly, his friend's daughter. They have to evade the police, which takes them all over the East Coast. As soon as they think everything is finally okay and they're in the clear,.....well, you'll just have to read it! Awesome book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"great background music for...","review":"I heard this at a restaurant bar while talking to a friend and was so immediately entranced I had to find out what it was. It's one of those rare finds. You can carry on a conversation or vacuum or ... to it, then you're like, \\"Waitaminute, stop, I just have to hear this one part....\\" You can play it when friends are over cuz its cool, jazzy, little-bit-tech vibe is not at all intrusive. Your friend will suddenly inquire, \\"Did she just say what I think she said?\\" Bawdy Jong lyrics set to most evocative music that is moody, but not dreary. After a few listens it makes you secretly long for those troubled relationships you had when young that were frought with longing, doom and lust. Like those liaisons, from the very get-go with Vanessa Daou's Zipless, you will be HOOKED."},{"rating":"2","title":"Seductive, introspective, unique!","review":"I only wish she would make another solo album. Her unique, seductive sound combined with her unabashedly introspective lyrics make repeated listening a pleasure.

I have three teenage daughters that love taking pictures. My second daughter just turned 16. I bought my oldest daughter a stylus when she turned 16. They like the camera because of its small compact size and ease of use. It fits nicely in their purse. After comparing every camera I could find for under $100, the Stylus had much better quality. In order to find as good a camera, I had to double the price. The viewfinder alone, is larger than most, very clear and crisp. Never had a single problem with the first Stylus. The fact that the price has come down is a real plus also. I paid more for the Stylus two years ago, than the one bought recently. I give this little camera a 5 star. You will not be disappointed. It's a really nice little camera. It's easy to use, attractive and it is not cluttered up with whistles & bells you'll never use.

I am ordering another one for me today."},{"rating":"2","title":"closest focus range allows you to do self portraits","review":"I see someone has already been mentioned how the fixed lens produces best quality results (rather than a zoom which cannot deliver the same quality). I wanted to add that the 600 auto focus stops, with a closest focus range of 9 inches is the main reason why I am onto my fifth one (although the design looks new - this camera has been selling for over ten years). I have put over 1800 shots through my current one no problem.

Don't pass up this film."},{"rating":"1","title":"A JOKE","review":"Reality is not the only thing that bites. This movie really bites, along with the acting.

Being 20 something in the 70's, I can appreciate the \\"drugs, sex and rock and roll\\" feel of the film. Good character development--I especially appreciated Hawke's \\"slacker\\" character. Well done. I've known and appreciated many \\"slackers\\" that are now successful social advocates. On on!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A really good movie","review":"Reality Bites is a look at the lives of a group of 20-somethings after they graduate college and begin their lives. Lelaina is valedictorian of her class, but she is stuck in a dead-end job at a tv station. Meanwhile, she makes a documentary of her and her friend's lives, taking an often very personal look at what each of them is like. Soon she meets Michael, an up and coming businessman who isn't well liked by her friend Troy, a poetic and intelligent man who lacks the motivation to find a real job. What results is a strange love triangle as Lelaina tries to find out who she really is and what she needs.What is really great about this movie is the strong cast that includes Winona Ryder, Ethan Hawke, and Ben Stiller. You can relate to Ryder's character of Lelaina, trying to find herself in a crazy world that won't grant you any favors. I highly recommend this movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"great romance!","review":"This is the first romance book I ever read as a young girl, and I searched high and low to find it again, since my old copy disappeared. I had read it dozens of times way back then, and since I found a copy of it again a few years ago, I have read it many times again. It was just as good as I remembered it, and is still my FAVORITE romance book, next to Gone With the Wind, which is saying a lot, since I have read many romances from Jane Austen to present-day authors.I have not liked any other Anne Hampson books I've read, but I LOVED this one. The chemistry is just right between Jane, an amateur British archeologist, and Nikolas, a Greek archeologist by profession. Set in Greece, with Nikolas believing Jane is married and deceitful while she works for him. In reality, she is pretending to be married so she can join the dig. Her British fiance is there to complicate things."},{"rating":"1","title":"DOES NOT WORK","review":"The VGA part of the splitter deos pass the VGA signal through.

I don't know what was up with that 1-star review, just ignore that as he has no idea what he's talking about. My favorite track is probably \\"I Know what I'm here for\\". I'm not sure if this Amazon version comes with the bonus disc with live tracks, but its also a must have, the live version of the previously mentioned song is incredible. In fact, the only tracks on the whole CD that I am not totally crazy about are Hello and Vervaceous. The rest are incredible... It's nice to see a band that has been around as long as James is still putting out fresh, original, incredible work. Not many other bands can consistantly do it.If you like James and are wary about paying the Import price for a cd, do it, its worth every penny.

It suffers from lyrics that are for the most part uninspired (\\"Shooting my Mouth off\\" is very throwaway), but which occasionally (for example, the description of Tim Booth's bit of stuff descending on earth from above in \\"Fred Astaire\\") slip into the depths of vomit inducing nonsenseAs if that was not suitable justification for avoiding this record, it suffers from the kind of unadventurously drab but stadiumfriendly musical arrangements that have managed to keep James in the running for so long.It will probably appeal to hardcore James fans... but for someone who wants more out of music than uninteresting four-chord songs, look elsewhere."},{"rating":"2","title":"weather is confusing...","review":"... and will remain so after you read this book. Everything in Buck's book is useful but it is tough to remember all of his rules without a solid grounding in meteorology. The cover's subtitle \\"a practical book on flying in all kinds of weather\\" is accurate. This book is about practice, not theory. However, after finishing the book, I was disappointed to find myself as ignorant as ever about weather and completely at the mercy of the FAA briefers."},{"rating":"2","title":"A pilot's perspective of flying the weather.","review":"Bob Buck is a retired airline captain who spent over 30 years flying for Trans World Airlines. He is also regarded as first person to make reading about weather interesting. This is the book he wrote to convey the pilot's perspective of flying through fronts, circumnavigating thunderstorms, and surviving icing conditions. If you are a pilot desirous of learning about how to predict weather, learning the tricks of the pros, and how to get there through the 'muck', this is the book to read. It is not an easy read, and Buck assumes you already know some weather basics, but it puts together all that you learned reading those boring FAA manuals, and Buck makes it interesting. (This is a review of the first edition, Weather Flying is now in its fourth edtion.)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Still the best practical guide on the market","review":"I first read this book early in my private pilot training, many years ago. Needless to say, I did not really understand what I was reading. Coming back to it now, with a number of additional ratings and many more hours of flight time to my name, was a revelation. Almost on every page, I found myself saying, \\"Yes, that's how it is.\\" Buck really knows what he is talking about, whether it be ice, thunderstorms, turbulence, or transitioning from instruments to visual on the approach. Taking to heart what Buck has to say will first and foremost help you to survive as a pilot by making good weather decisions. Just as importantly, he imparts a great deal of wisdom on how to get maximum utility from the airplane while keeping risk to a low level. However, as indicated earlier, the book is definitely not for beginners. A solid understanding of basic meteorology and a considerable amount of piloting experience are needed to interpret it correctly--and safely."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gorgeous Necklace","review":"I bought this and wore in my wedding and absolutely love it.

His effective mix of laid-back acid grooves with soulful vocal treatments is at its best on \\"Above the Clouds\\". The only thing that keeps this record from hitting 5 stars is his outstanding follow-up release, \\"Wild Wood\\", which reduces this debut to a stepping stone you must use to get to the next level.

From Techno, Hard Rock, To rap, to old school. This CD has it all. I recommend this one without a doubt. The best CD this year...so far!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A must: Waylon at his best.

One of the best, if not the best, country music records I have."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad treatment of a classic psychotronic film.","review":"A good bad film is a thing to treasure, as with this dark gem that shows character actor Ronald Lacey years before he stalked the screen as the Nazi interrogator in Raiders of the Lost Ark. However, this has ten minutes of the original footage edited out and it spoils the whole thing. To discuss it further is pointless. I have heard similar treatment has struck some classic Hammer films as they made their way here. I am very disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"CRUCIBLE OF TERROR","review":"The movie supposedly got an X rating on it release, but it should be rated pg 13 it has no nudity few killing with little gore. Besides that the movie moves real slow and it has no erotic feel to it. I rate it two stars because the acting was descent but not good enought to save this movie it's not worth buying."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why did I buy this?","review":"No, I'm serious - I can't remember. I'm interested in certain kinds of horror films (Universal through to Hammer), but they either have to have some good qualities, or be so thoroughly bad that they become collectable for their brazen cheek or tongue-in-cheek self awareness. This film has neither, it's just a somewhat boring not very good British genre horror pic. The plot makes no sense, much of the acting is just plain amateurish (but not bad enough to be enjoyable) and the whole thing seems completely pointless. The DVD transfer seems fine, but - why bother? [2 stars, because it's not good enough to get 1 star!]"},{"rating":"1","title":"C-","review":"In an ironic twist, the title is sadly misleading. In a group of essays that seem to exist mostly as filler, Degeneres, who is usually so funny in her stand-up routines, absolutely misses the target on her first humor collection. There isn't a single essay that is good all the way through. There is a running gag about club soda that is amusing, and a chapter on human behavior is likewise entertaining. Degeneres rambles on in a way that is irritating, and many of her observations are strangely dull. Much of what the author has to say is a few beats off from funny, and the chapters containing lists are staggeringly dry and achingly boring. Reading through this was like reading a slightly silly textbook. Eyes passed over words, and while comprehending them, did not find them interesting. What a major disappointment from a talent who has proven herself to be a remarkable addition to the field of comedy, but who must have lost some of her humor in the translation from stage to the written word."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ellen is much funnier in person","review":"I didn't find this book very funny at all.

I felt dreadfully betrayed after reading this book, because I am a fan of her stand-up, but this book was pathetic. I really feel that Ellen has done her fans a disservice with this book, and I can only assume that some ruthless publicist forced her to write it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hmm.. was funny.. then it just gets tiring..","review":"I am a huge huge fan of Ellen, I had always admired her talk shows and found her to be exceedingly funny without trying which is why I went to buy this book. I turned to the first few chapters and find them engaging but it didn't knock any laughter out of me. An occasional smile here and there but I get more humour out of internet chatting.I actually stopped reading after 4 - 5 chapters mainly because her stories seemed to be neverending.. this is leading to that and that is leading to further that and that is again leading to something else. Sort of like The Simpsons.. only lacking any real weight.I am still a huge huge fan of Ellen and I would probably buy her second book... and any books after that.. but this turned out to be a disappointment for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"cynical money making effort banking on her name, and nothing more","review":"it must have taken ellen about as long as it takes to read this book to \\"write\\" it. it's idiotic and though I have enjoyed ellen on the telly I lost a lot of respect for her after leafing through this pathetic excuse for writing.a ripoff - pure and simple"},{"rating":"2","title":"If you like Ellen, you'll love this book!","review":"It's just so Ellen.

I opened it expecting to laugh and learn something interesting about her life. What I have found instead is something not much more coherent than speaking to a three year old.

Stupid anecdotes that make no sense (the Iditarod thing? Give me a break!). The last chapter was Ellen \\"joking\\" about the number of words required for the book. No joke at all- clearly she had a minimum word requirement and was having trouble making it because there were all kinds of extraneous garbage included in the stories. Horrible book and a huge waste of money. Don't waste your time on this sorry excuse for comedy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of Money","review":"As much as I enjoy Ellen and her show this book was really stupid and I read part of it and just threw it away."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not very funny :(","review":"To me she's a great comedian...but to write a book and makes it funny is different. Several lines would have been funny if they were presented as a stand-up. I was going to give it 1 star, but considering throughout the book I got a few good laughs, and just smiling somewhere in between, I gave her 2. The title could have been My Point...And I do NOT Have One or My Point...And I do Have NONE (I know it's supposed to be funny in her original title, but it's not for me). Those chapters in the first half of the book are at least better than those in the second half. As the book moved on, I felt it got more and more dull. She was babbling too much, which was ok and very funny...when she did stand-ups; however, not in the book. Anyway I think she's better off presenting her jokes as an actress or stand-up comedian, but not as a writer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nope","review":"I love her 30-minute show, love her talk show, and I got a kick out of her second book. This was the reason I went back to the first one. I am not impressed with this book at all. I didn't crack a smile the whole time and this whole book was a bunch of lies. Just lie after lie after lie. It's funny when she picks fun at real situations (like gay marriage, having a cist, etc.), but when she just flat out starts telling fairy tales and tall tales, it's just like \\"Um...you coulda kept that.\\" That's how I felt about this whole book: \\"Um...you coulda kept that.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"I had to leave the room because i was laughing so much","review":"What a funny book, a must for any Ellen fans who understand her ramblings"},{"rating":"1","title":"MY Point....","review":"I love Ellen.

But little do they realise that the inventor is really the Master, and that to defeat his plans they will have to journey back to ancient Atlantis itself...Many aspects of this story are lifted directly from 'The Daemons', but it remains a pale copy.

Being used to the tightly woven and fast-paced plots of the Nina Reilly tales, this story seemed loose-jointed and did not move forward at the same rate that I was turning pages. The author(s) spent more time describing parking problems in the Valley than character development. And the plot twists just did not seem to hold - there was a definite, and uncomfortable, blurring of the lines between antagonists and protagonists. I finished the book just to see if it would get better, and while there is a surprise ending, it just did not justify the rest of the story.

I say that because when an author deviates from their stock characters, one never knows what the outcome will be. This is a fine book with a predictable storyline. The characters seem a little too shallow and self-absorbed for my taste, but as a nice comfy read it's ok. There are no great surprises, nor thrilling episodes, just a quick and easy read.The premise that a crime may or may not have been committed falls short with no evidence nor forensics to tell either way. The shifting from locale to locale is confusing at times. I think the book would have been better if more time had been taken to give the characters a three dimensional aspect. They are a bit one sided and plastic.Coming to grips with one's emotions and deciding what one wants to do about forgiveness and their future should have more depth."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not their best work","review":"I've read all the books in the Nina Reilly series and they were really enjoyable but this stand alone attempt is pretty bad.

I know they worked hard at it.I do look forward, as I always do, to the next book by P.O'S..

A wife disappears, her architect husband may have killed her, her former best friend wants to make up, and so joins the search for her, and everybody is keeping secrets. It sounded great on the cover. Unfortunately, the publisher neglected to divulge that this author spends a lot of time writing about what a crummy place Los Angeles is (why?) instead of focusing on the story.

Of course the entire album is full of memories, but several other gems that compete with \\"There She Goes\\" are \\"Timeless Melody,\\" \\"Way Out,\\" and \\"Son of a Gun.\\"It's hard to believe that La's frontman Lee Mavers hated this album when it was released, as it didn't fit his vision of what the songs should sound like. That's actually why it took so long to be released--Mavers couldn't find the right people to produce that vision. Many people were fired and added during the recordings, both producers and band members alike.But in the end the public did get a taste of The La's with this only official album release. And with re-issues coming out all the time, you can hear this album as it was originally released along with other b-sides and mixes.Long live The La's."},{"rating":"2","title":"fantastic pop album.","review":"\\"there she goes,\\" is an irresistable pop song, and this recording is filled with lots more terrific stuff. \\"doledrum,\\" and \\"feelin'\\" are outstanding, as are \\"son of a gun,\\" \\"failure,\\" and \\"looking glass.\\" if you are into power pop, this is a must."},{"rating":"2","title":"Trust me, buy this CD immediately.","review":"Truly one of the all time great bands, crafting brilliant songs beyond compare, beyond cult status. Sure, we all know that band leader, Lee Mavers, says its a God awfully insufficient representation of the band, but it is the only means by which I have had the glorious opportunity to hear these songs. I hesitate to think of the truly inhuman awesomeness a Maver's approved album would have been, being that I insist this recording be present in the collection of anyone with any musical sense whatsoever. The question is not whether or not you should buy this album, but whether or not you are worthy of it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mersey beat!","review":"The LA's debut album is doomed to stay a sleeping classic forever. From a certain point of view this perhaps can be explained by the difficulties musicfreaks might be confronted with when listening to the album. Apart from the radiofriendly and catchy \\"There she goes\\" (= hitsingle), the album mainly consists of tracks that should be heard a dozen times before they stick in one's mind. But hold on(!) and I am sure that, eventually, the album will reveal its hidden beauties. This release is also highly recommended for the bonus tracks, the live-performances in particular.

But now I've been listening to it, after all this time, and wow, it's a whole different CD. I guess my tastes have evolved, because as much as I liked way back when, I like a lot more musically than I did. And some of it, is stuff I'd not have listened to, that I didn't care for.      I find it worthy. However. A great many people must've thought what I was thinking, because it seems to not have taken a hold here in the U.S., as it's only available as an import now. Not that it matters to me. I got my copy years ago. And beneath all the dust of being dumped on the shelf to face the weathering destruction of time forgotten and alone, it plays just fine.

When asked what new bands he was listening to he mentioned only The La's and how he really liked the simplicity, songwriting and talent of The La's leader Mavers.If you have ever heard any of the Cast records, Cast sounds a bit like The La's.

I love the way this album is well made without sounding slick or packaged by a marketing team. Every song is not a classic piece of song writing but each song is good (some are great) because of the way Shelby Lynne sings. This is just some really good music.

This collection of music is very unusual with its time warped \\"very cool\\" word phrasings from Shelby and very memorable music, really soulful in parts, I will be taking this excellent piece of musical experiement in small doses to get a lasting impression, its that good going down, some bluesy, jazz and country vocal elements all put down in such a modern sound this is a very interesting project."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good album","review":"Shelby Lynne's career really took off with this album. After years of trying to break through in Nashville, she went away from her country stylings to this. Working with Bill Botrell, they crafted this album which is a piece of soul, pop, rock, and country all in one that is all Shelby's style. The production is a little overdone at times, but the songs make up for it. Comparisons are easy to make, the influences are obvious at times on the set, but she gives it her own flair. She wrote all the songs here, there's not a dud among any of the 10 songs. Favorites of mine include Leavin, Thought It Would Be Easier, Life Is Bad, Black Light Blue, and Why Can't You Be. A really eclectic and interesting album."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good voice, unremarkable songs.","review":"She has been wrongly compared to the late/great Dusty Springfield (although sometimes she is close to Dusty's phrasing/style). This cd is not a new Dusty in Memphis due to the fact that almost all the songs included are mediocre. She is a good singer but she is not the best voice in Country Music as some critics have called her. The best contemporary female country singer is Trisha Yearwood."},{"rating":"1","title":"Almost","review":"Shelby obviously has a wonderful voice, but this material holds her back.

God I hated it instantly. Could not see how it was anything different than, I don't know, Shania Twain? Ok, maybe that's unfair.

No thanks."},{"rating":"2","title":"...and I am most impressed!","review":"I've been hearing the buzz on this since before Christmas, and I was just sure it couldn't live up to the hype -- I mean, there will only ever be one Dusty in Memphis. That said, I Am Shelby Lynne just smokes. It's good enough to make you forget Sheryl Crowe, and I'll bet that Lucinda Williams probably won't be sleeping nights (if she ever did). Most of all, this represents the kind of artistic leap forward that you rarely witness during any performer's career. Every cut sounds like a classic, and the album has the kind unified, organic, soulful \\"Memphis\\" sound that you just never hear anymore. This would have been a contender in 1968 and a mindblower in 1974. In 2000, it just sounds like a miracle."},{"rating":"2","title":"An instant classic","review":"I am surprised at the narrow-mindedness of the reviewers who rated this album poorly. With no previous exposure to Lynne, I bought this album based on a couple of reviews and having heard Life is Bad on the radio. I LOVE it. Yes, one can hear Raitt, Crowe, Cline, Springfield and others through these songs, but Lynne adds her own unique imprint to each one, and the accompaniment is superb. And to top it off, she wrote these songs; there's not a dud in the bunch. To those who were disappointed that Lynne has diverged from her previous country genre,I say, expand your horizons, try listening to some of Lynne's obvious influences and appreciate this CD for the incredibly enjoyable production that it is, rather than complaining about what it isn't. My favorite artists are those who draw from other genres and make the influences on their music clear, because that leads me to discover music that I have never listened to before. Keep it up, Shelby."},{"rating":"2","title":"Raw, Sweet, Angry, and Beautiful","review":"I'd never heard of her, didn't know what I was buying, and really only bought the CD because of the picture on the cover and the title.

This CD is all I'm listening to these days."},{"rating":"2","title":"Shelby Lynne is one of a kind","review":"I can't add any better words to all the rich descriptions said about her and this album from others, except that she is one of a kind. Anything she does is unique and connects. The only other singer/songwriter I felt drawn to because of his unique sound and story-telling is Cat Stevens.

Restless has such an upbeat style that accentuates her wonderful voice. This album, I Am Shelby Lynne, has a totally different, depressing style.

I had never heard of Shelby Lynne before and had absolutely no idea what to expect. I have an appreciation for good blues and Shelby does some pretty good blues. I've never seen or heard any of her Nashville-era work, but I eagerly await her follow-up to this one. I hope this is her Nick of Time and the next is a Luck of the Draw. (For those of you who aren't Bonnie Raitt fans, Nick of Time was Bonnie's just-short-of-classic comeback about a dozen years ago and Luck of the draw was the truly classic follow-up).So Shelby go!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Lush and soulful","review":"This one sold out at local record store.

Never heard of her but definitely a fan of hers now."},{"rating":"2","title":"uncomplicated and pure","review":"I _love_ this album but anyone who is expecting country music will be sorely disappointed. Whatever she's recorded in the past (and _Temptation_ wasn't really country either) this cd should be filed in the popular music section not country. Half of the selections are smooth AlGreen-style R&B while others taste like a Lucinda Williams growler with a little Sheryl Crow thrown in for good measure. I've recommended this cd to two friends already both of whom loved it. If you are adventurous and like many different styles of music, give this one a shot."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic, raw and at times depressing................","review":"This cd is all of the above and more to me. At first listening to this cd, I was frustrated that Lynne's voice continued to trail off into an almost inaudible whisper on various songs, and I also found myself uncomfortable with the confessional tone of many of the pieces. Upon many more listens I have grown to really love this cd. Her voice sounds very bluesy to me, and the writing on such songs as \\"Thought it would be easier\\" \\"leaving\\" and \\"Why can't you be\\" are first rate. Her voice is raw and perfect for the songs chosen, though I do have to strain to hear her in places. I do love this cd, but I do not listen to it as often as some of her others, because it can be depressing. Too depressing, but her talent was finally acknowledged as a result of this cd, and I'm glad the world took note."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best albums of the New Millenium","review":"I received this album as a gift and I was quite surprised by the musical range and diversity of Shelby. She does everything from jazz, blues, and country (Life Is Bad blows away any Shania Twain song). Maybe the strings are a little overdone in some places, but it's one of the best albums of 2000. Will it have the staying power of Dusty In Memphis? Time will only tell."},{"rating":"2","title":"Incredible!","review":"This is the best CD I have purchased in at least a year. The vocals, songwriting and arrangements are superb. I picked it up a couple of weeks ago at a local record store without knowing anything about Lynne's new sound (except the blurb on the package).

This film had the technology, but strayed considerably from the biblical text and the historical events.If you want to learn the real story of Paul, you should watch either \\"The Visual Bible\\" series on \\"Acts,\\" which is word for word from the Bible, or watch the \\"Peter and Paul\\" film in which Anthony Hopkins plays Paul. Both of these films are considerably more accurate than \\"Paul, the Apostle.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Biblically Inaccurate","review":"I was very anxious to view this film on the life of Paul the Apostle. However, after just a few minutes of viewing I shook my head in disbelief. This film strays greatly away from Biblical accuracy. If you are unfamiliar with the Bible you may still have problems with production quality.

Overall this film was a waste of time and a big waste of studio money while only fulfilling a contract."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rock solid biblical movie","review":"This movie is drawn straight out of the bible with a little para phrasing mixed in and is beautifully done.

There is no way that anyone who believes in the Bible would show this movie to anyone else, in fear that they would be spreading a lie. There are many false messages in the entire Bible Collection films, but this one is false from the beginning to the end. It is very sad to me that if anyone who participated in any of these films ever becomes a christian, they will have this yoke following them for the rest of their lives."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great insight to the Apostle Paul","review":"Enjoyed every minute of this movie.

The movie is absolutely unreliable. Who is Ruben? Did a Roman general kill him on the Bible? Ruben's wife denounces a plot to kill Paul??? Does he appeal to go to Rome as portrayed in the movie??? These are just a few remarks in this work. What could be a great movie, since Paul's story is really powerfull is actually a bunch of historical facts mixed with extra biblical material (fantasy)and antibiblical material (lies about the story).

I was surprised by the more 'modern' content (nudity, violence, sexual suggestions), that you don't typically see in religious movies. It was a good reminder that there truely is nothing new under the sun and if the early christians didn't use the cultural, theological, political issues they encountered to excuse timidity in evangelism, I shouldn't either. It was also nice to see evangelism portrayed in a loving manner-vs-arrogant preaching that forgets the character of Jesus and how loving He is.

The life of Paul would be better represented in a mini series.I appreciate the efforts here, but too much time was devoted to making Saul a 'sympathetic' character and the truth of his conversion is weakened, when the Biblical reality of it is so much more."},{"rating":"1","title":"Celine T.","review":"I know that the DVD was a used one when I ordered it.

Being an academic myself, I do not have issue with this, but as an adoptee trying to find a concise analysis of coincidences in reunion, this book was sincerely disappointing. I do hope that Stiffler will reassemble the book for future readers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Saddly disappointed","review":"This book was recommended to me by some members of my adoptee/birthmother support group.

The book does not flow easily, it was a real challenge NOT to put it down. Aside from the \\"true stories of synchronicity\\" in the book, all there is to read is a jumble of information mostly from other sources and not the author.

The book also lack real examples and problems are a bunch of derivations that can be easily found in other text. I have good background in aerospace dynamics and have worked in aircraft area.

We took it back to Babies R Us where it was purchased and even the manager couldn't figure out how to fix it. That part of the seat already comes put together, so it's not something we screwed up. We exchanged it for the same chair so we'll see if that one works out better. If not we're going to a different model. Other than that, we like the chair and it's features.

It looked very similar, but the post was different. Almost as if it were a wheel off a different model.

But a projection however clever does not in this case have the power of what is closer to him, with him. And there is greater authenticity and strength in the 'Rabbit Books'.I have I think also an objection which only a minority of readers will share. Bech is a pasteboard Jew who has no real deep Jewish knowledge or identity. This does not mean characters like him do not exist, or Updike had no right to create him. It does mean that those of us looking for some depth when they meet a Jewish intellectual or cultural figure are quite disappointed.In any case it is clear that for Updike Bech is just a sideshow, one of the many that constitute parts of the complex identity of this very remarkable American writer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lost but maybe not quite a classic.","review":"I love the CD.

This so-called \\"writer\\" and \\"columnist\\" is about as capable of informing the public as politicians are capable of telling the truth. Very little research , if any at all, is done on Mr. Easterbrook's part in any facet of his work. To mask his apparent lack of credentials and knowledge in his subject areas, he'll heap upon the reader inside jokes and pop culture references in order to make himself seem witty and urbane, but frequently falls on his face due to the transparency in his writing.

Even Worse Human","review":"I could barely get through the first chapter of this tediously pedantic \\"book\\". I still have no idea why I borrowed it. I have read Easterbrook's \\"column\\" online at ESPN and he continually fails to impress - hack theories that he presents with no evidence and writing skills comparable to a 6 year old writing ransom notes. He often follows up his story (I hesitate to call it journalism though I think he thinks that what it is.) with a rating of his favorite cheerleader for that week. Am I expected to take him seriously with an attitude like that? Well, thankfully I did not spend any money on this doorstop and, hopefully, I have prevented you from committing that sin as well.Oh, I had to give this a 1 star rating because the good folks at Amazon won't let me assign 0 stars or, even more correct, negative stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Find something you know a little something about.","review":"Easterbrook knows as much about having a better life as he does about football.

Mr. Easterbrook sits on his high stool proclaiming his infinite knowledge and vast wisdom, assuming mindlessly that any of us want a part in it. His ego is so massive, and so holier than thou, that his points do not even come across. Yes his message is one of encouragement, but all hes doing is encouraging you to think he's a god! Terrible, just like his football columns!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Like facts? Look elsewhere.","review":"I began this book with high hopes, having enjoyed similar books (such as Malcolm Gladwell's \\"The Tipping Point\\") tremendously. But after the first two chapters, it became increasingly apparent that what I'd thought would be an objective consideration of middle-class discontent was simply an opportunity for Easterbrook to scold readers (and society at large) for their collective ability to stay on the sunny side.For an example of the logic you'll encounter in the book, consider this gem: at one point, Easterbrook argues that elderly Americans have no right to complain about the high cost of prescription drugs; after all, if those drugs didn't exist, seniors wouldn't be alive to complain.If you find this a compelling argument, you'll probably enjoy the book. If not, save your time for a more worthwhile read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Even-handed look at where we were and where we've come","review":"Easterbrook shows the disparity between our collective societal unhappiness and contrasts it with how much better we really have it now.

After the first dozen pages or so I get the point. But his solutions to our malaise are a bit over the edge. He would like to see corporate executive remuneration be significantly less, he would like to see more forgiveness between people, and he would like gross environmental effects addressed. How much of that can the individuals who read his book address. Not very much, I'm afraid.

Contrary to what Easterbrook says, the economic state of middle America is not so rosy. Jobs are this country's leading export. Wages relative to inflation are stagnant at best for most folks who are not in white collar occupations. Even for white collar workers, the economic climate is not so good.Essentially, Easterbrook's book is a prosecutor's brief on the side of raising taxes. He claims that even though most Americans are now better off than they ever have been, they are really miserable. Easterbrook claims that what's needed is a big tax increase to fund the programs necessary to \\"defeat global despair.\\"What Easterbrook has done, in essence, is to bend the facts to fit his predetermined agenda of advocating a big tax increase to fuel a big spending program. More and more big government is what he's really interested in, not in healing the wounds of the middle class."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sharing self-delusion","review":"This book illustrates the sad fact of publishing today, namely that once an author gets established, he can get anything published.

For instance, James claims (pp. 125-130) that Aristotle \\"stole\\" the great library of Alexandria. Hello! The library was founded *after* his death, as ANY first-year classicist knows. This is just but one example of a book filled with grave flaws and basic errors.

The unit also doesn't really work below 40 degrees, no matter how low a set the temperature dial. Personally, I would not buy this again, or recommend this product to anyone. You're better off spending a little extra money for a newer, better unit. I'm told the A419 works much better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Helpful","review":"I found the book very helpful.

I don't have any problem with these headphones and i recommend them to anyone looking to buy wireless headphones..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Still trying","review":"I can't seem to make these work & am frustrated.

At first it was a great idea, but once I got the product it was not what was expected - the only real problem that I have with this product is that when using almost all the time I get popping and hissing while watching TV. The auto on/off was a great idea, they were fairly comfortable, and had no issues with charging (though I have only had for a few days), they will be going back sometime this week due to sound quality.My advice - if popping and hissing will bug you - DON'T BUY, if that wont bother you, go for it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Saved our marriage","review":"The Sony Wireless Stereo Headphone System saved my sanity during TV prgrams I did't want to hear.

They were dull gray with a globular pear-shaped appearance. A properly soldered joint will be bright and shiny conforming to the shape of the elements soldered with concave fillets. To acheive a satisfactory solder connection all elements of a solder joint must reach the melting point of solder, not just have a droplet of solder applied.This was an easy fix for me having thirty plus years experience in manufacturing electronics.

Great purchase, easy to hook up and nice clear sound! Buy it you won't be sorry!"},{"rating":"2","title":"slight static, although on of the best investments I have made.","review":"I am very pleased with the product. It has great responce in all frequencies. Even thought the Bass is not as clear and full as others, it makes up for it in other parts or Hz. with the exception clarity. I understand that it operates on the primace of that like a 900mz cordless phone, I do have a occasion problem with the reception being just 10 feet away from the sender. Although with a slight shift of the head or the headset it seems to take care of that. The one thin I am really bothered about is that it was not adaptable to RCA out from stereo to adapt to the apply to the headphone jack. This could allow us to keep the base unit closer to the user and not have to constantly get up an plug or unplug the unit when we wanted to use it, thus it would be always in reach.Thanks Tim Mosley"},{"rating":"2","title":"Sony Wireless Headphone","review":"I first learned about this product at work.

For those of you still struggling with this, turn the volume on the device you're connecting to up to full blast and then play the headphones at a low volume. The loud popping has to do with the auto on/off feature. I got around the auto on/off feature by twist-tying the adjustable headband to the upper band. Put the twist tie on for on, and remove it for off. Of course that made the headphones only able to fit the Incredible Hulk. The headphones were big to begin with, which is why the auto on/off feature was activated every time you moved your head, frequently cutting out and making listening in any position but stock still an impossibility. If you have a very large head and a full head of hair, and twist ties at the ready, these might work out for you. If you're a normal person who doesn't want to re-engineer a product to make it usable, pass on these. A total waste of money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Could have been great, but...","review":"It would have been great had it not popped / buzzed even with the TV turned off.

Thinking I just got a bad pair, I tried another set, the 925RK. Same result. The audio is distorted across the entire frequency spectrum and has a 'hallow' sound (that I might be able to live with without the distortion). I doubt I got a second defective set, though it is possible. I think it more likely Sony blew it with their MDR line. How these headphones got so many positive reviews I can only attribute to my experience with high-end audio equipment and having a more critical ear. However, they are distorted so bad that even the average user should notice."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just awful","review":"1) Nearby Computers or perhaps other electronics make it click, buzz, etc2) It's supposed to automatically activate when there's audio signal. If I put it on when a video was playing that certainly had sound, but not continuously, it wouldn't active so I would have to start some music just to \\"wake it up\\"3) Though I hadn't used it all that much, I think it had some kind of charge issue. The operative word here is \\"think\\" because I couldn't tell. It simply wouldn't work and then I would put it on its charger/base and then maybe later it wouldn't work.

Also when I was sitting on my sofa watching TV, the sound went away if I turn my head to the left orto the right. In addition, there was a lot of static. I returned them after 1 week and I bought the IR Sonyheadphones instead. Those at least lasted for 1 year before they died, but at least I got good sound and reliabilityfor as long as they lasted.

I have a large 2 level home, can walk all over the home without any static. Sound quality is very good wired direct to the HDTV. Love the auto switch and no cable to plug hookup to charge the batteries. Just set the headset on the stand... now that's neat! And the batteries will last longer than I care to use them. Great product for the cost, I should have had them before now.Only one complaint... some times I hear a loud sharp click or crack. Some nights it never happens, some times it will happen 3 or 4 times in a row. Otherwise would have rated them a 5."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic headphones - Better than Acoustic Research","review":"These headphones are great, I love them. I wear them all day at work and I forget I have them on because they are so comfortable. The reception is good at short range, which is all I use them for. The only drawback is that they take a couple second to turn on at first, but that's not a big deal.

The Sony is a little too large for my head so tend to slip down when at their smallest setting and no, I don't have a particularly small head. I do like that these have a charger and it works just great as long as you pay attention that the charging light is on before you walk away. It sometimes requires a little adjustment to get them charging. I use these for TV viewing and they definitely help to make the words understandable.

I don't know if it is just a faulty indicator light yet. I had already purchased two new batteries, and charged them, which may keep me going for a short time.I had a chat with a Sony tech and after some discussion, she advised me that both sets needed to be returned for repairs, at my expense, since the wonderful 90 day warranty had expired.I would be happy to use a stand alone battery charger, but have been unable to find one.

As others have pointed out, the quality of the automatic on/off switch is poorly made. The left side of the headband is more sensitive than the right causing a popping sound when it turns itself off and then on again, if you move your head or move to another room while wearing them. The range is limited. The headphones come with a pathetic 90-day warranty.

They go back tomorrow.Pros: They are very comfortable and the sound is wonderful. Stereo really stands out.Cons:1. The battery charge function never did work. I left the unit on the charger for 3 days, well past the 16 hours recommended, and the battery pack never did take a charge.2. I used my own batteries for a while. It worked fine - for a little while. Once the cover of the left earpiece was removed to put in my own batteries, it wouldn't stay on. It would pop off at the most inopportune times. The last time sealed the deal. The piece fell behind my wall unit and I had to unload the entire unit to get it.3. Finally, the auto on/off feature failed. It would cut in/out every 2 seconds or so.

All the secondary attributes are great: convenient charging cradle, reversible cable, reasonably light, decent sound quality (when you can hear it).But I bought these to use at work, and the interference made them absolutely unusable. From a mild ever-present hissing sound, to regular, loud, annoying feedback, the interference was, in no uncertain terms, brutal.

I was looking forward to getting them, and assumed that along with being wireless, that being a Sony product, they would also have decent sound quality. Unfortunately, they work better as earmuffs. I think the problem is the RF signal is not a very good way to connect. I'm not sure if bluetooth or infrared is better, but I'd check them out before buying this one.

First, only one cuff will produce sound, then after another month past the other cuff went dead. The problem with the product is that it doesn't respond to channel signals and tuning signals. Both cuffs won't emit a sound. It's a weak product. Sony's warranty only covers after 90 days. So, if your problem was bought 120 days or more, you will have to get it Serviced by Sony or a replacement BUT the cost to replace is very similar to the original price of the item. I bought these for $99 and now, telling me that the Sony replacement will cost $43.00 (almost half the the original cost). Plus, they have to troubleshoot the product before they initiate a service agreement. This is alot of CROCK!! This is burdensome for the consumer. If you are thinking about SONY---think about so other brand, but not this one. I do not recommend!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Little Touchy","review":"This is, overall, a great product. It is very comfortable. There is some interference at times, but with the amount of wireless devices in our home (laptops, phones, printer) that's going to happen - you just need to move the base to a good location. The only problem we have encountered is the on/off. There is no switch, putting them on your head pulls out the inner headband activating the on/off function. For the vast majority of people this is not a problem. For us however it is. I bought these for my Autistic son so he can listen to the computer. The problem is that he doesn't like to wear them over the top of his head but prefers to wear them with the headband towards the back of the his head - just far enough for the headband to move back in towards the earphones which turns them off. I have put a zip tie around the inner and outer headbands, snugging them up just enough to turn them on.

These headphones screw up way too much in response to certain sounds - particularly the spoken letter 's'. Any quiet moment in a movie that is broken by an 's' - someone saying the word \\"sister\\", for example, instead comes out of these headphones as a very loud, obnoxious POP.

I had bought the radio shack version of wireless (infrared) headphones and they were alot better. the only problem with those were, that you couldnt leave the room and if someone walked if front of your transmitter you would get static..... also if the dvd player is going you get feedback from the motor.maybe I'll just stick with the 15ft. cord"},{"rating":"1","title":"Beware Wireless Headphones","review":"I tried this product knowing that 900mhz can be problematic.

When it arrived even though the headset is a bit heavier than I wanted they are very comfortable. I found that there is a constant popping and crackling sound whenever the headset is used. The popping and crackling sound happened no matter if you are close to or far from the aerial. I also found that if you are more than 20 feet from the aerial the hissing sound is so horrid I would never use it for music. I tried the aerial in many locations near I even extended the aerial cord far from any electronics but this did not help the problem. I am very disappointed in this Sony product and would never recommend any one buy it if they are looking for high quality sound."},{"rating":"1","title":"No good","review":"I purchased this headset thinking I would get crystal clear sound since it's a Sony brand.

I guess they don't make them like they used to, or maybe people have evolved TINY ROUND ears! Really?? Anyway I just wanted to see how many people have evolved tiny round ears. I must have noise reducing headphones so if any one has any suggestions on brands besides $300.00 and up Bose, please let me know.

My first test was audio quality at 3~4 ft from the transmitter, and It was just awesome, I felt the design very confortable and wear it laid in my bed with no problems. My next test was walking away my room, and noise and silences started when I walked like 30 ft from my room.

What it does have is plenty of stupid gimmicks like split-screen viewing and use of infra-red filters. Ooh!

To think that King originally at one point threw the draft copy of this in the trash (to later be rescued by his wife.) is almost unimaginable. This novel is fast and brutally honest about being an outcast in high school. It is written in a very strange form but the excitement is still there. If you've never read this book you're not a true King fan. Much different from the film but just as fast and gorey.

But is the true horror in this book about Carrie's strange family and her own power OR is it what kids did to lead up to that night? I say the latter.In this modern, kids-bully-over-the-internet-and-followed-by-suicide-or-the-victim-goes-on-shooting-rampage world I see this book as a good lesson for that. Sure, some may still argue about the power mentioned in this book but Carrie's ability is just the method. Change that to a gun, and you will see that the core message remains the same- do not bully anyone and do not be the part of anonymous crowd to just watch, and pretend there was nothing to be done. At lease Sue got somewhat of that, just a tad late."},{"rating":"1","title":"failed to be a horror novel","review":"I expected it to be oooh so evil and scary, but I read it late at night and I didn't feel any chill at all.

I can't wait to read another of King's facinating novels."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overrated novel with a great premise that was poorly executed","review":"Not as good as anticipated. The book was hard to get into. For the most part, it reads like a text book, with news articles that completely take you out of the story. There are too many of them and they interrupt the flow of the story, making it a real chore to read. The first scene is great, a classic scene, actually, but once it's over you are bombarded with the news articles. If I wanted to read so many news articles, I'd pick up the newspaper and have at it. I don't, that's why I picked up this novel. King uses the articles to tell the story instead of a normal narrative, sacrificing an enjoyable read.To put it bluntly, there are better Stephen King novels out there. I don't recommend newbs starting with this one. King had a great premise here but it wasn't executed well at all. A real shame, too. Anyone interested in this story might do well watching the movie instead, which was undoubtedly better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great reading of a good novel!","review":"I had read Stephen King's first novel, Carrie, years ago and finished it in one night. It's shorter than most of his later work and pretty good for a first book.

However, I enjoyed the movie more than I enjoyed the book. Carrie's mother sounds terrifying. My favorite part of the book was when Carrie was at the prom.

I loved the way the book was written, the reports from after the events of the story introducing you into each next section.

King is a wonderful weaver of tales. When I read this book while in my teens, I was bored with it and just didn't get it. Reading it again as an adult, I can better see all of the inner turmoil that the characters are facing. It's also interesting how he breaks up the narrative with exerpts from real sounding commission reports, news stories and post-event accounts of the events of prom night. Truly a well written story of the terrible things that adolescents do to one another and what might happen if the right person is pushed past her threshold of tolerance."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good novel.","review":"This is Stephen King's first published.

You think that he is all vampires and aliens? Well, let his first novel prove you wrong. Man, this book was strange, but very good all and all. King takes this innocent young, tourtured highschool girl and turns her into a person to haunt your dreams. Throughout the book you learn of Carrie White and her power to move things. Now, im sure most people have seen the movie, but the ending is so much creepier in this book than it is in the movie. It is a little bit slow paced, but it is all worth it by the end. It is the kind of scary that makes you shiver. Not like you are afraid to go to sleep, but more in a way that it is just so strange that it messes with your head. This is the book that skyrocketed King's career. His writing style was a little different back then, but not bad. I thought this was a really cool book and most definetly recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Short but Sweet","review":"As I see this book in the store I'm thinking to myself \\" Man this book is way to small.\\"If you are a King fan like me you are used to books like \\"IT\\" and \\"The Stand\\" and most of his others books.Then you see this little 245 and kinda laugh.Being a King fan I bought it.Man was I wrong for laughing.This is a definite page turner.This story of a girl mystified me.I don't know how he compacted such a story in so few of pages.This is one you must read.Don't pass it by."},{"rating":"2","title":"Human story about bullying more than superpowers...","review":"Carrie is remembered generally as a story about bizarre superpowers of the mind, but it is a far deeper look into the effects of bullying at school and abuse at home. This particular edition has a very interesting foreword by King that describes the two real-life girls that were his inspiration for the Carrie character.Yes, there are supernatural powers involved. But even more than the (very good) film, we get a look at how very natural forces shape Carrie into someone that can use those powers for destructive purposes. The book is also more balanced, with the school principal being a sympathetic character rather than yet another bully."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of Kings best books.","review":"I have read this book so many times, and I still can't get enough of it! It's a very well written book about a coming of age story in which the main character is trying to find her place in the world. Just enough suspense that it keeps you reading and finding out more until the very end."},{"rating":"2","title":"Could not put it down","review":"I know this was Stephen Kings debut novel but I'm just now getting around to reading it. I expected it to go pretty much like the movie(should've known better the book is always better than the movie)but there is so much more in the book. Excerpts from newspaper clippings appear throughout so you know that something is going to happen at prom, however it doesn't spoil the ending it just makes you want to read faster so you can find out quicker. It is a quick read but not easily forgettable. Right from the start I was feeling sorry for Carrie having to live with the bullying and the crazy nut of a mother. So by the end of the book you understand why Carrie does what she does. Very highly recommended!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I think Carrie is a mesmerising book","review":"I think Stephen King's Carrie is a excellect book I think Stephen King is an excellent writer,but he could have made Carrie a little more interesting.I guess I feel like this because Carrie is a harder book for me to understand because I'm only 13,but Stephen King's books are for pre-adults maybe they would unerstand it better then me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another In A Slew Of King Books","review":"Spooky chick has freaky mom.

My closeness in age to Carrie made her situations all the more real to me. I loved all the details King provided...the school locker room, Carrie's house, her clothes, the way her body looked, even the painfully intimate details about her period. I guess all the little facts and detailed descriptions made me feel as if I had a bond with her somehow.This book also made me a little nostalgic for the 70's. Not having lived throught that decade, I really enjoyed the 70's teenage culture and references. I wasn't too keen on King's use of newspaper articles, however...I would have preferred narration...but nevertheless it was an interesting way to reveal background information.Even though I've read this book countless times now, I still have the feeling of being so utterly powerless as it progresses. I wish I could intervene and stop Chris and Billy's plan...but the tragic ending is always inevitable."},{"rating":"2","title":"I found this book, remarkably enjoyable.","review":"I found this book remarkably enjoyable.

I think that I liked reading this book for a couple reasons, but the only one that I can think of right off the top of my head, would be because of how it was written, with a certin flare, it was written with energy, and that energy rubbed off while reading this book.

Had she not done this, the world would be deprived of a great novel. 'Carrie' is different. The entire book is written from many peoples' perspectives, which gives the reader many points of view. Not only is this unique, but the reader gets an unbiased view of the story. Excellent suspense and unique writing make 'Carrie' a winner."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great brief intro to King","review":"It's difficult to write something new about this book, so much has been written before. Aside from short stories this is one of easiest stories King has written, it's brief and to the point. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Must Read!","review":"I think that this book was very interesting. It kept me wanting to read it and the plot was good. The way the other girls made fun of her and how she got revenge. I loved the ending and I did not see that coming, but I really liked it. I think this book would only be for mature adults and would keep everyone involved in it. I would recommend this book to my friends and family."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not his best, but quite scary if you ask me!","review":"CARRIE is the third novel I've read by Stephen King. The other two are BAG OF BONES and THE GIRL WHO LOVED TOM GORDON. I liked CARRIE the least of all those books, but it was definitely a fast and sacry read. Margaret White, Carrie's mother, was very cruel and entertaining and the newspaper articles and interviews are intriguing and fun to read. CARRIE was also a good book because it wasn't long at all and the dialogue and writing was easy to comprehend. The greatest characters are Sue Snell and Tommy, the best people King ever thought up in his creative head. CARRIE was fine by my entertainment standards!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I loved it","review":"Even though I only read 1 other Stephen King novel(Firestarter)I still think this is my favorite.Not only is it less long and boring,I really identify with Carrie.I get picked on sometimes too,and sometimes I wish I had her power.I mean,who wouldn't want to get revenge on their enemies?Especially with enemies like Chris Hargensen."},{"rating":"2","title":"Movie vs. Book comparisons","review":"The Carrie of the book inspired as much empathy as Sissy Spacek's movie character, but the others much less so. In the film you felt some empathy for Sue, Miss Desjardin, and Tommy because of their empathy for Carrie. The teacher in the book is basically evil minded, Sue is a mix, and Tommy is on the good side. The most substantial difference is what happens at the prom. In the film, only a few of Chris's friends laugh (it's implied that the other laughter shown is only imagined by Carrie), in the book everyone laughs. In both book and film I'm totally on Carrie's side and applaud her actions; if I had her power in her circumstance I'd do exactly the same. In the book there is a final poignant interaction between Carrie and Sue. I should say finally I consider both the book and film masterpieces. If you want to know the root cause behind Columbine and such read this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Carrie- Absolute Revenge","review":"Carrie is a tortured teenager attending high school. Her mother is a disturbed religious fanatic, who forces Carrie to take part in her absurd religious demands. With no friends, Carrie is an outsider. But there's something different about her, for she has telekinesis, the power to move objects mentally. When a school hunk asks her to the prom, she at first refuses, but then gives in. She makes her own dress, fixes herself up, and despite her mother's protest, attends the prom with the hunk. While at the prom, a bratty girl who takes part in the torturing of Carrie at school, plans a little surprise. She arranges it so Carrie will become the Prom Queen. Carrie can't believe it when she is called up on the stage to accept a crown. Then down came the blood. A bucket of pig blood covers her as her eyes widen and she looks at the laughter-stricken audience in horror. What happens next? Remember, she has telekinesis."},{"rating":"2","title":"Completely freaked me out!","review":"This is THE most macabre Stephen King book. Tales of mistreated people always affect me and I could not sleep for thinking about this book for weeks. I think that it is the most delicate material he has ever written about and is just a classic. Along with Tommyknockers this is my favourite King book and I don't think that any he'll ever write another to change my mind. I was glad to see the film do it justice, which is more than can be said for the Tommyknockers film!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Carrie was gory, suspenseful, horrifying and a most read.","review":"An orignal masterpiece that is so well written I at first actually thought it was based on a true story.

One of the most sought after boys at school asks her to the prom. Then there's the mayhem!A brilliant book. Better than the movie.

If you are a fan of Stephen King then you really need to read this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Raw, dirty and very repulsive","review":"I am not a big fan of Stephen King books, although I have only read three of this books. The first one I read was \\"Carrie\\". I saw the film, loved it, so gave the novel a try. I must say it\`s difficult to get imagery from this book, and I did not find King\`s use of words powerful or frightening at all. They were too raw and unpleasantly accurate to intrigue me. But what really aggravated me about \\"Carrie\\" is the way King constructed newspaper articles, obituaries, and interviews into the story. It totally weakened the plot, and it sort of got confusing at times. Brian De Palma\`s classic film adaptation, I feel, is a lot better. The plot was produced with more focus on adolescence, and the severe emotions the main characters felt. There also a lot more powerful and unexpected moments. The book just didn\`t do anything for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of my favorites","review":"Carrie is one of my favorite King novels, for it's loosely based on his memory of two girls in his school who were picked on 'without mercy'. I first read this novel in high school where Carrie White's character was unfortunately present. I recall girls who were emotionally, and sometimes physically, battered by classmates and was once badgered by a bully myself. This book is also part of the early 'raw energy' of Stephen King as a writer, before he was launched into legendary status as a popular horror novelist. Though there isn't a happy ending in 'Carrie', I'm still able to sympathize with her character and see some justice in her wicked vengeance. This novel will remain on my bookshelves, safe from any future garage sales, and re-visited often.Chrissy K. McVayAuthor of 'Souls of the North Wind'"},{"rating":"2","title":"the emotional rollercoaster","review":"The story of Carrie White, written by Stephen King, portrays the quintessetial outcast in a suburban high school setting. Constantly being the butt of everyone's jokes, Carrie finally unleasher her telekinetic powers in a horrific night of revenge. This novel gives an insight into the mind of the typical high school reject, allowing all to truly understand that the ridicule they are put through is unbearable, leaving them no one to turn to and unlimited power of destruction over everyone else's life and her own. A scene at the outset of the book exemplifies this excruciating torture that she is put through when Carrie, the main character, is horribly made fun of when she is experiencing her first period. As the novel closes, Carrie can no longer take the constant bombardments of everyone in her life, even her mother, and she ultimately explodes on the city as a whole, unleashing her telekinetic powers in a fit or rage brought on by a deceptive night of false popularity."},{"rating":"2","title":"Chills for a Carrie","review":"Carrie was a novel I was reluctant to read. For one thing, the movie didn't impress me as much, and it's hard to read about someone that shares your namesake. But as soon as I pulled it from behind a rack of dusty books in a public library, I knew it was fate. I was immediatley pulled in, wondering how Stephen King could have such a wonderful first book.It starts with interviews from neighbors and students. Carrie White is a senior who has been scarred from a religious fanatic mother. Carrie also happens to have trained herself in telekinesis. These interviews all lead up to the fateful night of the Prom.Do yourself a favor.

But the suspence is great, the story amazing and Stephen King has managed to delight me when I hadn't read anything from him yet. I had heard of the film but I never saw that classic of terror. I should though, even after reading the book. The fact is, the book is wonderful and you can't put it down. The author says it is 'raw'. Well, if this is what he calls 'raw' I wouldn't know what to call a masterpiece... You have to read this book. Because you will never see things the way you do now again..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Still the Classic","review":"I've read both the book and watched the movie, and can attest to it's staying power. Although not as polished as his later works, the rough edges only add to the obvious torment our dark protagonist feels.Contending with a bible-belt(?) mother and extremely evil classmates, it's a wonder that Carrie did not snap eariler. Her life seems dismal until she realizes that she has telekinetic powers that enable her to do the extraordinary.Although the movie is low budget by today's standards (strings and wires are visible if you know where to look) this book remains very enjoyable because you can picture it happening any time. Even if it was intended to deal with the angst felt by the baby boom generation (and quite possibly the frustration women were feeling in narrowed roles)it remains relevant to my generation as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Carrie","review":"This is an amazing book.

While that may be true, put this novel against nearly every other non-King horror book, and understand how good it really is.It is terrifying and original. At the same time, however, it forces everyone to look into their high-school personalities and ask \\"what would I have done?\\" Most like to think they would have opposed Carrie's abuse, but few can say that honestly.It's no Stand or Shining, but it's quick and freaky.(A quick clarification: Carrie is not based on two of King's students, but rather two of his fellow classmates growing up.)"},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"One of King's Best\\"","review":"Stephen King's 1974 novel \\"Carrie\\" was the fourth book King wrote, but the first he had published.He based the book on two girls he went to school with who were shy and introverted and in the novel he brought both girls together and formed Carrie who possesses telekinetic powers who seeks revenge on her clasmates who have tormented her for years. In the book Carrie is also being raised by a Bible-thumping nut of a mother who only makes life for Carrie even more hellish.This was the first book of King's to be made into a motion picture and it starred Sissy Spacek in the title role and garnered her an Oscar nomination as Best Actress, something rare for a horror movie. That film spawned many sequels and remakes with the latest to come out in 2013 and starring Julianne Moore as the mother."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Movie Was Better Than The Book","review":"This book was pretty dry, without much color or interior monologue, just leaving me with the creeps and not much understanding.

I love most everything he has ever written, he's a phenomenal author, yadda yadda yadda... but this book just didn't seem to do it for me. And it's a shame, ya know, because the basic idea is just so damn good! Zealot mom brainwashes and abuses daughter, daughter wants to break free, has telekinetic powers, made fun of at school, kills them all... that's great! But this book didn't have the character development that I've come to expect from King... maybe I've been spoiled! Also the plot seemed too simple - but that isn't my biggest complaint. Sometimes short and sweet is great. But why waste a wonderful idea on such short sweetness? Oh well, to each his own. My opinion of Stephen King is still as high as ever... in fact this makes me even more eager to read even more, better books by him!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow!!","review":"This is great for being Stephen King's first book! It was kinda sad how kids were so cruel to Carrie, and how she had such a religious mom who didn't even let her sleep with a pillow.

This is a real first. I loved this book, but The Shining was better. If you want a scare, read The Shining. I do, however, think this book can be described in about 3 phrases.

It doesn't always work, unfortunately; the outtakes and quotes from fictional studies of the paranormal become a little trite. That's a mere quibble, however.

Carrie White resembles those of us who have been the outcast: the ones who were made fun of for what we liked, what we looked like, and how we acted.

The restrictions placed upon us as we grow, sheltering from the truths of life. Stephen King's wife was right when she took this manuscript out of the trash, handed back to him and told him to finish. And \\"Carrie\\" shows what can happen when someone cannot take bullying anymore: it's there, but the results are unknown until it's too late. \\"Carrie\\" is exceptional and shows that Stepehn King isn't just \\"one of the basic writers\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fanastic","review":"I have to say that this an excellent story that i have read.

My only hang-up with the book was the emphasis on how you can't obtain everything you need from one relationship. I feel you can't depend on other people to satisfy you or stroke your ego. The things you're lacking needs to be filled within you, not by someone else.

Bringing art to young children is so important, especially when we live in an era where music and art programs are being cut across the nation. Seeing not only Monet's masterpieces, but also his life, through the eyes of who was at the time a peer was an incredible introduction to his work.

We found the small hotel with the portrait of Esmeralda dancing. It is across from Notre Dame. The old tree was there. We finally made the journey to Monet's home and Garden in the Normandy region. It was better than I could have imagined. I recommend the trip to anyone. The house, the flowers, the flowers, the flowers with the bridge and pond.

She is a young in the industry, but she makes the film watchable to a certain extent. Rakesh Bapat is improving and complements his co-star well. The veteran actors are wasted and the rest of the cast are average tv serial stars.Music by Nikhil-Vinay is average. There is a song after every 5 minutes, and this slackens the pace of an already slow film.

You'd be hard pressed to ID an African American family, regardless of economic/social status, that could not identify w/ having a family member who's doing time or having done so & the hardships associated w/ trying to redeem themselves.

The film drags and you never feel sympathy towards Ana, the protagonist.That is, until the movie's sole highlight: an excellent sequence in which the protagonist teaches a small kid how to court a girl. Its so touching and funny that one wishes the filmmakers would have included more scenes like that.The film also presumes too much familiarity with recent Argentine history. Without that background, the film won't seem to have a point. I would only recommend, and far from enthusiastically, the movie to die-hard fans of Argentine or Latin American cinema."},{"rating":"1","title":"hard to stay awake","review":"it was hard to watch because nothing happened , i had to take a break from it and finish watching it later on, very boring i am from argentina,and like to hear the language and the look at the countryside,that was the only reason i saw it till the end,there was no plot, like home movies"},{"rating":"1","title":"Ana y los otros","review":"I was excited to receive this movie yesterday so i quickly popped it in the dvd player and watched it to it's conclusion.I thought it might pick up sometime in the middle of the flick.But to my dismay it just dragged on for the entire length of the movie.This would'nt be good as a rental.This useless piece of celuloid was about as much fun as a prostate exam.P.S.

Can you be good and strong and pure and yet find your goodness helping evil?Koontz seems to say yes in this novel. To me, that left a bad taste that lasted for days.

I must say, that this was absolutely the worst book I have ever read. The only reason I read it to the end is because I kept hoping that at leaset the ending would be good. (it wasn't).

I spent the majority of this book reading, \\"and he noticed how she moved\\" next page, next page next page. \\"He felt for the boy\\" next page, next page, next page....It's as if he wrote a 100 page book that they demanded that he turn into a longer novel...Very simplistic, the hero fails on nearly every level and yet we're supposed to feel pity for him. Koontz claims that autism can be caused by emotional trauma, a theory that was well disproved 40 years ago...this is a decent idea for a plot that is realized in such a terribly bloated plot as to be painful.Simply more evidence that the Odd Thomas books and everything else by Koontz could not have possibly have been written by the same author...wait for it to hit the .99cent bin..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hopelessly Breathtaking!!!","review":"This book was heart-pounding show-stopping drama.

It's less overtly supernatural, but equally suspenseful and operating on the same subject.A mad religious cult determines one woman's little boy to be the Antichrist. The boy must die! Needless to say, the boy's mother has a few things to say about that - but, since no one's listening and the cops can hardly watch her twenty-four-seven, she takes the little tyke and goes on the lam. The cultists are rather persistent and sneaky, however, and won't exactly leave her or her son alone...Nice, gritty little piece, which works primarily by use of shifting perspective and manipulation of audience expectations. Koontz's religious cultists are not mere cypher villains, but credibly drawn and even often sympathetic characters.You'd think, though, if they were going to reprint this book, they would have given it a better cover.The T.V. movie isn't as good. Read the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I expected!","review":"This is my second Koontz book and I was dissappointed. I first read TICK TOCK in three days. It was great.

To apply the adjective \\"Grecian\\" to the men of Hellas is a travesty. At best, they should have used the term \\"Greeks.\\" Honestly. \\"Grecian\\" is and should ONLY be applied to things manufactured by Greeks, not to Greeks themselves. It's like calling the people of Scotland \\"Scotch.\\" Try that one in an Edinburgh pub and see how long you last.

The subject in itself is most interesting and deserved better than this.

It follows a similar pattern and storyline.The DVD is a decent quality with a bit of grain, but overall a nice picture and sound. There is no overdubbing in English, and the film is in German with subtitles - it lends much credibility to the historical feel to the story however.There is an extra featurette included with interviews with the director and Klaus Maria Brandauer, but is exactly the same as the one on \\"Mephisto\\" so its kind of a waste here.Overall this is a fine DVD and I enjoyed it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Historical fiction lovers will love it ...","review":"This is a story that is not well known to the average American reader but quite well known to Europeans, particularly Austrians who know their history. It is not entirely accurate; especially the ending. Nonetheless, it is visually beautiful and imparts the story of the disillusionment of a man and the disintegration of an Empire from long ago. The good intentions and ambitions of the main character are seen to bend and crack as time goes on and he comes to realize later in life that what he has held near and dear to him are not worth his devotion and time. While a bit slow-moving at times, the plot develops methodically and the screws are continually tightened until the inevitable conflict bursts open. A patient viewer with a love of history and human psychology will enjoy this film quite a lot."},{"rating":"1","title":"A botched movie with some very good actors.","review":"The actors are excellent and the movie gives what seems to be a good presentation of life at the beginning of the 20th century in the Austro-Hungarian Empire.However, there is little connection between the real story of Colonel Redl's betrayal as a Russian spy and the confusing plot of this movie.The real story, entirely missed by the script, was that Redl had modernized Austrian counter-espionage techniques, and, ironically was in the end caught by a colleague who had been trained by himself. What goes around, comes around...You'll learn more about this story on Wikipedia. Why the movie makers decided to screw up a good plot, we'll never know."},{"rating":"2","title":"Joe rocks. And will rock forever.","review":"The music on this album is so good, it hurts. Every single second of this ambum is real, is true, is pure, is coming straight from the heart. It hits you like droplets of diamonds suddenly coming on your face. Sandpaper Blues and Willesdon to Criklewood are hipnotic, Yalla Yalla pours into your heart with such an intensity that you must refrain from hitting the replay button over and over again... The whole album is fascinating. And addictive. If you listen to it on a cold rainy day, the room will fill with the brightest light and you will feel the warmth and breeze of a sunny day on a beach somewhere on the Spanish coast.I knew Joe Strummer of The Clash, I also knew what a fantastic producer he was for The Pogues (I totally love their Hell's Ditch album), but this album just reveals Joe Strummer's genius. What a musician, poet, rocker and free spirit..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Touching and Heartfelt","review":"To start off, I've been a huge Clash fan since i was like 7. Not only are they one of my favorite bands (up there with the Beatles, Violent Femmes, and non-swing Cherry Poppin' Daddies), they were one of the most intelligent and genre-bending. As everyone knows, they disbanded in the mid-80s, and it's great to see that half of the driving force behind the band hasn't lost his musical prowess. Strummer's new album, while very un-Clash (with the exception of their slower numbers, a la Straight to Hell, et al), is a poignant, subtle album filled with his obvious penchant for electronica (as seen on the Grosse Pointe Blank soundtrack). I'm tempted to compare this album to my all time favorite, Bob Dylan's Time Out of Mind. Both albums are by men who have experienced quite a full life and may be getting older, but by no means rustier."},{"rating":"2","title":"Triumphant Return of a rock Icon","review":"First impressions are often wrong. After my first session with \\"Rock Art and the X-ray Style\\" I was a little dissappointed. Tony Adams, X-ray Style, Techno D-day and Diggin' the New jumped off the disc but i thought the rest fell into mediocrity. After about four listenings, I was delited to find I'd changed my mind. The whole album has a flow and continuity few others could achieve, especially considering the eclectic mix of styles. Strummer has a talent for plucking bits from disparate styles (blues, punk, techno, African chant, reggae) and weaving them into a seamless whole that is more than the sum of its parts. His new band, the Mescaleros, do an exceptional job of realizing Strummer's vision, and the former Clash-man's voice still has a bit of the old punk venom. Strummer says this is music for adults, and the maturity of the lyrics (he is in his late 40's after all) reflect a changed but still passionate man."},{"rating":"1","title":"No disrespect to Joe Strummer but...","review":"This is the only album I own of Joe Strummer minus The Clash. I can't say it's very good. I hate having to compare it with it with his work with The Clash but it's inevitable. His lyrics aren't as great, edgy or provocative. There isn't any fantastic music either. I am not really sure what to say since I haven't listened to the album in so long because it was so bad, I truly tried my hardest to like it. But I feel it is my duty to advise others to not make the same mistake. Believe me: I absolutely love everything about The Clash, the lyrics, Joe's voice, the music, the attitude and how cool they were, this is not Joe at his best, it's cool though cause now he's gone: go buy some Bob Marley albums instead, Joe would not have minded."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disillusioned","review":"I have to agree with the person a few reviews below. I am a big fan of the Clash, but this is nothing like it. The only thing that is the same is Joe Strummer's voice. Take away the great melodies, raw sound and raw loud guitars, the energy, the horns and pianos. Add \\"bigger\\" modern electronic sounding beats, and some other electronic sounds (bad joe, bad). All the songs have louder drums and are empty sounding. None of them have unique melodies or leave an impression. And anybody claiming that this album has kind of a world vibe is full of it. If you want to buy this I suggest listening to the song clips featured. I made the silly mistake of bypassing that option."},{"rating":"2","title":"A classic","review":"Still haven't found any real competitor for the Devils Dictionary.Sheer honesty abounds.

Pynchon hits a lot of easy targets - right wingers, Southern California crazies, environmental spoilage and pointless wealth accumulation - but if there is a bigger theme, I couldn't find it. As a reader, I don't feel challenged; I feel defeated."},{"rating":"1","title":"horrifically perverse and nightmarish","review":"Horrifically perverse and nihilistic.

The story line seemed to be simply about the 60s and conspiracies and I thought it was weird. On re-reading the book I really got more of a feeling of Oed in the real present shifting world of sensuality and craziness and random stuff with shit just happening on top of it all. She gets The Call. Her search for the truth leads her to frustration and yer basic angst with a touch of ennui. My feeling is that this book is about whether we can know or distinguish between conspiracies that are forces of history, gradually becoming obscure and being assimilated into the landscape and those of the present that are more personal and acute. Is there a difference or is all history (and every-day life)the result of treachery, deceit and politics? Does it matter? Oh, yeah, I really got into it alot more after I reread it."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Bear Just Ate Me!","review":"I wrote a paper on this book. In his comments, my TA wrote: \\"sometimes you eat the bear, well, sometimes the bear eats you...\\" Ha, Ha. It's simply unbelievable how big that bear is. In fact, it reminds me of those fractals in math: infinitely complex -- whenever you think you've \\"got it,\\" take one step back, and \\"it\\" turns out to be just one almost negligible part of the infinite complexity of this strange tale of conspiracy, religion, history, love, criticism on literary critics, LSD, Nazi doctors, anarchy, American Dream... the list goes on and on. They are all connected, and very powerful. The style and content are fused with such wonder unlike anything I've ever dreamed of. One point may deserve special notice for historic purpose: Pychon is truly a visionary -- he saw The Information Age, with all of its power and frailty, more than 30 years ago, long before cellphone, internet, pc, and all of those modern technological wonders."},{"rating":"2","title":"Razor Sharp","review":"Pynchon hits the nail on the head. The subject matter is fantastic, but that isn't the book's strong point. Pynchon weaves an elaborate tale through the eyes of Oedipa, and allows the reader to trace her development through the course of the novel. It's a strange and wonderful journey."},{"rating":"1","title":"Quite stressful","review":"Though I admire Pynchon as a monumental writer in postmodern American literature, I must say that reading The Crying of Lot 49 was anything but relaxing. I truly admire Pynchon's clever wit and humor, but the symbolism and references hidden behind every other word made me feel absolutely exhausted. I would still recommend this book, but only to someone who is up for a deep, mind-twisting read - not for a soothing novel for the tub."},{"rating":"1","title":"Read only as an assignment","review":"First, the positives: this book is very short and recognizably Pynchonian. This combination has led it to be assigned in many literature and writing classes.Unfortunately, it shows Pynchon in lazy and aimless mode. None of the stroboscopic brilliance of Gravity's Rainbow or the human mystery of V is available here. If you don't have time to read one of those books, read some fragment of them, and you will still experience more than by reading this ephemera, and enjoy it more as well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Por favor, nada Maas.","review":"I was vaguely aware of the existence of Thomas Pynchon, and after hearing a brief summary of CoL49 I went to the library and grabbed this and 'V'. I got as far as page seventy before I hung it up and decided to take them both back. It's got that weird wacky 'everything ends up being connected' vibe of my favorite Vonnegut books, but without the humor or the sense that I cared about the characters or what happened next. I never really got a sense of character from anybody except Mucho Maas, and people seemed to behave in whatever manner would propel the chaos engine Pynchon was frantically trying to keep spinning with this book. The writing felt awkward and disjointed, sentences sometimes needing two or three readings to decipher. But it did keep making me think \\"I should read Slaughterhouse Five again\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tiresome","review":"The first chapter is interesting enough to keep you reading, but it gets tiresome quite rapidly. The characters, funny as they may be - initially - are getting mired in a strange theory of conspiracy.Unfortunately, the plot doesn't stick and the reader looses interest in it. After the VERY long description of the \\"Courier's Tragedy\\" play you are left with the feeling that enough is enough...I understand the pivotal, crucial part the play has in the book but still...devoting such a long chapter to it is an overkill.The only motive to keep on reading is that the book is short, Pynchon is a true master of the English language, funny / interesting situations appear from time to time and one expects Pynchon to deliver.This does not happen and the book ends leaving the reader with the feeling that he/she couldn't care more if the conspiracy detailed really had a base in reality or not."},{"rating":"1","title":"What is this I don't even","review":"This book was absolutely insufferable. The plot was convoluted, the characters were unlikable, and the prose was simultaneously confusing and boring. I didn't finish it. I suppose if you like post modernist crap?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Too all over the map.","review":"I have never read a book that had single sentences running for two thirds of a page until I read this book. This book had no flow do to writers style of writing. I will read a later book by Pynchon before I decide if his style and stories work for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pynchon donates a masterful stroke to mankind.","review":"Pynchon weaves us through one of his most convoluted tales. Mayhem reigns as we follow the misguided Oedipa Mas into debacles of sex and booze, and booze-induced sex. The names alone are worth this relatively quick read (Mucho Mas, Mike Fallopian), but fortunately this is not all the fun with which Pynchon provides us. We spiral hand-in-hand into madness with Oedipa: is she really uncovering the mysteries of the Muted Postal Horn, or is she being driven to the brink by the demented plot of a deceased former lover? There are no definitive answers, but are there ever?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Go Postal with this wry conspiracy satire","review":"\\"The Crying of Lot 49\\" slowly unfolds into a conspiracy theory so crazy it just might be true. After reading it, I started looking for signs of its truth, and, either it is true, or fans of the novel have planted the signs themselves. Maybe both.Not just a paranoid lark, though, \\"49\\" is a wonderful satire of power structures. Like the best cyberpunk novels (Stephenson, Gibson), the satire is not so broad that it slaps you in the face immediately. But by the time you get to \\"KCUF\\" radio, you're pretty sure that not everything is meant to be taken at face value :-)Maybe it's the fact that we're recycling a lot of 70s culture now, but the satire doesn't seem that dated. Like Swift, it ages well.If you've been afraid of Pynchon for his pop-yet-pomo reputation, try this one out."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointing....","review":"After reading the great reviews, I was really excited to obtain a copy, but was quickly disappointed. The story was dated pretentious nonsense from the sixties and hasn't aged well. Read it if you like to torture youself alacommunity college Contemporary American Lit., or better, just keep it on the shelf to impress your friends. When they ask you about it, make something up. They'll never read it anyway."},{"rating":"1","title":"A major WASTE of time","review":"When I started reading this book, I was expecting a Victorian crime drama. I couldn't have been more disappointed! I guess I should have bought something by Paglia (pron. Pole-ya) instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"I gave it my all...","review":"I sat down and read each of the six chapters TWICE in this novel, and I didn't understand hardly anything. I know Pynchon is an outstanding author and I'm sure there's plenty of symbolism I should have picked up on, but guess what? I didn't. I like novels that make you think, but this one is like looking at a piece of art and just drawing a blank. The characters are interesting, but not detailed. No one can deny that... The story itself is engrossing for the first 50 or so pages. Then I just completely lost where Pynchon took the novel. Do you have to be over forty years old and have three degrees in English to understand his concepts? However, if anyone would like to explain any aspect of the novel to me, I would love to hear about it. Just use the address provided above. Thank you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Is It Over Yet?","review":"I have this problem that once I commit to reading a book I can't put it down because I think that if I keep reading, maybe, eventually something worth reading will come up in the later pages.This is why I dislike The Crying of Lot 49. The author goes on and on like a crazy hobo in an unending stream of conscious.This book could easily be a short story. It's not subtle at all where the author spends pages and pages over using metaphors and similes, going on tangents and generally trying desperately to fill out what never should have been an entire book in the first place.It took me weeks to finish this short read that should have taken only a few hours because I kept putting it down and eying it like a disenchanted child staring down a plate of vegetables."},{"rating":"2","title":"masterpiece of paranoia","review":"This is probably Pynchon's best and most accessible novel. It's a masterpiece of 60s paranoia, dragging the reader into a plot that seems improbably but becomes terrifyingly true as the book goes on. It's also really funny. Some of the jokes are specific to the time it was published (1966) but it contains enough oddball characters and situations to keep readers entertained. it's a short book, a novella, that's a good introduction to the reclusive writer. If you liked this book, I'd suggest moving on to V."},{"rating":"2","title":"Trying to Clot Your Mind","review":"Funny & confusing, but due to its length, a great introduction to Pynchon. Even though you find it hard to know what's going on, you don't have to wade through hundreds of pages for the finish.The comparison with Ulysses is not, in my opinion, very apt. While Pynchon had obviously read it, he didn't try to write Ulysses Lite.Enjoyably convoluted and worth the effort."},{"rating":"2","title":"Postal service conspiracy!","review":"I've never read Pynchon before, but his style, those winding, iridescent sentences seem like an important reference point for a lot of American authors who come after him, people like Don Delillo, Donald Barthelme, David Foster-Wallace, Johnathan Franzen, Neal Stephenson, William Gibson etc. He's able to synthesize obscurant historical references, pop culture, conspiratorial paranoia and drug use into this funky, swirling melange. It would almost be a kind of metaphysics, if it wasn't so kooky and consistently playful. Reading this, it feels like someone peeling off the surface of postwar American life, showing you this messy, bizarre, occasionally terrifying blend of forces that might have it in for you, or might just be yanking your chain. Or maybe both."},{"rating":"2","title":"reserved endorsement","review":"While Pynchon's circular, postmodern storytelling techinques can be misleading and frustrating; the story emerges as a compelling condemnation of everything America stood for at the end of the second world war. After reading this novella, you will never be able to drive through a suburban strip mall again."},{"rating":"2","title":"First two pages blues","review":"I was forced into reading this book as an example of postmodernist literature. As I attempted to read it, I found it impossible to read past the first two pages, losing attention with the unusual stream of consciousness style of Pynchon's writing. Finally I made a breakthrough, and found myself in the most tightly-packed, symbolism-ridden novel I have ever read. It was indeed gripping, and it was only my caffeine-induced stupor that prevented me from reading it at a more deep level. It has proved fruitful to me with its example of adversary culture, fighting against the technocracy and alienation of a postmodernist society, and refresingly it was really funny as well. One of the great American novels of the 20th Century, capturing the spirit of the sixties as well as \\"The Great Gatsby\\" did with the twenties, and as well as \\"Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas\\" captured the spirit of Hunter S. Thompson's paranoid, acid-fried state-of-mind."},{"rating":"1","title":"Some wit embedded in impenetrable gibberish","review":"Reading this book is a painful experience. But those that manage to slug through this gleaming example of the nadir of 20th century prose will get the occasional chuckle. I am positive that Pynchon does have something of value to say, and if you can make it through his unintelligible writing style and acid-head syntax, I am sure you can find it."},{"rating":"1","title":"I Wanted to Like Pynchon","review":"But boy, this book just turned me off completely. I take the point of the reader who wrote the review \\"Great Writers Are Not to Blame for Your Lack of Education\\", but I also believe that one should feel free to say, \\"I just didn't like it\\" and not have to worry about having your intelligence or lack thereof implicated. Having said that-- the character names; silly. Plot development; nonexistent. Characters; flat flat flat. This is all purely my opinion-- I'm definitely more of a classics reader. But I did get an education, and continue to educate myself, so I don't feel too bad about not liking Pynchon. And I think I may still give Gravity's Rainbow a try, you never know..."},{"rating":"2","title":"My Favorite Book","review":"This is my favorite book, but its not for everyone. Pynchon's style is dense and you'll find yourself reading sentences two or three times before you can make out the grammar.The story reads like a mystery, but this plot is only a cover for the philosophy Pynchon is proposing. Once you find the philosophy, though, a second and third read will reveal that the story of Oedipa and even the structure of the book are examples of that philosophy. Oh yeah, and its funny as hell too.If you can deal with Pynchon's style and stave off the idea that he is simply toying with his readers, then The Crying of Lot 49 is one of the most rewarding little books you'll find."},{"rating":"2","title":"buy it right now","review":"Gold. Gold. A hallmark of everything modern lit should be. This kind of writing is the heart and soul of our age. This is the stuff of canon, the kind of book and the kind of author they'll be studying 200 yrs from now in some 20th Century American Lit course, the professor will be saying \\"this is one of the best articulations of post WW2 cold war era american paranoia.\\" this novel is gold jerry, gold."},{"rating":"1","title":"this book SUCKS. Even Pynchon hates it.","review":"Don't even bother this book is such a bummer. It's so antagonistically *quirky* it reminds you immediately of the talentless fiction writers sucking up to the teacher in the front of the class who all swore a vow of loyalty to Pynchon and whacky antics. V. is much better. So is Gravity's Rainbow. This book SUCKS. I was so frustrated after finishing it I questioned throwing it out the window. It's just stupid and obvious and all it's got going for it is it's obvious drive to be zany. Word on the street is even Pynchon thought it was a jerk."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unreadable","review":"To whomever wrote the review from Washington D.C. titled \\"I would rather read the IRS Tax Guide\\": Right on! I am a college student who had to read this book for a contemporary American literature class. I couldn't get past page forty. Pynchon's prose is virtually unreadable and I had to give up. I also didn't find Pynchon's humor very funny. As a classical music lover, I didn't care too much for his joke about the Vivaldi \\"Kazoo Concerto.\\" Was that really necessary to understand what was going on in the novel?Of course, to be fair, I couldn't understand a thing. My class professor told me that whether I liked the novel or not, that this was how the world is. I told him, \\"No, it's Pynchon's world, not mine.\\" To those of you who consider yourself on a higher intellectual plane than me and the rest of the general population, I say, all the more power to you.But please leave the rest of us alone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Confusion, hysteria, paranoia, rambling, etc.","review":"T.P. novel, Lot 49, was introduced to me by an English professor at the university I attend. I can tell anyone that it is the worst novel (fiction for that matter!) that I have ever read. I enjoy reading fiction and I cannot believe that this novel could ever be popular. P's sentences ramble on and on as if he was in a state of mass hysteria or a drug induced coma when he was writing. Not only does this novel not make sense, I have to agree with another reader that it is not in the least bit interesting.

Gads, it was dreadful."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wow, was this excrutiating","review":"I got half way in, expecting something to happen, but nothing ever did. I learned nothing about the characters, the story did not move forward, and massive amounts of irrelevant trivia were thrown in - to make the writer seem clever? In this book, the joke's on the reader. Stay away unless you also really dig monotonal music too."},{"rating":"2","title":"Exposes the pleasures of paranoia and conspiracy","review":"Thomas Pynchon presents an anarchic, exhilerating glimpse into a life opening itself to observation and thus paranoia. Executing an eccentric's will, the main character discovers a secret postal service conducting its own deliveries and possessing its own history. The speed and implied meaning of the connections being made moves the reader into the grinning daze of a psychodelic's trance."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good enough for goverment work..","review":"COL 49 is a good warmup for V. no doubt, but while touted as being more 'accessible' than either V. or Gravity's Rainbow, is more like a notebook or sketchbook for those books.There are many clever metaphors floating in this Sargasso Sea, but Pynchon will never be a master of character. Not all novels are about human character but those which are not seem to suffer from the problems the aforenamed Sargasso does; still, shallow and crowded with flotsam.Perhaps Pynchon is the greatest American novelist of our time; maybe Jeff Koons is the 'greatest' American artist of our time; maybe our deepest sentiments and hopes have been invested in our cars. Keep living and see what changes."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good read","review":"This is a good intro to Pynchon's works.An unusual mix of light hearted, even slap stick humor, think Three Stooges, and deep literary references.Combine it with an underlying conspiracy and you get a good feel for Pynchon's style.I don't think this is his best work. Not as funny as Vineland. Not as deep or dark as V."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not my cup of tea","review":"It was such a chaotic book that it only produces nonsense. It didn't stimulate me intellectually at all. The only scene I thought enjoyable was the encounter between Oedipa and Metzger in the hotel. I laughed out loud."},{"rating":"1","title":"Noteworthy, yes... but a pleasure to read, not so much...","review":"To say this book is odd would be an understatement. It almost feels like it induces paranoia, hallucinations, and delusions all at once. I can't say I really enjoyed reading it -- with the exception of the first chapter, which was quite fun -- but I did appreciate it. I found Pynchon's sense of humor very entertaining -- my particular favorite character name being Genghis Cohen -- but the plot became so convoluted that I just kind of gave up trying to figure it out. I think that was sort of the point, though: giving up on \\"reality\\" and just accepting the absurdity and uncertainty. In the 1960s when this was written, I have no doubt his style was novel and groundbreaking. Now, it just seems to be a case of \\"been there, done that.\\" I appreciate the satire, but think its message is still eluding me. Maybe it will come to me down the line, perhaps through that nebulous, conspiratorial entity Pynchon attempts to expose: The Postal Service!"},{"rating":"2","title":"What is Lynn Miles Like?","review":"I can hear a little Shawn Colvin wistful in her.

I Knew it Was Love is both dirge rock, and a minor echo of Diamonds and Rust.You can fall in love with these songs.

And he does it without any of the language of \\"educationese,\\" the gobbledygook that so often clutters books about educational issues and makes them opaque and unpleasant tasks to read. Everything he says is immediate, concrete, and down to earth, drawn from specific observations of particular children, working effectively to learn whatever interests them.

It was encouraging, inspiring, and challenging to see the incredible faith and bravery of Corrie and her family. To see what they went through -- all because they chose to do what was right and good -- reminded me that the things we think of as \\"important\\" are often not so important at all.

It is the depicting of lives like these that demonstrate to me how relevant The Bible really is. While the experiences of the Ten Boom family were horrific, the writers have managed to convey these times without recourse to extreme description - we are given a clear understanding without being subjected to the deep ugliness of the times, and the grace and glory of God are given a higher priority than the evil in which these dear people lived.

I didn't pay much attention to it at the time, being so young. Now, I am in 11th grade and have read the book at least four times through, and I am now searching the Internet for further information. This book was a great inspiration to me. I very much admire Corrie ten Boom for her bravery and her trust in God to take care of her and her family. She broke all the rules of the German government to obey her Heavenly Authority, and that's something you don't see much of anymore. I am so awed over this woman and her story that I am now planning a trip to Haarlem some time after college. God bless all the men and women involved in spreading Corrie's story across the world!"},{"rating":"2","title":"My favorite out of all of Corrie Ten Boom's Books!","review":"While this is disturbing, it's also uplifting because the book is written form her perspective as a Christian and it portrays that God is in control even under the most difficult circumstances."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Hiding Place","review":"I bought a used copy from Amazon, and was pleasantly surprised to see what good condition it was in.

It was very meaningful and thought-provoking."},{"rating":"2","title":"True story of courage and prayer transcends adversity to inspire","review":"Outstanding audio-drama of the true story of Christian Corrie ten Boom, underground leader in Holland. Story begins with her life in Holland and takes you through her Nazi capture and imprisonment in concentration camps. When she is released, she overcomes the odds and rises up to bring healing and hope first through her center for peace (set up after the war to help former prisoners heal) and then as an inspiring international speaker. I stayed up most of the night with headphones on and tears streaming down my face. Life can be so rich. Yes, a bit religious, but not dogma; it's so much more."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book!","review":"Awesome book. I read this book years ago and love reading it again and again. Corrie was a remarkable woman. This is truly faith in action. Have you been deeply wronged? Find it hard to forgive? Bitterness eating you up on the inside and killing you spiritually?

And to my children, too.Corrie and Betsie Ten Boom are two of the most amazing people I have ever read about. The story rings true, too.

This is an amazing story about a Christian family whose faith does not waver even while enduring great trials. Corrie ten Boom actually becomes the head of an underground movement, providing for those persecuted by the Germans. She survives her time in concentration camps and then aids others in their healing after the war. Of course, this book is really the story of God's faithfulness and of his always providing for our needs."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful book - not a great copy","review":"I have only just started the book and have already found one editing error.

I will never forget reading this."},{"rating":"2","title":"The family who gave everything","review":"I've owned The Hiding Place for 15 years and once a year I get it out and read it again. Why, because it's a story that's worth reading once a year. There is no family that had so little yet gave so much. Corrie Ten Boom is one of the most humble and beautiful ladies who ever walked this earth and so was the rest of her family, except they were all killed serving others. Buy this book and you'll be changed forever - for the good, the for good you'll strive for like you've never striven for in your whole life because if this simple little family could do it, than any of us can. It's not just about the Holocaust, it's about how we can make a difference in today and in the lives of everyone around us. Corrie wrote other great books, but this is the crowning piece since it's simplicity and honestly of both strengths and weaknesses were put out there for us all to see up close and in person. I have it within 2 feet of the computer I sit at right now. Hopefully you will too."},{"rating":"2","title":"My favorite book","review":"I have read this book over 7 times in the past 40 years. I read it when it first came out in the 70's. I was a young woman and it inspired me and touched me so much. I have read it over and over and just read it again on my Kindle that my children gave me for my 61st birthday. Corrie ten Boom is my mentor, next to my mother's words, her words have encouraged me and touched more than any other . Consider yourself blessed if you order this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Audio Book","review":"I have really enjoyed this purchase. Not only did I get it $10 cheaper than the sticker price, the quality is excellent. The woman who narrates does all the voices for all the characters and she does an excellent job! I was so drawn to listening to the whole thing and couldn't wait to wake up and finish it. It skipped and repeated in my car's CD player but is perfect on my computer. It is unabridged and I didn't know for certain when I purchased it. I am so glad it is, I can follow it word for word in the book. It comes on 8 CD's. Corrie's story is an encouraging one. I recommend this particular recording very highly!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A novel that I will read again","review":"I originally purchased this book after seeing the movie for colored girls. I had criticized the movie without reading the play and I wanted to see what exactly the author's writing style was like.I enjoyed the way the chapters are set up jumping from Sassafrass to Cypress to Indigo once I was consumed in one story the next chapter moved on to another sister or a little from their mother. Another reviewer had said the story line isn't nail biting but the books presentation definitely keeps you from getting bored. I want to read the book again to see what I missed the first time I read it.The book is heart-warming story of a group of women who unconditionally love one another."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lenox is always quality","review":"These are lovely quality napkins rings.

This is the full length, uncut Italian version of Phenomena that is longer than all other versions of the movie. There are a few brief scenes that weren't even on the Anchor Bay DVD. Since they were never dubbed, they are presented on this Blu-ray in Italian with subtitles. The picture quality is very good - perhaps they used a little DNR, but it looks very sharp on my TV. The extras include an almost hour-long documentary. It's definitely the best available edition of this film, which continues to polarize Argento fans. Personally, it's always been a favorite of mine. If you love Phenomena, do not hesitate to buy this great release."},{"rating":"2","title":"PHENOMENA---It will make your skin crawl...","review":"...and it did. PHENOMENA was awesome. Jennifer Connely is sassy, beautiful, and a little on the odd side. The ending sequence is awesome. I was really suprised when Dario revealed the killer's identity. I didn't really get it, but after the second viewing I finally figured it out. Note: Pay attention to every piece of dialogue. The music is really cool too. There are also 25 minutes of features on the VHS tape including: two music videos, the theatrical trailer, behind the scenes featurette and an interview with Dario Argento. Note: Stay away from the 28 minute cut version entitled CREEPERS. It's horrible. Do yourself a favor, buy this video and treasure it. It will bring you everlasting enjoyment."},{"rating":"2","title":"ARGENTO LOVES THOSE MAGGOTS!!!","review":"Jennifer Connelly is phenomenal as the innocent boarding room schoolgirl who, through telepathic powers, can communicate with insects.

The acting was pretty bad, the story just doesn't make much sense, not a lot of his cool shots, not a lot of gore until the end and it has a monkey smarter then everybody else.

One night when she has woken up from her sleepwalking, she is brought to Professor John McGregor's residence by his assistant. She finds out that Professor McGregor is an entomologist and she has an ability to communicate with insects. Together, these two skills seem to be very helpful in the search for the killer of young girls. Phenomena is a film that looses its audience due to its weak story, but might keep some folks attention with its gruesome and creepy effects."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unsettling, quirky, and peculiarly charming, but not good","review":"Low budget Italian horror with an American star.Good?

No."},{"rating":"2","title":"80's horror you probably never seen","review":"I am just getting into Argento but i think what you need to do to enjoy his films is forget about the acting, and watch the way he works the camera and sells suspense. from the moment you turn the movie on you start to feel like this is going to be really good.The way he uses the Swiss Countryside and Goblins score, make this movie pretty creepy. Jen Connelly has this cosmic link with inscects and all these murders are going on, and the flies are telling her whats up. or something like that. Look the story's not the point. Watch the movie and you will be shocked at the murders, the motives, and the monkey? I enjoyed this film.

I'm a big horror fan, I like \\"weird and offbeat horror\\", and have enjoyed other Italian horror films by such directors as Mario Bava. Based on the great reviews of this movie on this site, I decided to pick this one up and was I ever disappointed. It's not scary and you'll see more gore in a Friday the 13th or Freddy Kreuger movie. The plot is so incoherent that the film becomes absolutely tiresome to watch. The only good things about it are seeing Jennifer Connelly run around in her nightgown, and the heavy metal soundtrack (which actually sounds very misplaced in parts of the film). The best part of the DVD is listening to the commentary by the filmmakers, who actually seem to think they've made some great piece of art with this film, when it's really just high-budget amateur hour. The only reason to watch this film is if you want to see a slightly weird, bad horror movie. If you do watch it, keep your expectations waaaay low."},{"rating":"1","title":"Freaky and Stupid.","review":"This was one of the worst movies that I have ever seen in my life!

I HATE it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Phenomena","review":"This movie could have benefited from so many things. Acting, Acoustics and Story line were the major shortcomings.

I consider the time watching this movie well wasted."},{"rating":"2","title":"monkeys, maniacs, mutants, and creepy crawlies by the ton","review":"What more could you want from a horror movie? A pretty schoolgirl who commands armies of insects, a knife wielding serial killer, a deformed boy kept chained to a wall in the attic, a vengeful helper monkey with a razor blade, Donald Pleasence, delirious camerawork, blindingly gorgeous cinematography, pulsating music, characters who behave strangely for no particular reason, lots of pockets of glowing blue light (see where X-Files got some of their aesthetic ideas), surreally graphic violence, beautiful scenery, it's all right here. Sure, it's not Dario Argento's best work, but it's his most eccentric. Besides, why not watch a real horror film instead of Scream?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Dario's favorite, and one of mine, too","review":"Many people call this one of Dario's weakest films, yet it is Dario's favorite. I loved it, as well. It feels like one long, frightening, beautiful dream where anything that can happen does happen.The plot revolves around Jennifer Corvino (Jennifer Connelly), the daughter of an international movie star who is sent to a Swiss boarding school for education. While getting settled in, she learns of a murderer killing girls in the area. Also, we learn that she can communicate with insects.That night, she has a sleepwalking attack, and witnesses something before ending up at the home of John McGregor (Donald Pleasence). The two become friends, as more people die and Jennifer's school think she has gone insane.This film was my introduction to Dario's work and I have been a fan ever since. I believe Tenebrae would be a better introduction to Dario, but this is still a wonderful film. Check it out."},{"rating":"2","title":"very original","review":"This is a very interesting and original horror.

Those by the Pre-Raphaelite artists, Rossetti / Millais and Holman Hunt are all reproduced in this fine little hard-cover book. Edward Moxon was a poetry lover and had a long association with Alfred Lord Tennyson. The price at publication was 32/- a massive sum at the time.The book features lovely, B&W; prints of: Recollections of Arabian Nights; The Lady of Shallot, Godiva; Sir Galahad, and many more.

While the fabric is lightweight, it is very good for cool weather. I guess the micro-weave keeps the wind and cool weather out.

I was very frustrating and did not even look at other things! I contacted the seller and they told me it's not a manufacture defect, IT IS JUST THE WOOD THEY USE FOR THIS GUITAR!!I returned the guitar and as a result lost 18$ for shipping (the company was kind enough to send me a return label)Youtube \\"Brad Davis Demonstrates a Takamine Jasmine S33\\".

I am pleased to listen to this live CD, as it gives me a heart-warming feeling like meeting with old friends. Most of the songs were simply played with acoustic guitars, and showed good harmony. It appears to me that throughout these 30 years, there is little change in the voice of Gerry and Dewey. But I miss the voice of Dan Peek. If he had performed in this conert, the sound would be richer and more harmonic. Anyway, this set of songs perfected America as one of the leading folk-rock band."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great acoustic concert in HDCD!","review":"For those that care, this cd is encoded as a HDCD, so if you have a HDCD compatible player, this album just sparkles!Anyway, it is a great recording and performance of just Gerry and Dewey on acoustic guitars and piano.

A very special recording.I don't know why record labels don't label HDCD's as such when they sell them."},{"rating":"2","title":"A solid performance","review":"I was hoping for a more intimate sound since it was just the two of them with their guitars. But with the venue being what it was, it sounds like their other live albums just without the rest of the band. But they do a good job with the songs. I believe this is the only official release of the extended version of \\"Riverside\\", so that should be justification enough for America fans to pick up the CD. It also has several other songs not found on any other live CD such as \\"Windwave\\", \\"Baby It's Up To You\\", and the classic \\"Three Roses\\".

I highly recommend its reading for those who are new to the faith and to long-time followers."},{"rating":"2","title":"great book","review":"This book has a lot of interesting ideas. I believe that Calvinism is true because this book backs up all of its ideas with Scripture references,and if bible is true so is this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Fit for Consumption","review":"Boettner's book presents to the world some of the sloppiest scholarship on record. The cited references to scripture do not in many cases actually support the author's claims. Citations to those passages from scripture which do not supportive the predestinationst polemic are absent, leaving the reader with no informed way to decide."},{"rating":"1","title":"I still don't get Calvanism","review":"I have read a number of books that outline Calvinism--in its various shades--and musts admit that the logic of their arguments are very tight and usually the books make for an enjoyable read. However, when I go back to the scripture, the whole system seems to fall apart. The whole theme of Hebrews and much of 2 Peter deal with the apostasy of a believer(s)--not 'apparent apostasy or a scenario that could never really happen to a real believer'--but true bonifide apostasy!I could go on and on but I no longer see the point. For the Arminian view has truly won out in the arena of ideas. I have come to realize that 1) True Calvinist are rare and hard to find within Christendom and 2) they have become the theological Amish of the protestant world-fun to look at but never really seriously considered by the thinking world of the protestant faith."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the Best Biblical Presentations of Predestination","review":"Dr. Boettner's book is one of the best works I have ever read on the doctrine of predestination from a Reformed perspective. The book is not a book that debates and ignores the issues but takes the reader directly to the Word of God as the source for its foundation.Whether you are a Calvinist or an Arminian, you would do yourself well to purchase this book and digest the meat found therein. The book, while covering a rather deep subject, remains quite easy to read and the content of Dr. Boettner's thoughts flow together easily.A great book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Sonia sings in Spanish!!!!","review":"Fallin is the best song on this album. \\"I don't know if I'm drunk\\" either.

The unit had died. I called Holmes and was told that the problem could not be fixed.Last winter I went out and bought another unit. It worked well throughout the winter season. At the end of the season I followed the cleaning / storage instructions and put it away.This morning I setup the humidifier and got the dreaded two light error again. One bad unit is a freak.

Unfortunately that the problem. I've had to buy 4 of these because they self destruct after about a year of use. The last one was replaced by Bosch and the replacement broke 3 months later. This all stems from a spinning gyroscope in the apex of the gauge. Even slight concussions can interrupt this. It also appears from careful examination of the broken protractors that they use sub standard glues to hold the moving parts in place. This may mean that the device cannot handle high temperatures. Which happens when you leave it in a work box or truck. I keep buying them because they work great and I can't fabricate metal without them, but this is is not a durable product."},{"rating":"2","title":"A versatile, quality made tool","review":"I bought the Bosch DWM40LK because I was installing a lot of crown molding.

Then recently it stopped working properly. The tool would give me the angle measurement, but not the miter, bevel or spring. I thought it might be the batteries, so I put new ones in. This did not solve the problem. It was the electronics in the tool it self. Every time I pressed the button to get these measurements the tool would display three dashes on the screen. So finally I decided to pack up the tool and send it to Bosch. It was still under warranty, but it was a hassle just the same. Bosch told me they could not fix it and would send me a new one, fine. I finally get the tool back and want to use it to finish my project, press the button to get the miter angle and again it is doing the same thing as before, what a lousy tool. This tool was not cheap, and I expect it to work when I need it to. I thought Bosch was known for quality, now the only thing I think they stand for is unreliability and aggravation. Buyer beware!"},{"rating":"2","title":"miterfinder","review":"The BOSCH miter finder is the best for crown installation. We all know that a house is not perfectly square in every corner. This product takes the guess work out of adjusting crown cuts. Use it right and you only need to cut your crown once. Wouldn't use anything else."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bosch Miter Finder is Great","review":"This is a supurb instrument. I use it all the time for my crown molding. Since, walls seldom have perfect 90 degree angles, the machine will measure the angle of the wall then give you the angle of the bevel and miter to make perfect cuts on your miter saw. Miters come out perfect every time. My only criticism is, you have to re-enter the spring angle of your crown molding every time. When you put up crown molding the spirng angle is angle the crown molding attaches to the wall. It is usually 52 or 45 degrees. It would be nice if the miter finder had a memory button which could retain the spring angle instead of re-entering it every measurement ."},{"rating":"2","title":"Boucheron, After Shave Balm","review":"Ever suffer from razor burn? Well, this is one of the best products for that cool, soothing feeling. Furthermore, it is the only balm with a musky, masculine scent that lasts all day.

He says, however, that in reading such stories I was indoctrinated as a child. He villifies our childhood comic books, and blames them for the mistakes that people in our country have made as adults.

From Barbarian with its brute strength to Sorceress with fire, ice, and lightning mastery. From Necromancer with his undead minions, Druid with his wolves and bear minion and natural magic including lycanthropy, to martial artist Assassin. Plus bow/javelin wielding Amazon and party leader Paladin.Whether you are a fan of D&D (Forgotten Realm, Dragon Lance) or RPG (Final Fantasy), you will find this game very enjoyable.

Another extremely annoying thing is that sites that dupe or hack to create items jump into your games to announce they sell these items for real money and to go to their site to purchase them.

Yet, they want us to pay $40 for this. I'm sorry, but that makes absolutely no sense; at best this entire package could be valued at $20, though in all practicality it could be sold for less than that (republished as a $15 single-disc).Blizzard is ripping you off.

Regardless of compatibility settings it will not launch."},{"rating":"2","title":"Diablo II LoD never gets old","review":"Diablo II, especially when taken together with the Lord of Destruction expansion, is a true, ageless piece of marvel. I've been playing with it ever since it first came out and simply can't get bored with it. The graphics, the music, the general atmosphere, the endless variety of monsters to be killed and treasure chests to be looted... this is one of those very rare computer games that can be played over and over and over again. If you haven't tried it yet, you are missing out big time, my friends. And if you have... well, then you know what I'm talking about. And all this coming from a girl who is not the greatest fan of computer games otherwise. Blizzard - bow wow.PS: Can't wait for Diablo III!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Diablo Battlechest (New version)","review":"My son and his boys enjoy this game so well that I have purchased two and they already had one. This gives each of them one and they play together."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ultimate (enjoyable) Time Waster","review":"I bought this game in preparation for an extended time away from home during which I'll need something to fill my time. The Acts are long, some of the enemies are very challenging as well. For being an older game, it's still legitimate for enjoyable game play today.I'm running Windows 7, and it plays perfectly. I've read reviews about people having trouble with resolution issues or auto-launch, but my screen is 1080p, and it self-adjusts to the appropriate resolution upon game launch.I'd recommend this game to all virgins, dorks, and people who are closet nerds like me. I would not recommend this game to new fathers who need every minute of sleep they can get. Sitting down and thinking \\"I'll just finish this mission\\" will leave one tired the next day, sometimes requiring a couple of hours of missing sleep to finish a short task.For the price, this is a no-brainer. I picked up the Battle Chest for a little over 20 bucks.Happy gaming!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Classic","review":"I have played this family of games for years, and they never get old. I like being able to interact with, as well as team up with other players to clear some of the more difficult quests/bosses. Very easy to play for the beginner, and still has some fun twists for the veteran. I recommend this for anyone who likes the fantasy/role playing genre. I can't wait for Diablo III to come out."},{"rating":"2","title":"Unbelievably addictive, infinite depth.","review":"I have so say, as a newborn Hardcore Diablo fan, that is may be the most justified purchase of my gaming lifespan. I have been glued to my computer since I opened this Blizzard masterpiece, and I foresee no end in sight to my addiction. The single player game, while entertaining, in no way compares to the wonder that is the Diablo multiplayer experience. Who doesn't love to get on-line with seven of your closest friends and put an end to the forces of evil. Building your adventuring party from level one, and taking down boss after boss using in depth strategy, or in some cases plain old melee carnage provides this gamer with a wonderful sense of accomplishment. I can say that if you love gaming, this may be the single greatest purchase you can ever make. One caveat, however. If you are married, be prepared for several severe tongue lashings. My wife has already forgotten my name."},{"rating":"2","title":"No Hellfire Expansion?","review":"I'm knocking off 1 star because Hellfire washn't included. Hellfire is a sought-after & pricey expansion to Diablo 1 that can end up costing more than this boxed set. While the graphics of these games are blase' compared to the Dungion Siege games that mimiced it & a lack of character designer, it has randomly generated dungeons so it may be quite some time before you crawl through one you've elready been through before. With each character's statistics so characteristically different & 3 games difficulty settings & so many different level designs, you'll be playing Diablo 1 for months. Seriously...I haven't even gotten to Diablo II yet. Play it for all it's worth. & snag Hellfire while you're at it. I also reccomend this game for female gamers like myself who prefur less-girly games."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stay Away!!","review":"Unless you enjoy crack cocaine and other highly addictive substances, this game is not for you! I don't know how Blizzard stumbled on the perfect randon-reward system to ensure a large section of the community would never get a tan again, but I wish I had back the 2 solid years of life they stole from me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Diablo 2 When I kill a monster I like it to stay dead.","review":"This review is for those who plan to play Diablo 2 off-line and not online. This game has some really serious design flaws. The first being the inability to save when you want. The second being every time you exit the game the monsters repopulate forcing you to replay that area over again and losing an hour of so of your time. Also the storyline wasnt that interesting mostly just hack and slash and I lost interest half way through the game which has never happened before."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not For Modern Systems","review":"Game was not playable on my system because of limitations in max game resolution. True, you can't expect higher resolution from older games; however, this compilation is being sold in 2009 and should at least include a notice on the outside of the box that the max resolution is 600x800. I tried to remedy the problem by running in windowed mode; however the action was then too small to see. Running in full screen, the 800x600 resolution looked absolutely terrible stretched over my 1680x1050 screen. A waste of money, unless you happen to have an older system."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great album in the tradition of Hank Williams ,Sr.","review":"\\"No Angel Knows\\" is such a good album filled with wonderful songwriting.

What struck me most when I first encountered this book, however, was the sense it conveyed of the man who did the research. This is a guy it would be a pleasure as well as an honor to know. Eisner reminds me a bit of Charles Darwin, another scientist whose humanity shines through in even his technical works. I suppose that men who spend a great deal of time experimenting with headless cockroaches or taxonomizing barnacles are nerds if anybody has ever been a nerd; but it turns out that their earnest, innocent curiosity and lack of self consciousness can also make them extremely admirable human beings."},{"rating":"2","title":"Greatest living entomologist?","review":"Eisner is one of the most creative behavioral and chemical ecology researchers in this century.

This novel also adds a behind the scenes look at the making of the movie.Much more compact and readable than some of the other Star Trek hardcover novels, Generations is worth the purchase price."},{"rating":"2","title":"Strong story, disappointing reading","review":"The story and movie are one of the strongest in the Star Trek series. There is a very powerful villain, dire consequences to his actions and Kirk, Checkov and Scotty appear in dramatic yet somewhat comical roles. We also see a vulnerable side of James Kirk, where he regrets the focus on his career to the detriment of his personal life. Kirk saves the Enterprise twice, costing him his life both times and in the second, he is teamed with Jean-Luc Picard in a fight to the death with a brilliant madman. For these reasons, the story is interesting.However, I found the dramatic reading by John De Lancie to be a bit disappointing. His work as the pixie like Q in the Next Generation series shows his capacity to be dramatic, and yet on the tape he sounds flat. There are points where a great deal more emphasis should have been placed on his words, and yet it just wasn&#65533;t there. Nevertheless, it is still a tape worth listening too, and I recommend it to everyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Traffic's \\"John Barleycorn\\" is super","review":"Traffic's \\"John Barleycorn\\" is a super album.

Glad is one of the best insturmental jams of the decade, I love how this song flows right into the other wordly masterpiece Freedom Rider. Things kick into maximum gear with the toe tapping Empty Pages, Winwoods signiture organ shredding on this track sounds better than ever. Stranger to Himself is short and nifty but nothing special. Things pick up again with the surreal horse opera that is John Barleycorn, Chris Wood's flute solo is hauntingly beautiful and is the best part of this track for me. The other songs on this album dont stand out to me as anything very memorable, however, the highlights on this album more than make up for them. If you are ever feeling down in the dumps than I highly recommend you put on the song Glad from this album, its infectious joy will really cheer you up."},{"rating":"2","title":"Empty Pages is a Treasure","review":"Staring at Empty Pages, need I go on? That song alone is worthgetting this CD. They just don't write Albums like they used to.John Barleycorn is an old alcoholic term, meaning if a bottleof whiskey was to take on a human form, it would become,evil \\"John Barleycorn\\".

But one star off for the bonus tracks, especially for the one stuck in the middle. I'm not a big fan of bonus tracks in general; they rarely add to the experience, but at least stick em at the end where they can be properly ignored. The liner notes for the re-issue give a clue to their cluelessness: \\"Along with Fairport Conventions Liege and Leif, John Barleycorn Must Die stands as a pivotal statement in late 60's/early 70's British folk rock music\\".

We are beginners, at best, and it's hard to know where to start to broaden your understanding. This book was VERY insightful. It is one thing to listen to the music and attempt to appreciate it, but to understand the perspective of the composer and the purpose of major pieces puts everything in a new light. I am really pleased with this purchase."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just enough to make some important points","review":"I have used this book with my women's group at Church to encourage them to listen to classical music and to appreciate the varied but strong relationships that these brilliant men have had with the God who gave them their incredible genius. While this book may not satisfy a purist or an academic, it is just right to introduce classical music to a spiritually-minded and intelligent (but not musically sophisticated) group. I love it and highly recommend it to those who appreciate spiritual confirmation, Christian or otherwise."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Religious Right cleans up the lives of great composers.","review":"The central idea that this book presented was initially very fascinating to me, but upon reading it, I realized that what the author does here is to omit obvious, well-known facts about the lives of many of the composers in order to present a very clean-living group who supposedly were very religious. For example, Richard Wagner's repeated adulterous relationships are not even mentioned; Franz Schubert was a homosexual who died of syphilis, but in this book there is no mention of his sexuality, and he is said to have died of \\"typhus.\\" Truth is the victim of the biased viewpoints presented in this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Spiritual?","review":"As one reads this book he must be alert to know the truth. Mr. Kavanaugh writes from a very broad and quasi-Christian viewpoint. His conclusion is that the majority, if not all the composers he writes about are Christian. He assumes all music written by these composers to be without flaw. As near as I can tell he believes that music is amoral. That is, he believes that music can not be right or wrong. This idea is at odds with the supposed Christianity of these composers. Oh, I'm sure many of them were believers. I can tell you though that not all are. And so you see my dilema. I love classical music and reading about the composers. However, I don't enjoy having to sift through a bunch of rubbish posing as spirituality."},{"rating":"2","title":"M-M-Mouthwatering Stuff!","review":"This sauce will change the way you think about BBQ sauce!

The Rich & Mild is a fantastic sauce with a great blend of spices, dark molasses and honey. If you like a little heat (in the words of a famous TV chef \\"Kick it up a notch\\"), the Hot & Spicy is your sauce. The Chipotle peppers are roasted, so they are not too hot - juuuust enough to add a little heat to the mix. The Teriyaki is a great marinade for quick meals. Just marinade for a 1/2 hour to 1 hour and place on your local BBQ. I heat a few ounces and pour it over the meat when before I serve it.

A cute little doll of a girl dies and no one, Steele tells us ad nauseum, \\"can bare it.\\" I couldn't, anyway.This children's story was tedious, clichéd and trite in the extreme, thus earning its five star rating by Steele's readers. When Steele tells her fans to be moved by a story, they are.I was not."},{"rating":"2","title":"A typically wonderful story told only as Ms. Steel could!","review":"This is another one of her books that you can't put down until you finish it.

My mother pressured me into reading any book by Danielle Steel, and I chose this one because it was blessedly short.

I suggest you read the first one to get a full flavor of the chief characters. This one adds some minor characters and continues on with more short stories.I wanted a book that was an easy and fast read but did not require a lot of philosophy or social comment. This book met the bill and more so. I found the heroine charming and believable though some reviews do not.I love the way the author manages to comment on African (at least in this part of the country) points of view on morals and the variety of social behavior amongst the different tribes and the views of white man. He rarely condemns but justifies the heroine's point of view with humor.I am now reading the 3rd book and plan to read more of the series."},{"rating":"2","title":"Diamonds are a girl's best friend","review":"I dunno know why I never wrote a review about this book. I enjoyed listening to it on cd last summer.The main character Mma Ramatswe is a middle aged lady detective of traditional build who is aiding an American woman whose son disapeared years ago and was never found.Mma Ramatswe sympathises,she lost a child too and it still bothers her sometimes. The mystery is a bit of sleeper, but that is fine. Because their are all these little subplots happening,( along with a romance going on) along with musings from all the differant characters about what Botswana used to be like versus what the country is like now.( It reminds me of what America was like forty years ago) How woman in Botswana are having a little woman's movement of their our own and trying for their voices to be heard. I also like that Alexander Mccall does this weird thing called humour taps. He taps you on the shoulder with little zingers of humour and then leaves."},{"rating":"2","title":"Continuing the fun...","review":"Another superb book in the No. 1 Ladies Detective Agency series; fantastic characters, vivid scenes, and fascinating stories.

I was always impressed by how nice the Botswanans were. Have traveled a lot and there is professional courtesy and there are genuinely nice people. All the ones I met were really sweethearted, kind people. Was very happy that these books reflected that culture. And a pretty decent detective story too."},{"rating":"1","title":"Interesting Story, But Not a Mystery","review":"The book was pretty interesting and well-written, with great descriptions of Africa and its culture. The tone is refreshing, and there are several poignant moments. Unfortunately, I don't think Mma Ramotswe is \\"The Miss Marple of Botswana\\" because the story does not have suspense, and the problem at hand is not a real mystery.First of all, mystery books have danger. Perhaps Miss Marple never finds herself in a life or death situation, but at least her murders are usually fresh and not ten years old. As Mma Ramotswe herself admits, the case is \\"stale.\\" I haven't read the other books in the series, so maybe those are more exciting.Also, I would expect a mystery to have clues. My favorite part of Agatha Christie mysteries is looking over the clues and trying to guess whodunit. In this book, they simply look up some old records and rely on \\"intuition.\\" Oooh, how clever!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Tears of the Giraffe","review":"This book is a coin toss. On one side of the coin, you end up with a true feel of Africa, the pace of the people, their thinking process. On the flip side of the coin, it is NOT a fast-paced mystery. It is predominately about the people and VERY, very slow-paced. Too many words. The 'mystery' is thickly buried within .. you have to dig and dig and dig to discover the what the mystery is ... much less the 'solving' of the mystery. Likeable people."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as good as the first very boring","review":"After reading the first book which I loved I could not wait to read the second in the series and I was very disapointed. I found it did not have ebought mystery as the first one did. It focus's more on the main characters life I liked that in the first book but now it's just boring.I want more of her detective work. When they do have her detective work it's good and it's a page turner. Overall not as good as the first but I want to read the whole series to see what happends int he future."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cute, comfortable, enjoyable read","review":"This is the kind of book one reads on an airplane. It's about 240 pages and there's nothing taxing about the plot. There's nothing sad to bring you down. Perhaps there's a joyful reunion to lift your spirits.At the same time one is taught the subtle or profound differences between Botswana and the USA, as well as countries closer to Botswana.Ms. Ramotswe is thoughtful, smart, full of common sense, and an unforgetable character of modern-day fiction. Apart from other detectives who are always unerringly never outsmarted, she is sometimes fooled by an adversary or the subject of her investigations...a purely common happenstance in real life, and she is all the more likeable for it.This is my second read of this series and I will probably read them all as long as the situation is right: a lazy summer afternoon on the porch swing, the aforementioned plane ride, or perhaps during an ill day from work."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tears of the Giraffe","review":"This series of books is so delightful to read.

Smith manages to convey the simplicity and complexity of Africa in this delightful novel. And for those readers who are interested to read more about this fascinating continent, once they have finished all these Botswana novels, I recommend A TELLING TIME, by Glynnis Hayward, which tells a gripping tale set in South Africa that will have them turning the pages."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tears of the Giraffe","review":"A real yawner! It didn't help that the characters names were too difficult to remember."},{"rating":"2","title":"A fantastic story","review":"A fast flowing story set, Tears of the Giraffe is one of the best books I have read. With good values expressed through characters that are lively, this book showed a beautiful side of Africa, where commitment is held sacred, where love is deep and hospitality is the norm. Fast paced and hilarious, this book hooked me all the more to the No.1 Ladies' Detective Agency. The plot reminds of Flash of the Sun. It is breat-taking."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very entertaining","review":"This is an outstanding book for listening. The reader is extraordinarily skilled, and this book includes a number of twists and turns in the story and some pretty interesting confrontational events too. There is some moralizing, and some thoughts on Africa which one might not wish to spend time reading, but for listening, it's ideal.Readers/listeners should start with the first book in the series."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing!","review":"Ahh, I found this band a while back through iTunes and its recommended bands, and that was where I heard their first single \\"Sweet Talk.\\" It was catchy so I got the rest of the album, and it's seriously one of my most favorite CDs ever. All the songs are really melodic. My favorites are \\"Paper Bag,\\" \\"Grace,\\" \\"Sweet Talk,\\" and \\"Midwestern Dirt.\\" One of the things that I really loved the most was the fact that the songs were so sing-able. Many of the choruses don't repeat themselves too, and I found myself constantly trying to sing them out with as much emotion as the lead singer does. One of the best bands ever! Can't wait 'till they finish the new CD! :D"},{"rating":"2","title":"An impressive debut album!","review":"This surprisingly good first effort from this band completely amazed me.

Unfortunately the film did nothing to educate, even falsely protraying park rangers as accomplices. It mentions in passing that Park rules are that there is to be no feeding of bears, but then shows that everyone does it. It shows that getting attacked by a bear is just a matter of being knocked over. I shows that a problem bear is one who is fed, then wants more - from a human that was the problem. Good interpretive skills used inappropriately."},{"rating":"2","title":"Talking Words Helps Them Read","review":"Leap Frog - Talking Words FactoryThis is a great video.

(The same senario with the Talking Words Factory DVD)The video itself was good. Very educational and quite interesting. Your child will learn each alphabet and its sound along with Leap, the little brother. For each letter, the sound of the letter is demonstrated with something funny & easy to remember. (Example: \\"A\\", a monster appears and the A's say \\"Ah\\") Of course, there is a catching tune enforces the letter & the sound. There is a little summary after every 4 letters and the video ends with a finale with all the alphabets.My 22months daughter likes the video and would like to watch it over & over.(Too bad it doesn't come with repeat play) She is trying to imitate the sounds of the letters now. I can see the video is doing some good."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent","review":"This DVD is awesome!!!! We got this for our daughter when she was 3 yrs. old. She loved it immediately.

Here, we have two very awesome character - who, despite what some cynics say, people cared about; Newt, and Hicks...and look what they do with them.

It's a BIG let down."},{"rating":"1","title":"If you liked \\"Alien\\" or \\"Aliens\\" - DON'T WATCH THIS","review":"The first two movies in this series, altough different in genre (horror and action) were very well done and and fit together perfectly. The first movie moved smoothly into the next and made for an increadible journey. The third movie destroys all of the work of the first two. It seems that the producers/director did not like having a happy ending for \\"Aliens\\". They killed off characters that you rooted for the entire film (\\"Aliens\\") without reason. They end up with a script that is just an ordinary slasher film. Creature chases good girl around huge building for 1 1/2 hours. The creativity and zest of the first two was lost. Do yourself a favor and skip to \\"Ressurection\\"!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Should never had been made.","review":"This film was completely unnecessary, Alien was a Masterpiece and Aliens was a brilliant sequel. There was no need to continue after Aliens unless they had come up with something really incredible. The film is a complete downer filled with forgettable characters that you dont care about and simply put, it's just boring.All the glory and victory from Aliens is wiped out in the first ten minutes and killing off Ripley is one of the worst decisions in cinematic history.It's weird, it takes place on a maximun security prison planet yet all the inmates speak with an upper class British accent. Even the monster is lame. Mostly it's just a CGI interpretation instead of an actual costume effect and it's poorly executed as well. Sigorney Weaver looks bored througout the film and it's pace is so slow that you just want the film to end.This is a movie that truly should have never been made."},{"rating":"2","title":"All the scenes, Please!","review":"Release a special edition ALIEN 3 with the deleted scenes included.

The premise of it is not rational given the end of Aliens. So it starts with a ludicrous plot premise, and it just goes downhill from there. I love Sigourny Weaver, but this is the worst movie she's ever made.When we do our \\"Alien\\" film festival, we leave the piece of excrement out of the mix. I can't think of a single positive thing about this film."},{"rating":"2","title":"Don't Hate, Congratulate!","review":"I don't know why people have so much disdain for this film. It was brilliantly directed, and acted as well. Sigourney Weaver was amazing, as usual. It was different from the others, and that's fine. That's why it's NOT THE SAME MOVIE as Alien, Aliens, or Alien Resurrection. It stands firmly on its own.

Perhaps it could have been, but too much was left on the editing room floor and the result was a disappointing mess. I'll buy the first two DVD's, but as far as I'm concerned there is no Alien trilogy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Puke!","review":"This is one of those movies that just should NOT have been made, and everyone associated with it should feel ashamed. The first, and most glaringly obvious problem is the script. How this script got past anyone remotely familiar with ALIENS is beyond me. For starters, there are eggs on the ship. How did they get there? Impossible. Second, half the survivors die within the first five minutes. Is that supposed to be \\"artistic\\"? I used to give this movie 1 star, but now I bumped it up to 2, because as lame as it is, it is still better than Alien Resurrection, which has no style to it. Alien3 at least has that, which is due to Fincher directing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Review the movie?","review":"Alien 3 is the last movie to stay true to the original. The rest are a bit too cartoonish for my tastes."},{"rating":"1","title":"It does get better with time...","review":"The first time I saw this movie I wondered how they could mess something up so badly. The second time I found some parts had improved (but not by much).First, the alien was a mixture of cool, sleek, killing-machine but also looked somewhat fake on the small screen of the TV. The heavy use of computer graphics allowed them to do a tad more with the creature than you could do with a person in a suit.Still, the story takes away, I think, from the Alien myth. It made the drone a tad too smart and the beginning of the movie was a tad confusing. I still don't know how the young queen got in there without killing Ripley. Too many questions and no real answers. Mystery is good, but total chaos is not."},{"rating":"1","title":"Alien 3","review":"This is the worst of the four. If they hadn't killed off the three wonderful characters introduced in Aliens it might have been an ok movie. But no, they make their ship crash on this planet of \\"celebate\\" prisoners and make Ripley the only survivor. And then, we get to watch as they slice open Newt's chest to see if there's a chestburster inside. And the rest isn't even worth talking about. I was really disappointed with this movie and you will be too. Rent it(if you must)first before you buy it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Should have stopped with Aliens","review":"One of the worst ways to ruin a sequal, in my opinion, is to kill off the survivors of the previous in the very begging. (What's the point in having them survive, then?) Not only does it hurt the sequal, but deminishes the previous as well.Then there is the whoel problem of how the eggs got there in the first place.If you want a good sequal to \\"Aliens\\", find the Dark Horse comics versions. They are \\"Aliens: Book 1\\", \\"Aliens: Book2\\", and \\"Aliens: Earthwar\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good movie with a single flaw.","review":"I like this movie for the most part. In fact the only thing I didn't like about it were a few of the special effects shots where the alien looked really out of place. Which ended up breaking the all important 'suspesion of disbelief'. Too bad because the rest of the film is great. Directed by David Fincher (Fight Club, Seven, etc.) Great sets, and action. Moody lighting and music. Overall a great movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible! The Worst (-5 stars out of 10)","review":"Not only the worst in the series, but has to be one of the worst movies I've ever seen! It ruins it for wanting to see Ressurection. Now I've seen alot of bad movies, but this was horrible. I was expecting it to be good since Alien and Aliens were equally great, but I've never seen one like this. From the beginning, everything Ripley did in Aliens, saving Hicks and the girl was a waste. But it just gets worse. ***DO NOT LET KIDS VIEW THIS!*** It literally says the F word 40xs! It's in every single sentence.... Definatly rated R for a reason. Don't even waste $3 on it. Just skip this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sigi's the nuts","review":"great entertainment, and as usual Sigi is up to it.

Keep it up Sigi - your my favourite."},{"rating":"1","title":"A deeply flawed movie that almost destroyed the franchise","review":"That this movie was directed by David Fincher continues to amaze me, since it is superficial, predictable, and simply bad. Killing off 2 of the main characters from Aliens before the opening credits is unforgiveable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst of the Four","review":"This movie has a lot of flaws in it, first of all killing off everyone that survived the previous movie shows a lack of imagination not to mention that it spoils the ending of ALIENS. I thought that the way the designed the alien itself was inventive, I like the way it took on the characteristics of the dog and how it could run on walls. The whole story about the bald-headed prisoners who were suposed to be some kind of munks was wierd and confusing. The movie drags until you get to the last half-hour and even then its mostly everyone just running around."},{"rating":"1","title":"Amazon needs to allow a 'ZERO star' rating","review":"Giving this movie 1 star is giving it more than it deserves. This movie is TERRIBLE. It has no story, unlikable characters, cheap sets and kills off two great characters saved in ALIENS. David Fincher has gone on to direct some quality movies (Seven, The Game) but I am sure he would rather forget this bomb.

This movie was rushed and it bombed!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Biggest disappointment of my life!","review":"After the tense thriller of Alien and the stroke-inducing terror of Aliens, Number Three totally bummed me out! It was like following up the world's two scariest rollercoasters with a ride on the ghost train featuring an old guy in a sheet yelling, \\"Boo.\\" I didn't care about any of the characters, least of all Ripley, the dingy sets didn't make me scared, it just made me want to wash, and although the final set-piece was impressive, I was thorougly bored throughout. Resurrection restored my faith in the franchise a little, but I just couldn't get the bad taste outta my mouth."},{"rating":"1","title":"One of the biggest letdowns in history of sequels.","review":"Rarely is the sequel better than the original, so expectations were high after Aliens proved this assertion dead wrong. Alien 3, without Cameron at the helm, was a dismal and disjointed attempt at sucking the blood out of the franchise. With Sigourney Weaver objecting to being filmed with guns around her, script writers changing at a moment's notice, and budgets slashed, this was a disaster waiting to happen. And it did. Pointless elimination of Newt and Hicks, characters that made Aliens the great movie that it was, drove away the fan base. Sigourney Weaver's primadonna demands that there be no guns combined with ever changing cast of screenwriters ended up in a heap of celluloid not worth wasting one's 2 hours of life on."},{"rating":"2","title":"Complete Collection","review":"Pretty much what I expected.

Good acting Poor plot....."},{"rating":"2","title":"Alien 3 Special Edition- Best of the Saga!!!!!!!!","review":"The first Alien Movie I saw was Alien 3! I thought it was very creative because it was more then a stupid slasher movie! It was more of a sad tale where the company was this evil monster and the beast was just an animal doing its thing. This movie is what got me into the Alien Saga. I totally agree with the fact that huge comanies is only one big part of a dangerous spiecies that we are and I do believe that there are animals out there who are hostile but not evil! I also believe that in the future wars will get even worse and we will try to use our technology to find creatures which we can use as weapons! I think it is very wrong indeed to do that but it is something that might happen! Also great music score by Elliot Goldenthal. YOU ROCK AND THIS FILM ROCKS TOO!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"When good works fail, blame the director!","review":"The director said he made this film for his friends. There are plenty struggling directors out there with greater abilities that could have been used. This is a commercial project and not a vehicle for showing-off to friends.When the warden says there are no aliens on his prison and gets immediately snatched up from above, it's so artificial that the whole scene becomes a waste of opportunities. An amatuer filmmaker knows you have to give the actors reaction time! Maybie Fincher is an amatuer in a job he can't handle.I didn't think his other movie Seven was very good.

I know it is not an issue with the seller, I have nothing against them in fact the were great in handling the issue it is a problem with the mass produced copies in my opinion."},{"rating":"2","title":"Makes the series worth it.","review":"Now this is an example of what the Alien series is capable of. Dark, atmospheric, intriguing, and boasting better performances than any of the other Alien movies, Alien 3 shows what an Alien movie should be. The first film was notable for the creature and little else. Aliens was plagued by over-commercialization and a weak final half-hour. Alien 3, on the other hand, focuses not on continuing the series, but rather on being an intelligent movie in its own right. The film more than overcomes its few dialogue faults and has quite possibly one of the greatest endings thus far committed to celuloid."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointing","review":"While this movie may be a decent film in itself, it cannot even be compared to the others in the series. I am an extreme Aliens fan and I was very disappointed by this movie. The creature in this one is supposed to move and act differently (since this time it is born from an animal and thus has animal like qualities) but the computer generated parts are totally obvious and unrealistic. It also does not adhere to the story: aliens do not have eyes, so then why are there scenes shot as if seen through the eyes of the creature? I don't hate this because it lacks guns and marines and stuff like that, i hate it because it was carelessly thrown together. i think someone who had a truer passion for the story of the Alien should have been in charge of this one. But by contrast, the series is SAVED (yes, SAVED) by the 4th movie. Anyone who says the 4th one sucked is obviously not a true Aliens fan. sorry"},{"rating":"2","title":"I feel bad for David Fincher","review":"This was David Fincher's first movie, and it's never listed in his fimographies on DVD special features, because he disowned it and walked out on post production. It's sad. That's the first event where Fox started to become the controlling greedy machine that it is now. They do make the best movies, don't get me wrong, but the way they pushed David Fincher around was wrong. He never had the whole script on the set at one time and a butchered version of the movie was released in theatres in 1992, but now the original vision is available for the first time. It's the complete version of Alien 3 that was ment to be. It's too bad about the audio for alot of the deleted scenes though. The voices are all washed out. I'm sorry, David Fincher, maybe some day you'll let someone interview you about the movie, because us fans would really like to here it from the director instead of anyone but."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shame !!!","review":"Okay, look. My brother and I have a personal grudge against this disapointment. First off, how in the heck did an alien get on board the SULACO ?Sigourney Weaver (aka Baldy in this one) didn't care to even preserve the characters who survived, so killing Hicks and Newt- poor Newt, so she can cash in on her pay.And the effects were not good. I could tell the alien effects were not generated well. Again, shame !!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Alien 3 is a bad try at a remake of alien.","review":"Sigourney Weaver once again reprises her role as Ripley this time a fire threatning the Sulaco her pod lands on a penal colony.When she land she finds that she the only survivor of this crasy and the planets inhabitants are every single know vermon in the face of the universe.But an Alien has been abord her ship the hole time this alien being more faster and keener then any before Ripley is once again chosen to her fate of fighting the creature once again.A lack luster script often dark but at times fallen short to a mediocre script with not much to go on however sigorney weaver is good in anything no matter weither it's bad or good the Dvd is not very imressive but picture quality is good and sound is even better but your best bet is to get Alien or Aliens."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh My God....","review":"What was the director of this movie thinking! There is only one word that i can describe this movie with. CRAP Plain and simple this movie sucks. Most of the great charactors from Aliens are killed of in the first 30 seconds of the movie. Ok well some people might be able to handle that. Then the film is bogged down by bad effects, stupid charactors, and dialog that wanted to make me puke. If that wern't bad enough the same face hugger manages to implant Ripley and a dog before dying off. I thought the face huggers only layed one egg before dying. Hmmmmmm... If you want to see some really great sci-fi movies rent Alien and Aliens. Even Alien Ressurection is better than this sloppy excuse for a movie. AVOID AT ALL COSTS!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Alien3 is my second favorite Alien movie but it is great","review":"Alien3 has a very cleverly designed plot, which is one of the reasons why I like it. It has a very interesting cast and ends the trilogy (the first three movies) perfectly. If you have seen the first 2 movies, then don't hesitate to see it. All of the characters are endearable (including the alien). I can't tell who ever reads this the plot, only because it would give it all away. The thing I like about the trilogy is that each movie picks up where the predecessor left off. I haven't seen the DVD version, but either format, it is a kick-a** movie, and I seriously reccomend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"beating a dead calf","review":"Directed by David Fincher, \\"Alien 3\\" is . . . well, let's face it . . . pitiful. Not even thrilling, it can't even compare to the pair of semi-classics which followed before it. The story is weak, the acting bland, the special effects so-average-it's-not-funny, and the entire idea is just dumb. After two great predecessors, what do you expect? Okay, maybe sequels are good, but after that? You have nothing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very underrated movie.","review":"The first time I saw this flick in the cinema I was furious with the errors they made in the script. There was never any explanation how one facehugger could impregnate Ripley as well as the dog on Fury 161, there was no explanation as to why this alien is different from all other aliens. How could Ripley ever get impregnated if her cryotube is still intact. But when viewing it again and again and again, I realised that if you look through these errors, you end up with a pretty decent horror movie.The good thing about this movie is the way Ripley changes again into a new being without hope, but with a lot of acceptance of her new role in the universe.I however feel this movie could have been done a lot better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Grate chances, Horrible resault.","review":"This movie is the second worst in the series, the ending of alien 2 offered so many grate chances to make a good alien 3 sequal. But David Fincher had to make it a boaring, depressing movie like he allways does with all his films.I do think alien resurrection is worse becouse the guys who made that movie had no idea what the alien \\"Spirit\\" was about and made a movie that looked nothing like an alien movie too me. I think fincher did a little better then that, but not much better."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best of the series!","review":"Alien was too boring, Aliens was too long, and Alien Ressurection was too complicated! Alien3 was the best one. It had suspense, good acting, good visual effects, good music, good storyline, a good ending, and a really cool new alien that was faster and more agressive than the others. My favorite part was the ending, and another good part was when the alien burst out of the hot lead- that really surprised me! This is one of my favorite movies and I can't understand why so many people hated it! And in case you wondered, the picture on the case is the queen embryo that is inside Ripley."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible.","review":"Horrible is the word I would use to summarize this film in one word. This is one of the worst movies that I have ever seen. The only reason anyone would see this movie is to keep up with the series. However, you are not missing anything by not watching it. The film is way too dark and, not to mention, it is not entertaining at all. Director David Fincher's style does not fit the Alien series at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just... No","review":"*WARNING: THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS*This is one of the most unnecessary sequels I've ever seen... To start, it was a TERRIBLE move to kill off Hicks, Newt, and Bishop. TERRIBLE. The story is only somewhat decent, I honestly kinda found it interesting that Ripley was impregnated with a queen alien, but at the same time I knew that it would have to lead to her death, WHICH I DID NOT WANT. Guess what? She died, obviously. So yes, killing of the entire cast of survivors from Aliens was an absolutely TERRIBLE move. AND, why did they feel the need to shave Ripley's head...? The suspense just didn't seem to be retained from previous Alien movies, either. This movie... Just no. No. -Trent Foreman, Author of Nightmare"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not very good","review":"I agree that they shouldve stopped at two if they were going to just kill off everyone. They went through this incredible odyssey in Alien and Aliens, especially in the latter where Ripley does everything to save Newt and what happens? She dies right away shortly after going to sleep on the way home. Nice. That ruined it for me right there. The rest of the movie, although it does have some nice alien moments, is actually poorly acted and boring. And how is it that Ripley had such a long gestation period? Didnt Kane in the first one have a relatively short one and it happened shortly after he became conscious? This movie almost made me not like Alien and Aliens it was such a disrespectful movie. There are tons of ideas for an alien movie. This one was the wrong one in just about every way."},{"rating":"1","title":"Should've stopped at Aliens","review":"This is the perfect case of film companies wanting to squeeze out a little more money in a series no matter how bad the movie turns out. Alien 1 & 2 were great films, even watching them now years later I'm still on the edge of my seat.I bought the big Alien DVD set and sat down to watch 3 last night for the first time, and I couldn't even finish it, it was just bad, terrible, stupid. The Alien name aside, this was a poorly done movie from all angles. Nothing made sense, it was goofy, acting was terrible (except for Sigourney and the doctor), and it wasn't the least bit scary."},{"rating":"1","title":"What for?","review":"Why was alien 3 made?Who had the guts to say to 20th century fox,Hey lets make alien 3?A movie by all means never ever should have been made?Who?Why?I mean alien 3 is long, boring, and without imagination. Really puts down Alien and Aliens,two movies I love.But when you stand it up to Alien resurection,it is good.Allthough alien 3 is 2 hours and 15 minutes of my life i will NEVER get back its worth a watch for fans of the alien movies."},{"rating":"1","title":"Depressing","review":"If this were a movie on its own, not meant to be a sequel, it might be ok. It had a very frightening atmosphere. I think I was expecting more when I watched this movie recently, but it left me feeling horribly depressed. I suppose the storyline couldn't allow Hicks and Newt to survive but I think it was unnecessary to show the bodies of the characters I grew attached to in the last film.Ok, besides my own unhappy feelings towards the movie, it was quite unrealistic. If you follow the story of the first two Alien movies in the series, there's no way there could have been an alien on their ship. I completely disregard this movie and I don't think I should have wasted my time watching it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Su**ks!","review":"This movie is horrible, cant you people see that! It has a bad story, and the only thing that makes this movie qualify as a movie in the excellent Alien series are the special effects. They far surpass Alien and Aliens. And since Alien Ressurection was made in '98 it doesnt count. By the way just to let you know, Aliens vs Predator, THE MOVIE, is in production right now, for you AvP fans."},{"rating":"1","title":"What were they thinking?","review":"Exactly. What WERE they thinking? Perhaps they wanted to go back to the genre's original calling - A horror movie. Fine. Then make the film suspenseful. They didn't.Then make the characters sympathetic. They didn't.Then make the premise interesting. They didn't.Instead of spending time making scenes look cool, perhaps they should've spent time making scenes that WERE cool. They didn't.Unfortunately, the suits in Hollywood made a sequel to this film. Did they learn their lesson with Alien 3? Unfortunately, they didn't."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worthy of scorn","review":"The other reviewers here are right. Alien 3 was just beyond the abilities of the crew. The writing was poor. The CGI laughable. Alas, if I were the director, I would merely cut all the scenes with CGI and immediately get a better movie. The first two (Alien and Aliens) are great in Blu-Ray; just skip this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Skip it.","review":"Aliens was the perfect conclusion, but this ruins it. Bad effects, plot, and etc make a bad film. It only deserves one star for Sigourney Weaver and thats it.P.S. Stay away from the fourth at all costs unless you are either a diehard fan of this series, Sigourney Weaver, or C.G.I. exploitation."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than the second","review":"Like Alien, and unlike Aliens, Alien 3 returns to the format of an isolated area, improvised weapons, duplicitous/idiotic authority figures, and only a single alien.It's great for the most. Unfortunately, a lot of the CGI is still primitive, and they clearly wanted to have a more visible monster in the end sequence. However, up to that, the plot is excellent, the prison-planet scenario was imaginative, and Sigourney Weaver was great.I'm still a fan of the first one over all the others, however. But really, for a money-making franchise, it just doesn't get any better than Alien."},{"rating":"1","title":"If only it had been more of the same...","review":"The first two entries in the Alien world were beautifully crafted, cohesive, actually believable stories, and I have only good things to say about them. Three was an awful disappointment, but based on the absurd premises, uncommitted direction and writing, and general ham-handling of it, the result was perhaps the best we could hope for. It's a lot of gray, yellow and black motion brought to you by a director who should have known better than to tell a two-hour story with Nike-ad blur-and-flash action shots."},{"rating":"1","title":"All style, No substance","review":"This is easily the worst Alien film, which is remarkable considering how awful the fourth film was.Alien 3 is often muddled, dark and incomprehensible with an annoying music video/video game quality to the filmmaking that makes it difficult to sit through.While the first two Alien films are classics and worth being in any film buffs collection, the last two are truly awful and should be ignored as cheap, unworthy successors.At least the fourth film had some of an amatuerish \\"so bad, it's funny\\" quality to it. This film is just an awful, depressing mess. Avoid it like the plague."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst of the series.","review":"The main bad thing in the movie itself is definately the swearing.The story is so bad because it kills off everything James Cameron did in Aliens.They kill Hicks and the little girl and Bishop ends up in dump.Another thing is how cheesy some of the dialog is.Also how in the heck did an alien survive from the second film?The queen could'nt have layed eggs because her tail was shot off and that is where the eggs are produced so this movie doesn't make to much sense.A sad addition to the great sci-fi series."},{"rating":"1","title":"It had potential. . .but. . .","review":"Probably the most frustrating thing about this movie was the fact that it had so much potential. It had such a terrific setup from the previous film. There were so many great paths they could have taken the story at the conclusiion of \\"Aliens\\" that it is hard to figure out where they took such a bad turn with Alien 3. There are very few characters that one can sympathize with since it takes place on a prison planet filled with rapists and murderers. Sigourney Weaver tries to work with a particularly lackluster script and story. If it weren't for her sincerity and history with the creatures, the movie would have been a complete disaster. The end of the film is also disappointing, giving us a particularly depressing conclusion to the trilogy. Several years later, I was excited to see \\"Alien: Resurrection,\\" but it was even more disappointing than this was. If you want the true \\"Alien\\" experience, you can't go wrong with the first two films."},{"rating":"1","title":"Burned at the stake","review":"With the success of Aliens,it was inevitable that another Alien movie would come.

The mood and atmosphere are so dark,tense and decidedly \\"cyberpunk\\"that they practically upstage the actors (who are mostly unknowns and perfectly cast). The art direction is incredible and this is one of the few \\"sci-fi\\" films I've seen that actualy manages to portray a believable future.The fact that there are no weapons only serves to heighten the drama. Being a fan of \\"city of lost children\\", I expected the fourth and most recent installment to be on par with if not exceed Fincher's. Instead,it simply revisited all the settings and technology we'd become familiar with in the previous films. Alien 3 is a real departure and deserves much applause. The ending is a real shocker as well, and is exactly what i didn't expect from Hollywood...of course, they found a way to keep the franchise alive..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing.","review":"ALIEN was great. ALIENS was an all time masterpiece. And ALIEN3 is...well, not as bad as everyone says. On the good side, we have a great opening sequence, some great effects (a few dodgy ones though), a very good musical score and some very good performances. On the bad side, there's...well, it's inexplicable. Something about this movie just fails to live up to the other two. There's too much gore and too much talk (like ALIEN in that respect), and simply not enough action! Blood-and-guts fans will have little to complain about, and it does have some of the suspense that made ALIEN so popular. But on the whole, ALIEN3 is one of the weakest Alien films - unless you count the latest nail in the Alien coffin, ALIEN RESURRECTION..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Alien 3--Bad movie, OK DVD","review":"Now, after viewing the DVD powerhouses, Alien and Aliens, I felt let down that Fox returned to thier basic DVD foundation. Only one trailer and a \\"Making of\\" feature. Boring :( This film is not that great to begin with, so Fox, try to add some cool features to make it cool.

Different movies in almost every way, but equally superior film making. Alien 3 and Alien Resurrection are sorry excuses for sequels. They're classic examples of Hollywood greed. Bad stories wrapped in excellent SFX don't make memorable movies. Alien and Aliens should be at or near the top of your \\"Must Have\\" sci-fi/horror/action DVD list.

But the 2003 special edition fills in all the gaps. It is now one of the best Alien films. I couldn't believe how much better this movie was after over 30 minutes were added to it. The movie even gives a whole new plot line between Ripley and Clemens. Even the alien story line is different and better where now the alien is shown coming out of an ox rather than the dog. All I can say is this movie is great and all those who didn't like it before should give the special edition a spin. It is garanteed to restore your faith."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dreck","review":"This obvious attempt to kill the \`franchise' should have been in 3D. Why did they kill off Hicks, anyway? Perhaps the filmmakers were they afraid someone interesting would be placed in the movie. This movie has no plot.

But this Special Edition, which provides us with the much needed footage that was forcibly cut from the film, is both enlightening and entertaining.Alien3 differs from its classic predecessors because it does not focus on the monster, but instead concentrates on the human journey. Like the prior two films, with the restored footage it is indeed a visual feast.I don't want to spoil the details for you, and prior reviewers here have already done an excellent job, so I'll just conclude by saying that Director Fincher has been vindicated with the release of this Special Edition. Alien3 is one of those rare films that actually becomes more appreciated as time marches on.Go ahead, and give this film a second chance by viewing this Special Edition - it's well worth your time and effort."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worked","review":"This item crossed referenced as a replacement however, manufacturing changed it enough to make it where it won't mount without modification.Shipping was quick."},{"rating":"2","title":"BLOWER FOR WOOD STOVE","review":"Great just as described and fast delivery.I would recommend them to anyone lookingfor a blower."},{"rating":"2","title":"good","review":"A good book that explains all that a patient needs to know about sexual impotence and nothing more.

How can a man concentrate on a team of kidnappers that are picking up high standing people for a possible sell into slavery when the mother of his son wants to drag him into a custody dispute? Not to worry, Patterson takes this tale to new levels with fast paced action as he moves Cross through the entire scenario without getting bogged down in the small stuff.However, the mysterious Wolf is just a little too farfetched to carry on with. Former KGB men now need to turn to mobsters in an attempt to make a living. For me there were some loose ends on this angle that needed addressing.

This book is not even close to being complete.The story also has significant flaws. The Wolf demonstrates he has the ability to get to any perceived threat. However, he allows Alex Cross free reign.The story was also very choppy.Patterson continues to stick to the same boiler plate when writing these novels.Alex Cross neglects his family; someone in the FBI is a turncoat; his family is in mortal danger; higher authorities undermine Cross's attempt to resolve issues.With that being said, I now have to wait for the next installment of this novel. I would not read this book until the next one is completed. Waiting 6 months to 1 year for the remainder of the story is a real turn-off."},{"rating":"1","title":"Love Alex and it's a good read, BUT...","review":"I think Patterson must be getting a wee bit greedy. This book was left totally unresolved on two major fronts. You're not getting me to buy another one, Mr. Patterson - your next book, I'll be checking out from the library! Other than a complete lack of resolution, it was a good, very fast read, but SO not worth almost $30! I'm force fed reality tv if I want to watch network tv (which I don't, since it's mostly moron tv, if you ask me); I will not stand for it in a book in which I want to escape. I realize many things in \\"real life\\" are not neatly wrapped up, like they USUALLY are in books, but this was ridiculous. It's like Patterson NEEDS us to buy the next book to find out what happens next. Thank goodness for JK Rowling, who I'm going back to next!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The big bad rip-off","review":"Told that this would be the best Alex Cross book, I eagerly plunked down the required money and began to read. At page 164 I felt like I'd been ripped off. James Patterson, I believe, has lost it. He doesn't know who he wants his audience to be. This book might appeal to teenage girls or older women. This is less a thriller than a story about Alex Cross and his troubles as a single father. Boring! This is a slow paced story that finally picks up speed just as the FBI is ready to close-in and close the case. James Pattersons best books were his first, the first Alex Cross book and the two recent books he collaberated on. After reading this I feel he just loaned those two young authors his selling power and stuck his name on their books."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cross is a stereotype of himself","review":"The Alex Cross novels, much like Robert B Parker's \\"Spenser\\" stories, is a victim Patterson's own success. The series starts well, but as the novels are pumped out, the bad guys become bigger, while our hero becomes more heroic. As noted by another reviewer, the chapters are a paltry page and a half long. This gives the illusion of a \\"real page turner\\" but what it truly does is waste paper. The other \\"pager turner\\" device deployed is ending most chapters with a lingering question or an exclamation, complete with italics. Without those, the story doesn't move well. The basic plot is fine. The coincidences and the happenstances (a 13 year old hacker comes to the rescue) are not imaginative. The internal struggles of Dr. Cross are forced. While there are action sequences, complete with gunfire, I never sensed that Dr. Cross was in danger. I only read the Cross stories out of habit at this point, but much like the Spenser novels, the early books are the best."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a Waste","review":"of time and money!!

I'd bet the reading level is maybe--4th grade."},{"rating":"1","title":"First I will admit that I did not read the entire novel.","review":"Life is just too short to waste time reading a poorly written novel. The writing had no depth, the character interactions were shallow. The story just plodded along with the stilted gate of a robot. Crap, crap, crap and another heaping serving of crap. It was a struggle to read the first third of the book. I kept hoping maybe the next chapter would be better, possibly the next page. But it never got any better and I finally had to put the book down.I had been a Patterson fan for a long time and religiously read every Alex Cross novel that he produced. But I have noticed a rapid decline in quality in his last couple of novels and frankly I think this will be the last Patterson novel that I will ever read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Missing about 100 pages","review":"As someone else said, Patterson just missed with this book. Another unsatisfying ending, with the bad guy not getting \\"his,\\" and the good guy getting the shaft. Needed another hundred pages or so to bring a few of those strings to a good ending. Probably going to be a \\"Bigger, Badder Wolf\\" in the future. Hope it ends better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Time for a break from writing?","review":"This book offended me more than anything else. I love James Patterson books, but these last 2 Lake House and Big Bad Wolf were awful. I will never buy another James Patterson book.

I read it in 3 hours and was pissed off the rest of the day that I spent 20.00 on the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Going downhill","review":"I truly cant understand what has happened to this author. This book is so bad in every way; a simple plot, poor characterizations and dialogue filled with cliches. I cant even remember why his early books were considered good and why I enjoyed them so much because none of that remains. People who like books fast and simple should be able to breeze through this in a few hours, if that is what they want. Certainly his characters and writing style will make that easy, but not enjoyable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not that great.","review":"This was the first Patterson book I read. I liked some of it but this guy has a real problem writing women and children. A lot of what he writes is just plain dumb. Nana Mamma?!?! Pu-leeze. That's so stupid! How many times can he mention \\"Zamochit?\\" Just when things start to get good he STOPS writing. Like he doesn;t have the guts to write about what evil people do to their victims. Get real. Mr. Patterson has good ideas but poor writing skills."},{"rating":"1","title":"so disappointed!","review":"I, like so many other James Patterson/Alex Cross fans, was anxiously awaiting this book, the next chapter in the life and career of Alex Cross. I was so disappointed in the lack of development of this book! It had a weak premise, the characters lacked development, the actual \\"dirty deeds\\" were not even entertaining much less interesting, and even the personal story line of our favorite detective was, again, under developed. It was almost as if James Patterson had a ghost writer who just didn't get the personality of the key players nor the angle of suspense that Patterson himself has been known to deliver. I can't imagine anticipating the sequel. I know that as a loyal fan I will probably read it, if for no other reason than to hope that the return of the core Cross family will be more developed and realistic than in this book, but I look forward to the book after that when this story can be put to rest and, hopefully, the true James Patterson will again emerge."},{"rating":"2","title":"A GREAT READ","review":"THIS BOOK IS GREAT.

I am not an avid reader at all, but this will get me back into reading for sure. I cannot wait until this book has a second coming, there is so much left for the imagination to run wild with. This is the best read I have had in many years and have not been able to put the book down since I purchased it. I am reading it a second time now just to relive the suspense and thrill.

The plot is weak and really badly developed, the characters are wooden and two-dimensional and the writing simple and boring.Even if you can overlook all these things, the ridiculously emotional language that is used to try and inject some interest into Cross's family life is so bad that you will end up sniggering or gagging through most of the book.This really does not deserve to be published."},{"rating":"1","title":"A disappointed Patterson fan","review":"I am a huge fan of James Patterson, and after reading this book I vowed never to buy another of his novels!

Otherwise I would have felt cheated."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Big Bad Wolf","review":"I am almost finished with BBW and have been complaining throughout about the lameness of this book. I have had people tell me for years to read James Patterson, they LOVE James Patterson. Picked this one up in a garage sale for about 50cents. (Glad I didn't spend any more on it.)I'm thinking I could write at least as well as this. After reading some of the other reviews, I'm glad it's not just me.

I've read all the Cross novels, but in this one, I didn't care if he lived or died or found love or treated his kids how they should be treated. He wasn't a character, he was a name on the paper. I cared about nobody in the book. And nothing ever really seemed to happen ... I thought it was just a slow start, and perhaps it still is (since the book is set up to have a sequel). If you're an Alex Cross fan, read it because of that reason -- but do not expect it to be an Alex Cross novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good at first, but majorly disappointing over all","review":"This book started off so well-- i couldn't put it down and couldn't wait to see what was going to happen next. Without giving anything away, I would just like to say that the ending was a HUGE disappointment and I felt as if nothing was ever solved. It just ended. Nothing was believable, you have no idea why the things that happened were happening and so many other story lines are left totally unsolved. I am so frustrated with this novel that i had to write a review :("},{"rating":"1","title":"Where Is The Outrage?","review":"At a time when legitimate talents of the genre only make the best seller lists for a few weeks, hack work by Patterson just keep hanging on. First off, forget the Publishers Weekly review (have you ever read a bad review by these shills?). The characters are styrofoam. The plotting is pedestrian. The author continues to reveal himself as a woman-hater in his fiction. If you want great suspense, go for Harlan Coben. If you want clever writing, try Robert Parker. But please, save yourself the time and the money. Skip this piece of nonsense."},{"rating":"1","title":"Falling Out of Favor","review":"One of my favorite characters is Alex Cross and I can't wait until Patterson pens a new adventure.

The PR, on this book, professed that it was going to be the best Alex Cross story, yet. ....it wasn't! I guess it serves me right for paying attention to PR! I didn't understand why the inclusion of the custody suit was handled the way it was...was this supposed to satisfy readers who want more of the detective's personal life included in the story? The ending is one of Mr. Patterson's well known tricks for supposedly making you want to buy his next book....I won't even borrow that one, the way I did this one. James Patterson is capable of writing really well....I wish he would try doing it, again. (Alone, without a co-author!)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Wish I could give it no stars!!","review":"Good thing James Patterson wasn't at my house when I finished this book. I have never been so angry after completing a novel. Be careful when people say this book is \\"fast-paced\\" or \\"an easy read\\". It absolutely is. Only because the writing is at a grade schools level at best. There is no character development or scene development. It is as if you are reading a first person account from a robot. The only reason I kept reading it was I hoped it would improve. DON'T BUY THIS BOOK!!! I wanted to mail it back to the publisher. If you enjoy descriptive literature you will be sorely disappointed. And you will feel like a sucker for purchasing it. Just like I did."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a joke!!!","review":"I'm a Patterson fan but was thoroughly disappointed with this book. Who is the Wolf? Who is the FBI mole? Who is Marvel? Was the sniper after Alex? How did Alex know the Wolf was shooting at Lipton? There were so many things unexplained that I felt like I wasted hours in reading this book. Alex was billed as a long wolf himself but he never went after the Wolf by himself. I was getting worried when I was running out of pages with no ending in sight. Sure enough, the pages ran out and what a stupid ending. Chapter 116 through Epilogue needs to be rewritten. What a joke!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Where's the ending?","review":"Hmmm, I wonder if Mr. Patterson plans to write a follow up to this novel? Could he have left more things unresolved? The Wolf, the sniper, little Alex, his new love interest, and those are just the ones I remember. The book was entertaining, but I felt mislead. I don't have a problem with leaving a small opening for sequels, but what he has done here is written half a novel. I can only assume \\"Big Bad Wolf II\\" is around the corner."},{"rating":"1","title":"Big Bad Bust","review":"I was very disappointed with Big Bad Wolf. This is the first bad book from Patterson. I only finished it with hopes of it getting better. It picked up towards the end and then it let me down. It was very boring. It was slow moving. The storylines were never finished. This was his worse book ever and it's being advertised as his best. Yeah, right!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Give Alex Cross a VACATION","review":"As a long time fan of James Patterson. I am extremely disappointed. While I have enjoyed his last few novels that DID NOT involve Alex Cross, I am having to say that I wish he would give Alex Cross a much needed vacation. If he can't come up with a better story plot than what this Big Bad Wolf book had, then maybe James Patterson should take a vacation also. The book ended horribly, obviously leaving it open for another book but I will not be rushing out to buy or borrow the next \\"wolf\\" book which will inevitably be on the book shelves before we can blink. I have one thing to say.. BIG BAD BOOK!"},{"rating":"1","title":"This is becoming a rip off","review":"I've read every Patterson book to date, and am a big Alex Cross fan. This, however, is ridiculous. Big Bad Wolf makes little pretense at being anything other than the introductory chapters of a novel. It does not stand on its own, having little development other than the now-obligatory (and blatantly predictable) \\"fake-out, wrong suspect\\" scenes. The Kyle Craig two-booker was interesting. This is just a ploy by Patterson to get 40 bucks for one mid-length novel and a lot of filler."},{"rating":"1","title":"Patterson \\"mailed it in.\\"","review":"I was very disappointed with this Alex Cross Novel. It reads like Patterson quit on the last half of the book. The action just doesn't match up with the plot. Everything happens too fast and too easy. It is as if he is rushing to get through.I suspect this happens when a famous Author gets enough clout that his Editor cannot get him to do the needed rewriting. Too bad."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sequel, Anyone?","review":"My husband & I listened to this as a book on tape on a recent road trip, most of which was at night, during a winter storm watch. I mention that because it was stressful driving, so perhaps we didn't give the story the full attention it deserved...nevertheless, we followed it closely enough to be infuriated at the ending--or lack thereof. I can't remember another book of this genre leaving the reader so thoroughly unsatisfied and frustrated. This was my first Patterson experience, and my last."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheap bad book","review":"Cheap novel. All happening, especially Wolf, looks unbeliavable. I know russian and was very surprised about what \\"samochit\\" means - I am sure this is author fantasy.Personal problems of Alex Cross like problems with custody of his son were completely out of story and I doubt anybody could be interested in them.I read several books recently - this is definitely the worst."},{"rating":"2","title":"Patterson's most elusive criminal yet...The Wolf","review":"While this was not the best Cross novel, I did enjoy the suspense behind the Wolf character. Just when it seemed like Alex was finally going to get him, surprise! The guy they apprehended was not the Wolf after all. He seems to be the toughest and most ruthless criminal Alex Cross has faced yet. The next novel in the Alex Cross series always picks up where the previous one left off, so I am looking forward to the next \\"Wolf\\" book. I was disappointed by the fact that Christine was awarded custody of Little Alex. I was hoping that Alex and Jamilla would finally get together, but not in this novel! I did miss some of the interaction with John Sampson. Hopefully we'll see more of him in the next novel. I'm not sure why there are so many reviews that were negative. I thought the writing was clear, and I wasn't confused by who any of the characters were. I plan to read 3rd Degree next...I can't get enough of James Patterson's books!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst yet.","review":"This book was dreadful, boring, and difficult to follow.

This book in particular is the worst yet."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointing \\"fluff\\"","review":"Is this what Patterson does best? This was my first book written by him and I read it because everyone else on my vacation was reading it. It was uneventful, illogical, and just plain unbelievable. It failed to excite and entertain. I will be hard pressed to pick up another Patterson book when there is so much more better written material out there!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Just a movie script","review":"I thought the premise and writing, amateurish and stunted. A master criminal, controlling billions with a global empire, is personally running a low-budget, kidnapping-for-sex business, which would not have covered the overhead? Patterson wisely had half of the cast speaking in broken English so that complex sentences were not necessary. Seems as though everyone is looking for their serial bad guy to compete with Hannibal Lector, but there aren't enough writers like Thomas Harris to go around. It's just the next movie script. Let's hope for a great director."},{"rating":"1","title":"Whatever happened to James Patterson","review":"I won't waste my time on this one. Needless to say, this is an author more interested in feeding the apparent insatiable appetite of Alex Cross fans than creating a compelling story. \\"Along Came a Spider\\" and \\"Kiss the Girls\\" were novels written by a promising new writer who cared about his craft; wanted to create a character that would live on for years to come. \\"The Big Bad Wolfe\\" is so sloppy and unsatisfactory that I had to go back to make sure I hadn't missed something. This one made me sick. See ya Alex. I don't care about you any longer."},{"rating":"1","title":"What's happened, James?","review":"I have to agree with those who started with the first Cross story. Patterson gives us nothing new as to who Cross is. He has been robotic in the last novels. The \\"split\\" novel of Roses and Violets seems to repeat itself here with an unsolved crime and a bad guy on the loose..... to be continued. Ican only give it one star because its a Cross novel but very little else. I'd rather he abandon the character than toture him to death with these less than honest efforts. Robert PArker has kspt Spencer fresh and entertaining a lot longer than Cross has been around."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing original.","review":"This is a pretty good book - conceptually -, but it sure reminds me of 'War On Wall Street' by Peter Senese."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love this series","review":"This was an awesome book.

Patterson is very famous due his capacity to write best sellers. Apparently, the Alex Cross saga is his most affortunated serie. However, the book (in Spanish El lobo de Siberia) is full of clichés and resources recommended for apprentice writers only. Using the simile between one of the victims and Claudia Shiffer to give an idea of the character is over used. Same thing happens with the nick name of Dragons' killer to give us the image of Cross for the FBI people. Cross does not have a failure in any role of his life, this is unbelivable. Finally, I think that is a betray of the author to hidden information to justify the final and the openness to prepare a second part of this saga with the Wolf. I respect Mr. Patterson for his 80 millions dollar contracts, not per this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a waste of paper","review":"A pervious reviewer hit it on the nose. Patterson can't write. It astonishes me that he's a best seller, considering the putrid crap that he produces. A 4th grader with a crayon could put together a more compelling storyline.

I needed a book for the weekend, and grabbed this one. Big mistake. The characters are cartoonish and totally undeveloped. The villian is obvious and simplistic.

I was very disappointed with this book. I actually threw it to the floor in disgust when I was through reading it. The writing is simplistic and there is no character development. The sentence structure and vocabulary are right out of an Elementary School level text. The only reason I even finished reading it was to have some closure and so I didn't feel like I had wasted my time by reading the beginning. Well, I certainly didn't get the closure I coveted.

Young men and women are disappearing all over the country and the FBI is convinced that a large well run organization is responsible. They think it is possibly headed by a former Russian KGB officer, and mobster, know as the Wolf.In this story the Director of the FBI has recruited former D.C. Detective Alex Cross to help in the investigation. Cross, who has a background in Criminal Psychology and a reputation for solving many cases, is somewhat disappointed in the way the FBI operates and he is thinking that maybe he should have stayed with the D.

It was a messy amalgam of many of his previous books -- the escaped victim a la \\"Kiss the Girls,\\" the threat on Cross's family, a la....well, all of the Cross books, the help from a former bad guy...and the undecided ending. If this is the first of a series, then it doesn't enthrall me enough to pick up part 2. I am very unhappy to say this about Patty, but it's the truth."},{"rating":"1","title":"Comic Book fodder","review":"If we were to rank this effort against the great Alex Cross Novels it wouldn't even be in the same ballpark. The Villian, \\"The Wolf\\" is totally unbelievable and in my opinion Comic book fodder. No intensity like \\"Along Came A Spider\\" and \\"Kiss The Girls\\" and I found myself shaking my head with disappointment at the end of many chapters.Patterson is throwing out lightweight drivel and expecting us to buy it. I guess I did \\"buy the book\\" but this is more like Sidney Sheldon, soap opera junk.Where have you gone \\"James Patterson?\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Same book different title","review":"James Pattersons' Alex Cross books were good for the first 3 or 4 volumes in the series. Now, they all feel the same and they are really very shallow as far as the depth of character or plot development. Very little substance, but I suppose that's all they are supposed to be. Oh well...."},{"rating":"1","title":"Big Bad BS","review":"I thought this book was really far fetched. Parts of this book are wonderful and very entertaining. Other sections of the book just do not seem accurate. I realize this is a fictional book, but I really think with a little more editing this story would have been great. I enjoyed reading the description of the kidnapping at Phipps Plaza in Atlanta as it seemed very accurate and scary down to every minute detail. On the other hand, the chat room crap seemed a little far fetched although who knows there are plenty of sick people in this world. I just do not really believe there would be people willing to pay money for other women in such a fashion, but who knows as maybe there really are people out in the world like mentioned in this book. I hope I never encounter them!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A Letdown","review":"It started out good (as most of Patterson's novels do) and then it went down hill. I think that Patterson has taken Alex Cross as far as he can. It's pretty much unbelievable that the \\"FNG\\" of the FBI can just be thrust out onto the streets to solve the Wolfe kidnappings. Here's hoping Patterson can build on the Wolfe's character because he doesn't seem all that big and bad yet."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I was disappointed with this one. kind of got the feeling, it was to keep us going to the book store to buy another James Patterson novel.I will say that he definitely makes up for it in the \\"3rd Degree\\" Awesome reading. I couldn't put it down. I'm here to tell ya, I'm a 330 pound football offical, exterminator by trade, and I got more than one tear stirring up in my eyes reading this one. I got really attached to the charcters. This \\"3rd Degree\\" is a MUST read."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Big Boring Wolf","review":"2 1/2 StarsI have read every one of Mr. Patterson's books and have loved them all. However, The Big Bad Wolf was a bit of a let down for me. It felt as if a lot of the details were left out. I was also very disappointed in the ending. It seems as if there will be a sequel to this book, if there is I hope it's a little more exciting and less predictable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Thin stuff","review":"This novel is your basic James Patterson product. Short paragraphs - little fleshing out of a story - lots of twists and turns in the hunt for a brutal killer - just interesting enough to keep you reading - but fairly thin gruel. Alex Cross, the ex-DC homicide cop who joined the FBI in Four Blind Mice is earning his spurs as he joins the hunt for the Wolf, a member of the Russian Mafiya who has plans to be the godfather of all organized crime. What initially has the FBI's attention is the kidnappings of white women who it turns out have been \\"ordered\\" by wealthy patrons who have designs on them. Why the Wolf would be involved in such an activity when his designs are so much larger is never explained. Patterson also brings a custody battle over Little Alex in to the story which does little or nothing to advance the plot, but perhaps he needed a few more chapters. He has done better and hopefully will again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fast and fun read","review":"Very quick and easy reading- hard to put down! The story did end very abruptly but there will definitely be a sequel. I thought the plot was similiar to other stories- but that is why I love Alex Cross. I liked him being frustrated in his new position in the FBI. I wish there would have been some additional details with his personal life instead of completely business. The return of little Alex's mother helped make the book more personable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I thoroughly enjoy the Alex Cross books as a rule. This is the second time that Patterson has elected to stretch a story into 2 books. It is very disappointing to have a book be so intense and just come to a dead halt at the end. I think that it would be good customer relations if he would at least identify that his book is the first of two. Overall, Patterson has been one of my favorite writers, but with books like this I am starting to think otherwise."},{"rating":"1","title":"What's Happened to James Patterson?","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed the initial Alex Cross novels, but this was a resounding disappointment. Patterson seems to have evolved into an author who no longer cares about the quality of his writing. If you can accept the premise of the F.B.I. recruiting someone from a city police force and immediately jumping them over seasoned veterans to a position of dominance, then, perhaps you will be readily able to accept the many other unlikley aspects of this novel. Rather than contributing to character development, Patterson's subplots involving Cross's family and friends seem manipulative and shallow. His long distance romance is like a teenage view of love and separation. The most manipulative facet of the entire book is the ending which seems to have no motivation driving it other than an effort to get readers to buy the next epsiode when it comes out. It shouldn't be a long wait-it can't take much time for Patterson to type a book of this quality."},{"rating":"1","title":"TERRIBLE!","review":"What A Terrible Book!It started off very promising, but the style of two pages, new chapter, two pages, another chapter throughout the book is very annoying (313 pages - 119 Chapters In the Soft Copy Version).It appears that the author was very rushed, and completely lost track of what he was writing about half way through the book, tried for a big finish - and utterly disappoints - I am all for unexpected endings, but this one was purely wrong!Worst Read Of This Decade!

My daughters love the little hiding places, and the detailing is excellent. I like the fact that there are features included for the Kelly dolls also, like a bed that folds up into a seat for Kelly. There's enough little accessories included to keep any little girl happy, and the \\"dance floor\\" is fun. You can also use the Kelly dolls on the twirling dance floor. The dining table also becomes a full-length mirror so a princess can admire her gowns. Ths only negatives we've found so far are that the canopy for the bed does fall sometimes, but not every time, and you can't put all the pieces inside the castle when it's folded. It is nice to have a castle that can fit on a shelf though, and the toy is well worth the price."},{"rating":"1","title":"Flimsy!","review":"It is a beautiful castle after it is put together...but shame on Mattel for terrible, blurry, vague instructions!

These poems not only summon their shared past in vivid detail, but also ponder the meaning of death and separation, as well as the yearning for eventual reunion. Her's is an unforgettable, lyrical voice radiating strength and optimism in the face of loss and separation.

But, as Wilde so forthrightly put it, \\"all bad poetry is sincere.\\" This is no exception. The poems in this collection are barely poems at all, but more often are simply thoughts chopped up into lines to make them appear poetic. \\"Show, don't tell\\" has left the building for this one, folks.\\"I don't want eternityit overwhelms meI want to be alivewhile I livewithout thinkingabout whyI live...\\"(\\"I Don't Want Eternity\\")There are a few pieces here where Alegria still seems to grasp the essence of poetry (and translator Carolyn Forche seizes on two of them in her introduction, the best part of the book), but they are in the minority here.

I have over 20 cookbooks on seafood alone. This book is the BEST book I have found. It not only tells you about the fish (briefly, not too detailed), it gives you other fish options to substitute for each recipe (which is nice if you are limited to what's available at the fish store), breaks the index down by type of fish AND type of sauce and other ingredients so if you feel like something with avocado or black beans or tomatoes you can search the index by ingredient and not have to search the entire book for specific recipes. And, unlike other \\"quick meal\\" cookbooks, this one truly is quick. Finally, each recipe frequently calls for one or all of my four favorite ingredients: fresh garlic, fresh flat leaf parsley, extra virgin olive oil or butter and wine."},{"rating":"2","title":"A life-saver for a landlubber just moved to the coast","review":"After having lived on the coast for a year and STILL being afraid of cooking fish and shellfish at home, I checked this book out from the local library and gave it a whirl.

I have, alas, become a believer. This man's lyrics are soooo deep. I love the fact that I can listen to this CD and search for the deeper meaning in the songs. For instance, I never realized that in his song 'I've Made Love To You a Thousand Times,' that he was speaking figuratively and that it was a fantasy. But when I figured that out...OH MY WORD!!!! how seductive is that??!!! I believe that when he wrote Daylight and Darkness he had me in mind and didn't even know it.

Every chapter eases into Roman history in a way that brings a beginner up to speed and new insights into America itself. Barr includes extensive footnotes and uses direct quotes from the great Roman historians, playwrights and philosophers whenever possible. The transition from Republican rule to the Empire is clearly described- again, in a way that offers insight in to modern America. Through good emperors and bad, remembering senators corrupt and enlightened, a picture of Rome's historical flaw becomes apparant not in the form of government that it possesed at any given point in time, but the values of their culture and how they changed. If you are interested in Roman history, get this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Faulty CD!

Yet another case winds up involving one of Mma Makutsi's students, a mustachioed charmer with a center part. The case was taken first to a rival detective agency, just opened by a man with big-city connections.

Hand-eye coordination is THE essential element of golfing talent, but even with great hand-eye coordination, you have to know what to do with the hands."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just needs decent graphics and illustrations","review":"I enthusiastically recommend this book to golfers with an interest in science/math/engineering, or scientists/mathematicians/engineers with an interest in golf. You should get Search for the Perfect Swing first. But once you have that out of the way, this book is an excellent addition to a golf library.The biggest shortcomings of The Physics of Golf are (1) a lack of quality illustrations/pictures/graphics and (2) a rather terse treatment of the material. I feel that the author probably has enough research to go on for 4-500 pages but called it quits at a much more concise size. I'm all for concise, but not when it leaves me feeling some useful material was left out."},{"rating":"2","title":"For the love of witches!","review":"Well and animals and fudge! A childhood book I could never forget. I read it 30 years ago and would love to have a copy of it now."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fudge and Animals, what more could you want?","review":"As a child who loved animals and desperately wished I could talk to them, and also had a particular fondness for fudge, I devoured this book time and time again. \\"No such thing as a witch\\" delivers a gentle message about not making rash judgments about others -- as well as being kind to animals -- but it doesn't bludgeon the reader over the head with it. It's a fun little fantasy and a good way to spark the imagination of young animal lovers, boys and girls alike. It might appeal to anyone who enjoys stories such as Stuart Little, The Borrowers, The Mouse and the Motorcycle, or The Littles series. This book needs to be in print again."},{"rating":"1","title":"A lacklustre effort","review":"Despite some handsome ink wash landscapes and cityscapes, this is a plodding low-budget adaptation. Needless to say, drastic cuts in the plot are necessary to scale Dickens's novel down to the length of a short film, but thanks to clumsy script-writing and editing, the plot is not very clear for children. There's surely a better way to initiate kids to this story."},{"rating":"2","title":"A nice companion","review":"The Mentalism Companion gives a very good listing of extra spells, professions, and training packages for the Rolemaster system. The professions and training packages are pretty cool, such as an Enchanter profession and the Dreamweaver Training Package.

Likewise the shop assistants at Tlokweng Road Speedy Motors.The mystery of Mr J.L.B. Matekoni's change in behavior commands our attention early on. Hats off to McCall Smith for weaving a common but stigmatized illness into the story line, through a character he has already made us like and respect.As the novel wraps up, Mma Ramotswe puts an important \\"Government Man\\" in his place but neglects to solve the mystery of the child we met in the second chapter. Will we ever find out this boy's history? I plan to keep reading to find out."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lady Detective Triumphs Again","review":"I so enjoyed the HBO series a couple of years ago, but have only begun reading the series recently. This third book has the virtues of one and two: written in simple, effective style; taking an affectionate stance towards its familiar characters; creating an idealistic, almost magical world where thoughtfulness, patience, love and determination reign, malice is treatable, and violence is heard only in muted echos. I can't help picturing the TV actors as the main characters, but I don't mind, because they were played so well, particularly Mma Ramotswe.

However, that isn't a bad indictment on this charming and easy to read book.In this book, our hero's assistant, who was promoted to Assistant Detective in Tears of the Giraffe, finds herself in an expanded role in the detective business, and in the automotive repair business too. For reasons not entirely explained, Mr J.L.B. Matekoni suffers from depression and takes a theraputic vacation, leaving his business in the hands of his fiancee and her trusted assistant. I was disappointed that we didn't find out more about the cause of the depression, but perhaps that is the cliffhanger to lead the reader to the next book, The Kalahari Typing School for Men.There are two main detective tales in this book, one involving each of our two lady detectives. Each are solved with uncommon common sense from two of the smartest women in Africa."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful change","review":"It is really a great series! The changes in this book makes it fresh and gives it a new twist. Not only does she have an assistant who proves to be as wise and intelligent, but Mma's new approach to solving problems and understanding people's behavior is the main issue in this book. It shifts a little from the route of culture, and emphasizes on everyday issues just like in any other place. We don't see Mma explaining traditions and their meaning, but trying to understand human nature, whether it was depression or revenge, she finds a way to show reality and truth, even her assistant found her own way of facing truth.I can't wait to find out what is going to happen to Mr. Matekoni, and what happened to the ring?!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Favorite author","review":"What a wonderful surprise to find such an interesting series about a Botswanan woman written by a man!!

Precious Ramotswe is busy. She is moving her detetective office into her fiance's business to help cut costs as her detective agency is not doing as well, financially, as she would like. Her fiance is not feeling well and she is trying to help him plus take care of a couple of orphans and solve her cases. Her character is one of warmth, kindness, generosity and strength. One of the things that I like about these books is that I get a glimpse of what life is like in Botswana, Africa."},{"rating":"1","title":"stiff PC prose","review":"Read the sample pages on Amazon...the author obviously set himself the task of raising consciousness about life in Africa, specifically female life in Botswana.

By comparison, vol 3 dwells too much on the personal lives of Mma Ramotswe and her husband to be. These parts of the book are uninteresting and did not engage me much. On the other hand, very little detecting is done in this book. The main character really handles only one case, and while in the first volume this was where her earthy wisdom shone through, here her advice is not as convincing, as if she has her mind on other things.On the other hand, the minor characters in this book are delightful. It was good to see the assistent come into her own, and the mechanic apprentices insert a much needed comic note into the story.In all, this book feels like the author is treading water, not sure where to take his characters. He is shifting from the series-of-vignettes to a more long form novel, but the result is not convincing. Yet."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointing, sloppy","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed the first two volumes in The Ladies No.1 Detective Agency series; however, this entry was a huge disappointment. What can you say about a book where there are not only plot inconsistencies across volumes (Precious's father left her 180 cattle in volume 1 but that number is given as 2000 in this volume) but within the volume itself (the Government Man clearly says of his youngest brother, 'He is my brother of another mother.' However later on in the book the Government Man's mother is claiming the youngest son as her own and no further mention is ever made of the 'other mother'. Further there are plot stubs that go nowhere as far as I can tell -- the Lion Boy, Ms. Makutsi's brother and Mr. J.L.B. Matekoni's illness. Seriously, seriously disappointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"First of all, I think that it is reprehensible that a book of this caliber is published without being proofread!!

Secondly, the story lacked the imaginative and insightful detective aspect of the first two. Very disappointing!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Just boring not as good as the first 2 books","review":"I really enjoyed the first book then the second was dissapointing and this one was really dissapointing. O.k the first one was mainly about the main character working as a detective solving crimes that people ask her to do. Then this one has hardly no detective work. It focuses more on the main characters life outside work which is o.k I ebjoed that in the first book but it's not the same in this book. It just drags on and on and on. Bring back more detective work in the series of books."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too forced","review":"There is too much of this book which reads like a junior-high essay which had to be 500 words or more. Too many references to the \\"Little white van\\" and \\"Mr. J.L.B. Maketoni\\" which only add text, not meaning. (I'm sure that this gets written with \\"JLB\\" and then a search and replace with \\"Mr. J.L.B.

Nevertheless, we are favored with the wise one liners of these patient busybodies. Mme Makutsi with her oversized glasses and her too dark skin shines. The detective agency is charged with the task of finding a young woman whose integrity matches her beauty among contestants in a beauty pagent.

When postmodernists say that humans cannot and will never understand a system from within that system itself E replies that \\"a certain capcity for critical self-reflection belongs to the way the human animal belongs to its world\\". Shamelessly E makes a law of what he has to prove! Rationalism, universalism (which E stands for) are bankrupt. Relativism and postmodernism are also bankrupt, but E doesn't understand how (that one mirrors the other).

With my iPod though I had to pay more attention to the settings to get the right sound and sometimes it didn't seem as loud as the FM and easily distorted with certain types of music.None the less, I consider this to be a wonderful personal portable radio. Great for the office, bedroom, kitchen, or on the table during dinner. In a lot of ways the sound is just right. Just the right volume and clarity to give it many uses without being overpowering.

This makes it a lot less practical, and I won't even go into how long this battery will last--so far I've read about it lasting only about 500 charges, which means mine will easily be dead forever in about a year.

I take it with me everywhere I go: in my car, around the house, etc. If anyone is in the market to purchase an mp3 player, I would highly suggest the iPod because you will not find a better player than this one. Why? Because it is very simple to use and it has a great design. All of the other mp3 players out there are too bulky and are too difficult to use.

The touted 20 minutes of skip free play is almost exactly that. At 18-20 minutes into a run (just getting started for many runners) the iPod freezes, and can only be unfrozen by plugging it into its recharger. Amazingly, the arrogant tech at Apple recommended stopping running every 18 minutes and plugging the thing into the recharger for a few minutes...really handy for trail runs. To be fair to Apple, the iPod uses a hard drive to store MP3's, and this performance is not unusual; however the inaccurate advertising is unusual, and not very Apple-like.

This renders the device useless for listening to anything from Audible longer than 30 minutes as I would have to manually write down my location in each book that I am listening too.

All through the book, I was thinking, \\"OK, this is all interesting: all the future predictions and gadgets, but when do we get to the monolith?!?\\" I really got interested when they discovered the monolith's plans, but nothing ever came of it. They had ONE meeting about it where they figured out how to solve the issue (trying not to give anything away to anyone who hasn't read it), Frank had ONE conversation with Dave and they implemented their solution. I thought the humans were going to get into a real good conflict with the monolith, but instead all I got was that weak spectacle at the end when the monolith was defeated. So basically, interesting view of the future, but Clarke seemed to be trying too hard to fit it into the 2001 series."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lacking the complexity and imagination of first 3 odysseys","review":"Other Reveiw have given the basic story line so I will restrict myself to comments.

Cheif among them was \\"Who would inherit the galaxy--the humans or europeians?\\" 2001, 2010, and 2061 all also showed clear thought logic and eccelent imagination built into it that 3001 lacked completely. In fact in my opinion he failed to live up to the expectations that his great writing in the past and build up especially in 2061 led us to believe was coming. Frankly I am terribly disapointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"A good start that was published too early.","review":"I love Arthur C. Clarke's books. Always have. But. A big but... 3001 starts out fantastic and I blazed through the first couple of chapters letting Mr. Clarke tell me, what appeared to be, another good story. But it would appear that Mr. Clarke didn't want to tell a story. That he only told this story because he was asked to continue his most famous story line. The worst part is that he felt that he needed to flash back to remind the reader of what happened to Mr. Poole in 2001: A Space Odyssey. If I ever feel that I need reminding of that great tome, I will dust off its well worn cover and retrace those steps. 3001 just seems unfinished.

The ending is similar to Independence Day (the movie). Computer virus wins over are ancestral guides?

You come to Clarke for his speculative ideas and interesting plots. 3001 begins well enough; the ideas are abundant and the plot builds, albeit, a bit slowly. There is a bit too much of revived Discovery astronaut Frank Poole's recovery time devoted to the minutiae of fourth millennia technology. When Poole finally gets back into space and pursues the continuing mystery of the monoliths the book really gets rolling. Unfortunately, and inexplicably, Clarke rushes the conclusion, and I believe undercuts the powerful image of the Monolith he has challenged our imaginations with from the beginning of the Odyssey series. The supposed conclusion to the series leaves readers more confused than ever and trivializes one of the most potent images in sci-fi lit. Very disappointing and unsatisfying. I wish he hadn't even made the attempt."},{"rating":"1","title":"An anticlimactic end to a great series","review":"Arthur C Clarke has produced some awesome works ofSF. Rendezvous with Rama, 2001 and Childhood's Endrank, in my opinion, with the best SF ever produced. This book is a major disappointment. There are a myriad of inconsistencies with the previous books of the series and the work reads more like a short story than a novel. Most of the key elements of the previous book have been discarded and some of the more trivial ones developed. As an optimistic speculation as to the state of the world in 3001 the book works well. As a novel it is rather poor. The Clarke fan would consider it substandard when compared to his other works while the casual reader would just find it dull. After the heights of 2001 the Odyssey series has come to a anticlimactic and perhaps even unimaginative end."},{"rating":"1","title":"Science - 10, fiction - 2","review":"Arthur Clarke is a genius, and when he tells me what the future is going to be like in a thousand years or so, I pay attention.

These people don't breathe and spit and snore; these are illustrations, not characters.

According to the speed of light, the Alien Overlords are just finding out what humanity is like and that maybe we are not that nice. Didn't Clarke read his own book. The speed of light can be gotten around. The aliens knew EXACTLY what we were like right from the start! His vision of the ring around Earth is kind of cool, and the best thing about this book.It needs to be said that Clarke's condescending comments about religion and religious people are so callow and insulting that I lost much of the respect I had for him. I now assess most of the credit for 2001 to Stanley Kubrick.

But overall the novel is very short on plot. You are left with the feeling that he set out to write an epic, but got tired, thinned it out, and ended it quickly.

Almost zero attention is devoted to the mystery of the monolith, actual characterization is marginal at best, provocative theological questions are quickly mentioned then ignored, major developments are summarized in a trivial second-hand fashion totally bereft of any depth--and the ending is manages to be arrogant, simplistic AND boring at the same time.It's pretty clear dollar signs were dancing in ACC's head when he wrote this claptrap.

The book suddenly stops in its tracks. I had to re-read the final chapter and check the PAGE NUMBERS to see if the publisher had left out the ending by accident.It's as if Mr. Clarke lost interest in this awful piece of fluff about three pages into the story -- if story is the right word --and continued to write, grudgingly, in order to pay his mortgage.Yes, he's brilliant, and he's written some classic fiction and non-fiction, but he was so disintrested in his own story that the magic, the mystery, the grandeur of the next (or, previous) thousand years is glossed over without any thought about entertaining the reader.If you haven't read this book yet -- don't.

Clarke is considered the greatest science fiction writer of all time,\\" says the publisher's blurb. By who? _3001_ contains maybe 25 pages' worth of story (though \\"story\\" is putting it too strongly), padded out to ten times that length by self-indulgent prophesying and preaching, in amateurish prose that makes you cringe several times per page. And when, after 150 pages of this padding, we finally get to the actual story, Clarke fails to provide us with the most important and potentially interesting part of it, the actual message whose warning of impending disaster finally sets the real plot in motion. Ironically, the best writing and reading come in the nonfictional source notes and valediction at the end of the book. For addicts only, and they might want to wait for the cheaper paperback edition, which surely won't be long in coming"},{"rating":"2","title":"well written book but it is no sequel to 2061","review":"Although the book was very good.

(They should do a movie of this one.) But 3001 was a totally unnecessary ending. Much of it is implausible, even for the next, next millennium. The resolution for the Monolith plot thread seems far too convenient, and the black enigmas were best left a mystery. The future of mankind was good enough in 2001-2061, but it is depressing here. And a ring around the planet? Even for 3001, this is a bit too much. I still respect Clarke though, but he failed to finish the story in a good way.

The plot was too focused on the human aspects of Frank Poole and not focused enough on the thing that made the 2000 series great -- the monolith. It seems to me that Clarke expended too much energy on introspection and human drama. The fabricated plot surrounding the Monolith seems like it was put in there to give a semblance of credibility to the fact that this story really shouldn't take place. All in all a disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Should have stopped at 3","review":"I was very disappointed with the story as it unfolded. As some of the other reviews have indicated it started with promise and then quickly died. Mr Clarke did not bother with even an attempt to conceal his loathing of religion nor his apparent view that Socialism is the best form of government (obviously he has never read Frederick C. Hayak's \\"Road to Serfdom\\"). I kept waiting for the story to break out into something worthy of the series but instead found myself at end asking \\"Is this it?!\\" He should of stopped at the 3rd book or at least waited until he had some inspiration."},{"rating":"2","title":"Clarke's imagination is pure science and it shows in 3001","review":"In 3001 the missing element is extra-scientific imagination in the form of real drama. Like the Rama series, there is wealth of plausible scientific innovation from a futurist perspective in the 2001 series, but little in the way of real imagination of the human kind. Nonetheless, I read Clarke with this caveat in mind and he never disappoints me. As expected, Clarke's world of 3001 is the innovative environment that we have come to expect from a futurist thinker, but to describe his world, he inserts some unrelated incidents that simply serve as a vehicle to describe innovation. I did enjoy the innovations of the third millenium and look forward to Clarke's futurist research prospectus."},{"rating":"1","title":"Was ACC in a rush to get somewhere?","review":"This book, no rather collection of pages, was awful. Where is the plot, where is the imagination? By the time I finished I felt that ACC had an appointment that afternoon and quickly finished the book so as not to miss his engagement.

At least I'll always have 2001 to revisit."},{"rating":"1","title":"Biggest disappointment of 1997!","review":"One expects to suspend logic while enjoying ascience fiction novel, but Clark has carriedthings much too far. Enjoyment was marred by the constant thought: \\"Gimme a break!\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"There's no heart here.","review":"What I hated about this book was that it had Frank Poole as a protaganist, a character we barely remember. 2001 was the best book in the series. It explaiend things better than the movie, but not so much that ruined it. 2061 was the most boring and this book is tyed with 2010. I also hated how the characters on Earth and Ganymede were able to figure out what happened to Bowman. I liked it better when it was big mystery. This book is also self contradicting. During the prolouge at the begining it says the firstborn came years ago and left never planning to come back but leaving their monoliths to do the rest. But in the epilouge they say they plan to come back at the end of time. Without a doubt 2001 was the best."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good concept, but never seems to develope","review":"The mystery of the monolith, being so cryptic and strange, is an exceptionally good concept for a science fiction plot. After all, everyone whoever saw 2001 wonders at times about the monolith.Sadly though, it seems that the author never really figured out how to develope this idea and ended up just dragging it out through 4 books.This sort of was an obvious let down for readers.I also felt that the series was more devoted to his idea of the future and the universe than delivering a real storyline. The storyline was merely used as tool to express his quite fasinating image of the future to the reader.I must admit, the fourth book is a bit predictable. He needed to finish off the series and was only capable of thinking up a medicore climax."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a \\"Scientific\\" science fiction","review":"I love most of Clarke's works but this book actually drives me mad! If I did not know him, I would guess he did never saw a computer even from distance! How he did even imagined using a computer virus, 1000 years after it's creation on an alien computer? I really did not expect that from a world class SF writer. I think that flaw realy spoils the experience...."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointing","review":"This book gets 2 stars only because I was able to finish it, not because of its content. It does not compare to the literary quality of the first 2 books in the series. Good science fiction should be both imaginative in its exploration of the future and intellectually stimulating in its exploration of ethical dilemmas. This book is neither. There was only one lame chapter toward the end of the book that dealt with the religion issue and how 31st century science had impacted it. And what happened to Frank when he landed on Europa and was supposedly reunited with Dave after a millenia? And Hal, the epitome and representation of evil, now a \\"good guy\\" or at least benevolent? I agree with the other reviewers that said some things should be left to the imagination and that this book should be read only to complete the series.By the way, someone who has been writing for as long as Clarke has should not misuse the word \\"myriad\\" as often as he does."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't bother","review":"As I said in the review about 2061, the series should have ended with 2010, because it had the perfect open-ended way of finishing the series. 2061 and 3001 are not important at all, and with all its inconsistencies 3001 is much worse than 2061.I recommend 2001 and 2010 only, and also some other classics from Clarke like Childhood's End and Rendezvous with Rama."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ok it wasn't the Greatest","review":"this book was what i call junk i can't belive he wrote a book on this some part were ok but what the heck were you thinking.you ruined your self on the third so never make another and people don't read this if you don't like stuff that is so mixed up you can hardly read it but hey in the end it was preaty good."},{"rating":"1","title":"Letdown of massive proportions!","review":"3001 was a letdown. I had been looking forward to this book ever since I finished 2061. I finished the book and basically said \\"That's it?\\" I'll admit that some points in the book are very flavorful, but they are not used to their potential. It's as if this was a bit rushed and background was kept at a premium. I guess the Odyssey went in like a lion and out like a lamb."},{"rating":"1","title":"The FINAL odyssey, I hope","review":"As sad as this may sound, I would have expected better from a first-time hack writer. This is hardly ACC at his prime; the plot was utterly contrived, consisting of little more than a repeat of chapters from the previous three books with some glue in between. As an attempt to add some suspense, the reader is treated to an ending worthy of Hollywood: the Monolith becomes the villain of the story, with our heroes involved in a gratuitous battle to save Earth. The deus ex machina solution, of course, consists of one (1) supercomputer virus, Jeff Goldblum, and a Powerbook. Wait - I must have confused this with Independence Day.This series has definitely reached a new low point with the 3001: Final Odyssey. I do not relish the thought of yet another literary atrocity, just in case the publishers are even contemplating a sequel. Avoid at all costs."},{"rating":"1","title":"3001: Just Say NO!","review":"If anyone suggests you read this book, just say NO! Why?

I just want to say that not seeing Independace Day is not really an excuse for Clarke. Take a look at \\"Invasion\\",\\"The Puppet Master\\",\\"War of the worlds\\", and many other alien invasion movies, and you'll see that almost every time the aliens are destroyed by a virus(biological or computer, it doesn't matter, it's still a virus). Everyone who has read the previous books would expext the similar kind of enigmatic conclusion, where not everything is revealed, and the reader could be left wondering about some higher intellegence out there, and we could get some idea from the book.

The story is mundane and predictable and without any of the facination that held my interest in earlier books. This book opens at a low level of interest and maintains it throughout.Clarke uses this book as a soapbox for insulting anyone of faith (calling them \\"Un-Sane\\").

The first 2/3 of the book is boring. It's too descriptive. Clarck tries to describe a world at 3001 based in theoretical physics of today, we don't know if could be ever possible, and when action starts it's too simple, no suspense. And the final comfrontation to the monolith has been taken from a recent commercial movie of the 90's."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved the view of 3000","review":"I became completely enveloped in the world created in this book and the technological advances presented within.

I disagree that there is anything really interesting in it. None of the ideas are new, and most have been presented better in other books. The fact that it shares something with the movie \\"Independence Day\\" should be an indication that it isn't very good.The story just plods along with no real focus or reason for being until near the end and then the solution is so matter of fact, and trivial that it just sucks the life out of the Odyssey series.I would recommend passing on this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not quite as good as 2001 and 2061, but...","review":"For me, the compelling story of Franke Pool, long believed to be dead, being resurrected and communicating with the evolved consciousness of Dave Bowman within the monolith was just too good to pass up. I've added it to: Stranger in a Strange Land\\", \\"Puppet Masters\\", \\"Foundation\\", \\"2001\\", \\"2010\\", \\"Rendezvous with Rama\\", \\"Ringworld\\", all the \\"Star Trek\\" and \\"Star Wars\\" books, as well as books as new to the genre as \\"Advent of the Corps\\" and others."},{"rating":"1","title":"Painfully Bad","review":"This is probably the worst book I have read. The book lacks imagination and the characters have no substance. For such a brilliant start of a series 2001 the ending was so bad it is indescribably bad and predicable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good for dedicated 2001 fans","review":"The book is farily easy reading, not a lot of technical jargon . Definately not action-packed (no sex, violence, or high speed chases), it does clarify things from the previous Odyssies and is a must for those of us who have been with 2001 from the beginnings in the '60s. Finding and reviving Frank Poole after 1000 years, Clarke did a fair job of taking modern problems and concerns and relating them and their possible solutions to the future. I thought the ending was anticlimatic, but it did leave the door open for another sequel"},{"rating":"1","title":"3001 : The Final Odyssey","review":"This book was very disappointing given Clarke's other works. There was little explanation as for how Poole survived, and the book spent most of the time catching him up on the last 1000 years. I was expecting a big finale, and what I got was a few pages involving using a computer virus to trick the monolith system into giving humanity another 1000 years. When I got to the last page I thought, \\"that's it?\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"A uncharacteristically mediocre odyssey","review":"Whilst 2001 has a certain mythical grandeur, and left the reader with a sense of awe and wonder, and is one of the greatest works of the twentieth century, Clarke's conclusion of the story one thousand years later is highly unimaginative and much more like 'standard' science fiction.To those readers enthralled by 2001, and to some part, 2010, I strongly advise that you do not read 2061, and certainly not 3001, lest the wonderous illusion of the original story be shattered in an instant."},{"rating":"1","title":"Weak","review":"A weak ending to a great series. The sense of wonder was gone. Very little suspense and story. This is more Clarke's view of the future than it is a story about the future. Potentially interesting as an examination of Clarke's views on politics, but that's about it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh man, hold your nose!","review":"ACC should have stopped at 2001, a truly great read from one of the best movies of all time. Each book in the series went down from there. This one doesn't even deserve one star! It sucked so hard that I read it in one sitting, since I knew I would never come back to it if I put it down. It is horrendous, no lie!"},{"rating":"2","title":"So far so good","review":"The book so far has followed a Clarke tradition of carefully yet vaguely describing an odd scenario that probably will not exist. I will finish this book as soon as possible given the well done story setup"},{"rating":"1","title":"Embarrassing","review":"This book doesn't deserve even 1 star. It is at such an opposite extreme of quality to the original novel, one must assume that Arthur Clarke didn't really write it. Astronauts coming back from the dead? Circumcision? Computer viruses locked in a vault in the moon? Please. Beyond stupid. The only -- and not even remotely saving -- grace was a few interesting ideas about what future technology might look like."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting.","review":"I was impressed with 3001, but I hadn't read the others in the Odyssey chain. I am reading 2010 as I thought it might shed some light on 3001 -- sort of a literary reverse engineering thing. Sure is dark in here."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cardboard cut-out characters that are little Arthur Clarkes","review":"A thinly veiled tirade and anti-religious editorial filled with smug elitism. Mr Clarke has forgotten that we expect a story when we buy a novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unbelievably dull and unimaginative","review":"I can't believe that the same author wrote the previous books of the Odyssey series! 3001 was a weak speculation of the future, Clarke's rendition dull and unimaginative -- merely excerpts of other literature of our time (\\"Jurassic Park\\" and \\"Cult at the end of the World\\" for example). It was almost as if Mr. Clarke was forced to write this book! I was completely disappointed and barely made it to the end (I couldn't finish 2061). I probably should have stopped reading his books after reaching puberty."},{"rating":"1","title":"If you saw Independence Day, you know the plot of this book!","review":"I had to force myself to finish this book. It was plotless, predictable, had lifeless characters, and frankly I wish I'd never bought it. There were way too many dumb references to \\"quaint\\" twentieth century things (ie, one character -- who was born in the thirtieth century, no less -- had to explain that there were no \\"Star Trek transporters.\\" Plus there was a plethora of bad cliches being used, because, predictably, the female love interest was a historian who just happened to specialize in Poole's era). ARGH! It hurt my brain to read this book! Save yourself the bother -- if you absolutely have to read it, just check it out at the library. At least that way you don't have anything invested in it and you can put it down without feeling like you wasted your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"The 'Windows '95' of the Oddessy series","review":"Well. uhmn. Touted, lots of anticipation based on reputation. Like climbing into a Mazzerratti (sp) And discovering it has a salvaged 1967 VW Bug engine. Best things to say here are 1) Technologically, interesting. 2) Didn't suck. Not completely at least. In my uninformed opinion, ACC is tired, and may well have been pressured into this by his adoring public. In my mind, where there is an afterlife in which you are free to roam the cosmos and time at will, and all things are known, all answers revealed, this final oddessy will become more palatable."},{"rating":"1","title":"A GOOD BOOK GONE BAD","review":"I picked up this book for a good price and just because i knew the author was a good one. I can't say that i've read his other novels, but i hear he can do better. As it started I was intrigued and read the first hundred pages non-stop. It portrayed in good and facinating detail the ways of life and the culture shock that Poole tried to avoid in 3001. As i read i became less interrested, but kept reading hoping that since the beginning was excellent that it would end w/ a bang. I was sourly dissappointed at a boring and mildly eventful ending For the diehard Clarke fan its a must, though dissappointing, I wouldn't reccomend this to anyone as a first impression of good Sci-fi."},{"rating":"1","title":"HO! HUM!!!! JUST LIKE 2061","review":"Prepare to be disappointed again. 2010 was science fiction at its finest. It was passionate, intriguing, and left me breathless for more.2061 was not very good and neither is this one.Clarke seems to have lost his interest in this story and wanted to just shrug it off like a coat no longer needed or wanted' The book is short and has a large font, as well as copies of previously released chapters. The only remotely interesting thing is Clarke's portrayal of future gadgets. But that does not save it from being a big waste of money and very little time!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Did Clarke really write this?","review":"This book is terrible. I loved the other books in the series. Not only are the characters shallow and undeveloped, the plot thin, but the actual writing is terrible. It seems there at least three exclamation points per paragraph. \\"I'm sure confused! This is the future! That's nice!\\"I think that Clarke must have a grandson or something who is learning how to write and used his grandpa's name on this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"So that's it?????","review":"This book was twice as useless as 2061. It is a good short story that never makes it as a novel. As usual, Clarke uses the story to publish his predictions for the future, but with this book that's about all you get. The poorly developed characters elicit no empathy from this reader, and the plot is only ankle-deep. I kept thinking that sooner or later it would have to get interesting when I realized I was three quarters of the way through to the rushed and wow-less ending. I read this book only to finish out the series. Odyssey 2: 2010 left me wanting more. And while Odyssey 3 was rather lackluster, 3001 is contrived and downright juvenile in story development. Read the Epilogue from 2010 and consider that the end of the story because you will find no new revelations or answers here."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unworthy of the first three Odyssey books.","review":"Clarke should have left well enough alone. 2001, 2010, and 2061 were all fascinating stories. 3001 appears to be little more than a Clarke manifesto, full of his not-too-subtle preaching on various subjects (it's one thing for him to be a vegetarian or vegan or whatever he is; quite another to go on and on about \\"corpse food\\"). If you've completed the trilogy, leave it at that and pass this one up."},{"rating":"1","title":"Atrocious","review":"This would have to be one of the worst books I have ever read. It lacks imagination, which is the backbone of all good science fiction books. The book starts slow and is predictable all the way through. The only exception to this is to believe that dinosaurs are recreated, via cloning, to be domesticated servants.This book lacked intrigue, suspense and the dramatic finish that the initial concept of 2001 offered. The characters lack substance and the dialogue between characters was at the level of young children.Here is a typical passage: Do I detect a hint of sarcasm? Thanks to our computers, we can run political experiments in cyberspace before trying them out in practice. Lenin was unlucky: he was born a hundred years too soon. Russian communism might have worked - at least for a while- if it had microchips.Revetting stuff isn't it?This would have to be the low point in the series and I doubt whether there is a lower point for it to go."},{"rating":"1","title":"terrible","review":"This book, to put is plainly, is stupid. Once you get past a few of the interesting concepts that are discussed in the beginning, it becomes a chore to read the book. 2061, although not fantastic, was a solid conclusion to possibly the greatest science fiction epic of all time. Clarke has tarnished the series with the publication of this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing finale","review":"Bringing Frank Poole back from the dead was a good idea, but I wish Clarke had developed his character better (or at all, for that matter). Since character is not his strong point, he'd better have some damn interesting ideas, but unfortunately those are not present either. Much of the plot consists of Poole wandering from point A to point B and talking with various individuals about various subjects; this gives Clarke an opportunity to vent on selected topics, but doesn't make for interesting reading. I could forgive a slow beginning if the end came through, but Clarke inexplicably elects to reprint chapters from previous books. I didn't expect this last book to live up to the previous ones, but what a disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"A sad and bitter end to Clarke's visionary career","review":"Having grown up reading Arthur C. Clarke books, I was expecting to be challenged and intrigued anew by the genious behind 2001, Rendezvous with Rama and Songs of Distant Earth. 3001: The Final Odyssey is proof of the horrible decline in his faculties. He seems more concerned with pontificating on the wisdom of his past positions (like the Millennium falling on 2001) than on developing any new ideas. This book managed to ruin my appreciation for the earlier books in the series. I cling to the hope that Clarke is actually too infirm to write and 3001 was ghost-authored by some well-meaning but untalented assistant. As the saying goes, I am less enlightened for having read it."},{"rating":"1","title":"3001: A depressing odyssey","review":"Oh God, Arthur! Why why why! Why did you have to write this book? It was flat, unimaginative, and a complete waste of my time as a science fiction reader/fanatic. If it weren't for some basic information that led you back to the series I would have given this book one star. But I gave it two because it looked so pathetic setting next to its predecessors on my bookshelf. Thank god its over! Try the Dune series or Foundation series or Lord of the Ring series if you want true reading material."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just like 2061-totally unnecessary","review":"When I first saw the adverising for this book it said \\"what really happened to Dave Bowman and HAL, and what are those monoliths?\\". But all those things were explained in 2010, so there was no need for any more sequels.In 2061 nothing really happened, but at least it was an odyssey (because odyssey means a long journey, like the journeys in the first three books). 3001 is not an odyssey at all. Poole just hangs around on Earth most of the time, then he makes a quick travel to Jupiter's moons (which takes about two pages of the book, and therefore it's not an odyssey), and then the stupid ending takes place.All the inconsistencies and bunch of other very stupid stuff are explained by most of the other reviewers, so I'm just gonna say that just like 2061, this one is totally unnecesarry, and is obviously made just for money.Stick to the first two books, and also see the two movies. You don't need anything else."},{"rating":"1","title":"gobble gobble","review":"This turkey shouldn't have been written. Flat, stale, unprofitable to read, and with a totally lame ending that leaves the reader unsatisfied. That it was written by Arthur Clarke makes it even more disappointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Interesting but not too entertaining","review":"3001: The Final Odyssey is really a strange book. It has the general form of a novel, but it really doesn't have much of a plot. It mainly seems to be an excuse for Arthur C. Clarke to hypothesize about what life and the Earth will be like in another thousand years. Some of his ideas are very interesting, and they all seem to be firmly rooted in \\"science fact\\", but I was still kind of disappointed with this book. The characters were flat and there wasn't really a plot. I would recommend this book only for the novelty value of the futuristic settings and people. As far as novels go, it was pretty poor, and many people who read the first three books of the series will be disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Final? Odyssey","review":"I found the imagery in this book to be extremely awe inspiring. Clarke's vision of the future is a masterful one. And I like the quotes about how technology seems magical to those of the past. Reminds me of my parents. Overall however, i found the plot lacking. The explanation of Poole's return is vastly unbelievable. If you can get past that, the plot is very slow and cursory, and the ending leaves a lot to be desired. It kind of leaves you hanging out there, wondering if he's going to do another sequel, or did he just run out of ideas? If you're a fan, it's worth the read though for the imagery alone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tripe","review":"This is perhaps the biggest letdown I have ever read. The Odyssey series is one of the greatest sci-fi series of all time. But Clarke seems to have ignored all the questions of the other books to write this. The first 3/4 of the book is boring drama about how Poole adjusts to 31st century life, then the last bit rips off the ending to Independance Day (which incidentaly is completely ludicrous). Overall a big let down considering this ends the series."},{"rating":"1","title":"Competent, but for Clarke less than expected.","review":"Much of Clarke's work has made that indefinable leap into spellbinding mystical flight woven with the science of the world.This book is well crafted, but lacks mystery and never took flight from that spark of genius in the depths which Clarke has displayed in other books. Good as sci-fi goes, but way below the original 2001, \\"Childhood's End\\" or \\"The Deep Range\\", or \\"The City and the Stars\\".Some interesting ideas there. ZPF physics (which predicate the possibility of faster than light travel BTW), but the book felt kind of flat to me. It seems that Clarke's ideas have been shaped by his experience with the somewhat religiously based civil war there where he has lived."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great view of tomorrow, but poor to the series...","review":"Author Arther C. Clarke exhibits a wonderfuly vivid look into tomorrow with outstanding concepts and ideas that when really given the time to think about, make sense. However, I believe Mr. Clarke looses track of the story many times, and when he finaly gets back to the point he tries to make, he does it in a quick like gesture. Overal, a disapointing book to end the \\"Odyssy\\" series, but a marvelous look into the third millineum."},{"rating":"1","title":"3 stars for science fiction; only 1 for a logical plot.","review":"It is a millenium after the original 2001 saga that featured poorly communicative monolithic slabs of extraterrestrial technology causing havoc to an ill-fated spaceship on a voyage to Jupiter. Well, those monoliths are making trouble again. This time they are out to destroy the solar system, or at least the humans who inhabit it. But the technologically inferior humans try to outsmart their digital adversary with ancient computer viruses produced by terrorists with an adolescent mindset.

It was with great anticipation that I picked up 3001. What a major disappointment. There is very little plot and even the major characters were two-dimentional. I actually went back and read the \\"novel\\" a second time several months later hoping against hope that I had missed something the first time. It was even worse the second time around. I thought the ending of Independance Day was lame and here's the same basic idea, even though ACC claims to have not seen the movie the whole virus thing reminded me of the virus hoaxes that appear on the 'Net way too often. The whole Starchild/Halman theme seems to have been cheerfully tossed over the side and whatever happened to Floyd? I can go on and on but why bother? <sigh>"},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible Odyssey","review":"This book doesn't conclude the series at all. I got to the end, and thought, \\"This can't be the end.\\" It isn't that bad of a book, but goes nowhere, instead just mentioning predictions and techno-wiz wonders that could be in the future, but gives no explanation. You can't figure out what half of the things are, until characters use them enough it becomes obvious. There could be a lot of possible continuations of this plot, and it stopped in the middle. This is just the first half of the story! It doesn't even end, just breaks off with the future ahead. I was expecting something to happen, but it didn't. Sure, it explained everything that happened later, but that was all it was, having no plot line at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Well-Written Didactic Sermon","review":"Communism would have succeeded but for a lack of money.

I was sorely disappointed. There seemed to be a total lack of character development. I've seen better development in short stories. I only paid $4 for the paperback edition, but I do not believe it was even worth this amount. I wonder if it would have even been possible to get this one published if it had not been with Clarke as the author. If this is an indication of how his abilities have slumped in his later years, I believe that it is time for him to give up writing and take up gardening. If you are a Clarke fan, you will have to read it solely because it was written by him, but don't expect too much... Borrow the book so that you don't waste any money on it..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why Didn't Clarke Just Let Well Enough Alone","review":"2001, 2010, and 2061 were all great books. 3001 however, wasn't good enough of the title Odyssey.

It's almost impossible to think that this novel is his."},{"rating":"1","title":"Be sad, be very very sad.","review":"It was with great anticipation that I picked up the book from the library after having reserved it. I was looking forward to a typical AC Clarke novel of imagination, excellent writing, futuristic imagery, etc.(AC Clarke readers know the rest) I was shocked, disapointed, dismayed and angry. I was angry at ACC for allowing a book of this importance to be written as if a team of 12 year- olds had assembled for a writing assignment. No, I take that back, 12 year olds have more imagination than is evident in 3001. I suppose the thing that angered me the most was the writing style. It was flat, with little use of imagery, and did not evoke any emotion or wonder. I am very sad. This should have been a glorious culmination of a series. Instead it is a waste of our dwindling forest resources."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a sequel, not independent, not a good read","review":"If you are a Clarke fan, if you do not know much about computer viruses (virii?), if you like short-short chapters with not much material on them, and if you are willing to forget \\"2061: Odissey Three\\" ever existed, THEN you may like 3001.The comments regarding computer viruses are ludicrous (locking them up in a vault so they cannot infect anything? burning a robot which handled such a virus in order to disinfect him?). Forgetting all what happened in 2061 --which has become a non-entity-- is not justifiable. The link between Bowman, Hal and Floyd in order to solve the problem of Lucifer's extinction looked interesting... but it's no more. Furthermore, there is something illogical going there. Much of the novel hinges on the problems of FTL (Faster Than Light) travel and information sent out to a place 450 light years away but the Monolith was a sort of star gate which allowed FTL travel, so why the delay?"},{"rating":"1","title":"3001 - What an Odyssey Story","review":"Hmmm. Clarke is probably one of the best writers this century in any genre. However I have to ask - did he really write it or was it ghost written? I quite enjoyed the overall read but the book didn't hang together well. As for the end, I turned the page for the next chapter to be confronted by no more story! It was as if Arthur suddenly got bored and just stopped!2001 was excellent, 2010 and 2061 were both innovative and well written, this however quite frankly is very poor, and better he should have not written it than given us this. Maybe I'm too harsh, but we have come to expect from Clarke a certain imagination that allows us to believe in what he says. It's not coincidence that much of what he predicts happens as those inventors probably read Clarke as boys, and were spured on by their own imagination and Clarkes belief.Sorry but this only gets a 3 out of deference to all his past unsurpassable works."},{"rating":"1","title":"someone kill me!!!!","review":"I love Clarke, BUT this was one of the worst books I've ever read. It added nothing to the series. The characters are flat. Ofcourse this is sci-fi; that can be excused. Whtat can't is that Clarke seems to have spontaneously become scientifically ignorant and uncreative. Ex. dinosaurs reconstructed from dna are used as gardeners in the future. No, I don't mean they trim the grass by eating it; I mean they use hedgeclippers. Yes, that is really in the book. The only reason that I didn't give it a 1 is because the epilouge in which he dicusses some scientific principles is very good."},{"rating":"1","title":"PLEASE DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK!","review":"Just like another viewer, I started reading 3001 while training my Dragon voice-recognition system. I liked it, didn't love it, but was a dedicated 2001 fan, so bought it, violating my own rule about book length (it's short). There is not enough content in here for a decent screenplay, let alone a novel. No characters except the one we already knew, no real plot, dialogue, or content. Then, enjoy an additional thirty pages or so of acknowledgements BY CHAPTER! I'm sorry for bad contracting requiring another book of a designated length, but this is ridiculous! I actually have to thank the illustrious author, for giving me faith in my own writing. I have this irresistable urge to finish writing this book. It IS a good outline. I just don't normally buy works in progress.

I had such hopes after 2061, that we'd get to learn what was really going on. I can't believe in the future as foretold in 3001. Humans are far to self-important and conceited to not go after the bad guys...Stop reading now, if you're going to read the book.The ending is every bit as plausible as the Independence Day movie.

His early collections were some of the best Sci-Fi everdone.

Several of the chapters of this extremely slim volume are word-for-word lifts from the other books.If your memory is bad or this is the first work of Clarke's that you've ever picked up, then you'll probably enjoy this little read, but I'd wait until it comes out in paperback if I were you"},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad","review":"This book is almost as bad as 3001. The first 25 pages are interesting. The rest is a waste of time, especially the non-climatic climax. Clarke has written a self-serving money maker to trap into adding to the value of his estate.

I thought that they would reappear in this book but no..NO! Thay simply seemed to have disappeared. It was as if Mr. Clarke forgot to read his other books before writing 3001. The story actually does not follow the path of 2001 series and it appears as if he wrote the book just because a publisher asked him to. The life seems to be missing from the book. It definitely was a big disappointmnet to read the book and realise that the ideas postulated -- the hub around earth -- is borrowed form his previous novels. What happened to originbality. He has been the pioneer of his times and in fact the 2061 ends with the line -- Ans the monolith awaoke. At this time the monolith is supposed to be in the courtyard of the UN building ON EARTH not somewhere floating above. Simply very disappointed. Reda it if you are a ACC fan .

It's telling, not showing.Majority of the book, as many readers have brought out, is just about Frank Poole being brought up-to-date in the 31st century. The dealings with the aliens are put in for a small portion towards the end of the novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why couldn't Clark have left well enough alone?!","review":"Not much to say that hasn't already been said. 2001: A Space Odyssey (the film) should have been the beginning and final chapter in this 'saga'. The movie was a classic enigma; the 'Mona Lisa' of cinema. Each viewer left with his own interpretation of \\"what the hell was all that about'? That was the fun, the mystery, the challenge of what the Odyssey presented to the individual viewer. To have it dragged out, ad infinitum, into a Star Wars wannabe, was just sad! 2001 Is still one of my all time favorite films. I was 17 when I saw it in CINERAMA in Montreal. I'm 60 now, and have watched the movie maybe 50 times. It still leaves me with the same chills and awe that it did the first time I saw it. Too bad it got dragged the the comercialism knot-hole!

Such a great author reduced to such a low level. The book concentrates on techno stuff of the 4th Millennium and that is about it. The characters (if you could call them that) are shallow and offer nothing to this book (if you could call it a book).As Science Fiction it lacks imagination. Which is the fundamental requirement of such an area. Only a small amount of the book is devoted to why it all occurred (the answer). The way this book is written leads me to feel that a 7 year old could understand it. Words with more that two syllables are rarely used and it fails to spark the imagination or the feeling that you are involved in something marvellous. I expected some earth shattering revelation but got crap.I feel this book has now spoiled the earlier experience I had from the other books. As I said I have not read a book as bad as this for many years."},{"rating":"1","title":"Read something more worthwhile.....","review":"This book is, thank God, better than the atrocity that was 2061. There are some interesting ideas about the future - especially religion. The story is mildy entertaining, though quite uneventful. However, three quarters through this book, Clarke decides he needs to go ahead and end the series. He slaps together an extremely anticlimatic, sloppy ending, leaving you completely dumbfounded that more thought and effort wasn't put into concluding this series. Clarke's inconsistencies throughout these books were annoying as well. It seems as if each book changes or contradicts something that happened in a previous story. Bottom line - 2001 was great. 2010 was a cool addition, although not necessary. 2061 and 3001 are simply superfulous to the storyline and add little to the original masterpiece. Life is too short for such mediocre, unentertaining books."},{"rating":"1","title":"A disappointing end to a terrific series","review":"The Final Odyssey is a big disappointment. There are no original ideas, but the author treats the ideas like they are his creations. The characters are not developed at all, and are merely plot devices with names. Arthur Clarke promotes his underdeveloped religious and philosophical ideas in a way that has nothing to do with the plot. The ending is the most unrealistic and disappointing part; it leaves the reader wanting more and wondering how the author weaseled his way out of writing an ending. Read the earlier ones, but to NOT ruin your appreciation of the series by reading 3001."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book is the worst piece of writing i have read","review":"whatever u do! don't buy this book!

(Everyone had dill weed, which is not at all the same!) It's a good, high quality product, but the jar may be more than most people would use in a year or so. If you use a lot of celery seed, it's still the best price around, and I would certainly recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lovely!","review":"Good size product and as described.

Used when pickling cucumbers and am excited to have enough for many more batches to come."},{"rating":"2","title":"Satisfied Pickler","review":"I was very pleased with my order. It arrived in prompt manner and was fresh and perfect for all my pickling needs. I would recommend this company highly. Also, will be ordering more products from them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great songs, bad transcriptions","review":"The compilation of songs represented in this book is amazing - all the best of Waits's golden years, you've got to love his art. But the transcription stinks: terrible, over-simplified arrangements for piano. All the funky pieces sound lame, and the only ones that work are the few simple, originally piano-driven slow songs like Innocent When You Dream. It's a lost opportunity that the book was done this way, a talented musician with vision and style could have made good adaptations of these brilliant songs."},{"rating":"2","title":"no wating on waits","review":"The man is a barroom genius, writing the scripts for the aftermath of back alley brawls and suds soaked sentiments.

This record makes me want to change that immeditely. I bought this album on vinyl when I was rummaging through some records at a local shop. It was for $3 so I figured, what the heck?I was captivated from the first moment Max Roach starts playing on \\"The Drum Also Waltzes.\\" He creates a magnificent drum pattern in 3/4 time that almost speaks. It reminds me somewhat of listening to West African talking drums.Again, I know little of jazz, but I know talent when I hear it and I have to surmise that Max Roach is among the greatest drummers to ever tap a snare. I know that Max Roach has some records that he did with Duke Ellington. I'm itching to get those too."},{"rating":"2","title":"Guerilla Maab....Z-Ro....H-Town","review":"One of the best rap albums straight outta tha H-Town...I also recomend any of the Slow, Loud, and Bangin'(S.L.A.B.)

Unless you don't have Honey Pie already don't buy this toy! Honey Pie is perfect and the accessories are cute. However, there are only a few. There are lots of accessories on the box that don't actually come with the toy and the box doesn't list what is inside. There is a shopping cart on the box, it is not included! The hinges for the salon are small and not strong enough to hold this toy together. Move it an inch and the whole salon collapses. This is the worst toy I have ever purchased! I took it back and bought my daughter the My Little Pony \\"Twinkle Twirl's Dance Studio\\" 100% better!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Always falls apart","review":"My daughter got this today from the \\"Easter Bunny\\". Right from the start when assembling it the pieces will not stay together. Under no circumstances does this product stay assembled.

I should have bought the Fisher Price Friendship Pony stable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Someone fell asleep while designing this toy","review":"Please don't waste your money on this one. I was surprised by the inferior construction of this toy, because my daughter has the Strawberry Shortcake Home, which is well made, sturdy and we love it, but this toy is terrible. It easily and constantly falls apart. It is too difficult for my 5 year old daughter to put together herself. It can usually be found as a heap of plastic parts on the floor. The only part of this toy I can say anything nice about is the horse. I would buy the horses, but separately. Save your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stable \\"Unstable\\"","review":"I have to agree with everyone else on this one...The pony is cute, so if you can buy this for less than $10, it's worth it to buy for the pony.

Very dissappointing toy all in all!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't look at it or it will fall apart.","review":"How dissapointing!!! This toy is so cute but if you look at it wrong it falls apart.

My SSC but pass on this one unless on sale for really really cheap."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible Toy!","review":"My 4 year old daughter received this toy as a gift. This is one of the most poorly made toys I have ever seen. You can not move the stable without the entire thing falling apart and even if you try to play with it in one spot the sides fall off. The only decent part to the toy is the pony. I am close to throwing the entire stable in the trash! This toy is a total waste of money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buy a tube of glue","review":"Like everyone else my daughter keeps coming to me to put this back together. It is almost worthless as a stable. We too are going to glue it all together at least until it get chucked in the garbage (predicted to be soon). The horses on the other hand are great for preschoolers because they are pretty sturdy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy this toy","review":"This toy is cute but not sturdy at all. My 4 year old asked that I glue the stable together so that it would quit falling apart. As much as I love Strawberry Shortcake, I would not recommend this toy.

It would be more durable!"},{"rating":"1","title":"great idea, horrible execution","review":"I bought this toy for my five year old daughter.

I paid $5.29 with free shipping - at least I got Honey Pie pony with it. This is the only item that is worth buying! The rest of the stable - cheaply made, thin plastic pieces that don't stay together. Please, read the comments - so many people can not be all wrong! Cheply made! Shame!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Super Glue to the rescue!","review":"I agree with the other reviews that the stable is fairly poorly made. However, I got some superglue and glued along the seams of the stable parts that are supposed to stay together permanently. We haven't had a problem with it since! Honey Pie Pony is adorable, and the set comes with lots of little pieces to groom her mane and tail. The stable will hold around four horses, if you happen to own more than Honey Pie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fun toy but not durable","review":"This toy was a great gift for my daughter on her 5th birthday. However, the stable was difficult to keep together and it kept falling apart when she tried to set it up and play with it.

Trash","review":"I threw the stable and acc. away after days of trying to put together for my girls. It is trash! The pony is cute and my girls do play with it but not worth your money.

Literally!","review":"I purchased this last fall for around $35.00...it sat in a pile in my daughters closet until she finally asked if she could throw it away last month....she's 6 years old. She loves ponies and SSC, but this is just junk. I can't even rate this toy a 1 star but thats as low as they would let me go because it is just that bad!

Also there are tons of tiny pieces that are impossible to keep track of, and they don't fit anyway."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing Playset","review":"It comes with a nice pony that Strawberry and her friends can sit astride, but the other props are paper or cheap plastic. The stable isn't even a nice \\"set\\" to place in front of because it is rickety and does not find together.

It's a wonderful pony for your Strawberry shortcake dolls. UNFORTUNATELY this stable is the pits! I never got it \\"put together\\", because it doesn't STAY put together. Too many of the pieces move. The floor of the stable is in two parts, the walls are two parts. There is some kind of yellow trim piece that supposedly holds the walls together when closed, but it never fits right. There is a fence at one end that won't stay on. This needs to be re-assembled each time you pick it up. JUST BUY THE PONIES SEPARATELY, and you'll be a lot better off. They are really the quality item in this deal."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Worth the money","review":"My daughter likes it so I am not returning it but this is really cheaply made and I am about to take my tube of super glue to it to see if it can be salvaged.

My daughter is addicted to Strawberry Shortcake and I searched to find it for Christmas. I wish I had never found it. When we set it up it was cute. Five minutes later I must have helped my daughter put it back together at least 3 times. I thought \\"OK I did something wrong\\"So after the 3rd try I realized this is just a really cheaply made toy. My daughter now just leaves it in one spot and doesn't open and close it.

The minute you place your finger on the stable it come tumbling down. Nothing stays together. The horse is about the only thing that is durable. Thank God I only spent $9.00 on it and not $20.00.

Slapping together a countdown timer with an annoying belch sound then threatening to sue the people providing all the superior products, obviously. To call this abomination a power hour is an insult to every college drinker, wide-eyed buzz seeker, and life-long alcoholic who has pounded six beers in an hour hoping to save some cash at the bar. It is the New Coke of drinking games: This power hour takes an existing brand, savagely twists it into a broken, hollow version of its former glory, then callously insults you for not appreciating the so called \\"improvements\\" that have been rendered. The point here: This is an awful product. Devote a few minutes of your time to Google searching and you'll find a slew of more entertaining options that are offered up free of charge."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is trash","review":"My friend purchased this item and invited us over to play it. I found this product to be so abhorrent, so badly produced, and such a rip-off that I felt compelled to write a review.

This product is garbage. This product is as much of a game as an epileptic third grader that happens to have a seizure every sixty seconds: Sure, you can drink to both, but neither are really any fun. (Although, there is always the slight possibility that the third grader will wake up and spill profanities out of his mouth, which would be funny. Sadly, this \\"game\\" doesn't really have any hope for ever being humorous.There's infinitely better products out there. (Try [...] for example.)

It's basically a bad powerpoint with a timer. You won't just be disappointed, you'll be furious.Sidenote: I was so disgusted with this game that I came back to Amazon to see what kind of person would give it a positive review.

I agree with the previous review - just Google Power Hour and find more sites than you know what to do with that are FREE and immeasurably better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Manages to make drinking with your friends seem like a chore","review":"Really, really, really, really, really, really, really bad. Sucks the fun out of drinking entirely, as you're forced to watch a timer on a screen while you and your friends wonder in awkward silence what else you could be doing with your lives.

Even if I were to forget about the terrible quality, the lack of music, the bad sound quality, etc. It would still be terrible. It is a timer with burp sounds. The man who made this must be mentally challenged, or at least seriously drunk when he made this product, for it may be the worst product ever made. This product single handedly turned me into binge drinking, as after using this terrible product I went into my room and drank a bottle of whiskey, since it killed my faith in in humanity.

I can safely say this is not how power hour is played. This product is as one reviewer stated, essentially a power point presentation with a burp sound. The two 5 star reviews are from Steve Roose (creator) and another gentleman who I suspect is a friend of Mr. Roose. Power hour is about having 60 songs that play for one minute each and taking a shot of beer; not a silent power point presentation. If I were to use this to pregame as the other reviewer suggested, I'm sure my friends would laugh at me for trying to get them to drink to some slides. If Amazon would allow zero or negative stars, this would be one of those products that warrants it.

It looks like the editor didn't proof read that section at all. Luckily, all the spells are there. The rest of the book is just fine.But my reason for a 1 star is that:You make a mistake in what building you bought and it cost you a few hours and gold.

No promises were asked or made as to what I would say about it. My basic problem with the story is that the characters are not fleshed out very well. We find them already formed, already bent on trying to introduce PeaceMaker to the computers of the world or prevent it from happening, depending on the character. The character of Dianne is far too manic in her mood swings to be believeable, just for starters. Her motivation is said to be the humiliation she received when held in contempt by the court at the anti-trust trial involving her computer company. If so, her reaction is extreme and otherwise unexplained. The book reads more like the outline of a larger book in which there is an interesting story to tell if done right.

It is preceded by experimental modelling of linguistic knowledge based on rewriting rules and the resulting conclusion of the need for transformations and is followed by new innovating ideas on restricting the power of transformations. We already see the deep thinking that went into the development of the next stage. He discusses the idea of 'singulary transformations' which the individual transformations were, then, composed of and which later developed into Move-alpha, Delete-alpha, etc. He argues very persuasively for a separate 'lexicon' and the kind of information we should expect to find there. Overall, it is rich with seeds that later developed into the ideas comprising the 'principles and parameters' theory. And most importantly, it gives the shrewd and disciplined argumentation, which became a standard of Chomsky's later works and generative grammar in general."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not such a good read...and not out of spite.","review":"As a Ph.D. student in linguistics I had to read a lot of classic books in the field.

I haven't been able to stop listening to it since. It reminds me tremendously of Wilco's \\"Yankee Hotel Foxtrot\\" in that it's one of those CDs that a lot of people just don't believe in for some strange reason that I can't ever possibly understand. I, personally, find this an intensely beautiful, intriguingly complex, \\"I can listen to this forever\\" type of album. \\"You're the Storm\\" is just tremendous. I like to tap my foot to \\"Live and Learn\\" and \\"For What It's Worth.\\" I don't know what people are expecting from The Cardigans, I really don't.

Everything I love about the Cardigans sort of slipped away with Gran Turismo, and now the magic is truly gone. I even bought the \\"A Camp\\" CD and it kinda grew on me, but I'd rather have the money back from re-selling this CD than the music on it.The bouncy, happy-yet sometimes beautifully wistful music found on their first three CDs was like aural Prozac to me ... if I ever felt sad or depressed or whatever, Nina Persson and company could medicate me with a few good doses of joy. In addition, \\"Other Side of the Moon\\" is so awesome that no real Cardigans collection can be considered complete without it ... but that's where I drew the line. \\"Gran Turismo\\" was marginally terrible, and now this \\"Long Gone\\" nonsense.Sure the band has a right to change ... but I don't have to accept it and change with it.

The only word to describe this album is: bland. It seems so completely uninspired for a band that is incredibly original. But there's still hope. The bands new album: SUPER EXTRA GRAVITY, which was just released in the UK, is a step in the right direction. They are back to writing densely layered pop compositions. THANK GOD. I thought we lost them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Surprisingly good","review":"I was never a fan of The Cardigans until they got a bit noisier on Gran Turismo. I thought \\"Lovefool\\" obnoxious and considered The Cardigans too \\"bubblegum\\" for their own good (although, I've always had respect for the guitarist). On Long Gone Before Daylight, The Cardigans seem to be taking another direction entirely. Branching out into a mellower, more sophisticated (mature? palatable?) realm of the pop world, they've put together an album surprisingly consistent and pleasant. There is nothing groundbreaking or extremely original but instead it is a collection of solid songwriting and catchy hooks amounting to what I consider their best work. If The Cardigans continue their rapid growth, they could very well become a yard stick by which modern pop-rock bands are measured."},{"rating":"1","title":"warmed-over Fleetwood Mac","review":"This record is a real disappointment, a banal collection of slow, mopey snoozers with none of the wit, sparkle, elegance and sonic delights of their previous releases. The Arctic-circle depression that pervaded \\"Gran Turismo\\" has morphed into a plodding, somnambulent world-weariness, minus the cool beats. Nina's voice is as gorgeous as ever, but the other players seem to be sleepwalking through their parts -- this just doesn't sound like a Cardigans record. Maybe Sheryl Crow's backup band, or Fleetwood Mac warming up while Stevie Nicks' Hummer limo is stuck in traffic. Is this the same band that turned disco on its head with \\"Lovefool\\" and retooled \\"Iron Man\\" into a sexy torch song? Sure doesn't sound like it."},{"rating":"1","title":"You can't repeat the past","review":"I was a huge fan of the first five albums of the Cardigans. A couple years after Gran Turismo came out, I gave up hope of another album ever coming out. So, I was delighted with news of Long Gone Before Daylight. Unfortunately, I just cannot connect to the new sound on this album. The vitality of the other albums is missing. The lyrics are great on these songs, but the music just cannot pull me in... My favorite song on the album is A Good Horse, though it breaks my heart that I can't say anything good about the other songs. Ah well.

I count myself lucky to have had the extra months to myself of the album before its stateside debut. This album is lyrically and melodically genius. I don't understand exactly why and how Sweden, a country of 8 million, produces music so prophetically. But, they do, and often exceptionally well. If you like this, there is another great Swedish pop-folk group called Gloria (www.gloriasays.com). And there is a wealth of music that will never make it to the States such as the most cathartic music I know of by Swedish song singer and writer Eva Dahlgren. I believe \\"And Then You Kissed Me\\" is the best song. \\"No Sleep\\" is so sparsely beautiful as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"THIS ALBUM BLEW ME AWAY","review":"This album is a break from their earlier bubblegum stuff and from Gran Turismo's electronic sound.

Probably one of the best albums of this year for me, right up there with kanye west."},{"rating":"1","title":"Antik","review":"This is a OK shoe. But not for the price...

I have to say that while Manson himself might be great with concepts and lyrics, his musical abilities are non-existant. If you look in the CD cover, you will notice that Twiggy wrote nearly all the songs, and now that he is gone, the music is empty. If you are a fan of Mechanical Animals, you will feel the songs, they are full of emotion and depth - MA, Great big white world, speed of pain, fundamentally loathesome... those songs all have something which this album doesnt - sure the CD is not unbearable and one can still listen to the songs, but it really is a waste of time... if you want to buy your first Manson CD, get M.A."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poseur","review":"Buy any album by Skinny Puppy if you're looking for a message delivered with power, sans the gimmicks."},{"rating":"1","title":"Please go away.","review":"Marilyn Manson is like a joke that's not funny anymore.

I don't know what happened here... Golden Age is just an absolute disaster... Marilyn Manson used to say these brilliant things that resented other things people said about him and now it seems he is just trying to fit this 'o, i'm evil, i'm evil' label people have thrown on him.

The lyrics are really cool. Like in (s)AINT \\"I've got an F and a C and i got a K to and the only thing that's missin is a bitch like U!\\" is very catchy. This album couldn't get any better!

One of the guests was an aspiring songwriter named Charles (you can call me Chuck) Manson. A good time was had by all, although Chuck did make some mention about how empty the walls all looked...Fast-forward to today: Marilyn Manson lives. Parents are afraid of him and their kids love him. Personally, I didn't think I would like his music, until I heard this album. Witty and rythmic, he made a believer out of me.Of course, if you're reading this, you probably know exactly how good this album is. But if you are just looking for a recommendation... this album rocks. And as for the christian dude... Bush sucks.Put THAT in your pipe and smoke it...(Buy this album. I promise you will love it)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Golden Age Of Disapointment","review":"I don't know what Manson was thinking! He fires Twiggy, Hires Tim Skold, and you get this? When you think of Manson you think of shocking lyrics, and music that makes you feel like youre in hell, but you like it. GOAG is not as harsh sounding as Manson claimed, saying: \\"it's like being kicked in the balls with a brick tied to a shoe\\". In my opinion it's like when my little sister throws a grape at me. Not saying it's a bad album, but as a Manson album it sucks."},{"rating":"2","title":"matt c","review":"I'm still waiting for manson to write a song that will compare to 'the beutiful people'...this album hasn't done that. however, for the most part, its pretty good.

Every album usually had something that drew you in to engage your senses. Now hearing the whole album, I felt he took all the annoying cliches from his predecessors, tossed it into a bag, shook it, spilled it out, and called it the golden age of grotesque. Nobody cares about his senseless rambiling about the media anymore, i was let down when I heard the new single. A couple tracks had some interesting segments, but for every good chorus a song had there was a lacking verse, etc.....pretty boring stuff if you ask me. Overall it almost seems like Mansion didn't put his all into this and instead the cookie cutter album seemed like it was attempting to reach out to an audience that has moved on."},{"rating":"2","title":"Highs and lows, all around above average.","review":"I haven't read any other reviews about this album, and I have listened to it a time or three so this is just my opinion: This disk starts off quite good. It seems to be more up beat and faster moving than the last album. It has a bunch of songs that have a very catchy chorus. mOBSENE is an example of this. The end of the album seems to slow down a bit with a few of the songs seeming to be a anthem to love lost (Rose McGowan?). Some of the songs degrade to a out \\"I'm better than you\\", \\"I'm a big rock star\\" ego fest. But if that is what is on your mind you might as well sing about it. This is a great album, I would recomend it but it is not as harsh and dark as some of Manson's better works."},{"rating":"2","title":"marilyn makes a come back into the world of real rock","review":"First off this cd is better then i could have hoped for. I was a really big fan of twiggy and still am but new bassist tim skold manages to pull it off adding new value to the band. Every track on the album has something new to offer if u really dive deep enough into it. It isnt his best work but nothing can really compare to 1996's antichrist superstar. SO if you are a fan of the man or arch daddy danda you should pick this up in a hurry. This album is even worth buying just for a few tracks even tracks 6 through 10 are just so incredibl you will fall in love with them as soon as you here them so pick this album up."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not Mansons best, but still good music","review":"I bought this album the day it came out. i listen to all kinds of music, but for manson, hes not for every one. he is really an eye opener, but i like him. so i own most of his albums, this is a good ablum, but i still think hes best was Holywood. You can listen to that whole album without skippimg any tracks. but this one dosent have as much energy as most of his others. But hes always changing his image, and does it very well. so i give him major credit. My favortive tracks are \\"This is the new ....\\" and \\"The Golden Age Of Grotesque\\". Hes a very dark man, and carrys that image very well, and continues it in this ablum.But if your a Manson Fan, then you should buy this ablum for sure."},{"rating":"2","title":"new, strange, lively, unique","review":"Strangely manson, very different, this album bursts with life and imagination not usually associated with the band. Yes, we always agree they've got \\"imagination\\" but not like this. this album is a strange trip into a very strange, but addictively entertaining world. True, not all the songs are marvelous, but some of they are really great, and it's just a matter of taste.Now, about the dvd. After watching it the first time, most people will be left with three words WTF? It's amazing, but you have to understand I enjoy things that make no sense to me. The dvd makes very little sense as a whole, but some of the things that occur are humerously sensical, and very strange. Imagine some one saying someone that makes so much sense that they've never had the nerve to say it before, and so, never did it.That's Marilyn Manson, this is the Golden Age of Grotesque"},{"rating":"2","title":"Greatest Manson Album So Far!!!!!!!","review":"This by far is the best Manson Album yet! I own all his stuff, and this has to be the greatest mix of Heavy guitar, mixed with wonderful and poetic lyrics. The lyrics are a combination of wonderfully thought of words and also meaningfull boasts towards those who apose. If you are a Manson fan, or just looking for a kick[in] Heavy Metal CD to buy, i'd get this. I don't know if the DVD makes a difference, but if you can get it cheaper without the DVD, i'd do it.

Just my opinion though."},{"rating":"1","title":"Easily Mansons worst.","review":"Well Manson had been putting out good music for a few years now so you just knew it was coming.

But, hey to each it's own it's just my opinion after hearing this album it didn't as many others have said even really sound like Manson it sounded like a different person. I'm sure every artist gets curious in trying something different which looks like he is trying to do. Tried it, didn't work well now let's get back with the OLD MANSON!

First the new style, then firing Twiggy. This guy is never short of shocks. Any decent Manson fan knows that it was the girlish Twiggy who gave the band their more traditional punk rock sound. Now that he's gone, only John 5 and Ginger Fish provide memories of what was once the REAL golden age of Manson's grotesqueness. But looking at the positive side of the album, New S**t and Slutgarden are the only songs worth listening to more than once. And what the hell is the deal with Kaboom Kaboom???!!! I can't believe that this is what they're coming to now. He should just stick to playing with dildoes and raping sheep instead of screwing over best friends. To conclude, don't buy this album, just download New S**t and Slutgarden. You should own Mechanical Animals and Holywood if you like this kind of music. This is a sad era for Mansonites."},{"rating":"1","title":"why marilyn why??","review":"ok in a small amount of words. this is garbage. i dont know what the hell manson was thinking. without twiggy how did he expect to put out a GOOD album. didnt work. \\"slutgarden\\" is the only worthy track listening to. \\"saint\\" is a moronic pop song with goes..\\" hold the S cause i am an AINT\\" dumb dumb dumb. dont buy it unless your paying the 3 bucks for it used."},{"rating":"2","title":"Oh Yeah","review":"It was supposed to be like Psychotica from the beginning of Brian Warner's music career fronting fake Christian death metal bands, but his fans just didn't get the joke.

I'm going to be selling mine on [the web] very soon...what a shame. From one song to another it all sounds the same, and that's \\"not a good thing\\". I agree with another reviewer, it's only a matter of time before Manson splits. Jeordie was smart and got out while he could.

I am a very big fan of previous Albums such as Anti-christ SuperstarMechanical AnimalsHolywoodEtc. etc.Manson has outdone himself this time, but not in the way any of us had hoped. He has completely tarnished his god forsaken nature and just obliterated his reputation with ONE album. its amazing that a multi-million superstar such as himself would actually release this low grade album on poor unsuspecting fans. I am more than by far disappointed with this lousy CD. Manson fans, my opinion is that you should stick to the older albums.

Yes there is a certain degree of repetivity, and songs \\"This is the New S***\\" (featured on The Matrix Reloaded soundtrack) and \\"Better of Two Evils\\" aren't anything special; but this is undoubtadly one of Manson's best albums with enough industrial laced metal tunage one can't help but headbang to. \\"mOBSCENE\\", \\"Doll-Dagga Buzz-Buzz Ziggety-Zag\\", the title track, \\"Ka-Boom, Ka-Boom\\", and \\"The Bright Young Things\\" are solid rockers that proudly carry the Manson banner, and despite what others are saying about this album (just like with \\"Holy Wood\\"), \\"The Golden Age of Grotesque\\" is another exercise in shock value for Mr. Manson and crew; and is definitely more than worth listening to."},{"rating":"1","title":"Manson Tries Again","review":"Not since Anti-Christ Superstar has Marilyn Manson released a record with anything close to resembling merit. While Mechanical Animals had its positive moments, it marked the steady path of decline that Manson and his team of goons have careened down without looking back.Now in The Golden Age of the Grotesque Manson returns to bite us...with another pathetic and abortive stab at validity. It seems that the further this man goes to try and be off the mark, the more horrible his creative attempts become. One interesting and comical moment on the record is when Manson attempts to rap, obviously buying into the rap-rock bull that has pervaded decent music since the post-Korn revolution.My advice, pass this one by. Better luck next time Manson."},{"rating":"1","title":"Quit While You're Ahead","review":"Marilyn Manson probably should have quit music after his crowning achievement, Antichrist Superstar. At least that way the Mechanical Animals embarassment would never happened. Golden Age of Grotesque is proof that Manson at the very least should have called it quits after Holy Wood. Everything here is derivative, not just of Manson's past music but the themes of other performers today. It's pretty obvious that this is the artist wallowing in his self-magnificence and nothing to please the fans who have put Manson where he is today. Buy it if you have a compulsion to own every Manson recording, but even then I'd get it used. Of course, this album sounds like it's been pretty used already, and not in a fun way."},{"rating":"2","title":"BRINGING BACK THE ROCK!!!","review":"Marilyn Manson starts out hard and continues to rock with his latest album! This is the New [stuff] is only the beginning of yet, another, great Manson album. Mobscene was another cool tune, also the single. Although, I wasn't sure whether I liked it or not, it doesn't become quickly catchy and not in the usual commercial way of most songs. With the exception of a few songs, I pretty like them all. I must admit that Holywood I was somewhat disappointed, after all the hype. I didn't know what to expect after hearing this was his best album yet. Now, I do. Golden Age [is great]! Oh ya and it came with a free dvd film from Manson that scared the hell out of me. It was the strangest stuff I've ever seen. I wanted to complain but it was free, plus the album made up for the dvd making me sleepy, entranced with subliminal messages and scared all at the same time. As for the cd buy it and crank up the tunes! If you got a decent stereo you won't regret it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"THE WAIT IS OVER!!!... MANSON IS BACK!!!...","review":"I have been waiting anxiously for this CD to arrive for a long, long time, and I have to say it was well worth the wait. The Golden Age of Grotesque is definetly worth buying for any true Manson fan. Once again, Manson takes us on an incredible music journey, only this time, it's a lot more unique and extremely interesting. The Golden Age of Grotesque welcomes you to explore the exotic sexually-drenched dream world of our star, Manson himself. Oh, yeah, the music, the vocals, and the lyrics are very well done and quite interesting. Of course, this thing is loaded with expicit lyrics, but mature music fans should get a kick out of it. Manson is back & better than ever. I highly recommend this CD. Even if you're not a big Marilyn Manson fan, you still ought to give this CD a try. You might just like it. I bought it today at the mall, and it was incredible."},{"rating":"1","title":"A sad day for manson fans","review":"I was extremely disappointed. Everyone knows that manson has been going down hill since Mechanical Animals, but at least that CD was tolerable with classic songs like Coma White, The Dope Show, and Rock is Dead. Not to mention the unforgettable love song The Last Day on Earth, how many of us titled that \\"our\\" song. The image change was okay as long as the music was still good. Then came Holywood which was even less tolerable but at least it had meaning and lyrics that some of us could relate to like A Place in the Dirt, The Nobodies, etcetera. I still cannot figure out what Manson is trying to say to us with this CD, the lyrics are ridiculous, and there's no TWIGGY! The only song that I think is even remotely good is slutgarden, it's tune is a little catchy. I wish Manson hadn't changed. He needs to grow out his hair, put on a red and white stripped top hat, and start making beautiful music again because this SUCKS."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yea... Whatever...","review":"If you are a industrial rock fan and you own this album, you should be ashamed. This album isn't worth [...] to most industrial music. It's missing the complete vibe with syths and keyboards.Manson needs to get back to the old days when he was edgey and sick. ACS and PoaAF were by far his most poetic and incredible albums. This sounded like something a random kid with a computer made up the syths and added to screaming and bad guitar playing. (Which is still better than most bands.) In short this album wasn't worth a 3 year wait. Get back to what you know Manson!"},{"rating":"1","title":"?????????????????????????","review":"I have mixed emotions about Marilyn Manson's latest album. He has seemingly gone a completely different direction with his music. I honestly don't know what to think about this one. All I can say is that you may have to base your judgement on how big of a fan you are to him and how open minded you are about music."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Return of the God of Fck","review":"3.5 StarsWhile there is nothing terribly new about this album, but it def. is one Mr. Manson's better works. The pretentiousness of his last couple releases seems to be gone and it's like he's making music because it's who he is and what he does. It def. seems like he was having fun (eek) making this record. Skold is also a very welcome addtion to the group.My complaints regarding this work are:1. There is a lack of vocal variation. Manson's voice sounds the same on all the track.2. The live drumming on the album was not up to par with previous releases. Ginger Fish is one of the better drummers out there, but on this album his drums are either very plain or so far burried in the mix that you can't even tell what's going on.The bonus DVD is OUTSTANDING."},{"rating":"2","title":"No bad but not the best","review":"It's could be a good release but not gor MM.He are able to do more.This album is directed to american people before.American drive without realy strong lyrics.Quite commercial things, but It has some brilliant songs as a GAOG song.I just can't get enough a little Twiggys' guitars riffs.Sound is changed( more indastrial samples like NIN,Rammstein-Scold.....)Anyway it's good that Manson try to find another ideas in everithing.Hollywood is best at the moment"},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible","review":"Marilyn Manson's worst CD yet. I really don't like the whole industrial rock scene. Tim Skold has little to nothing talent. Too bad Twiggy left, he may have made this CD worth listening to. Although, Use Your Fist and Not Your Mouth sounded pretty good in concert. This CD needed a better bass player, Some good solo's, and Marilyn's old touch."},{"rating":"2","title":"At least he's picked a gender... I think","review":"I admit that, some years back, when Manson first made his presence known to listiners I was facinated with his bands image and many of their songs.But that intrest quickly died after Antichrist Superstar, when Mechanical Animals hit shelves.At first I was weary of this album. Mechinical Animals having turned me off to Manson's more recent tracks. But after listining to a few small bits of various tracks off this CD I thought it good enough to buy.This albums feel is, as other reviewers have said, reminicent of Alice Cooper's works. But where Cooper did much of his stunts for sheer shock value, Manson himself states on one of the tracks that this is his life we're viewing."},{"rating":"2","title":"My favorite Manson of all Time","review":"I have all eight of his CD's, This is the best. Must buy, but if you already have buy Hollywood also by Manson cause it is his second best."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where have I Heard this Before","review":"Now I've been listening to Marilyn Manson since i first heard the song 'Get YouR Gunn' wayyyyyyyy back in late '94, and I gotta tell ya...HIS SHTICK IS GETTING OLD FAST!!! I'm sure that if it wasn't for 'Mechanical Animals' that we would have all been sick of this by now. Their's alot to be said about trying out new things, and I know it didn't exactly far well overall, but as the old saying goes, 'if at first you don't succeed, try again.' Please Marilyn, try something different, for god's sake, even Metallica experiments."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT IMPRESSIVE!!!","review":"okay, I had been waiting for a while for Manson to release a new album. The anticipation was killing me. But needless to say, as soon as I listened to the c.d. once, I was devastated. For me, Manson has been an inspiration. Everything he puts in his songs have meaning, emotion, and an addictive vibe that makes you want to keep listening. He has done a lot to change his appearance over the years, but he has still found ways to top himself. This album is everything that classic Manson is NOT. Most of the songs just sound like he's out of ideas and just making up stuff. For example: Doll Digga Buzz Buzz Ziggity Zag is a very fast paced, heavy song. But the lyrics are just too goofy and childish to be Marilyn Manson. If you are buying this album expecting \\"Anti-christ Superstar\\" or \\"Mechanical Animals\\" type content, DO NOT BUY THIS!!! But if you are ready to hear the once named \\"American Antichrist\\" sing about sappy, kiddy, meaningless crap... feel free to waste your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Avid manson fan.","review":"Up untill the release of this album I was an avid manson fan, even repecting all early spooky kids work and all songs off smells like children etc. But when i read reviews saying 'It will grow on you' etc i am sadened. Why should an album from such an artist grow on you? It should grip you from the first song and leave you begging for more when the cd stops. Manson has gone from such a down and dirty lyrical genius into a mockery icon who appears on top of the pops. With lyrics such as 'i like a big car, cus i'm a big star' and the women singing be obscene like he wants children to be nasty to each other. [He] has lost his controvesial edge and has become yet another dying age of music."},{"rating":"2","title":"give me a break!!!","review":"Now some dedicated MM fans say wow this is less metal & little goth this sucks!! its more rock & a new style now i don't have time to review every song but this is another masterpiece like every Manson album Mr. Warner A.K.A. marilyn manson thank you for making masterpiece after masterpiece.\\" I don't say to be like me, i say to be like you and to make a difference.\\" - Marilyn manson"},{"rating":"1","title":"THE BEAUTIFUL PEOPLE DESTROY THEIR STEEPLE","review":"Marilyn Manson should get into film making.His themes and imagery are mind blowing especially on this latest album.For that reason it gets a star.It is his best art work yet!However his music has reached a dead end.This album is his last two albums revisited.It is less melodic but the dynamics are the same as is the vocal delivery.Lyrically there are some clever ideas but it borders on contrivance.Although Bowie has covered the Berlin period and the flirtations with Nazism MM takes it to another level but still, special effects and creative production can not disguise sub standard songwriting.Music should essentially be about good songs.Theatrics are secondary.Give me Torniquet,Coma white or The Nobodies any day."},{"rating":"1","title":"The album title is right","review":"I even heard about somebody naming their hamster after Marilyn Manson. But the trouble is they believe it's sqeaking wheel sounds better than this pile of trash!

Manson and Skold have crafted a fresh sound. Not as dark and introspective as the previous efforts, this album's strength stems from its catchiness and accessibility. The absence of Twiggy Ramirez is quite apparent, but that's not necessarily a bad thing. The techno/rock influeces that Skold brings to the fold are a welcome change."},{"rating":"1","title":"I don't think I've heard anything worse in my life...","review":"OK, I've loved Marilyn Manson forever... Portrait, Smells Like Children, Antichrist, Mechanical Animals, Holy Wood... love them all, but this... this thing... I don't know how one would even go about calling it 'music.' I don't know what happened here at all... They used to be absolute briliance and Manson would say something that would defy what people said about him, but now it seems like he's trying to fit this 'I'm evil, I'm evil' label people have thrown on him and teh band has just turned to crap... this album is a very sad day for the music world..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely Amazing!!!!!","review":"I have heard more rock, death metal, alternative music in my life, but this one tops all of them. This is the most amazing Marilyn Manson production I have ever heard. The new sound shows more creativity, and is extremely impressive.

Some of the great songs are, This is the new sh*t, (s)AINT, Vodevil.

It's not horrible either. It's just boring. It's obvious that Manson has not been inspired after \\"Antichrist Superstar\\", and with \\"The Golden Age Of Grotesque\\" it's clear that he has run out of ideas. \\"This Is The New Shxt\\" sounds like something a 12 year old Slipknot fan would write in his diary. And the lyrics in \\"s(AINT)\\" sounds like he's been hanging out too much with his buddy Eminem...\\"What's my name? What's my name?\\". The worst part is that he isn't even shocking anymore.Marilyn Manson: The Shock-less Rock StarNow all I am waiting for is Marilyn Manson to show up right next to Alice Cooper playing golf on VH1 specials."},{"rating":"1","title":"O Manson, where art thou?","review":"When I heard Manson's previous album, Holy Wood, I started to get the feeling that the \\"Marilyn Manson\\" formula had set in, and it was nothing more than a rehash of the brilliance he showed on Anitchrist Superstar.I hoped I was wrong, however The Golden Age of Grotesque only confirmed what I was thinking. It seems as if the energy and originality Manson once exuded has reached its peak. Now he's at the plateau, and I fear there is no redemption to come from him. I do like the pictures in the liner notes, even though there also nothing entirely new from them (however, I'll give them a star). For me, the sad truth is Marilyn has hopelessly fallen into the \\"Evil Rock Guy\\" shtick. He wants people to fear him for his devilish persona, but all I'm afraid of is his predictability."},{"rating":"2","title":"If I could give this 10 stars I would!","review":"Very impressive, I have been listening to Manson for a long time and now two of their albums are my favorites. This one and 'Mechanical Animals'. Definitely has a very German feel to it. I have to say I liked every song on the album.Favorites: 'Para-noir','Ka-Boom Ka-Boom','Vodevil','Doll-Dagga Buzz-Buzz Ziggety-Zag','Spade' and 'The Golden Age of Grotesque'. This album is artistic, hard hitting and just plain interesting. I have to give it a high rating because it was awesome! It kind of takes you into a wicked underground direction as well. I have listend to this band ever since the first album and they have definitely matured in thier sound."},{"rating":"2","title":"Manson is Smoken'","review":"well, i have heard alot of MM's music[very good indeed!] and i feel that this record is very powerful musically. the only problem that prevented a perfect rating was the fact that alot of the tracks had somewhat rediculous lyrics. i find that disappointing becuase MM had always been such a brilliant writer. he really could have put more meaning in the songs but, than again the sound is always the most critical part. by the way, i found that if your new to Manson, THIS is the place to start. alot of the songs are very catchy, fast-paced, and easy to get in to. anywase, i am looking forward to the next album very much.8/10"},{"rating":"2","title":"not too bad, kinda good actually","review":"I have been avoiding this album ever sinse it came out even tho I own every single cd Manson has put out. I have been missing out. I decided to bite the bullet and buy this cd just to complete my collection and this cd is actually pretty good.

At least Gene Simmons doesn't take himself so seriously."},{"rating":"1","title":"Marilyn Manson has left the building","review":"Manson's new album GAOG lacks a lot of things, originality, emotion, things that used to be part of their music. Personally Holywood (In The Shadow Of The Valley Of Death) was a much better album, even though fans and critics alike considered it a disappointment. Manson's musical roots are no longer present, due to the departure of longtime bassist and songwriter Twiggy Ramirez. In my opinion the band will not last much longer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Marilyn is Back!","review":"Marilyn is Back! I think these cd is great, I enjoyed the \\"Holywood\\" cd but these one feels more like manson to me, I think this cd is a mix between Antichrist and Mechanical Animals.

I think that true fans will enjoy this cd."},{"rating":"2","title":"...","review":"not as good as his other albums, but this is still great. manson always changes, and sometimes change isn't as good as what was before-hand, but this is still an awesome cd."},{"rating":"1","title":"1 star for 1 good song on entire cd -mobscene-","review":"i was very disappointed with this cd, mobscene is a good tune but the other songs are just lame. manson needs to work more on the music and less on make-up and costumes.the bonus dvd is no bonus to watch, very boring and repetitive i was hoping for something alot better. all of manson's music before this cd is great , i own all of them , buy those to hear the best of manson."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is worth the cash","review":"CDs now a days are big bucks... probably most of you will download this album off the internet and join the revolution. But these songs, however you get it, are worth it. The songs are different than other albums released by Manson but The Golden Age of Grotesque has new songs in a good way. Each song is catchy and has a different kind of sound to it with Marilyn Manson's mood still screaming through the noise. This Is The New S**t is my favorite, while mOBSCENE and The Better of Two Evils are songs I will never get tired of. For the new Manson fan, I'd get Mechanical Animals first because it hooks you on to Gothic Style of Manson quicker. Anyone looking for a album to love forever should get this."},{"rating":"1","title":"ZZZZZZZZ.........save your money","review":"Worse than Holy Wood, this is the lamest Manson effort yet. The generic sound of each track with it's Verse-Chorus(bring in the distorted guitars and crash cymbal)-Verse formula is exceptionally annoying. And the lyrics are, for the most part rediculous. Most choruses seem forced: 'hold the 's' because I am an ain't' ??'we're five middle fingers on a ...hand' ??LameThe title track is fantastic and there are a couple of good songs but for the most part Marilyn Manson seems to need acceptance, singles, and a wardrobe more than he wants to explore being an musician and daring to do something a little musically different. Mind you, this is better than most [stuff] out there but I expected much more than juvenile Linkin-Park-esque jank..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Generic and disappointing.","review":"I STILL love all three of the last Manson albums, and was really hoping this would be a culmination effort, what with new member Tim Skold (supposedly) reinvigorating the recording and creation process. Instead, this is plain BORING! Listen to the music underneath and imagine it without vocals. In almost every song I could hear this being another in a long line of industrial nu-metal bands that all sound the same. Sadly, we now add the name Marilyn Manson to that group. I guess the loss of Twiggy Ramirez is more pronounced than anybody would have thought. Outside of \\"Mobscene\\" and \\"Ka-Boom\\" rocking like the Manson of yore, there's nothing here I haven't heard too many times before.

This album is to me just an uninspired version of Nine Inch Nails' Pretty Hate Machine(which rocked by the way). No matter how much you liked Manson's trilogy I strongly suggest you avoid this album no matter how much you like Marilyn Manson.What happened to the master works that were Tourniquet,Man That You Fear, Lamn Of God,Burning Flag,Coma White,The Last Day On Earth,etc? None of the songs on Golden Age come close to being as good as the songs in his trilogy.If you want a hard rocking,finely produced album I suggest you stick with Marilyn Manson's Antichrist and Holy wood as well as Nine Inch Nail's masterpiece The Downward Spiral.And if youre looking for an easily accesible poppier sounding album just stick with Manson's Mechanical Animals and Nine Inch Nails' Pretty Hate Machine."},{"rating":"1","title":"Manson fans: The.

Just a mess, and not listenable. Antichrist Superstar was brilliant. Mechanical animals was beautiful. Holywood was his darkest by far (my opinion) and argueably some of the bands best work.

If you are a Marilyn Manson fan, then stop and read this. This CD is nothing like AntiChrist Superstar or Holywood. With Twiggy gone, so has the hard sound that made Manson famous. All songs have a good hard beat somewhere in the song, but then change to a techno sounding beat and an annoying sounding chorus. Not very hard sounding. Manson has changed his sound so much that it is hard to even realize that this is from the individual who once produced Antichrist Superstar."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad","review":"Words cannot describe how dreadful this album is.\\"Porait of an american family\\" was his only good record.Every song is awful,And the bonus DVD it came with was pointless garbage.Manson just seems to be trying to shock people.Every single thing he does is a rip off of another artist.This record is NOT worth buying,avoid at all costs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hahahahahahahahhahahahahahahahhahahahahahhahahaha!!!!!!","review":"Marilyn Manson=s***ty nu-metal, NOT goth metal or shock rock! Manson is nothing but a poseur, and if he does things the least bit offensive (i.e. cover a fan in meat) it's considered shocking and scary. I bet if you guys went to a Mayhem concert, you'd s*** your pants, as Mayhem do live animal sacrfices on stage and make Manson look like Mr. Rogers! Also, want satanic? Listen to Dimmu Borgir, Shagrath (DB vocalist) makes Manson look like a school quoir boy."},{"rating":"1","title":"This One Sucked Worse Than Holy Wood!","review":"I Know what your saying your probably thinking it wasn't that bad.Think again this was the worst manson album ever made!I mean it is so bad i would give \\"Holy Wood\\" A 5 Star rating!i'm sorry but I just depise this album.I may be a Kid but I can give you good advice! DON'T BUY THIS ALBUM!

I COMPLETELY wasted my money. Its taken me long time to review because I never needed it really. It came up in conversation how bad it is and I decided to warn anyone who might consider this non-reference.Everything is shabby and explained inadequately. Other books have drafts for different types of pants patterns, not this one. Darts and slashes are not explained AT ALL. The author should never, ever call herself a teacher again. Books like this and crappy descriptions by Amazon make me not want to buy anything through Amazon again. This is the third time I have bought a product and been disappointed through poor descriptions."},{"rating":"1","title":"The worest published Shounen-ai I've read","review":"Honestly, it gets me annoyed that DMP would actually consider these titles \\"Yaoi\\". Do they even know what Yaoi means?! These titles are more shounen-ai than yaoi.\\"Desire\\" was a huge disappoint. I feel like i wasted my hard earn money.Like the previous reviewer stated, DMP's translations suck. The whole \\"Mr...\\" part is a very obvious one.The only good things about this manga were the art and the very rare fluffy parts.Things were under-developed, the story and the characters.It's a cheap-flake-off to get money. If you know someone who owns a copy, read it first before you decide you want to buy it."},{"rating":"2","title":"BOY LOVE!","review":"I absolutely LOVED this one.

I'm usually not into the whole unrequited love thing or just the drama but it's just so good!!!!! You put the same storyline of the shy, art student in love with the jock in a regular manga (boy-girl) and it would be pinch-your-eyes-out BORING! but because this is the miracle of life called YAOI then it isssssssssss veeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeerrry goodd and suddenly the plain storyline is converted into some kind of sacred, interesting, hot story between two dudes.It's a soft YAOI though, there are like 2 or 3 mild sex scenes, but still those are HIGHLY anticipated once you start reading the manga. It's good oh sooo very good! really, totaly worth it.GO BUY IT !! really IT'S SUPER CHEAP COMPARED TO WHAT IT SHOULD BE WORTH!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"The other reviewers have the plot summarized pretty well already, so I won't bother with that. My main problem with this book is the translation. It's horrible. The language is stilted and awkward. You can figure out what's going on, but there's no subtlety of phrase here and nothing like the English anyone actually speaks. In a story that rides alot upon the uke's inner-dialogue, this awkwardness of expression really makes it hard to relate to what he's feeling. This is also another title where the Uke stammers \\"NO\\" and \\"STOP\\" throughout the first time the main characters have sex. Why the publishers think quasi-non-con is the way to go with so many of these books, I'll never know. I know that if you're looking for English Yaoi you've got a limited number of titles from which to choose. This one should be a sort of last resort."},{"rating":"1","title":"much better stuff out there...","review":"I really dislike this manga. It's bad when you end up getting annoyed with the two main characters. I felt that Ryoji was constantly bullying Toru, who was too much in love to realize he's a fool. Ryoji and Toru's friend Tadashi is the only one who seems to understand what's going on. Whatever I was thinking, Tadashi seemed to say for me, which was good. This book aggravated me on so many levels, especially since the characters make so many painfully obvious mistakes. This whole situation could have been prevented with the truth. There is A LOT better stuff out there, so please save your time and money and don't get this."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Whirl Wind Tale","review":"For one I have never read any thing in this series before. I was quite surprised but all so pleased with this manga. I've read other published homosexual stories out there and 'Desire (Payback)' I thought is certainly one of the better stories. This is very graphic and not for those with a faint heart. The story line to me was quite shocking. However, once I got passed it. I really enjoyed it. I like the art work a lot. Pretty boys are all ways nice to look at.I was very much satisfied with this story more towards the end of the story. I felt as though the begging was a bit boring. However, it started picking up after a while."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not one of the duo's bests.","review":"Unfortunately, the plot of \\"Desire\\" struck me as formulaic and predictable: Toru is a sensitive art student who is in love with his good friend Ryoji, miscommunication, angst, and tears ensue. The characters left me emotionally cold, and the plot was rather boring. Despite all this, I am still a fan of these authors' works (check out \\"Kiss Scandal\\" and \\"Rin\\").As the previous reviewer SDW also noted, Digital Manga Publishing has bolded one word out of every speech bubble. I think this is a bad pratice: they have selected for the reader all the so-called \\"important\\" words and left little for the reader to interpret."},{"rating":"2","title":"floor mats/lexus","review":"fit great and look great....first ones I found at a reasonable price.

The second set came in with 3 pieces broken and I decided not to order anything breakable from you again. I did not try to return it since the first order also had broken items.

Sure, their music may be up-beat and catchy, but while their tunes do not grate on my nerves, the lack of diversity in this video (as well as the other one I purchased) does.There is not one child of color in the entire production -- everyone is lily-white. Just because they are Australian does not exonerate them from cultural sensitivity.

I was looking for a stocking stuffer for my nearly 5-year old son, and I picked up \\"Wiggly Play Time\\". The first time we watched it, he didn't like it, but my daughter was hooked. One day later, my son asked to watch it again, and it's been on every single day since then. I broke down and bought another one, \\"Yummy Yummy\\". I have to admit, I hated The Wiggles at first. Now, however, I really like them! It's fun to dance with my children, and we sing the songs in the car. One sure way to turn my son's bad moods around is to start singing \\"Fruit Salad\\" from \\"Yummy Yummy\\". And, as an extra bonus, I swear I can use the \\"Yummy Yummy\\" video as an aerobic exercise! My daughter's vocabulary has exploded suddenly, and the tapes really do soothe the savage beasts! I highly recommend these guys!"},{"rating":"2","title":"WONDERFUL, WONDERFUL, WONDERFUL!","review":"First of all - get over the Do The Monkey not being on this tape, buy the other one - they are cheap enough! Now onto the good stuff, 3 kids (ages 20 months, 5 and 8) and 2 grown adults love this tape! The Wiggels and Barney are in a dead run for first place in our home. We have video taped the kids dancing and signing to this tape and those precious memories will be great when they get older. I dare one child or adult to sit down and watch this and not start singing, dancing, or even toe tapping. I find myself at work humming the Wiggles songs now instead of Barney - thank goodness.

It's very infectious and I can see why they are very popular with the kids! This is my first Wiggles DVD and so far so good!Some of the catchier tunes are Dorothy the Dinosaur and the Quack Quack Song and many more!

My one year old and three year old are glued to the tv when we put it in. They do not sit still and watch, they both get up and dance and sing the songs.

Personally, I could never do what they do, but I appreciate that there's people like them to entertain the pre-preschool crowd. I say, \\"you go Wiggles!\\" The only thing I don't like (besides their needing to shave) is that they've got me singing their songs at work. Do you know how embarrassing it is for a guy who works at a power plant to be singing \\"Dorothy the Dinosaur\\"!? Don't let people who say that because they're Australian it doesn't translate very well to kids in the U.S. because it does...they're kids (<3 year olds) for goodness sakes!

Lots of up beat, energetic, catchy tunes. The songs make all of us want to dance and put big smile on all of our faces. We went to buy more, since this is the greatest thing to our little boy, and purchased Wiggle Time and the new, Bananas one. Wiggle time is boring and slow and only the live songs at the end make it watchable. It couldn't even keep my son's attention for a minute where the first one makes him go into a zone and he won't take his eyes off the TV. The new Wiggles go Bananas is computer generated and the songs are worthy of one star. We went through every song on both of the DVDs and agreed that our son will probably never watch either again. Waste of money!"},{"rating":"2","title":"If you have a little one You must have this video","review":"This is an absolute favorite here with my 16 mos old. It is amazing that the Wiggles can get a child this age to not only pay attention throughout the entire video, but sing and dance too.

We did also! We sang the song and danced with her. So we ordered this video. It's definitely not what we thought we were getting. The monkey dance was very cute with all of the kids dancing along with the Wiggles. That's probably what our 14 month old liked the best. But, the video doesn't have hardly any kids dancing and singing along. I'm sorry to say, but most of the skits are very corny, especially with four grown men trying to act very silly. The Wiggles need the cute little kids like they have in the Monkey Dance in every one of their songs. I will say the Wiggles sing well, but that is what they need to stick to and let the kids do the rest. Overall, it's not what we bargained for. As a result we're returning the video."},{"rating":"1","title":"Catchy songs, tacky visuals","review":"Okay, there is something to be said for the wiggles. The songs are catchy. But in my opinion, these songs should have been recorded to cd's, and the dorky visuals should have stayed ...The children we know that like the Wiggles, never liked them instantaneously. For example, ... our neighbor, used to protest at their appearance before his Barney tapes, but after about watching his Barney for the 50th time and seeing the previews so much, he finally was okay with the Wiggles.My daughter ... also didn't take to the Wiggles right away, and it's never a tape she opts for on her own, only on somebody else's suggestion.We prefer to choose the videos that are an instant hit, and as long as a child is not obsessed with only one video, then it is easy to see if the entertainment is successful on the first go.Bottom Line: Dorky and overstimulating."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very cheesy & disappointing","review":"I just got this for my 3 year old daughter for Christmas based on all of the positive reviews.

Great video-all song and dance to keep the little ones interested!"},{"rating":"2","title":"My son calls it \\"My cool movie\\"","review":"We saw the advertisement of this group on a few Barney tapes. Every time we saw it my son would get up and dance. I loved the idea of a video that would keep him busy for a while but that he didn't just sit on the couch and watch. Every time he watches it he gets a work out. I love this video and it makes me feel good to let him watch it(even sometimes twice in a row). My daughter who is 15 months is also dancing (or wiggling) to the video."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Break from Barney!","review":"My 3-year-old son and 1-year-old daughter absolutely love The Wiggles! I actually enjoy them, too! I bought the video because I felt we needed a break from Barney, and the kids now would rather watch The Wiggles! The music is very catchy, and the dances are adorable. My son's friends can't wait to dance when they come over!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great exercise and entertainment for both kids and adults","review":"My 2 1/2 year old son did not like this at first because he wanted the Monkey Dance (featured on the Barney Christmas Video). After showing him small segments (rewinding after a few so he could see them again) he started asking for this video. Now, this is all he wants! I ordered the other Wiggles video today so he has another one to watch. My son, husband and I dance with the video (great exercise) and my 11 month old daughter wiggles to it too! I hope they come LIVE to the St. Louis area!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Welcome Change from Barney - but what's with Jeff's teeth??","review":"My 2-year-old loves this tape. So does my 7-year-old. The music is really good. Instead of the recycled children's songs that Barney offers (and Raffi deserves credit for resurrecting those songs - not Barney), the Wiggles write their own music. So this is a good selection if you're fed up with the same old songs. It is eminently hummable and danceable. Also - check out the keyboard part in \\"Quack, quack\\" - it is pretty sophisticated! The kids look like real people - not Jon Benet Ramsey clones. Their choreography is miles ahead of the simple Barney fare. So - your little ones will like the melodies and dances, while the rest of family will dig the music too.But what is with Jeff's teeth? This subject keeps my 11 and 7 years speculating for hours (and us parents too). Does he even have teeth?"},{"rating":"2","title":"A hit with my toddler!","review":"My 19-month old son LOVES this video. When he gets up in the morning he asks for \\"giggles,\\" and as soon as he gets home from day care he wants me to pop it in too. He's learning the words to the songs, and we've just noticed that he's doing some of the gestures/dances too. It's so fun to watch him dance to the songs. We have two other Wiggles videos (Toot, Toot and Wake Up Jeff), but my son clearly prefers this one. We're getting a little tired of it, but it's such a favorite of his that we couldn't possibly take it away now. Younger viewers are sure to be pleased!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Benny..Where's the punch?","review":"I bought this album not long after hearing the album he did with Jack McDuff called \\"Dynamic\\"(Prestige records-PRLP-7323)back in 1964,now out-of-print.I was taken by the arrangements he did for McDuff and expected more of the same punch he delivered. Boy, was I wrong. Aside from 'A Sweedish Villa' it sounds as though everyone in the band was taking a vacation and was asked at the last minute to do a recording session.Having cut my teeth on Basie and other swing era big bands, I was just hoping that this album could resurect some of the dynamics of that time.

It is the work of a genius. Fingaz is definately among the all-time untouchables. This is a phenomenal cd, beats, rappin, and all. Fingaz' work is definitely at the top. He has established himself as his own unique self with great confidence. I don't think Fingaz needs help from anybody but the guests on his album are fanstastic as well. There is not one weak song on this cd. I can easily listen to it from start to finish, and still want more. Fingaz' cd is not only killer beats and incomparable rappin but it has depth, breadth, and quality messages. Fingaz really makes you think. He hits you in the head as well as the heart. Now that is the work of a genius. His cd is not just words and music, it is life. TO FINGAZ AND HIS CREW, THANK-YOU FOR AN UNSURPASSING WORK OF ART AND CREATIVITY! It is beautiful!

Unfortunately, I bought the DVD before the viewer from Sacramento, CA. had posted his review. The only reviews that were posted at the time were glowing. Needless to say, I was very disappointed when I viewed the DVD. Not only is the quality of the movie footage terrible, but the quality of the audio is also very poor.

I don't blame them.This is truly a waste of money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buyer Beware","review":"If you buy this product, be sure to inspect it immediately. My set included two Disc 1s and no Disc 2, a discrepancy I didn't notice until the return window had closed. But after watching the beginning of one of those Disc 1s, I realized I wasn't going to miss Disc 2 or ever get to Disc 3. Lackluster narration, ten aimlessly arranged minutes per year, and prints so bad they make 8mm bootlegs look good.

The blades that come with it are sharp and good quality. The handle seems like it's going to hold up long term. However, there have been two instances where the switch that opens the blade storage in the handle has been activated in my pocket. The blades did not fall out, they also appear held by a magnet, but it was a bit disconcerting to know it was a close call. I've taken to keeping this in a belt pouch since, which also better distributes the heft."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Nice","review":"First off, let me say that Amazon Prime shipping has only got better and faster over the years. Thanks Amazon! This is a great utility knife. It replaced an old Stanley that I had used for for over 30 years and the difference is night and day. First of all is the ease of changing blades, no more screw driver and trying to line up the blade. I like the way it folds up and is easy to carry. It has a space to carry extra blades and it feels good in the hand. I just like it! Yes, I will recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"great knife","review":"Great knife to have in a print shop. A little dangerous on its snap when closing the blade (I have since scrapped off the edging around the blade entrance's finger zone in a warning pattern). Also blades of different sizes can wobble inside the blade-lock area and a piece of tape on the blade will stop thate nicely enough.What I like most about this blade though is its grip. it doesn't have that hard feel of pressed plastic or metal. It also has enough curves for a variety of grip positions.Way better than standard issue, break off blades. This changes faster.Watch your fingers!

The first was in ancient Egypt, which was fairly easy, just mummifying a pharoh correctly and decoding Carmen's note to her associate. The second was in Rome, and included fixing the plumbing. I had the most trouble with that! It continued with getting the Vikings their ship back, bringing the moon's light to a Japanese writer's room, doing errands for William the Conqeror, etc. They get harder and harder. I lost the discs before I could get any further than the sixth mission, but I'd really like to have it back and see if I could complete the missions now.

Well, I won't be buying another one of Mr. White's books after reading this one.The story line included a bunch of sub stories that really didn't have anything to do with the main storyline. (Spoilers ahead!!) A son who had ordered his own paternity test. An ex lesbian lover pregnant with Doc's child who turns out not to be an ex lesbian. A neurotic best friend that has a promonition that Doc is dying while in the middle of surgery and puts himself in a drug crazed coma to reach out to him. And on and on and on. The book starts out with a bang and then loses it entirely and never picks up speed again. I would say 50% of the book's writing does not belong in the book and doesn't add to the storyline. I only finished it because I hate not finishing a book, but this was ridiculous.I won't bother recommending this book to anyone.

I do suggest that you start with Sanibel Flatts, and read them in order, each book is used as reference through out the series, so it helps to know all the back stories. The characters are great, Doc Ford, Tomlinson, Jeth, Mack and the rest of the guides, plus all of the Doc's lady friends.

This one just put me off. There has always been a dark side to these books -- understandable when your hero is an ex government assassin. This one seems not only darker, but seems unrelieved by the conviviality and \\"humanity\\" that marks the rest of the series. The action, which has in the past been mostly believable and realistic, in this book seems to lean more toward teen-age fantasy.

They are really scary. Even I find them nightmarish. They really are straight out of a horror film. But that would be okay if this worked like a normal DVD. You could just skip the track and move on. But the tracks do not correspond to the beginning and ends to the songs. The first puppet sequence, for example, spans less than one track, so if you try to skip over the puppets, you skip over at least one other entire song. The same is true for the second puppet sequence. Bc the DVD is so poorly designed, you miss about 1/4 of the content. So my advice is DON'T SPEND THE EXTRA $$$ ON THE DVD. It isn't worth it.

It's a great way to spend time with your kids and excercize too! However; there are a couple things I don't care for in this particular video. I don't think the Hebrew song is very fitting and I could defenatly do without the puppets. They don't scare my daughter , but she's not particularly interested in them.

The Wiggles was the first show that my baby boy showed any interest in at all, and he's been watching them over a year now (He's going on 21 months). We have 13 different Wiggles DVDs that we rotate for him. But, unfortunately, we had to give this one to the Goodwill. He loves the whole DVD - except for the Wiggle puppets. He backs away from the TV with a horrified expression when they're on, and as I'm usually trying to get things done when he's watching the Wiggles, it's hard to make sure I'm there to fast-forward past the 2 puppet songs. I find myself wondering, as much as I love them, why they did these scenes at all. They are rather scary."},{"rating":"1","title":"They've Made Better!!","review":"This is my and my son's least favorite Wiggles video. It's slower moving then the rest of their high energy videos.Unlike the others that he sits or dances through in their entirety, he lost interest quickly with this one.Also - portions of the video that have the Wiggles as PaperMaiche dolls with big eyes (creepy looking) singing superfast send my 2 year old screaming for me!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great fun!","review":"This is the video your looking for if you've seen the preview on Barney video's of the Wiggles. This has the Monkey song on it. My kids (5 and 21 months)think these guys are wonderful. They begged for the tape after seeing it advertised on Barney. We went looking for it at Toys R Us and with no luck came looking for it here. Thank goodness I found it and the kids get up and dance and sing with it. Its great. They can even spell DOROTHY, you'll see. Even Dad and I find ourselves singing the songs. I plan on buying Wiggle Time soon for them as well. This is for sure a tape that won't sit around, it will be watched a lots of times..."},{"rating":"1","title":"mostly good wiggles stuff as per usual but....","review":"I Bought this for my son(20 months)who adores the wiggles, wags, henry,etc. I was in dire need for some new wiggles entertainment, Both Wiggly party, wiggly bay (great Videos buy the way) had become old hat. S0... I purchases Yummy Yummmy.Great performances by Greg, Murry, Anthony, and Jeff when they were on, but WHAT IS UP WITH THOSE BIZZARE PUPPETS SEEN ON THE VIDEO FOR MORE THAN HALF OF THE RUNNING TIME? I could understand maybe for one short song, if I knew the bizzaro puppets were on the video that much I would have used my money for barney:)!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fabulous!!","review":"My daughter is 15 months old, and when she started watching The Wiggles on the Disney Channel, I decided to buy a video of our own. We both absolutely love it! There isn't much dialogue so it keeps her attention very well. She loves dancing to all the songs. We watch it at least twice a day!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This one has the songs you're looking for","review":"Take it from a home where The Wiggles currently reign supreme (at least as far as my 22-month-old Wiggles-addicted daughter is concerned): This isn't the best Wiggles video (That honor would go to \\"It's a Wiggly Wiggly World.\\") But it's among the better ones. And if you're looking for the songs your kids know from the TV show, this tape will take care of quite a few.Yes, you'll tire quickly of \\"Fruit Salad,\\" \\"Hot Potato\\" and the other songs so frequently repeated on the Disney Channel show, but your kids will love the ability to watch them on their own schedule, rather than the network's. And if you don't want to be chained to a TV schedule, either, so will you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yummy Yummy ... Yuck!","review":"While I must admit my 2 year old loves this video, I find it one of the most annoying Wiggles videos ever! I bought this one as my first Wiggles purchase because it has many of my son's favorite songs, but was very disappointed. The puppets are annoying at best, and several of my sons friends find them downright scary. The \\"techno-wiggle\\" song section is very out of place on a toddler video, and if my son would let me, I'd skip it every time. There are many better Wiggles videos out there, and if given the choice, I'd pass on \\"Yummy Yummy\\". Check out \\"Wiggle Time\\" if you want classic Wiggle songs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Songs are good --puppets scary!","review":"My 6 year old (who is afraid of clowns )did not like the puppets with the high voices. He was really afraid of them so we gave the DVD away. Next time I will check to see if the puppets are in the next one I buy. They could of at least used the Wiggles' real voices. A bit creepy I must say!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Nowhere near as good as the TV show","review":"I bought this DVD hoping it would be just like the TV show on Disney Channel, which my 23-month-old adores and begs to watch every day. It's NOT. This is sort of the low-budget, music only version. It also has these puppets which SCARE MY SON. I have to jump past the puppet songs when he's watching it. Why can't they put out a video that's just like watching the TV show?"},{"rating":"2","title":"I LOVE THESE GUYS","review":"i have an 18 month old who loves music so naturally she loves the Wiggles. She already know the dance moves to at least one song. We first saw the Wiggles in short little skits in between shows on the Disney channel and she fell for them instanly. I knew had to get the tapes this is the first one I have bought and I think that I will be getting more very soon. We want them all."},{"rating":"2","title":"It Grows On You","review":"My two-year-old is a huge Wiggles fan and has half a dozen of their videos. At first he wasn't crazy about this particular one, but it seemed to grow on him with time. What makes this a little different than the others is that a couple of the songs/skits are done with Wiggles puppets/dolls that look like the four guys, and you have to get used to looking at them (they're kind of scary looking with their big eyes...LOL); but after you've seen it a few times, it's pretty entertaining. I'd recommend this, but still prefer both Wiggly, Wiggly World and Wiggly Play Time over it."},{"rating":"2","title":"hours of fun and entertainment","review":"These videos are very entertaining to our 2 year old and 7 year old. Our 2 year old dances and wiggles just like the guys do in the videos. She even takes them to her babysitters and puts on a show for all the other kids. These shows have even helped her developmental and coordination skills. We highly recommend these videos to any parent. We have purchased every one of their videos. Hope there will be more to come in the near future."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth buying","review":"My Daughter is 21 months. She loves this dvd. She sings along with it and enjoys so much... i am planning to buy more dvds for her from wiggles...Wiggles have done really good job."},{"rating":"2","title":"FUN","review":"This is a fun video. I think there is still a little too much dialoge in it but still worth buying."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good choice.","review":"Fun songs and lots of Wiggle energy. My major complaint is the puppets. There are two songs that are preformed by clay puppets. My daughter is scared of them and cries. We are forced to fast forward through those tracks which is annoying. Otherwise another Wiggle classic."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wiggles Time","review":"I am a mother of 3 children and Barney and Blue's Clues were getting alittle old when we discovered Wiggles it was the best thing in the world instead of sitting and watching they are up dancing and singing- Thank you so much the little time that they are allowed to watch movies it is nice knowing that they are enjoying the show."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not Their Best but Well Worth the Money","review":"It's not as good as the other one (the puppets are kind of yucky. My 2 1/2 year old really likes anything \\"Wiggles\\", and this tape is still better than any Barney tape"},{"rating":"2","title":"Better Than Wiggle-Time!","review":"Another great hit for both my daughters, age 2 1/2 and 9 mos. They can't watch it enough. I'm sure i'll buy another tape when this one wears out! Worth every Dollar!All the Rota Girls Love it......even mum."},{"rating":"1","title":"No chapter stops - no menu - horrible","review":"While the content of this DVD might be good, the presentation is simply miserable and I can't believe this was even released.It is basically a video tape put on DVD with random chapter stops that don't even correspond to the songs.Someone could have spent an extra 10 minutes on this and made it a good DVD.Until they fix the shoddy job they did making this disc, don't buy it.In addition, the two puppet remixes are just simply creepy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Truly a 'Wiggles Convert'","review":"When my sister said that my then 11 month old daughter 'loved' the commercial for this DVD 'sooo much' that she just had to get it for my daughter's first birthday, I thought, 'who are the Wiggles? And what the heck is 'Yummy Yummy'?'. I now know and am, happy to say, a 'Wiggles Fan'.My daughter is now nearing 21 months, and loves this DVD. The music gets her up and dancing, and it takes merely singing the first few bars of 'Hot Potato' or 'Monkey Dance' to get her moving.What I find most enjoyable about this DVD is that, unlike the show on Playhouse Disney (which is fine in its own right), the DVD is mostly musical, save some short scripting here and there. The music and dancing are what really attract my daughter's attention, so I'm very pleased.Even if you're skeptical, give this a try. I'm now in the market for more 'Wiggles' videos. And you may surprise yourself, too. Enjoy!"},{"rating":"1","title":"How Disappointing!","review":"We were so excited to get this video based off the promo we saw on a Barney video. That promo song was the only one our child liked on the whole video! There are even some finger puppet videos that were such scary imitations of the real singers that my son got scared and started to cry! Then we find out that we cannot return the video because we have opened it. What a waste! We were looking for a fun music/dance video for those days we can't go outside, and ended up with a video that my son is scared to watch at all!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This Video is Yummy Yummy","review":"We have 4 of the Wiggles videos and this one is our favorite. My daughter (14 months old) has been watching this since she was 10 months old. And it is amazing - she watches the entire video. And to watch it every day for 4 months straight - it has to be entertaining. I think she is going to be a Wiggles groupie."},{"rating":"2","title":"~The Wiggles make Us Giggle~","review":"I run a childcare, and I saw the Wiggles-Yummy Yummy advertised on a Barney video. They had such fun, snappy songs that I had to order it, and I was soooo happy I did. The children love this video and its their favorite. They love to sing and dance with the songs, but I think they giggle the loudest, when I'm dancing right along with them..... The only downside to this video is your apted to sing some of the songs in your head, but their so cute so who cares. :) I highly recommend this video for your child..."},{"rating":"2","title":"great alternative to \\"couch potato\\" videos","review":"The first time I played this video, I was a little disappointed that not every song had dance moves for the kids to follow. However, my kids (ages 2 and 4) loved it. They hop around to the music even if there are no dance steps, like with the songs done with puppets. It's a great change from Barney and Blue's Clues!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Completely Skippable","review":"Our two year old loves the TV shows & his Wiggles CDs, but he is not interested in this DVD. It is simply songs strung together, with little or no dialog and no plot (which our child really enjoys, and frankly, makes it easier for me to sit through, strange as that may sound).Most songs are performed on the same basic set, which is just a sky & clouds background.Also, as many reviewers have said, the puppets are terrible. I think they will give ME nightmares. They are AWFUL!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"Too SCARY\\"...though I am not sure why","review":"I have to rate it low because like a viewer above, My two year old is scared to death of this video, since seeing the puppet scene, and a part where the pirate weeps. She absolutely will not watch it a second time, and that's a surprise, since I ordered it after she danced with such glee to the clip of the \\"Monkey Song\\" on the Barney video leader. Double the wasted money, because I also bought the other \\"Wiggles\\" video initially, thinking it had the advertised song, but it doesn't. That one doesn't scare her, but doesn't interest her, either. From an adult perspective, neither one is scary, but apparently some children will think so. Personally, I thought the dances were cute(and simple enough that a child could actually copy them), the singing pleasant, the sets nonexistent. BUT the kid rating is what matters, and that's zero."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth your money","review":"I bought two DVD's for my 2-yr old son. However, I am extremely unhappy about the play time of these DVDs. It is too short with a lot of advertisements and stupid puppet shows and very little time dedicated to the real Wiggles. They are not worth the money you spend on these videos and I would not pay more that $... each for these videos."},{"rating":"1","title":"Did not care for this dvd","review":"I have only 2 dvd's and this is my least favorite. I would not recommend this one. The one we like is Wiggly Play Time, but that is the only other one I have seen."},{"rating":"1","title":"stay away from this one","review":"I purchased this one because my 22 month old loves the \\"hot potato\\" song, and usually all of the wiggles songs are pretty entertaining - except the stupid high-speed singing puppets. I thought the dvd player was going nuts but it was just the song. Would not recommend this dvd."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yummy Yummy","review":"My 15 month old son loves the Wiggles...but did not like this video...he even cried when the puppets came on....he LOVES the Magical Adventure video...it keeps his attention and he loves to dance to the songs....me and my husband even walk around singing them!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Kid must have","review":"Easy dance moves, catchy tunes, and 4 funny guys in Red, Blue, Yellow and Purple make this a Big hit in my house. My 16 mos old loves them and even does some of the dance moves right along with them. Ok, the puppets are kinda freaky but my son thinks they are a riot. My son will sit through the entire video and cry when it ends. We have the entire collection of wiggle videos (even dance party) and this is one of the best!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This DVD is just \\"Yummy\\"!!!","review":"This is winner from the Wiggles. The DVD has 14 songs and they are all beautifully song by Greg and the rest of the Wiggles. This was definitely a great buy, parents if your little one loves the Wiggles, then don't skip this one...Here are some of my daughter's favorites.. She is 18 mos and already they have her up and on her feet moving and shaking and just enjoying herself....Hot PotatoFruit SaladDorothy the DinosaurHenry the Octopus (Henry's Dance)Crunchy Munchy Honey CakesJoanie works with one hammerDo the MonkeyPoint your finger (performed by Wiggles puppets and she still loves them..)My only complaint is that they could have added more songs to this DVD, too little songs for the price.. On the other hand the songs are all wonderful and so she has to listen to them over and over again!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not so great - a disappointment for this Wiggles fan","review":"The video is nothing but musical number after musical number. I wish there were more vignettes to mix things up a bit. Also, for the price it is quite short - just over 35 minutes long. I agree the puppets seem creepy to me, but my son enjoyed them, esp. the Captain Feathersword puppet."},{"rating":"2","title":"My 2 year old loves this video!","review":"Our 2 year old son asks for this video by name as soon as he wakes up in the morning.

Stories don't need happy endings or all of the pieces tied together to be good, but they do need characters who engage you enough to provide an emotional connection. Unfortunately for me, I did not have any feelings (positive and negative) about the characters in these stories, and the plots were unsatisfying as well.Sadly, I cannot recommend this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Promising, but...","review":"Admittedly, my interest in Maile Meloy initially came entirely from my enjoyment of her younger brother Colin Meloy's band, the Decemberists. Meloy's debut short story collection is extremely promising in a lot of key areas: her stories have a strong sense of place, and she's got both a good ear for dialogue and a strong handle on narrative pacing. Things actually happen in these stories, in other words, something that can't always be said about similar short story collections. However, it seems that Colin inherited all of the family's sense of humor genes, as Maile's stories are almost relentlessly bleak and often downright depressing. A wider variety of emotional shadings would go a long way towards enhancing this collection."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beautifully written for the lover of short stories.","review":"If you enjoy short stories, Maile Meloy is the way to go.

I've gone to see it in London and have seen it at the Shubert in Century City many times. In all cases the casts were excellent and the overall effect was moving! Here comes the 25th anniversary concert on blu-ray with state of the art surround sound! What a disappointment! The concert was done in what seemed to be a football stadium, complete with screaming fans who yelled and applauded over most of the orchestral passages. Each of the \\"singers\\" were equiped with microphones in which each screamed for the entire evening. Not all the singers were vocally good enough to merit all that amplification. There is no balance between vocal parts and the orchestra. The performers stand in place sreaming while the orchestra can't be heard. This has been a lesson to me. You can't hear a musical production that has been produced as if it were a football game."},{"rating":"1","title":"WORST EVER","review":"This show has NOTHING to do with the 10th Anniversary one. The 10th is absolutely awesome, with much better singers. Especially Marius. Whose idea was it to cast Jonas as that important character? He is a joke.

Once more, travesty - Joel Schumacher does the movie version of the Phantom of the Opera. But was followed by the 25th Anniversary of the Phantom of the Opera Royal Albert Hall. Bravo. Browsing through Amazon, I saw this 25th Anniversary Edition of Les Miserable and was about to ignore all negative review, but curiosity overcame. I saw Nick Jonas as Marius. My jaw dropped. Nick Jonas' rendition of Empty Chairs at Empty Tables is empty and insulting.

I 've got this blurry, it's much improve both audio/video."},{"rating":"2","title":"Les Miserables Live","review":"I do enjoy this recording, however, when I selected this item based on the grouping by Amazon and the design of the cover, I was expecting a recording with the cast of the concert at the O2, the same as the DVD with Alfie Boe.This is not the case. The cast though wonderful is not what I wanted to order."},{"rating":"2","title":"exclent","review":"i love broadway i loved this dvd it took me back to when i saw it in person but the stage was not like this one i relly enjoyed not having any pledge breaks i thought nick jonas was excllent but looked strange without a guitar loved the ending when every cast came out"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic!","review":"This concert is amazing. I wish I could have been there for it. Not only is the Blu-ray picture unbelievable, but the talent of the performers is out of this world. If you are a fan of music in general or the story of Les Miserables, this is definately worth your time and money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing!!!","review":"Breathtaking, Fantastic, Superb!!! The ensemble cast was so good. I was moved to tears throughout. What an amazing show. A great purchase."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nick Jonas EPIC FAIL","review":"I love Les Mis, overall I will say that most of the performances were moving, there were several times during the program where I needed a tissue. The music always moves me to tears. Awesome performances, except for Nick Jonas, what were they thinking when they thought it would be a good idea to put this pathetic ameteur on stage with true professionals? With his weak voice and pained expression, it was pitiful to watch and just as painful to listen to. I wouldn't let it ruin my overall impression though. This is why I only gave 4 stars, ignore the meak and meager Jonas and you get 5. The encore was spine-chilling, the voices of the 4 Valjean's were stunning together, more crying from me here. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"I watch it over and over :)","review":"Some people haven't liked this cast of Les Mis, but I think it is fantastic. After seeing it first on PBS, I wanted to order the DVD to share it with friends and family. I find myself watching all the time! It isn't the full musical, but a concert with the songs...regardless, it keeps my attention the same way. If you love Les Mis, this is a great way to keep you occupied until you see it in the theater again or the movie comes out!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Les Miz, 25 years","review":"First, you must love Les Miz the musical.2nd; this is the complete cast in costume, singing all the songs with the most incredible encore ever seen as they bring all the previous performers together for a big last hurrah. Doesn't get any better than this."},{"rating":"2","title":"The time is here!","review":"If you are a fan of Les Miserables -- this is a must-get. If you are not a fan, then there is no help for you. That is all. I initially watched this special on PBS, and watched it again, and again. It is pricessless. The shear love in the audience, and by the cast of hundereds stands embodies everything this musical represents. Well staged. Well shot. Must get."},{"rating":"2","title":"wonderful!","review":"fabulous recording of a fabulous event! first saw this on pbs. now i will be able to enjoy it over and over."},{"rating":"2","title":"Uplifting","review":"I saw a production of a High-School Concert version in 2009 and became attached to the music. I had not seen a production of Les Miserables up till then. I own the 10th Anniversary CDs and have seen the DVD of that concert. Now I've seen the movie and the 25th Anniversary concert within the last month, what a treat. We have also seen 3 movies made of the book, our favorite one is the one made in 1930's. Forgiveness, redemption, giving ... all relevant topics in the 21st century."},{"rating":"2","title":"25th Anniversary DVD of Les Mis","review":"The 25th Anniversary Concert production features a great cast. Definitely worth the purchase. Happy to have my own copy of it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Les Miserables: The 25th Anniversary Concert","review":"This is a Excelent movie, i like it, i love this movie . . . . . . . ."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great production.","review":"While this is not the actual play, the 25th anniversary does a good job at depicting the story line. I have been a fan well before the movie came out and grew up watching the 10th anniversary and it was cool to see some of the old cast come back again. This has to be by far the best musical and they have done an excellent job with picking great vocalists."},{"rating":"2","title":"The long-awaited dvd is here!","review":"I love Les Misrables. I loved the 10th Anniversary Edition. There's only really one thing I'd like to add to the other reviews. We felt that the videography, lighting, and filming quality was inferior to the 10th Anniversary show. The videographers spent too much time on distace scenes where we, like the audience, watched the close-ups on the screens above the actual performers. Kind of bummer."},{"rating":"1","title":"kind of boring.....","review":"I tried to see the opera just to compare with the new movie(Hugh Jackman) but it 's no comparison. It's best to see the moviewith the scene and backdrop to appreciate Les Mis. Besides the DVD stopped and froze in the middle so I have to switch it off."},{"rating":"2","title":"More in love with Les Mis","review":"After seeing the motion picture, listening to my CD of the movie and the DVD of the original cast, I had to purchase this 25th anniversary version. A bonus feature of this DVD is that it includes the original cast joining the 25th anniversary cast to double my pleasure of the music and singing. Another collector's item for me!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Alfie Boe and the rest of the cast were unbelievable","review":"I just finished watching this, and would watch it again if I didn't have to get up for work in the morning! All star cast, Alfie Boe to begin with has a voice like none other. Others have said the Jonas brother was a distraction and that his voice was weak, it was softer than the others, like Boe but he performed the role well. I absolutely loved this DVD and wish so much that I could have been there to see it live. I would also like to know when the CD will come out of the soundtrack of this performance. A CD has been released, but it is NOT of this cast, with Alfie Boe and Jean Valjean and Lewis as Javert. I will keep checking for the CD as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"AMAZING!","review":"I have seen more versions of Les Mis than I can count. This was one of the best. The performances were moving, powerful -- just incredible. My favorite was Samantha Barks as Eponine. Not since Frances Ruffelle had I loved an actress' portrayal of Eponine so much. Banks' voice, emotions, expressions -- all of it was absolute perfection. I also thoroughly enjoyed Lea Salonga as Fantine, a role much better suited to her than that of Eponine. Alfie Boe made a great Jean Valjean -- very emotive. As for Nick Jonas -- yeah, he wasn't the best Marius I've ever seen. But he did a decent job, and it gave me more respect for him as an artist. He's been singing pop songs for too long; maybe if he stays on Broadway for awhile he can get up there with the greats. I would have liked him to deck the Thenardiers, though. I saw Marius do that at one show, at the wedding, and looooved it.In sum, if you love Les Mis, you'll enjoy this performance quite a bit."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bravo !","review":"It is a wonderful DVD that all Les Miserables fans must have. One can't help in comparing the current cast with the original cast (or the 10th anniversary cast). Nevertheless, the members of the 25th anniversary cast had brought different aspects to their roles. They radiated youth, emotions and ideals in their characters. Alfie Boe has a good voice and he interpreted Jean Valijean well. At the encore / finale, it is absolutely splendid to hear the stunning performance of \\"Bring Him Home\\" by the four Jean Valjean's. The singing of \\"One Day More\\" by Colm Wilkinson, the original 1985 cast and the 2010 team was another speculator performance."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing! - except Marius","review":"This is an amazing concert of Les Miserables. The only complaint is the stunt casting of Nick Jonas. He has a good enough voice but good doesn't hold up with the amazing voices of the rest of the cast. He sounds weak in comparison and looks like it takes way too much effort to get the songs out. I wish they would have used a professional and then this concert would have been perfect!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Les Miserables-25th Anniversary DVD","review":"I loved the 10th anniversary concert but the 25th - particularly in its BluRay version - is absolutely wonderful. Some of the reviews I've read have expressed disappointment in Nick Jonas' performance and I must concur - not the strongest, but at least adequate. This is a very small criticism, however. Overall this is a very beautiful and spectacular production. The joint performances with prior cast members during the encore are worth the cost of the DVD alone."},{"rating":"2","title":"wonderful","review":"We watched this on PBS, but it was wonderful to see it without commercials. It was almost as good as seeing in person."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not Quite The Same","review":"The quality of the DVD is perfect, the casting leaves a bit to be desired. Alfie Boe is marvelous but I was not thrilled with the rest of the cast. I loved the 10th Anniversary recording so maybe my prejudice is showing. Alun Armstrong just cannot be replaced as the inn keeper. (Has anyone ever discovered why the inn keeper and wife are Cockney in a French play?) The inn keepers wife appeared to be the only repeat from 15 years ago and she is still the best. That being said, if you love the music, you will enjoy this copy."},{"rating":"2","title":"I love this musical.","review":"A friend made me watch the 25th anniversary edition in College. I thought I was going to want to die, seeing as Nick Jonas played Marius. But it was awesome!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Performance!","review":"Was just a great show. Alfie Boe as Jean Valjean was superior. The best part was the end when the original casts came on stage."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enchanting version of Les Miserables!","review":"I heard this production on PBS and it is just fantastic! The singers along with the after concert excitement when 4 Jean Valjean's on stage was just wonderful.

No issues with the product. Received with in two days. Great Show!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderfully current","review":"Loved it. I first saw this concert on PBS March 2011, so I just had to get my own copy. So many wonderful new singers and some returning favorites make this a wonderfully current performance.Desipite those who criticize Nick Jones as Marius, I think it is refreshing. For the snobs who get all wigged out from the fact he is a \\"pop start\\", you might get your nickers unbound to know he cut his teeth in the Theatre (poo poo) in Les Mis, no less, as a child. I think his performance as Marius was accomplished - ok, anyone compared to Michael is going to fall short - but that shouldn't take away from the work Nick put into it. Give the lad a break. Should Nick wish to return to musical theatre fulltime, I think he could - he is certainly young enough to achieve many years of experience and have a brite future ahead of him. I get the impression we have not seen the last of Nick beyond \\"pop star\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Les Miserables... with Nick Jonas?????","review":"It should have been an amazing show.Everything was going exceptionally well and everyone was giving amazing performances.Untill..... Nick Jonas arrives at the stage.Who in their right mind casts Nick Jonas for such a show? This was a DISGRACE.I even felt sorry for the guy, trying to sing along with his amazing talented colleagues.I was so disapointed with his performance I did not even had the stomach to finish the Blu-Ray.I can't give more than a 2 Star rating because of this and I am sorry to say I will never recommend this to anyone.Buy the 10 Year aniversary DVD instead. That one is worth it.Don't buy this one. I'm sorry I did."},{"rating":"1","title":"One Good Reason Not To Buy This NICK JONAS as MARIUS!!!","review":"NICK JONAS AS MARIUS. What were they thinking in giving a role like Marius to Nick Jonas.... R U Kidding me... Seriously. Nick Jonas is standing next Ramin Karimloo and you can tell what a high school amateur he is. I really wanted to buy this but rented it on Amazon first to check it out and Nick RUINED this production. He's constantly looking off to the side as if he's reading the words off of a tele-prompter.I don't get it???Also Alfie Boe is a great singer, but the guy needs to take a lesson from Colm Wilkinson and learn when to use a little dynamics and not always sing the big stuff as BIG and as operetic as he does.IMO the 10th anniversary is far and above a much better show when it comes to the quality of singers. The one singer that really stands out is Samantha Barks as Eponine. Fantastic. If your a HUGE fan, than get it.. I still might... But I still can't get over Nick Jonas... UGH."},{"rating":"2","title":"Quick service for a great DVD!","review":"This is th 25th Anniversary Celebration of Les Miserables.I had seen it on PBS and it is fabulous!I ordered it and had it in two days-music and a storyyou'll never !"},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing","review":"First of all I think all the people hating on Nick Jonas are snobs. I am not really a fan of his but I think he did a decent job.This DVD was wonderful. Some of the songs are so amazing they bring you to tears. I've seen the musical on stage and this DVD made me feel as though I was there again.

Watch for Colm Wilkinson in the movie out now. And watch all the way to the end!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"By now, fans know every line of the score. Cutting sections leaves awkward gaps where the listener anticipates words that never come.Casting was also less than optimal. Visually, Norm Lewis has the sternness and the drive for the role of Javert, but his voice lacks the emotional range that made Philip Quast's performance so memorable. Nick Jonas seems to be winking at the camera in every frame. Alfie Boe brings youth and vitality to his role... but Valjean is better known for his resignation and weariness.The physical placement of the actors on the stage did little to enhance my appreciation of this version. I had a hard time seeing the intimacy between the characters when they were standing half a stage apart using separate microphones."},{"rating":"2","title":"get this edition","review":"Other than the Jonas brother attempting to stretch his talent this edition is well worth having in your collection.

I highly recommend this DVD!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This was an interesting DVD.","review":"It was a very interesting DVD. The Royal Albert Hall is incredible and the fact that it was an Anniversary Edition made it more interesting. I was surprised that the Singers just stood there in front of microphones rather than actually acting out the parts. The movie which is up for an Oscar was much more realistic and I loved the movie! The Music is lovely!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointed!!!!","review":"I thought the performances were going to be more realistic. What does Jonas has to do singing with all those actors-singers????. It is hard to believe!!!. When I go to a live play or musical the least thing I expect is to see credible performances and let me ask: who is going to believe that Salonga is the mother of a blonde child?, besides she still has her strong accent even when singing that I thought I was hearing to Pacquiao. Samantha Barks should be Fantine, period. Other point I want to said, most of the performances were just to step on the front and sing like when you go to a high school festival and listen to the students. The majority of the protagonists didn't act at all.Honestly, I don't recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Still have not received it yet","review":"May I get more information on when I can expect this particular item?

He isn't even close in vocal talent as the rest of the cast. He had short breathy phrases and had the same pained look on his face throughout. I was actually embarassed for him.

I think I'll get out my 10th anniversary concert instead!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad writing","review":"I know this review will probably be unpopular, but right from the beginning this play smacks of bad writing.

Originally, I was so thrilled to receive the 25th Anniversary edition and then after watching it I was blown away with how poorly the editing was done. It's too bad since the star studded cast had to have sounded incredible that night! Previously, I had watched it on youtube in segments and decided to invest in a copy. I feel like the YouTube segments were superior for sound quality than the real thing. Disappointing since there was such a talented ensemble."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor performance","review":"I tought it would be a great show, but to my surprise, I found out that the performance was rather poor in comparison to the previous live presentation (The dream cast in concert) in 1998."},{"rating":"1","title":"A dream cast it is not!","review":"Colm Wilkinson you are irreplasable!Wrong choise for Monsieur Thénadier.Nick Jonas as Marius, appalling!The 10th Aniversary concert at the Royal Albert Hall is the best!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Les Mis DVD Amazing!","review":"This DVD is amazingly wonderful!
