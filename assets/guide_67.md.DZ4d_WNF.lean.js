You don't have to read any more.Sony Classical worked hard to make sure Charlotte Church only sings two songs even though they promote her name heavily with this DVD.Sony Classical also worked hard to put in as much echo as possible. No doubt because Vanessa Williams and Tony Bennett need all the help they can get. That echo spoils the little singing that Charlotte does and it spoils all of Placido's singing. Maybe Sony Classical thinks that this sound track should be played with heavy echo on $... boom boxes.What a great missed opportunity for Sony Classical to have Placido Domingo and Charlotte Church sing a few christmas carols together on a DVD without distortion.There's obviously a lot of reasons why this DVD is now being heavily discounted.

This is the commonality of all Christmas songs which we look for when listening to such fare. Fortunately, 3 of the performers here, Tonny Bennett, Placido Domingo and Vanessa Williams provide us with this holiday necessity in a variety of favorites. The 4th, Charlotte Church, however, simply belts out some traditional songs with about as much warmth as a snowball. When I hear songs by an individual, I expect more than just a choir-girl rendition. If Miss Church is unable to meet this expectation, she should stay home, enjoy her Christmas and listen to those that do."},{"rating":"1","title":"Extremely fragile","review":"I bought two of these for storing coffee.

After having gone through three of these, I now use the remaining unbroken one to store bay leaves and keep it safely in the back of my kitchen cabinet.I bought two mason jars for coffee and for a total of $6 they work just fine.

Once removed, there were no bald patches, and no more tufts of hair have fallen out since (received it two days ago), so perhaps it is merely a nuisance.

I'm a side sleeper and have always used a twin size air mattress when camping, fine if you're car camping but not if you're hiking or biking. I was skeptical about using a mat and being comfortable for quite some time but decided with an upcoming bike / camp trip I'd take the plunge. First thing I did when I got it was open the valve and let it inflate. Took about 5-10 minutes and a couple quick puffs to fully inflate. I layed down and was instantly impressed with how comfortable it was. I'm not a small guy (6'1 & 225lbs) and was fully expecting to push through the mat and feel floor but NO. Even on my side I was still being supported by this mat. I'm sold on Therm-A-Rest from here on out. So much so that I even took a short nap on the mat in my home, on the floor, next to my bed :).I recommend this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't bother","review":"The cheap reed fell out the first time I used it.

Also, Hamsters lack teeth, they only have two bones that many people mistake as teeth. Hamsters are also vegetarians, which includes eating rice, dead insects and beans. Next to my pet Hamster, I love this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointing as Felix only makes a brief appearance.","review":"I purchased this video for my 3 year old as I wanted to introduce her to Felix the Cat as I loved watching him as a child. I was very disappointed with this video as Felix appeared briefly in the first cartoon (with very bad sound I might add) and after that it was followed with an assortment of obscure cartoons that don't feature him at all. Some of these cartoons were rather violent, for example one had someone's brother dying from thieves, another had a gun being used. Then again another one featured the character called \\"Injun Joe\\" which some might find offensive. My 3 year old luckily had walked out of the room in boredom prior to some of the more offensive scenes appearing. I don't think I will ever buy anymore Cartoon Carnival movies as now I know they will feature a popular character of their cover, but then submit you to a bunch of cartoons that couldn't be sold on their own merit."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dont Waste Your Money","review":"This DVD is just a stupid retaliation against Welcome to Death Row.

BUT, the writing is very amateurish and full of grammatical, punctuation, and syntax errors (among others). It was like slogging through quicksand to read it. The book must have been self-published because no editor would have let it go out with all the errors.A very good editor could make this an OK book, though not nearly the quality of Susan Kay's.Don't buy it unless you are a Phantom of the Opera collector and just must have everything published."},{"rating":"2","title":"I really liked it","review":"This is probably the best sequel I have ever read to Phantom of the Opera. It has a nice ending that is really different that I sort of saw coming but wasn't sure until the end. It is really nicely written even if it has a few problems. I think the author must be a fan of the movie with Gerry Butler, but I have seen the play lots of times with different leads and so I don't need all of those references to that actor. Still, it wasn't distracting to the point it took away from the story. We talked about this book at our monthly meeting and just about everybody liked it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Into the Dark","review":"A truly disappointing tale. Instead of Erik seeking a new life, the author has him plunging into the world he needs to leave---murder, thievery and deception! I believe a great disservice to phans and Erik has been done here. The author has failed to do primary research on Paris, let alone on beloved characters. The reference to Gaston Laroux was badly executed, the writing style left me totaly cold and unsympathetic to everyone, and if this is a follow-up to the movie, I did not see a glimpse anywhere of the wonderful actors who portrayed their roles with such brilliance. Perhaps Ms. Whitehead needs to see the film a few more times, as well as the play. While I fully accept that we all have our own version of Erik and various events, this particular story need not be counted into the millieu."},{"rating":"1","title":"horribly written","review":"I bought this item because it seemed more interesting than descriptions of other published Phantom fanfic.

Poor thing looks like she has been out in the sun for days. I called the Burt's to let them know about this and they gave me a case number and said that I could talk to customer service about it further. We will see what they say. They recommended that I take the bottle in to the pediatrician, and have my kids tested for allergies. Normally I love the Burt's products, but this one is a huge no for my kiddos! Works just fine on me. Spot test for sure!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Gave my 3 month old a terrible rash that lasted for weeks!","review":"I thought that by using a more natural product that I wouldn't have to worry about my son having a reaction, but I was sadly mistaken. After using this lotion my 3 month old son developed a contact rash which lasted for just over a month, which was very disappointing seeing as I was given quite a bit of Burt's Bees products at my baby shower and now will not use any of them for fear of this happening again. He was covered with red sores on his entire body after one use, and the poor guy was so uncomfortable! After this happened I began reading negative reviews that other mother's had written about this same product. Never again!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A great lotion!","review":"This is a very moiturizing lotion! At first it feels a little tacky on the skin, but after it sinks in all that's left is softness. It's long lasting too; 1 application will last for almost the entire day. This lotion is also GREAT on the face, believe it or not. I've used this everynight before bed (after a shower) on my face for the past 4 weeks and my skin has never been softer. There have been no clogged pores or breakouts (I have T-zone skin too), just really smooth skin. I also tried using it in the morning under makeup and the results were wonderful! My makeup applied very smoothly and and didn't run off later in the day like usual. I did however only give this 4 stars because the scent could be better. It has a creamy coconut scent to it, which is fine, but then there seems to be mint in the background as well which I don't care for. But that's a minor issue with all the benefits this lotions has. A definite staple product!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Rash","review":"This product gave my toddler a terrible chemical rash. Three weeks later, parts of his body are still inflamed.

My only problem with this particular product is that the pictures shows a PUMP bottle. I bought two because I wanted pump bottles which are easier to use than pop-top bottles.

It looked so very, very awful and he was clearly very uncomfortable where the bright, red, hot rash was. He kept itching and it looked dreadful. Did I mention it looked painful?!! Sorry, but it was bad. For being so natural, clearly many children are having this reaction. The redness was very hot to the touch, and I would liken it to a very bad burn. Great smell, but a terrible price to pay. Ouch!!! I was ready to run him to the ER for fear that he was in danger of a some sort of severe allergic reaction.

What a riveting tale! I could scarcely put it down. This is a memoir like no other.Although Dr. Novic chooses not to beat the reader over the head with psychiatry, the insight and clarity of this perspective come through on every page. 'Alice' takes the reader down the rabbit hole and approachs her new life as an eager and open-minded experimentalist, constantly formulating and testing each new theory. The reader is kept abreast of each exciting and terrifying turn, and ultimately we get to share in the same conclusions and triumphs. As a TG latebloomer myself, I found her story very inspirational.

Since we were going by train, excellent reading material had suddenly become a prominent issue. I'd hemmed and hawed and asked for recommendations (you'd have thought I was buying a car) before I stumbled on this one myself and knew I had a winner. In fact, I could barely put it down in the store!Richard's story of self-discovery alone is remarkable, but this book isn't only about that, it's also about how he and his wife found a way to strike a balance between his two distinctly different social spheres, which I admire.I've recommended this book to many and know that they have gone on to do the same. In fact, I'm having a hard time getting it returned to me as it appears to be making the rounds again!"},{"rating":"1","title":"No thanks","review":"Using crossdressing as an excuse to cheat on your spouse isn't good.

I ended up disliking 'Alice' due to her selfish bahavior. Not recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not about crossdressing -- a bisexual indulging himself.","review":"I have to agree wth the other one-star critics. This guy isn't credible as anything but a person who is trying to get the best of everything -- for himself. It goes from being episodes faintly helpful for and descriptive of a crossdresser, then turns into a non-stop search for men to go to bed with. From a few pages into the book, it just becomes one affair after the other -- with no regard for anyone else around him. And I do mean HIM -- I got the strong impression of a gay guy trying to justify himself by wearing women's clothes -- and just using the clothes and makeup to attract other men. I have absolutely no problem with gay people of either sex. This guy is just out of control. I consider the book a waste of money -- and time spent reading MOST of it, hoping it might get better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Marriage Vows","review":"What a one way street this guy/gurl is riding. So much for marriage vows. It's all about him/her. The book is well written but I can't help feel for his wife which he made a chump of. What does she get out of all this?

I devoured it as though it were filled with cream and covered with dark chocolate!I am a 43 year old crossdresser and I saw much of myself in Alice's story.

To hear her speak with such honesty, clarity, openness, reason and even enthusiasm and joy is truly inspiring!It is very good work."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply Fantastic","review":"I really could not put the book down. It was very informative and enlightening, and maybe helped me to understand myself a little bit more and put things into perspective.

We bought it after \\"nursery rhyme month\\" at daycare, and it really helped to give her the repetition she needed to memorize her favorite rhymes, especially considering that her parents didn't know any of them. I didn't know more than the first verse of \\"Mary had a little lamb\\", and now I know all four paragraphs of it and we can both sing it at the top of our lungs, as well as many other well-known and even some relatively obscure nursery rhymes/songs.

It's an ok CD, but I would recommend looking elsewhere for other Greek wedding songs."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Album Title is FAKE","review":"The contents of the CD and the cover name is not matching. The songs are NOT Greek Wedding Songs, and the Main Title of the original CD is NOT Greek Wedding.

If adjusted so that they were covering more in the front, then they tend to ride up really high in the back and stick way out of my pants. They have a cute look to them, but aren't that flattering on. I suppose if you were someone who wears your pants up past your belly button (or if you just wanted to wear them as lingerie and not under clothing), then these might work for you. The writing on the tags and stuff is in spanish as well, which I found to be a little bit annoying, as well as how much they cost to ship. I bought 3 pairs from the same seller and it cost as much to ship them (all in the same tiny plastic envelope) as the actual panties cost. I really wouldn't recommend."},{"rating":"2","title":"What can I say.........Tremendous, Brilliant and Fantastic!","review":"Buy it!!

I've actually been reading one section a day to my 4 year old son and he's starting to understand, I think. This is a book that needs to be given to those you know who are searching for significance or have undergone something which makes them question God and maybe rebel against Him.I like that each chapter as \\"going deeper\\" questions and there is a chapter about the steps for the new believer. Great book.I received a copy of the book for review purposes. No additional compensation has been received and I was not required to write a positive review."},{"rating":"2","title":"OH MY GOODNESS!","review":"Now this is what I'm talking about - REAL Praise and Worship.

There are new and unconventional ways to view life's circumstances on every page."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unbelievably Uninteresting (yawn)","review":"This book was a disappointment. I was expecting a self-help style book about positive thinking and concrete steps one could take to decrease any innate sense of anxiety about life. Instead, this book reads like Zap Comics from the 1960's. It has a \\"stoner\\" feel to the writing (if you can call it writing: lots of choppy one sentence phrases interspersed with cartoonish drawings). This book is simplistic, contains little wisdom and is written at the eighth grade level. If your teen child smokes weed they might find it fun. But otherwise, it's not for the mature.I would have sent it back but the return postage was about what the book cost. At least I was able to recycle it."},{"rating":"1","title":"painfully bad","review":"I really really tried to like this book. I couldn't and I can't. Author is alway HIGH. No one is always high. Right at the beginning I said to myself this man sounds as if he is on speed. Then I opened the book randomly to read some more and lo and behold, he was discussing being high. Enough. I want to be high on life and you don't need a million words repeated in assorted ways to get there.I loved the reviewer who burned his copy rather than have it loose in the world. Seems fitting. Wish I had done that."},{"rating":"1","title":"Complete and utter nonsense","review":"This book is a random collection of contrived nonsense clearly meant to cater to a very gullible audience. I find no value whatsoever within its ramblings and, if you are a thoughtful and critical person, neither will you. I hate to crash this feel-good party that is clearly marketed towards the idiotic Baby Boomer \\"spiritual\\" crowd, but you can find more wortwhile life lessons by watching paint dry. That so many people take the presumption at face value that the world is an inherently loving place and you can get all the blessings you want by just by believing in this drivel, is something that makes me very paranoid indeed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nonsense","review":"I bought this book because of the great reviews.

I have always loved Rob Brezny's Free Will Horoscopes, since the first time I discovered them in a weekly paper in Minnesota. I love that they are cheerfully intense and profoundly lighthearted. I love that they always surprise and yet resonate with truth.This book is the cure for the insanity that masquerades as normal modern life. When I am feeling out of sorts, I flip open to a random page and before you know it I am feeling out of sorts in a much more positive and enjoyable way. It shines a light on the real reality, the present moment, which is all that we have, isn't it?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful & Innovative","review":"Might take me a lifetime to actually read this book but since the book is simply a magnificent cornucopia of wisdom & delight, a lifetime to read, reflect, scribble notes about and integrate into my living seems just about right. Highly recommend."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pronoia now and then","review":"Every time I pick up this book and start to read, my mood changes. These wise words pull me right out of any of the shadows that the world can send my way. I begin to feel lighter and less worried about the state of the world. I feel hope and maybe even start to hum a ditty. Even if the universe is not constantly sending blessings our way, it can be enough to consider the posibility. I have worked for the last twenty years with the criminally mentally ill. This book is a good anidote to that toxic environment. The expanded edition makes this tome worth another read. The author came upon many of his ideas through the experience of the event called Burning Man. If you can't make it there do the next best thing and read the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Delicious Surprises","review":"I love this book. It brings me joy, it makes things more real, more complete, more full.I can open up this book to any place and find something inspiring, goofy or meaningful. I can open it up and learn about myself. I use it to write in - sometimes, I use it to inspire me.I laugh from reading it. Sometimes it's too weird and I shut the book. Sometimes things in it make more sense than I know how to explain. Most of the time it's a fun adventure and a kind of wacky romp.The thing I love about this book is that reminds me that I am human, that life has hope. And it's just wonderfully awesomely weird."},{"rating":"2","title":"Let your life be an adventure, not a task.","review":"Don't take life too seriously! Enjoy the process of living!

I've always enjoyed reading his horoscopes, and I look forward to them mainly for his unique and fun information and personality. This book is chock-full of that.It's a real comfort-book to savor like fine wine or dark chocolate, (with no calories!) after a long day.Enjoy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Helpful doses of positivity","review":"This book is great because you can pick it up and put it down at your leisure. You don't have to read it cover to cover for it to make sense, and I like this kinda freedom. Having a bad day? Flip to any page for good advice. If you obsessively check your Free Will Horoscopes every week, I suggest buying this for more \\"ah ha!\\" moments of clarity. We live in such a negative world, we NEED someone like Rob to tilt us in the positive direction."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tried to like","review":"I very much wanted to like this book, but it's really corny, doesn't go into great depth, and I found myself doubting many of the \\"facts\\" the author cites that are supposed to surprise me and/or make me feel good. But if you want a book with lots of kooky feel-good exercises, and you're really, really, really into the Burning Man Festival, you will probably like this book.Also, I get the feeling that the author is one of the many neo-hippie types who believes that in order to be liberated, a woman needs to be willing to sleep with just about anyone, particularly him, and not necessarily expect a call the next day. Not that I was looking for sexism, but it bugs me when I find it, and the fact that there isn't much of interest in this book for me makes its flaws stand out all the more.I do like my weekly Free Will Astrology horoscope, though."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointed -- too far \\"out there\\" for me","review":"Don't get me wrong. I'm not new to New Age writings -- quite the opposite in fact, which is why I was so pleasantly intrigued with the premise suggested in the book's title and subtitle. With the author's writing style, though, I couldn't go more than a few chapters in before I realized I was growing increasingly skeptical and annoyed. Frankly, the writings read (to me) like someone who was extremely high when they were written or, less charitably, by someone who was mocking his readers.I choose to believe the author's intentions were good, and will only say that my approach to the subject matter is apparently considerably more pragmatic than the author's, um, esoteric approach.You'll find this same review by me on the same author's \\"Televisionary Oracle\\". That's not an accident -- his writing style completely puts me off."},{"rating":"2","title":"A breath of fresh, unadulteratedly positive, air!","review":"Thank you, Mr. Brezny! My partner bought two copies, one for himself and one for me, as Christmas presents. I have to say that your viewpoint on life itself is superbly positive and is very much needed by a world in need of some serious joy medicine. I'm a pretty cheerful person myself, but you sir have taken it a step further. BRAVO!"},{"rating":"2","title":"the first page had me shouting YES!","review":"I've been a huge fan of Brezny for years. When i got my hands on Pronoia, I started shouting on the very first page - as usual, he had me happy and believing life is what you make of it and oh, what a joyous life it can be if you just change your attitude and open yourself to the possibilities that life has to offer - there is a bigger, happier picture.Not a book to read chronologically - I like cracking this one open to see what I get, though that opening chapter may actually be my absolute favorite part of the book, anyway!I took it to a women's group I am a part of and read the first chapter as the beginning to one of our gatherings - we've taken on Rob's cheer to be wilder, wiser, kinder and trickier and made it our own. It's not a half-bad goal, really.I like to think of this book as the \\"Be Here Now\\" of our generation."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing","review":"I absolutely love this book!

As soon as I got this book, I HAD to read it from cover to cover. However, the way it is laid out allows you to just dive in wherever your heart desires.I like how the book is somehow \\"interactive\\". Plenty of room for you to jot notes, lots of suggested \\"challenges\\"...But the book isn't just a long list of do this and don't do this.There are quite a few interesting stories and news items here...and not the gooshy tugging heart strings stories.Some might find this book a little silly-- but hey, silliness is a part of life! Just read the book with a grain of salt and pick out what works for you.

This kit is very easy, 1st turn off the water before you start, just make sure you polish the pipe so it is smooth before installing the kit or you might have a leak later. I recommend using nu shine to polish the pipe. Also make sure you put the bolts on tightly that clamp onto the pipe. The kit comes with extra parts in case you drop something on the floor and loose it like I did. The kit shouldn't require teflon tape, just make sure everything is on tight.

All i needed were two adjustable wrenches."},{"rating":"2","title":"Unclear directions; difficult to install","review":"This took at least an hour to install, including the time it took to drill passageways through my cabinets. Overall, I'm satisfied. I did become frustrated during installation, which doesn't happen often with me. The directions were somewhat unclear: each plastic baggie had parts of the directions on them, rather than them all being in one place. Once it was finally installed, water leaked out of both ends. I had to take both ends apart and use pipe tape to create a tighter seal. I'm glad I knew enough to use pipe tape, otherwise I would have had to take it all apart and send it back. So take my advice and use some pipe tape! Now that it's all finished, I'm pleased with the final result.

It is one of the few audiobooks that I chose not to finish. I am not 100% sure whether it was the reader with his overly whiney Phoebe or the writing. People in other reviews said they couldn't wait to see what happened. When I turned it off, I was almost done CD 1 and they were covering some smile contest, there was no suspense or tension. Adam is/was mildly jealous of Phoebe and there was some hint of upcoming drama over a donation made to the school.

It was printed only in 1944, after Cdr Hichens was killed in action.So, the details are vague, there is NO date, and unfortunately we can not have details ( cross-check ) from the Kriegsmarine losses.There are very few photographs, mostly of old models of MTB and MGB; but the ideas of the tactical role of those \\"fast vessels\\" can be fully appreciated by the lector.This is a very rare book that I fully recommend for all those who collects WW2 books and appreciate them like very rare and old wines...but do not expect too much from it though."},{"rating":"1","title":"Little informaiton","review":"I was a bit disappointed with the quality of this video.

Toddlers will bend toys if they are bendable! When we taped the tools back together, they no longer fit into their slots.This seems to be a book that evolved from the author's great idea into the publisher's slick package. In the end, it is frustrating and sadly impractical for its recommended age group."},{"rating":"1","title":"Would need constant supervision","review":"Got it to give as a Christmas present but decided to take this one back. Great concept, I'm sure a lot of kids will love the book, but bear in mind the other reviews that caution about how easily the tools will fall apart, this book will have a fun but limited life span! It might be good to bring out at special times for parents and children sharing a book together, quiet time, etc. You couldn't give kids the book and have them play with it unsupervised for very long before something would get broken.

However, it should first of all be noted this book is less than four inches high! I found the book just too overwhelming small and frustrating to bother with and certainly not worth the price.If the reader truly wants value for their dollar, I highly recommend any and all of the books by Desmond Morris, such as \\"Cat Breeds of the World.\\" Readers should not be disappointed in any of his books.

If you put enough holes and slots in them, well it will fit just about anything. The pins for height adjustment have fallen out so many times I had to replace them with screws and lock nuts. I wish I had done this before I ran over them with the mower. I also used a threaded rod between the wheels to straighten them and give more support.I emailed Eazy Mow with no response.I'm not a complainer, just a dissatisfied customer with a poor product and out $70."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good idea, flawed design, no good on uneven ground or dense grass","review":"I liked this idea, but as others said they only work on flat level surface. If you don't have a flat level surface you end up fighting to keep the mower where you want it. Also the hard small wheels sink into thick/dense (not tall) grass making the mower hard to push (even with self propelled) and this results in an uneven cut and gouges in your turf. Maybe with larger/wider/softer wheels this would work on thick/dense grass, but my healthy lawn is too much for them and I've had to remove them.

Thanks.......","review":"Ditto to all of the the other reviews praising this product. See my photos of my curvy landscaping and take my word that it is very easy to maneuver now with the swivel wheels installed. Installation was a snap, and I actually trimmed the mounting bracket to get the wheels closer to the deck for maximum clearance in corners and tight areas, but it lined up perfectly. A retaining pin didn't retain so well, so the manufacturer immediately sent a replacement which was also appreciated. It takes a little more concentration on the straight-away runs, but the improved performance in the curved and corner areas is awesome. You won't regret this very reasonably priced upgrade to make your mower perform like a much more expensively priced factory swivel mower."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible product","review":"At any case, you will most likely need to modify your lawn mower to fit this kit which requires you to drill a few holes. The kit is a joke, these people that give this product a 4 or 5 stars should not of rated this product. First of all the pins that keep the wheels together will continue to fall apart, you will also have to find a way to modify the pins to make sure their secure. For me i have to weld everything to make it secure.The worst thing about this product is, the metal frame is not strong enough, if you have a lumpy lawn, the metal frame might bend alot, which cost you alot of time trying to hammer it back to straight.Product does not worth what their asking for.

That solved the problem! Now, the computer runs for hours.

Every section of the story ends with one couple or another becoming \\"sky-clad\\" and releasing their passions. There are several couples in this story and they're all completely devoted to one another as the author makes clear time and time again.

It is quite short (half an hour?) Only one or two points or parts of points are shown per each year of the US open in the 80s. Despite the lack of time in which to actually present any meaningful tennis, the producers did choose to show you extensive views of the the spectators, almost as much time is devoted to showing you the crowd scene as the tennis. Also they do a little review of the non-sports events of each year (Reagan was elected president etc. etc.) that takes up more precious time. The result is that almost no tennis is on this video. I have no idea who they thought would appreciate this dog. A complete waste of time and money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Smart, witty dialogue with an excellent supporting cast","review":"A movie that is just a lot of fun.

He brings life to many of the famous and less-than-famous defenders. He also describes the political climate in Texas and the United States and why the Battle of the Alamo, a loss for the Texans, was so important in Texas' journey to independence.Just as importantly, though, Lord continues the story beyond the fall of the Alamo.

This book has loads of information, it has 15 Lessons, and at the end of each lesson there is about 4 Lesson questions, and then a lesson examination. I found that this was a very helpful tool in remembering what you have read. There is a large amount of rituals and spell ideas, as well as the history of Wicca, and Witchcraft. One thing that I found bad about this book, in my opinion was that it was centered a lot around covens. A lot of the rituals were for coven use. The only time he says anything about Solitary Practitioners is in the very last lesson, Which is about 5-10 pages long. I find this a little degrating considering most Wiccans are Solitary. But, if you are planning to join a coven, then this is a very good book for you to read. Therefor, If I was planning on joining a coven, I would have rated this book a 5."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very little value of as an occult work.","review":"This text may be the work singularly most reponsible for the propagation of the Wiccan myth. That is, it is incredibly famous in the Neo-Pagan community (not the genuine occult community) and has done more damage to the Craft than good. This book and its clones have cut both our legitimate Wiccan friends and Wiccan elitists off to the rest of the occult community by ignoring the fact of the hundred of Non-Wiccan magickal systems do exist and some are older than Goddess cults. Besides being dry the magic is non-scientific and the histories propel an anti-science, anti-Christian feel, even though in other areas the book specifically says this is not its aim. In short, only fair as an introductuion to Wicca, and pure trite as an intoruduction to occultism on the whole. Even more damaging to the true Wicca than it is to those of us in Non-Wiccan magick."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is NOT a good book","review":"I'm sure that there are worse introductions to Witchcraft, but this is probably one of the worst. Buckland doesn't stop at plugging the tradition he created, Seax Wicca. He commits the crime of being boring. If you want to read an introduction to Witchcraft, read Scott Cunningham's Wicca or Silver Ravenwolf's To Ride a Silver Broomstick. If you want to find out about Seax Wicca, try Raymond Bucklan"},{"rating":"1","title":"Eh...","review":"How bland, how dry, how self-absorbed. This is a happy little introduction to something that is frankly somewhat dangerous, scary and powerful. NOT happy, safe and whimsical. This is not a serious book by any stretch and does more harm then good. It was written for an 8 year old mind. Try Mastering Witchcraft by Paul Husen for more realistic and relevant information. It does have some info, but don't delude yourselves, witchcraft is for real and needs to be taken far more seriously."},{"rating":"1","title":"To non-Gardnerians","review":"This book is not good for anyone wanting to practice ecclectic (AKA Solitary) wicca Buckland emphasizes covens and even states that Covens are the only way to practice. The information in this can be detrimental to anyone looking to get into Wicca simply because of it's bias. If you're interested in the Gardnerian tradition of Wicca then this is a good book for you. However if you're like I was looking for good information to use in solitary practice you might find yourself out of luck."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best book on the market for beginning Wiccans","review":"Whether you are in a coven or a solitary practioner, this book is a \\"have to have\\" publication.

I didn't even get a quarter of the way before I traded it in for another book on Wicca. It's just another case of blah blah blah me me me.

I don't want to be sold Wicca."},{"rating":"1","title":"Complete?","review":"I'd say it is well written to convince the novice and even some intermediates that eveything in it is correct and \\"complete\\". It is not. It simply shows that people will buy whatever they are looking for no matter the truth or fiction of it all without even investigating the information. One shouldn't take this book as 'gospel' should I say? If it were so complete and so rigid in truth, then why is the same author continuing to put out other books filled with nonsense saying that they also are true. The only Craft I see being used in all these books by the Bucklands is Craftiness in Writing Skills. Keep up the good work. You page claims over a million in print of all your works. Good Paycheck eh?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Anti Family / Anti Love","review":"This book has the nerve to tell us that Wicca is a family religion because your coven becomes more important than your real family. It encourages teans to turn against their parrents in exchange for artificial bonds that will inevitably fail when you need them most.I am sickened at the word \\"Complete\\" in the title as if the author is the Pope of Witchcraft. This is most certianly not complete as it contains none of the heart and soul that this beautifull religion offers.But then again, what should we expect from an author that has flat out said there is no room in the craft for homosexuals? Skip this one and purchase either Cunningham, Farrar, or Drew."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful Book on Witchcraft","review":"This was truly a wonderful read. I haven't read a book on the magickal arts this good since reading 'Memetic Magic' by Kirk Packwood.

A little difficult for beginners though."},{"rating":"1","title":"Would you buy a used religion from this man?","review":"Buckland's book is crap. If you are not into 'Saxon' wicca, and not into being told one true way, this is not the book for you. 95% of his quotes are from his own works, his history is shaky where it isn't outright wrong, and his ethics are more than a little shaky. For those who are interested in anything besides Gardnerian wicca and its offshoots, it's not quite useless. Though as a beginner book it's worse that useless since it predicates one true religion of Wicca. Pfaugh. Pick up 'The elements of...' series, and take a look at \\"Drawing Down the Moon&quot...."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible","review":"TERRIBLE TERRIBLE TERRIBLE!!!

Experienced Wiccans can find the information elsewhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buckland needs some help","review":"I would probably use this book if I were writing a ritual and wanted a variety of ideas (there are some good tidbits). I would definitely NOT use this book as a guide for someone just beginning to seek into Wicca. It's pedantic, dry and dull. Buckland can't get past his own tradition of Seax-Wica, and although he does plenty of grousing about other traditions incorporating Ceremonial elements he seems to have a real ceremonial hangup of his own. It was also patently dangerous and very irresponsible for him to reccommend Culpeper as a guide for those wishing to practice *modern*, *medical* herbalism. Misguidance like that is the last thing the Craft needs, which is why Buckland should have been extra-careful to avoid slipups. Well, he wasn't."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book, to say the least.","review":"I must say this is one of, if not the best books, I have ever read on the subject. I have read many.. none compare. I don't agree with every word but over all I have to says it's great. It takes you from the very basics of the religion to a mid-level to advanced place. That makes it a good book for the beginner to a mid-level witch. I think anyone can pickup a great deal from this book. It's brought to you in a very good, easy to understand way. I've got more from this book than anyother and this is the first I would recommend. As a Wiccan of over two years I give it 5 stars (more if I could)."},{"rating":"1","title":"used to be good","review":"This book used to be part of the reading list of my coven and was essential training material for neophytes for the last decade.

If you've read one of the \\"wicca 101\\" books, you've read them all. By the definitions laid here I would be a solitary witch and legitimately. This is one of the books I had seen in stores as a teenager that caught my attention when I first got into witchcraft as a teenager. I would say to get started practicing wicca this is easily one of the best books on it that gives explanations of the different tools of the trade. And more importantly it shows the student how to make their own equipment. Though these days you can get better quality items that will last a long time and still look new on online occult shops."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not recommended for buying","review":"I read this book because my wife is into Wicca, and I wanted to see what it was about, and to support her. I have also read a couple of her other Wicca books, but for Buckland's Complete Book of Witchcraft, I found it was way too opinionated.The author makes a point then tells the person how it should be done by his terms. Also it is very boring to read, I kept jumping over pages and even chapters. Even though I am not into the Wicca religion; I enjoyed reading Scott Cunningham books more.I also know when someone chooses a path to follow, it is for him or her to discover and grow; it is not to be forced upon by what the author wants his reader to do, and this author want his reader to do it his way."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worthless Reading","review":"What a lot of horse puckey!

I didn't like it at first because it was black and white and it wasn't covered with pictures. Colorful pictures may be the only thing that this book is lacking. It gives an abundance of information on almost everything you can think of. The author doesn't go abysmally deep into the subjects, but for a really well-rounded book, this is definately a must-have for a first time (and older, maybe twenties) witch. The lack of color threw me off when I was younger, but now that I look at it (I am older now), it has so much information, that I can get a lot out of it!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Complete?","review":"Witchcraft is NEVER complete. Paganism changes all the time as the Universe expands...so too does WitchCraft which by the way actually is the \\"Craft of The Witch\\". It's so easy to propagate one's own ideas but readers should understand that belonging to a real pagan community and learning first hand is the real process, not purchasing a book written by someone who claims to have the complete information and certainly not by someone who makes up their own Craft because Paganism is pre-Christian, not a belief 'made up' in this century. People should ask real questions of the people who write these books. For instance...where they got their information and how much of it came from their own imagination and better yet find out where their coven is and how to attend. You might just find out what you need to know."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not recommendable for beginning Solitary practioners","review":"This is the first book I read on the Craft, and I wish it wasn't. All of the rituals in this book can only be done if you are in a coven. Granted there is a very short section discussing solitaries, but it's useless. Fortunately I had purchased another book from Scott Cunningham for beginners. There is better understanding and he doesn't force his opinion on you as Buckland does."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"Complete\\" If You Happen To Be Raymond Buckland","review":"Nevermind all the hulabaloo that surrounds a Big Name Pagan. Buckland's full of himself and a lot of other stuff, too, and this comes across in the pages of this book. For starters, it is the most pompous and boring book on the Craft I have ever read. His \\"style\\" is stiff with an almost touch-me-not aura. Let me also point out that this is no book on general witchcraft. It is a tome on the brand of the Craft Buckland invented himself, Seax Wicca, and won't be every witch's cup of brew. I'm always amazed at how any book on the Craft can lack passion, and this is the most passionless out there. Should I even mention the ritual bondage associated with initiation? Symbolism, sure. Bondage is bondage and has no place in a practice where all are equal. Read this if you must but please supplement it with other more liberal renderings of the Craft."},{"rating":"2","title":"AWESOME Beginners book","review":"Buckland's Complete Book Of Witchcraft is just what it says it is, a COMPLETE book of Witchcraft. Obviously made for the student, it covers many important points in the whole of Witchcraft such as Herbalisism, History, Craft Names, Sabbats, Divination, and most importantly, the many practices of Magick. After a lesson, there are workbook questions given on the learning points covered in that lesson. This makes it extremely hard for a beginner not to understand the lesson, while also making it easy to remember the lesson. One note: a serious student may wish to buy a tape recorder or digital voice recorder for the questions as it is much easier to talk than write. If any person has bought the book and found it too technical, I suggest also buying beginner's books from Scott Cunningham, as he covers more of the spiritual aspects of the Craft. Overall, this book must honestly be considered a \\"must-have\\" for a Witch's bookshelf. -Ingrid"},{"rating":"1","title":"If I Could Give It 0 Stars, I Would","review":"When I purchased this book, I had already read Thea Sabin's Wicca For Beginners and was looking for information to augment that. (I had also already read Cunningham's Wicca and Living Wicca.) I had heard a lot of praise for this book, and ordered it.I was severely disappointed with the book to put it mildly. I began to read it, and the sheer amount of dogmatic thinking and condescension in his tone immediately made me want to close it. I skimmed through the rest of it to see if I could find anything useful, but what little that was useful I could find explained much better elsewhere.This book is a bad buy, and should not be purchased by anyone who is seriously looking into Wicca. I highly reccommend Thea Sabin's book, as that book is much more comprehensive than any beginning Wicca book I've read. Cunningham is ok, but even reading both of the books I mentioned above won't cover completely everything Sabin covered in her book."},{"rating":"2","title":"great read","review":"This is a great starter book for anybody starting off in the craft.

We're new, folks. Deal with it.Buckland is also, if I may quote my good friend Sannion here, \\"nauseatingly self-referential\\". You'll find he quotes his own books far more often than any even remotely modest human being would, and he often goes into an extremely dismissive tone when talking about anything that isn't directly related to his interpretation of the craft.The herbal section might help you out, as could the rituals, but I recommend avoiding this thing like the plague if you've got a more than basic understanding of Wicca."},{"rating":"1","title":"If I would have known...","review":"If I had known how focused this book was on Buckland's tradition, I would not have bought it. I was looking for an intro, like the page described. Students who truly are at the introductory level should not herded to one tradition. Cunningham's book is much better if you don't want to be one of Buckland's sheep."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Whichcraft Library \\"Must Have\\"","review":"While hardly the \\"be-all, end-all\\" of Witchcraft information, Buckland's compiled research is an extremely useful tool, and a must for the foundation of anyone interested in the craft.Durk Simmonsauthor \\"Strings of Connection: Book 1 of the Witches in America Series\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"School Book","review":"This book offers all the necesary to practice the Wicca Tradition, like a school manual but with examples of Seax Wica a Buckland creation. (you try to read a site of Seax Wica tradition for your opinion.Then you read this book and practice the lessons you will consider a Wiccan"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Workbook for the Ages","review":"An excellent place to start, but not to all tastes. I found some \\"new\\" information here, but as an eclectic witch of many years experience, I found the workbook format, as in children's school texts, to be a bit insulting. I do recommend it, however for the beginner with good reading skills, since it is not meant to be a witchchild's primer. However, the novice witch must realize that there are some forms of ritual and rite here that are specific to Buckland's version of Saxon Witchcraft, and differ from other, equally valid, forms. Brightest Blessings!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not waste your time buying this book","review":"When I bought this book, it had a basic edge to it. I was new to the craft, and that book looked like it could help me on my 'magickal quest' It didn't, It is not a book for beginners and it's not usefull to those with experience. Buckland leads you to belive that 'this is the way it is' but thats NOT the way it is. Wicca is open, a way of life but at the same time something that you create to fit your life style, He though, does not give you that impression. If your a beginner, go out and buy a book from Silver RavenWolf, like To ride a magick broom stick. Not only does that book get 5 stars, it DOES give the basics a beginner should know."},{"rating":"2","title":"COOL BEGINNER'S BOOK ON WITCHCRAFT","review":"Buckland's book is a cool beginner's book on witchcraft. He covers a great deal of territory in this resource book. I bought Sirona Knight's book Empowering Your Life with Wicca just before I bought this one and the two books are perfect complements to one another. Buckland's book is more traditional and Knight's is more New Age. I think everybody who wants to get into Wicca would find Buckland's book (and Knight's book) useful and very helpful. This is the kind of book you can refer to over and over."},{"rating":"2","title":"My workbook for Wicca 101","review":"Literally my workbook for Wicca 101, This book explains everything. Not only magick, but the history of the craft. The only complaint I have about this wonderful book is it focuses on Gardnarion a little bit too much. Aside from that, you can adjust various rituals and rules in it to suite your tradition. It also includes questions at the end of each chapter to test what you have learned. An excellent book whether you are a beginner or 3rd degree."},{"rating":"1","title":"Outdated","review":"This book was writen many years ago to introduce people to the Gardnerian Tradition of Wicca - even the title of Bucklands book is misleading! This book CAN BE of use for everyone interested in the Gardnerian or Alexandrian Tradition of Wicca. If you look for \\"basic training\\" and good beginners books - look elswhere!The book is outdated and much to complicated!"},{"rating":"1","title":"He just keeps reprinting it!","review":"Doesn't matter that Wicca's best thinkers chucked all ideas about \\"The Olde Religion\\" years ago, he just keeps reprinting his so-called \\"history\\" chapter. How can I take seriously a book or author that has no more respect for its readers than that?"},{"rating":"1","title":"nothing special","review":"i dont understand why everyone,thinks this book is oh so wonderful. imo it sucked. yes he covers alot of ground,but he doesnt teach you enough about anything,he acts like his tradition is the only tradition of wicca. plus is too full of himself,now being proud of your accompolishments is one thing but thinking you are the best thing in the craft is another."},{"rating":"1","title":"Money maker","review":"Why is it that the majority of these highly reccomended books on Wicca are basically the same thing over and over and over again. So much avialable material is \\"beginner\\" and hardly ever will you find anything that goes beyond casting a circle or this is the way it is because the author says so. That's pretty much why I bailed out of Wicca. It was fun while I was in high school and it gave me a card carrying membership to the Club of Oppressed People by that Evil Wickid Bad Christianity(well actually the ones who You-Know-Who-Says-He-Doesn't-Know)If I truly wanted something useful on old religions I could have gone to a college library and checked out books concerning old rituals by historians. And that would have been free as opposed to 14.95 per book."},{"rating":"2","title":"A fabulous start !!","review":"I have had Bucklands book for some time and it is always one that I recommend to curious searches as it educates on the History of Wicca and it's smothering by Christianity. It opens the eyes to the beauty and simplicity of Witchcraft's origin, and dispels the Satan association 'bull' (sorry !), which I think is still very much a strong 'conditioned' misbelief. The format of the book in sections or lessons is a good way to start a journey with may sometimes seem overwhelming. Buckland very much sooths the regimentation nerves with his 'whatever suits you' attitude. I didn't notice that he was offensively sexist, though as commented in by another reviewer, he is from an era that may have not been so non-egomaletistically (my own word!)inclined."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nate's Review","review":"ROFL Oh Nate, I absolutely loved your review.

ROFL"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waist your TIME!","review":"This book is not for beginers and it dose not help the more experanced. Out of the meany books I have bought on this subject this one was the worst! Being Wicca allowes room for you to make your own spells and to worship how you think is right. This book makes it sound that if you do not work magick his way you are doing it wrong! You have to dig through what he says to find anything useful. Don't take the time or the effort to bye or read this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Magical me","review":"I bought this book years ago when I was first interested in paganism and alternate religions. The writing is egotistical, pompous and condescending . On reading \\"The chamber of secrets\\" a couple years after I was convinced J.K. Rowling was having an inside joke by including a character such as Gilderoy Lockhart - It is just the epitome of Buckland. He is a bit too much of \\"My way is the only way\\" - to the point he quotes his own books.I gave it 2 stars as there is some good information in it - but it is far from complete. The parts on blindfolding, binding, and hanging certainly did not appeal; and the insistence that one needed a numerologically correct practicing name was a bit childish'"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not quite worth it","review":"This book gets a lot of publicity, and it would deserve it if it were the only book of its kind out there. But it isn't. This book has a pretty good section on making an athame, and everything else you can find in tons of other books explained a LOT better. The author does a good job of remaining impartial to any religious viewpoint, but as a result the book is no more than an information pamphlet written by a disinterested, unimaginative, and sometimes not very thorough author. I don't recommend this book for anyone actually trying to look at \\"Witchcraft\\" and get a feeling for what it is. This book doesn't do that at all. It just gives a lot of techniques that, in my opinion, don't really work that well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wake Me When It's Over.","review":"Buckland's too full of himself to give the subject an appropriate treatment. And besides, ritual binding and blindfolding? No, thank you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Unca Bucky's Big Blue Book","review":"I actually recommend this one to my students with the caveat that he is teaching his particular path of Seax-Wicca. He has some excellent parts to his book as well as some that may make you giggle. I have to admit that the foil helmet of the God caused me to laugh until I cried. Overall, it is a book I think needs to be on your bookshelf if you wish to learn about Wicca and Witchcraft as well."},{"rating":"1","title":"don't buy it","review":"for a book that calls itself a 'complete' guide to witchcraft, this is certainly lacking. rituals are too liturgy oriented, he basically discourages personal thought and imagination, and comes across as a 'fundamentalist witch', ie his way, or ways very like his way, are the only way. there's disappointingly little exploration or consideration of the philosophy behind wicca. he's also very self important, and claims to be .the. driving force behind modern wicca in america. nowhere near complete, often misses the point entirely. save yourself the money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disorganized and pompous","review":"Buckland claims his book will give you \\"the equivalent to a Gardnerian Third Degree,\\" which is not only overblown, but an insult to those who work many years for such degrees. Buckland, though, has a grudge against the Gardnerian tradition, which he airs on many pages, to his book's detriment.I suppose that wouldn't be so bad if Buckland's Big Blue Sleeping Pill was a worthwhile book, but it isn't. It's so poorly organized that when referring back to it to find an item to quote, I couldn't find it! Chapters seem to have random assortments of information, and there is no index.There are some useful practical pointers -- like how to make a horned crown -- but they're all jumbled together hither and yon. There are also some dangerous and stupid ideas -- like telling the reader it's okay and expected to feel weak and drained after performing a psychic healing! (This is a good way to make the healer ill.)There are so many books out there nowadays, that buying this one is a shame."},{"rating":"1","title":"Claims to be more than what it is","review":"This was one of those books which I had very high expectations for, but found very disappointing. I will say that it is better than most introductory books, and I do like the workbook aspect. However, the historical and theological information is just plain wrong. Buckland attempts an intellectual approach to Wicca, but ends up creating a work that is not nearly as intelligent as advertised."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must for someone who needs basic knowledge of the craft","review":"This book gave us the insite that we needed. It was the first book that we read, and gave us the knowledge to get started. It a must for someone needing the basic knowledge of the craft."},{"rating":"1","title":"Okay for reference sometimes","review":"As a solitary practitioner (and a beginner at the time), I didn't find much of anything useful in this book. I occaisionally go back to it for historical references, or to look at some of his holiday rites, but I haven't used it much at all. I also didn't appreciate the emphasis Buckland places on the necessity of tools, or the formality of his rites."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good book!","review":"I found it to be an excellent book as a starter. I just ignored the stuff I didn't agree with and adapted the other stuff to my beliefs. I was able to hold an intelegent conversation with other Wiccans as a result of this book. I liked it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This is a very good book for reference.","review":"This book is one of the best I have read. It is informative, not boring, and infinitely useful. This is a definite must for anyone of the craft."},{"rating":"1","title":"Welcome To Buckland 101","review":"This book is dry, flat, and quite boring. Buckland droans on like a stale college professor. If information about witchcraft is what your after steer clear of this book. His rituals and most information is geared for covens and not solitaries. Needless to say if you need a sedative, this will do the trick"},{"rating":"2","title":"It is an excellent reference book for anyone.","review":"This was the first book I bought when I began my search. I found it to be very helpful and insightful. Raymond Buckland is an excellent teacher, especially for those who know how to listen. It is a good thing to respect the knowledge and wisdom of earlier generations. I still use it as a reference book and recommend it to those just starting out. He gives a good overview of many subject areas"},{"rating":"2","title":"It's not that bad...","review":"Sure, there are better books out there... there always will be.The important thing is that it gives people who are unsure orjust curious a starting block. It is helpful from the beginning,and I still find myself going back to this workbook for tips orpointers. Respect must be given to Buckland for coming outin the media when it still wasn't safe.

As one should expect the recording process wasn't anywhere as good as it is today but this is still a good recording for a Classical music lover like yours' truly. The bass & horns aren't heavy as compared to you being there but this is still an excellent recording to have if you are a collector of Beethoven symphonies or you just happen to have a big interest in old, historical recordings. In fact, Oscar Fried's recording of the 9th Symphony is available on CD, too, from 1929. This also is worth having and is a much better recording than this CD of Beethoven's 3rd Symphony.

While I can't confirm it anywhere, the Stinger subsidiary of OTC appears to be OTC's home mechanic (read \\"cheap\\") line of tools. (Perhaps similar to the BluePoint line that SnapOn sells.) It's manufactured in Taiwan, not the US. The kit includes a 2\\" and a 3\\" splitter, but they are not the OTC 1122 and OTC 1123 splitters. Both the OTC 1122 and 1123 splitters are made in the US. The difference in quality is very apparent.

His character seems to like hurting and killing people out of curiousity, though, so it's alright when he's not going on about his past.

Jeri Ryan as Seven of Nine and Robert Picardo as the Doctor consistently get the best dialogue, perform the best acting, and star in the best episodes. Kate Mulgrew as Captain Janeway also gets consistently strong characterization, but the rest of the crew seems like they fell by the wayside.Season 5 started out with a really interesting premise, with Janeway in depression and the crew traveling through a starless void. This is exactly what I'd hoped to see more of in Voyager - the crew going through psychological stress on their voyage home. However, this tension only lasts for one episode before we get back to business as usual. What a wasted opportunity."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent","review":"Such a great episode.

My only complaint (worth a one star deduction) is not with the show itself but that of the DVD's. The discs I received had episodes burned entirely out of sequence. For example I would have episodes 201, 202, 204, and 205 on one disc. Episode 203 would be on an entirely different disc. Furthermore, the episode Dark Frontier was labeled episode 824 and was joined with episode 205, 209 and an empty episode slot.

The real fun of this episode comes from the fact that it's the EMH that is teaching Seven about Human relationships; obviously he is not qualified (though he thinks he is), as Tom said \\"...the blind leading the blind\\". And thanks to some wonderful writing and acting, Seven's first date felt authentic and it was even cute. I was grinning like an idiot this whole episode, and an instant classic for this series.I especially loved the moment @ 9:50....Robert Picardo is amazing :D"},{"rating":"2","title":"Another 2-parter, you know what that means?","review":"It means it's going to be really good ;) It's easy to forget that Seven of Nine was one of the first Humans to be assimilated by the Borg, and her family was one of the first to encounter them (year 2353-2356, Picard was assimilated 2366) What we get here are some flashbacks and history of Seven's family, their research and how they were able to study the Borg secretly. Very interesting stuff especially if you've been paying attention!A minor gripe I had was that Janeway's plan seems out of character, and it seems to come from out of nowhere. I wish the writers would have done a better job of catching the rest of us up on exactly how much the Borg had been pestering Voyager.

Perhaps this would be good for a new Christian who needed an easy introduction to studying God's Word. . .perhaps?

In reality, the seat is too high and the trike can tip easily. Also, he had a very hard time reaching the pedals and controlling the trike. If I could do it again, I would buy him a regular little tiny bike with training wheels instead. They actually are sturdier and sit lower to the ground."},{"rating":"2","title":"Do not buy this trike","review":"My daughter received this tricycle for her 3rd birthday. She enjoys riding it, when it is not broken. Metal forks split the front wheel, but the petals are attached to the metal forks by reinforced plactic joints which slide into the forks and hold the wheel onto the forks. The plastic joint has broken twice in six months, from normal use. While Radio Flyer has been helpful in sending replacement parts, and has now offered to reimburse for the cost of the tricycle, neither helps my daughter, who has a tricycle she cannot use. Shame on Radio Flyer for such a poor design!!Other reviews are also accurate in that the tricycle does tip over easily while turning and pedaling."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cute, but not safe","review":"We have been very disappointed with this trike. Not only will the steering wheel not stay positioned properly, but it is very tippy and dangerous. My son has had this trike for a year, and now at 3 it is still a hazard. Children sit up so high and the broad turning radius causes the trike to tip over very easily causing a big fall. We are going to buy a Kettler instead and anticipate better results. Cute to look at, but best left at the store, at least for 3 year olds."},{"rating":"1","title":"Handlebars are useless","review":"Must admit got seduced by the radio flyer name and thought this would be great for my 2 year old, and it does look nice. The only problem is that the bike is useless because the handlebar keeps coming loose and out of alignment. It is just poor design, b/c you cant tighten the bolt any more. Couldnt do anything with it short of welding the handlebars in place, so decided to swallow the $20 paid to amazon and buy a new trike."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ruby's Bike","review":"My husband assembled very quickly.

Putting it together was no problem until I got the the handlebars. Instead of the \\"old fashioned\\" bolt that held the handlebars in place, there is a ring that you slip around the tongue where it positions onto the bike. You tighten the ring to secure the handlebar in the forward position. Both my husband and I tightened the bolt as far as we could but the handlebars are still not as stable as I would like. When she gets off the trike, the handlebars turn independently of the front wheel. I would return this trike if I could find my receipt.The seat isn't real stable either. It twists from side to side.With research I'm sure that there are much better tricycles out there although I liked the retro look but my daughter's safety is more important."},{"rating":"2","title":"pedal problems","review":"I got this trike for my 2 1/2 year old. This is her first ride-on with pedals. But this is not the trike to learn pedalling on! The wheel rotates independantly from the pedals, hence, if you push the trike, the pedals don't spin, and, when my toddler tries to pedal she can't get momentum going because the trike will just coast without spinning the pedals with her. This same feature is quite dangerous because the toddlers it is designed for, may not remember to take his/her feet off the pedals to stop. When the child stops pedaling, it just coasts - think a two wheeler, if you don't hit the breaks, it keeps going."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not recommended","review":"High center of gravity makes it too easy to tip.

I fired the gun, and nothing came out. returned and got it fixed, took it back out of the box with a note that said was jarred. I tried again to see if they fixed it (by they I mean my retailer at Hobbytron.com) Samme thing happened. So I dismantled the rifle and salvaged what was still in good condition. When I got to the Gearbox, which was the problem in the 1st place, had a huge hole in it, and the gears were ruined.

But the battery isn't good. The grip is the only thing that's really good. The flash hider makes it look like an M4, but with out it, it looks like a weird SMG. The gearbox is fully plastic, so don't stress it out. The magazine has a design flaw that makes the first bullet not feed. Then those extra BB's can get jammed. The gun is just bad. Cause your in the middle of firing and it stops sending out BB's but the motor keeps running. I guess that's the cheap gear box. But it happens every time i put a new magazine in the gun.

Mag always leaves about 2,3 bbs unfired. Not a prob. Semi auto get jamed sometimes. Full auto shoot out fast YES! but not good for standard mag. the sling ischeap... but who needs it?

I was sure that he would have it broken within the week due to how rough he is with things but it is quite durable and fun to use. The only downfall that I would have to say is the laser sight. Its certainly for looks and something fun to play with but the switch came off the wire inside of 30 days - not that big of a deal. My son loves his airsoft gun and I would purchase this again."},{"rating":"2","title":"it was great","review":"it was great i liked it so much mine did not break the only flaw is that if you scratch the gun your scratch is white and you cant take it out"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as advertised","review":"I called and asked some questions about the item and when it arrived I found it to be far less than the description and what I was told on the phone.

The silencer (Supresser) nor the barrel would screw on to the end piece.It took atleast 5 minutes to reload it. The range and accuracy was beyond horrible. My Berretta shooting around 150 - 250 fps has more firepower than this.Lookwise was bad ass, setting up was a pain. It did not arrive with all included products (Was missing thee saftey goggles and I think a battery)."},{"rating":"1","title":"not happy!","review":"This gun is no good. One of the screws that hols in the back sight won't screw in. And the connection to the charger doesn't fit together correctly.

But unfortunately it is so Godawful inaccurate that the gun is useless. If you hold the rifle in one spot and shoot full auto, the BBs go in all different directions. On Semi it's a little better, but you can rarely hit the same spot twice. Also the battery charger has no instructions, so I had no idea when the battery was fully charged. I just waited until they got warm. I bought my kids some good Combat Machine M16 Carbines. They are way more expensive with no accessories, but they are more powerful, hold way more ammo and shoot dead-on accurate. Spend the money and get a good gun. Don't buy this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Heavy M4 M16 Replica Airsoft Gun Double Eagle M83 A2 Full Automatic Electric Rifle","review":"First airsoft I own. My kids and I love it.

For me since im in airsoft wars a lot it comes with a speed loader which helps and an extra magazine which helps even more. I would say the only downside is the accuracy, thats not too great. But still its a great deal and i recommend you go for it.

The next morning i finally had to dismantle the gun completely at which point it completely fell apart, with no way to put it back together. it is now in the dumpster and the company offered us $5 credit...ummmm, not good enough. Perhaps we received a bad gun but the company did not try to back up their product so that leaves a little bad taste in the mouth- not buying from them again.

There were no batteries in the box and only a few bb's were included NOT the 100 they said will be. The safety glasses that were included are cracked.

When we tried to troubleshoot the problem, we found that the gun we had received wasn't even a fully working airsoft gun, but basically a toy replica. Several of the adjustment knobs were cemented in place so they looked good on the surface but couldn't actually be used. This is a low-price rifle, but it was advertised as a working airsoft gun, not a toy imitation. The company did handle the return professionally.

I recommend emailing them, wait two days, and then call Amazon. They will make the company respond. I should be getting my money back, or at least amazon said so. Well, I know you don't want to hear it but you really have to just save up an extra 70 bucks or so and by a JG or something. In the long run, this will save you time and money.

Another thing that sucks about this gun is that as i was taking it out for a war the magazine fell out and smashed on the concrete (and that was only falling from 2 or 3 feet imagine what it would have been like if it had fallen from a greater height) I personally think that this gun should be able to withstand a 7 or 8 foot drop but I don't know about you.

As long as it doesn't break after 2 days..","review":"When I got my gun I was thrilled.. I have quite a bit of experience with airsoft.. I play a lot of battles with my friends and I have had about 15 guns.. Most of them were spring so this was only my 2nd or 3rd electric.. It shot relatively hard but not too hard i thought the clip was empty and i shot myself in the leg from about 6 inches away and it hardly stung.. I have a pistol with 200 fps and it makes holes in cardboard, this gun does not. I mean its 40$ which isn't bad at all but mine broke 2 days after i got it.. When I tried to shoot it would just make this shooting sound but when i took out the clip it was full.. I gave it a two stars because it was a good gun for 40$ but I would prefer it to last more than two days.."},{"rating":"2","title":"Passed My Inspection","review":"I recieved my M83 in two days, even though I ordered 6 to 7, so it was off to a good start.

They were high grade to! The de-jamming rod that was reliable got stuck in the gun and I can't get it out. The handle that is pictured on the bottom of the gun is so low quality that the thing broke along with a good chunk of the bottom. Like a concerned guy I tried to glue it up but the glue oozed in the battery chamber so I can't take the battery out.

It is inaccurate to a substantial degree and sprays bb's every direction. I even recall the feeding of the rounds to be awful, you can just hold the trigger and you will get one bb out every 3 or so shots, it's ridiculous. Double Eagle is a low grade company that makes either beginner stuff or just really cheap stuff, i would not recommend this to anyone and there are many better rifles out there for a better price guarenteed. Also i remember never getting the A.C.O.G. scope to even work at all! I put new batteies in i spent hours trying to get it to work but no result.

Then a month passed by, no word from them, I had to email back twice to get a statement that they will not honor their warranty.

The volume also changes from louder to softer so there is a constant change. I love the instruments themselves from plucking instruments to nice background percussions instruments of various kinds that help to give the mind and ear something else to focus on even if only for a few seconds.If you love melody and new age instrumental sounds with an eastern flare that will help take you away and relieve stress at the same time, this would be one album to check out."},{"rating":"1","title":"Gregory Peck Collection","review":"I was disappointed in my purchase, because I did not realize there would be so few movies on \\"the Collection\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Playful, laid back psychedelia","review":"The band The Wild Flowers was a kind of rehearsel for more \\"serious\\" bands.

Unfortunatly, you could never tell it by watching this misfire.What few good gags there are, never work because you're too concerned wondering if Stan is going to fall down and not get back up during the film.I honestly have found *every* Laurel and Hardy film I've ever seen to be enjoyable. (even The Big Noise) But I don't think I'll ever be able to make it through this one again."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's different; try one of the other L & H films first","review":"This European film, produced in 1950, was the last Laurel & Hardy movie, and most of the international cast and crew spoke other languages. (In the film Stan and Ollie speak English but everyone else is dubbed.) Both comedians had serious health problems during filming, and these are obvious in the film. The language barrier also caused communication problems on the set. Thanks to Laurel & Hardy, what should have been a total disaster is not all that bad. There's a novel setting and plenty of L & H humor, as they inherit a \\"yacht\\" and a tropical island. Laurel & Hardy fans may enjoy this as a novelty; first-time viewers should try an older, more typical L & H movie from the '20s or '30s before seeing this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent value, especially with cassette & lighter adapters","review":"Well worth the... price. The player is very lightweight using two AA batteries which they claim can run up to 35 hours. The headphones are okay, but nothing exceptional. Using the cassette adapter and the car lighter adapter this works very well in the car and I have yet to hear a skip from the unit. It also reads audio CD-R disks just fine (not MP3 CD-R's). I have hooked the unit up to external speakers and the sound is excellent, although it defaults to its SBR \\"bass enhancement\\" which is a bit overdone when listened to on a system with reasonable bass response. I typically just listen to it with no tone enhancement at all (it has a \\"train\\" mode which I cannot find a reason to use!). It would be nice to have an AC adapter but I was able to use an old... adapter I had lying around which works fine."},{"rating":"2","title":"Counseling: A Comprehensive Profession, Updated Edition","review":"This book has been assigned for my first grad course in family counseling.

That's why I purchased this book, hoping to learn -- as promised -- the real story behind the Burma-Siam railroad.However, the book's prose is so bland and uninspiring that it manages to make an otherwise interesting story boring. There is little narrative here, the paragraphs are large and clunky and the comma-free punctuation will annoy readers.That said, if you have a deep interest in and knowledge of the Pacific Theater in World War II, you might find this book more approachable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Songs","review":"1.

The book is very dry and hard to read. While the information in the text is correct, it is hard to imagine a more uninteresting and dry way to present the material. Pseudo code was unnecessarily difficult to understand. Same goes for the main math concepts, which often had to be explained at length by the instructor."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the best math textbook","review":"As a comprehensive book on discrete math I really found this text lacking. At times some examples were vaguely illustrated or maybe omitted altogether.If you're using this for a discrete math class, hopefully your instructor has enough supplemental material to carry the text, but I'm not as lucky. Doing an independent study of the course that used this text meant using Google a lot.I also have the next edition, and I can say that there is hardly a difference as far as the lack of examples and overall clarity."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great! If you already know the material...","review":"According to an instructor of mine (not the one teaching the course), this book was written by mathematicians for mathematicians. If you are not already well-versed in proofs and logic, this book is excruciatingly difficult to follow. The instructor teaching the course was a Ph.D. from MIT. Obviously he understands it, but both he and the book utterly failed to explain the concepts in terms that a normal computer engineer/scientist undergraduate could understand. If this is required reading for you Discrete Structures (or equivalent course) I highly recommend getting a second book that explains the terms in plain English (as opposed to in the language of Math, which I am not fluent in). Unfortunately I was not smart enough to do this myself early on, so I cannot provide a recommendation.

It moved me both to laughter and tears. I admire the central characters for their overcoming all the hardships they had to face. The fine style is remarkable, considering that english is the author's second language. Let's have more of such immigrant writers! My only reservation is some doubt about the accuracy of the account of the war years. how could such a young girl remember so much? I can only remember two or three incidents before I was six. But then nothing traumatic happened to me.

The knives are reasonably well made. The steel is decent quality and will take and hold and edge that's certainly good enough for the general American household.

These people that gave it 3+ stars have been conditioned by $20 knife sets and haven't seen quality like my old set.

This is the first item that I've purchased for her that I'm embarrassed to have done so. I trusted the Chicago Cutlery name (and the previous reviews!), but no more.Within the first week of use they began rusting. Then I went to visit her, was chopping up broccoli for dinner, and the blade of the small knife I was using broke in half! I have never broken a knife while using it before. And on broccoli???I urged her to return the set, but in her busy life she had not saved the paperwork or packaging. Very disappointing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful Set","review":"I bought this set for my grandmother because it has a traditional look to it. She absolutely loves it! The knives are nice and sharp. Like other knives, these knives should not be put in the dishwasher. It will cause the wood to dry out and crack, and it can cause rusting. Knives should always be washed by hand, and these are no exception."},{"rating":"2","title":"Substantial knife set at a budget price point","review":"In the overall scheme of things, this knives are cheap for the number of knives you get at the price point. I grew up in a household where we couldn't have a sharp knife because my mother would always slice her fingers open. Some 20 years later, a heavy sharp knife feels amazing when you're using it! Must be something about the mother thing, but I can imagine when cutting chicken that the blade is going right through my finger, bone and all. Which I think that most of these knives would be fully capable of doing!I recommend that you use a sharpening kit like this for sharpening any knife:Smith's DFPK Diamond Precision Knife Sharpening KitThese kits are amazing and will put a professional edge on any knife. You can adjust the angle of the sharpening edge, down to the razor thin edge like an X-Acto blade."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great knife set!","review":"The Chicago Cutlery knife set I purchased from Freedom's Gate is awesome!

The picture quality was very clear and the sound was great. The movie kind of brings back the 1950's horror flicks for me.

I am a film critic, so I give movies a break when they have low budgets, but it seemed to me that when they got the idea to make this movie, they just started, and began making the plot (and the special effects) as they went along. The acting is bad, the effects are terrible, the directing is silly, and the plot is sub standard (even for this genre). There was actually a scene where it looked like the Spider was made of paper and they just walked it by the camera on a stick. It took every thing in me not to turn it off and throw it in the trash.

It's not even a worthwhile rental. The ending is really dumb, with the police watching helplessly, as the heroine dangles from a helicopter by a rope, armed with an armor piercing bazooka firing at the \\"spider\\" on a skyscraper-which one would think would be full of people, even if it's night-there are bound to be maintenance workers.

A few friends and I saw this film in @1981 on a late-night local station and talked about it for years and I was very happy to get my hands on a few copies.

The Sigma 15mm fisheye has been extensively reviewed and compared by other websites (go ahead and search) and this is a very good product. The canon has a tighter focus and a *touch* faster in focusing, but with the massive depth of field with this lens, it's not a problem at all.Be aware that if you use this on a 1.6 crop factor digital SLR that has APS sensors like my 20D or digital rebel, then the fisheye effect is not as pronounced on film or 1.3 or full frame digital SLRs.Watch lens flare should direct sunlight hit it also...but that happens to any lens that has protruding or bulbous lenses.This is a much better bang for the buck lens than the canon equivalent which costs significantly more. If you search around, you can find much lower prices on this lens."},{"rating":"2","title":"wahoo!!...","review":"i am a fisheye lens addict. i have had this lens for a few months now, and i use it for almost everything. the lens was worth every bit i payed for it. and the sigma customer service was so fast and easy. the lens takes clear sharp pictures everytime. this lens takes the best skateboarding and band pictures! if you are considering this lens, i would definately reccomend it. i love how the pictures can either be circular or full frame. its a great investment......."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Experience Ever","review":"I wanted to use this lens with my Canon EOS-10D and I was shocked with its performance. The AF only works for objects closer than 4 feet and it does not focus on objects farther than that.

I have no idea why they distribute outdated lenses to their resellers.. That's not all, I tried manual focus, and the photos came out very soft even at very small apertures (large f-stop number)After 4 weeks I get the lens back from Sigma in the same condition.

Throughout the 30s and 40s the style was refined and finally emerged in the Flamingos smooth sound. It took Pat Boone \\"pushing\\" and singing \\"in front\\" of \\"I'll Be Home\\" to get the Flamingos the attention they deserved. Several of this group's songs have been featured recently in films and on TV, with Bill Cosby and Felicia Rashad dancing on The Bill Cosby show to the Flamingo's glittering rendition of \\"I Only Have Eyes for You\\". This same 50s classic was the closing music for one of Tim Reid's series; Reid and his wife dance to this at night in front of the Lincoln Memorial. I can't get along without this album, and that's why I'm ordering two more; one for each car."},{"rating":"2","title":"The song I was looking for, FOUND!","review":"Sometimes when looking for a particular song that you remember in your youth, because of the time period, it's not always easy to find.

Thanks Amazon> Even though it was only one song I really wanted the whole CD is very enjoyable.

After researching my options this KVM switch seemed like an excellent solution. Installation wasn't too tough, though the switch doesn't come with any cables (hence the four stars) and the D-Link ones were backordered. Once installation was complete, all my computers started up with no problems. Switching from one to another is handled either by a \\"Select\\" button on the switch box that moves through the connected computers serially or by using an easy to remember key combination to select a specific computer. No drivers or any software was required to install the hardware.Overall, I highly recommend this KVM switch. Anytime you have a lot of computers in a little bit of space, it will come in handy."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the Best!!!!","review":"This is a great CD!! All the songs are worth listening to.

Note from seller was enclosed, saying \\"It clearly states in the listing that the box pic on the listing is used for reference only and that yours will come in a non-branded box.\\" NOT TRUE - nowhere on the listing does it say those words.

When I came to this sellers cartridge it printed so light that it cannot be used. The cartridge saying - low toner - did a far better job. So I write to the seller and they say \\"too bad\\" past our return period. The product was defective and they don't care. Please if you're going to buy one from the Amazon site purchase it from a seller who won't treat you like this.

Paley really does a great job at succinctly packaging the evidence against Barnett --motive, profile-- and, most importantly, what I consider to be the closest thing to a smoking gun in all of the Ripper suspect cases -- the missing key to the last victim's... Barnett's girlfriend's... bedroom. And I disagree with those who say that the profiling is too widely matching; there are just too many characteristics. My only problem with the case -- and with the book -- is that I am not convinced by Paley's assertions that cleaning fish gave Barnett the neccessary \\"Ripper\\" skills. Maybe it did, but Paley was weak in making the case for that. Otherwise, very, very good detecting --and great, tight writing-- indeed."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Kindle version is an absolute disaster!","review":"All other reviews are about theprinted version and I agree with them that the book itself is quite good and interesting and well written.

In parts you can not read it as the meaning is completely ruined.Onm a printed bbok I would surely demand a refund as it is a faulty, damaged product that it does not make justice to the author.

I rate this book with only two stars, because if one knows the history of various insurgencies of the past, can easily avoid reading half of the pages.Corum and Johnson did not go deep in details, so the book remains just a general historical overview of the phenomenon of airpower against insurgents, even forgetting some minor wars (Sri Lanka against Tamils, Russia against Chechens, Morocco against Saharawis and so on).Moreover, in the chapter dedicated to Colombia the two authors give an explicit negative political judgement on Clinton politics and overtly claim an American military intervention in the ongoing Colombian civil war: mixing politics with an academic work is not a good thing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where's the mystery?","review":"The \\"mystery\\" in this novel takes up about five pages...the rest is a boring account of daily goings'-on in Tinker's Cover...Lucy is a moron, her husband is a grumbling troglodyte, her kids are selfish punks, and her friends are rather hurtful.

Instead, she accidnetly blunders into trouble and the murderer then promptly attacks or kidnaps her.Like may readers, a book is as escape for me into another world. Lucy Stone's world is one I do not intend to visit again. Her harried supermom performance, coupled with an inability to say no, makes her such a victim that I end up rooting for the bad guys. Her children are lazy brats who manage to get into all sorts of trouble. Her husband is insecure and selfish. Her friends think nothing of imposing on her.

I had to cut some larger nostrils, eye holes, and eye brow slits to make it more bareable. Its hard to wear for long periods just because of the airflow issues.

I had heard of it, then checked it out from the library. This movie was not well made. It absolutely could not hold the attention of my 1 year old. He loves his Baby Einstein movie & I hoped this DVD would be on par with that, but it is not. They do not seem to have a grasp on what kind of images will hold the attention of babies. There is one song where the whole song just shows a little girl kneeling next to a teddy bear, and she just picks and pulls at the bear the whole time. Unbelievable. The whole thing was painful for me to watch, and my 1 yr. old found better things to do. An older child might sit still for this (my 6 year old did watch it through, but she did not ask to see it again after that).

The blade is plenty sharp, although a little skinnier than I prefer. But I knew that when I bought it. My biggest issue is that the handle is SO wimpy! It's not much bigger than the blade itself and I find it extremely uncomfortable to hold. I feel like I have no control over the knife and it makes me nervous that it will slip and cut my other hand. I don't think I'll be keeping this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"one sharp knife","review":"I purchased this knife for two reasons: I wanted a knife that would cut tomatoes without hassle and Rada's seemed inexpensive. I read in a couple of other reviews to watch out, that this knife was awfully sharp. But despite being quite slow and careful, I sliced my middle finger badly the first time I used the knife. All's well now, or I would have hated this knife. I think the handle's somewhat short for the length of the blade but that is the only drawback so far. The handle hasn't discoloured for me, as some reviewers mentioned. (I have never put it in the dishwasher; I rinse it quickly in running water and wipe it with a little towel. The knife cleans fine). The knife makes cutting tomatoes and lemons seamless but the blade is really, really sharp. Buy it if you want to spend as little as you can to get a reasonably good tomato-knife."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great knife, does its job well","review":"I recently started using Rada knives in the past year and won't go back to anything else. It is so nice to have a knife that can actually cut something smooth and without much effort. With the tomato slicer I can do super thin cuts or just slice them up for sandwiches.

With this tomato slicer I can cut super thin slices of both tomato and onion. Sandwiches are quick and easy no longer a chore. I love, love this knife. Even better Rada knives are Made in America and I look specifically for American products. I was doubtful about the quality because Rada knives are cheap. Rarely do you get something of quality at this price but these are great knives. I highly recommend you start with this knife and once you use it you will keep buying more Rada knives.

The toy is heavy, clumbsy, and not well not well-built. It was anything but fun and my 4-year old son quickly lost interest in it; I had to purchase another one. (My son was told that Santa made a mistake, and boy did I!) The Radio Flyer company makes great wagons and they, in my opinion, should stick to that market. They've totally missed the scooter market."},{"rating":"1","title":"Skip This DVD","review":"This is such a disappointing video.

Interesting characters pop up in each new book."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Joe Pickett book well worth reading","review":"In this Joe Pickett book, CJ Box has done another great job of developing his characters and solver a mystery as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Engaging as usual!","review":"I found this book difficult to start because I did not want to see my unblemished image of good guy, Joe Pickett, tarnished due to an affair. Much to my delight, he did not disappoint! Great story. Ready for the next Joe Pickett read."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Top Notch Adventure","review":"This should be five stars, not one. This is my first C.J. Box book and it certainly won't be my last. It was great to read about a hero who had a normal family life and makes a mistake now and then. Other reviews have given the plot line, so I don't think it's necessary for me to do so. However, I would like to say that the author has created believable characters and situations and kept up the suspense all the way through the novel. I liked reading about a wilderness area that I knew nothing about. Great job!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Huh?","review":"I don't know what book everyone else is reading but the book I read was not Box's best and it was not a tribute to the Joe Pickett we've all come to know and like in 4 previous books. This book is uneven and largely unsatisfying. I finished the book and kept wondering what I had read.There is a subplot going on involving both Joe and Mary Beth flirting with thoughts of affairs...Joe with new character, Stella Ennis, Mary Beth with Nate Romanowski. Neither have the affairs but that they are even a part of the book I found offensive and not true to the characters that Box has created.The best of the book occurs very early and very late in the book. The early involves the death of a rogue grizzley. The very late tells the demise of slimy ex-Sheriff Barnum.If you like Joe Pickett my advice is to skip this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"CJ Box has another awesome read","review":"When CJ Box comes out with a new book, I am at the front of the line. I never pre-order a book except for CJ Box and Vince Flynn. Out of Range was another book that I could not wait to resume reading. I could easily have read this book in a couple of sittings but I did not want the read to end. Out of Range had all the elements that Box brilliantly weaves into all his great stories."},{"rating":"2","title":"expectations are high--very fun (and difficult) to read","review":"I am a dfw fan to begin with. The selection in the book that contains the \\"quizzes\\" is probably the most remarkable piece of fiction I have ever read--in the sense that it is the most drastic re-working of the short story form. Very good work. Once again, I am in awe. As usual, some of it just weird.dy"},{"rating":"1","title":"Clever but Reader-Friendly?","review":"As a writer, I found the craft utilized by David Foster Wallace intriguing. He really breaks out of what a standard \\"story\\" can be and is quite successful in a few of the pieces. I, however, did not enjoy much of what I read.There is something to be said for being clever and being inventive but to put so many stories together in one collection limits the ability to take them all in and truly enjoy them. I think if this book had been cut in half I would have given it a better review, but the sheer number of non traditional stories was too overwhelming. In other words, I wanted more story and less creation."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Failed Experiment","review":"David Foster Wallace certainly conducts an interesting experiment with this collection of shorts. He has a knack for writing in the present, or capturing a moment that, in many ways, is unprecedented. He portrays the absurdity of contemporary culture in a way that makes the the reader feel close to the oddities and peculiarities. However, Wallace often fails to create characters that are compelling and interesting. When he manages to do so, and he begins gaining momentum, he is often slowed by a less compelling, or tedious short. The stories themselves are often redundant, and what seemed to be a cohesive series of shorts soon becomes a tedious compilation of repetitive stories."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fragments of modernism not as compelling as his essays","review":"I am a huge fan of DFW's non fiction. His essays are amongst the choicest examples of the modern form. But his fiction I'm not so sure. I keep gearing up for a shot at his mammoth Infinite Jest, but reading these trickles from his stream of consciousness mind puts me off. I can see the talent there, but these come across as flicked off the wrist exercises in craft. Neither particularly stylish nor funny. I think I'll stick to the non fiction."},{"rating":"2","title":"Get the Audiobook","review":"I really can't explain why, but several different sources agree. On paper this is a pompous and annoying book. The Audiobook, on the other hand (which is read by the author) is engaging, funny, and cool. If you are drawn to David Foster Wallace and have never really gotten into this book, try it on tape. It may well be a whole different experience."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Different Perspective","review":"This was the second of David Foster Wallace's books that I've read, after Infinite Jest. This is certainly a more accessible tome in comparison, but maintain's Wallace's unique perspective. Much like the man himself, this book is often very funny, and sometimes very sad, but always comes from a perspective of seeking out the humanity in characters where it's not always obvious.This is obviously a much different book than Infinite Jest, which was a sprawling novel of vast ambition. The short stories, or 'brief interviews,' will sometimes make you laugh out loud, sometimes blow you away, and sometimes leave you scratching your head and shrugging. And in that respect, the two books are very much the same."},{"rating":"1","title":"His insight and his writing skill has not diminished, but his subject matter is deprived and you guessed it, hideous","review":"I read a collection of Wallace's essays called \\"Consider the Lobster\\" that I found provocative and insightful. His descriptions of people and places were saturated with wonderful rich details. Together the effect of Wallace's intellect and his writing skill was simply electric. With regard to Hideous Men, his insight and his writing skill has not diminished, but his subject matter is deprived and you guessed it, hideous. I guess I was ill prepared for how low he could go. A couple of the short stories were searing with surprise twists and turns. The rest were an exercise in self indulgent ranting. Remembering his suicide, I couldn't help but wonder if this was a window to the soul of a man truly unhinged."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best-pressed book.","review":"This is my most-lent book.Nigh-schitzophrenic writing is generously tempered with a gourmet vocabulary, making the deep, jerky ride of his stories extremely readable. DFW presents the writing process as a very deconstructuralized thing with very experimental formats, providing a wholly multifaceted experience.Perhaps some of the criticisms he's received (An English prof I once knew said, 'He's just a blip on the timeline of literature: a passing phase..') gave rise to the themes of acknowledged pretentiousness in many of the stories.Hipsters and those fascinated by Americana culture alike will truly enjoy this, if only for the provocative nature of the writing styles, the stories in and of themselves, and themes.DO read this book. I can't stress it enough."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well, I don't know...","review":"Sometimes DFW seems scared of being honest, like he's trapped in the postmodern \\"we all know what we're doing here\\" cliches he seems alternately scared of and disdainful of. He hides behind the footnotes and the overeducated dialect. I still can't tell if there's a point to \\"Tri-Stan: I Sold Sissee Nar to Ecko\\" or \\"Church Not Made of Hands\\" (or whatever non sequitur it was called). But he's honest when he doesn't think too much about it, he's smart, all the \\"Brief Interviews\\" are amazing, he has a command of tone he sometimes lacked in \\"Infinite Jest,\\" and when he is on (and he is on a lot of the time here) he is positively magnetic. It's been a while to wait for him to put it together, and maybe he never will throw down the crutches of unconscious Lernerisms. But if he keeps feeding us stuff like this, I'll occasionally blanch, but I'll down most of it gladly."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wanted: An Editor","review":"The pattern here soon becomes familiar. Start with an oddball premise, sometimes shocking, sometimes offbeat, occasionally brilliant. Find a voice, an authentic voice -- perhaps working class, maybe self-obsessed neurotic, occasionally just delightfully kooky. Then, with these admirable ingredients, proceed to beat the reader over the head with this same premise, this same voice, for 30, 40, or 50 pages. While slogging through this, occasionally smiling, sometimes laughing, but mostly drowning, I recalled Jack Kerouac's famous line \\"you're a genius all the time.\\" Kerouac wasn't and neither was DFW. But what editor had the balls to tell either of them that?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Where I lost patience","review":"I loved much of Infinite Jest and his essay collection A Supposedly Fun Thing, but he always had tics which threatened to ruin his work and here they are given free rein. It's all here: the trivializing long-windedness, the meaning-denying vocabulary, the distracting footnotes, the reflexive experimentation, the fetishization of the grotesque, the general sense of droning and contempt for the reader."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disjointed","review":"This book was a boring read, very disjointed, and not at all what I expected based on the description. Although effective (his piece \\"the depressed person\\" put me in a depressing, annoyed mood with every page I read), it was not for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wallace at his absolute best","review":"Why hasn't anyone mentioned the wonderfully complex and fun \\"Octet\\"? That story/belletristic exercise/whatever is, by itself, worth the price of 'Brief Interviews.' I cannot imagine anyone except DFW writing such a marvelously tangential tracery, and making it work.To the person above who takes issue with footnotes, I think the person you should be blaming is actually Nabokov, by the way.This is an amazing book: it should be read over and over and over again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lots of fat to chew on!","review":"This man was sooo brilliant, as in burned too hot! WOW! Some seriously insightful concepts. Lots to chew on and ponder! You've got to enjoy \\"strange\\" out-of-the-ordinary thinking! I can't imagine how a movie has been crafted from this! It's not at any theaters near me! Can't wait to see it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A unique and highly enjoyable read","review":"David Foster Wallace has done it again, but in a grander fashion than ever before. The stories contained within \\"Brief Interviews with Hideous Men\\" are complex, funny, and at times irritating. Whether or not the latter is DFW's intention is unclear, but true none the less. Some of the stories are paralyzingly involving, while others have you looking ahead to see how many pages are left in the story. Luckily for us, the first kind are far more numerous. The annonymity of the characters in this book are sure to remind you of yourself or people you know, which gives the stories that extra zing of life that some books lack. I reccommend this work to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Smug and Vile","review":"I have to preface this review by saying that I normally do not have a visceral reaction to novels and stories I do not like. As a matter of fact, I have wasted a good chunk of my life reading things that were no good and or not worth reading. That being said, I actually threw this book across the room. I have never read such a self-congratulatory piece in all my life. The smug conceit of the author actually oozes out of every page. The book made me go and reread some Dostoevsky, just so I could feel better about the world and literature."},{"rating":"1","title":"Brief Review of Hideous Book","review":"Having read -- and disliked -- two of this collection's pieces in Esquire and The New Yorker, I should have avoided \\"Brief Interviews with Hideous Men.\\" But I wanted to give David Foster Wallace and his vaunted dry humor one more chance. I found a couple of the briefest stories (\\"Forever Overhead,\\" the first episode of the two-part \\"The Devil is a Busy Man\\") interesting and even laugh-provoking, but the remaining stories bored me. Like Jon Stewart's \\"Naked Pictures of Famous People,\\" this book strives too hard and self-consciously to be funny. Wallace should buy a volume or two of Barry Hannah's work and study the master of the dryly hilarious short story."},{"rating":"1","title":"A bad writer who has a reputation as a literary genius","review":"It is stunning how many critics, academics, and readers who want to think well of themselves have fallen for this trashy fraud. The man COULD NOT WRITE! His prose is the sort of stuff produced by clever but not very literate undergraduates. The stories are adolescent in design, the ideas are silly, and the whole effect is one of profound boredom.Wallace's works are intelligance tests: if you can be conned into thinking you should think these are good books, you aren't nearly as bright as you'd like to believe you are. Come on, admit it: you hate this stuff."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not even for fans","review":"To this hard-core fan of experimental and modernist fiction, David Foster Wallace's Infinite Jest was fabulous -- incredible, even. I read it obsessively, down to the notes to the notes to the endnotes, and loved it. I even re-read it! Then I laughed out loud at A Supposedly Fun Thing. And I loved his recent book-length essay on \\"the usage wars.\\"So why can't I get through Brief Interviews? I think he just needed an editor. The whole MacArthur grant/critical acclaim/national bestseller thing must have gone to the heads of both Mr. Wallace and his publisher. These \\"stories\\" are just boring and annoying. Half should have been junked in the first place, and the other half ripped to shreds before being re-written."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hideous? Yes, hideous.","review":"I love David Foster Wallace's non-fiction essays (particularly those in Consider the Lobster), but I could not finish this book. Two-thirds was more than enough. It is expertly crafted, to be sure. But, like Rembrant's Carcass of Beef, I found it repellent. I get it, but I can't stand it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Engrossing but disturbing short stories","review":"Difficult to read as relations between parts and whole are not clearly marked.

These don't have the quality metal that the old wooden handle Chicago Cutlery knives do since the wooden ones don't develop rust spots on the metal after a run through the dishwasher while these do. So they must be of poorer quality than the old ones I have had for years. I also bought the Wusthof Grand Prix set and there are much much better for just $20 more.

This includes reading any reviews I can find. I read the ones posted here and I must admit I stewed over making this purchase for about a week and finally came to the conclusion that what was considered a \\"higher quality\\" or more expensive set of knives such as Henkel or Wustoff wasn't needed in our household. We are the average busy family with no more than 3 or 4 meals a week cooked here. Thus, eliminating the need to spend more money. I have always considered Chicago Cutlery to be quality in my book, and I am very pleased with my purchase. I also want to note that I didn't have the problem with the cracked handles as some reviewers had stated. They were just fine, and I love being able to throw them in the dishwasher!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Problems with small knives","review":"I think the knives are great, except that many of the small knife handles are cracked.

Well it was too late, the knives had already been packed up and returned. I also noticed the same problem on the same small knives for sale in one of their factory stores."},{"rating":"2","title":"A WORKING KNIFE SET - NO MATTER HOW YOU SLICE IT!","review":"There are many things in our kitchen upon which we've come to depend, and this Chicago Cutlery knife set is right at the top of that list.First of all, it comes with a handsome and handy wood block for easy knife storage. We keep it right by our chopping block.The knives, with Bakelite handles, are well balanced and well made with stainless steel rivets holding the knives to their handles.Perhaps the most used are the parer and the utility knife.

It's a dark, creepy video...with one of the girls like, in a cage...which I don't understand. And the chorus is pretty cool - they're preforming with a band behind them and they've all got funky, 80s type hair.Whole Again ~ This videos a lot better (thankfully) - and I love the clothes/hair in it. Because it takes place in the 50's it's really cheesy and happy, but that's the best part! I would have bought the DVD just for this song, but getting an extra video was okay too.In short, this is a good DVD, but there's only two videos and they're both cool...but I Must Not Chase the Boys is really weird and slightly mature for their age (14-16).Overall grade - B"},{"rating":"1","title":"slow","review":"They say this reads in just 6 seconds.

I had not really heard a lot of Telemann, and what I had heard had not really stuck with me. Nonetheless, as I grow more fond of Baroque, the combination of a favorable Grammophone review and the Naxos price pushed me beyond temptation. Bottom line: I love it and plan to get the other 3 installments ASAP. The music itself is of a very high quality, with an enjoyable lightness of touch and bounciness I did not expect. The performance and recording are very good. It seems Naxos' recording techniques improve with each new offering.

It has exceeded my expections, something that very seldom happens anymore when it comes to tools."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a disaster, don't buy this machine","review":"Save your money and buy another brand. I went through 3 of these machines in 2 months. Each one worked worse than the previous. Messy, the \\"steam cleaning\\" feature is a joke, grounds are still left all over the place and you have to wipe the whole inside top and grinding chamber to clean up the beans. Each machine also became so slow in making coffee that half the water drifted away as steam. It's ashame Krups let the quality slip so much, it appears that many others have the same issues. I just ordered the Melitta gind-n-brew, I hope it works better."},{"rating":"1","title":"High Maintenance, Loud Machine, Fried timer","review":"While this Krups made some great coffee, I was very unhappy with the extensive clean up required. Bits of soggy coffee grounds end up everywhere. As well, the basket door and other parts of the machine to not dissemble making clean-up difficult (and painful if you don't watch the sharp edges).The grinder is extremely loud. Much louder than any separate grinder that I have used. You could look at it as a built in alarm clock, albeit a very annoying one.Finally, this coffeemaker broke after only five months of use due to humidity getting into the digital timer area. Now I can't stop it from grinding on start-up.All in all, I would not purchase this machine again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yes - it is really junk!","review":"Brews great coffee and looks nicer than most. BUT you must be patient as it takes forever to brew even a couple of cups. The jug cracked and leaked after a couple of months (with no noticed cause of the crack). Worse still the plastic parts that bring the hot water over to the bean holder MELTED - was this plastic's heat resistance ever tested at the factory?. Krups claim this is not a typical problem and will replace it with a separate grinder and coffee maker (if I can find the receipt!). I liked the combination unit, so this isn't really a satisfactory solution in my mind. It is a shame becasue the concept was good, but the execution was terrible."},{"rating":"1","title":"the other guys aren't kidding!","review":"My first clue was the discovery of coffee residue on the machine the first time I used it--had already been returned to the store once! I could overlook the turbine-engine grinder noise if it worked more than 15% of the time, but a successful pot usually involves completely disassembling the machine's many parts, declogging, drying, waiting 30 minutes for the cycle...then it gets its one star for tasty coffee. Still, after several months, I'm giving up. I wonder if the positive reviewers have used theirs for over 2 days."},{"rating":"1","title":"You have to be kidding","review":"This is the worst appliance I have ever purchased. It took my wife and me 45 minutes to get it to operate as the instructions are confusing and incomplete. It makes awful coffee and the cleanup required is outrageous. On our first disassembly to clean, it took us 20 minutes to re-assemble as the removable strainer somehow slipped loose and would not fit back into the unit. I returned the unit and will not buy another Krups coffeemaker - ever! All this for a very mediocre cup of coffee. You've got to be kidding!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Loud, louder, then failure","review":"Liked it the first month, even though it woke us every morning and it was very quirky - - often the beans wouldn't grind unless we'd wiped out the machine.

Returned it, and afraid to buy any other Krups."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible Terrible Terrible","review":"This is the worst. I am on my second Krups Fresh Aroma Time coffee maker and it's the last. Besides spending alot of time and money sending the first one back, the second one just died (the grinder will not shut off) after only three weeks of use. Some other negatives... super slow brew time (25 minutes on average), coffee that is never hot and a royal pain to clean. I've tried the Cuisinart Grind 'n Brew and the Krups. Now it's onto the Melitta Mill and Brew and hopefully a reliable coffee maker and a good cup of coffee!"},{"rating":"1","title":"DO NOT BUY THIS COFFEE MAKER!!","review":"This is a terrible coffee maker - the worst I've had. We put 10 cups of water in it, and an HOUR later we have about 3 cups of coffee. It works very well as a humidifier since that's where most of the water seems to go - into the air as steam. If we put a dish rag over the steam vents on top, we do a little better - about 5 cups in an hour (after putting in 10cups of water). We clean the constantly-clogging grinder every day, but still do not get any better performance. Also, the design of the carafe is terrible - you cannot pour from it without burning your hands from escaping steam. Overall, it's a total waste. We've only had it for 3 months, and we're shopping for a new one (NOT KRUPS!)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great considering it's the first coffee maker ever made.","review":"My second fresh aroma in six months just quit. It seems there is a seal inside that can go bad. You will know this when your machine starts to create a lot of steam and seems to make a lot less coffee that water inserted. The grinder sounds like a chain saw. A full pot of coffee takes almost 25 minutes. Krups replaced my first one in two weeks. They promised to refund the $15 postage it took to send it but didn't. This one their sending for and replacing with a different model. I wanted a refund but no go. This is with out a doubt a bad product."},{"rating":"1","title":"WOW!

I think it makes coffee that tastes good, and I was sure sick of the mess from using a separate grinder. But I quickly discovered that if you omit a single step in the set-up, you wind up with a pot full of dirty water and a hopper full of steamed beans. (This can happen even if you do things right. And since the hopper doesn't detach, it can be real tricky getting those wet beans out.) The first time I used it I set it up to have coffee ready when we got up. Darn thing went off like a jet engine and scared me silly. It's more complicated than a VCR and louder than a boombox. The reviewers are right: Bad engineering."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not waste you money on it","review":"This is one of the most idiotically designed machine you will ever see. First it is way too loud (you may want to use it as an alarm clock, for self and neighbors), the grind cycle is 50 seconds no matter how much coffee beans you put in it. It makes more steam than coffee, you may have to put 4 cups of water to get one out (magic!!). Grind filter is hidden and is pain to remove and place it back in. The carafe's bottom is narrow and therefore surface on the hot plate is relatively small, so coffee cools real quick.

I tried cleaning it over and over, trying to find what was clogging it up...which I never found the problem. Finally, I sent it back to Krups. After paying to ship it in for repair or replacement, they sent me a new one after a month.

It is enclosed, and the so called \\"self-cleaning\\" is not good, so there are always OLD, CRUSTY grinds inside the grinder housing. You can easily test this out by brewing a pot without any beans and seeing how the carafe water is a light tan everytime;*Old hidden grinds, as they dry and \\"crustify,\\" do eventally slowly fall out of the grinder housing. If your filter basket and pot are not in place (such as if they are removed for cleaning), the grinds will fall out onto the hotplate and get in the seam around the hotplate making it impossible to thoroughly clean.*Brewing is SLOW. For a full pot, don't be surprised if the brewing takes 20 minutes.I've also heard the Cuisinart model is a pain and unreliable. If I were to do it again I'd try the Melitta Grinder/Brewer.

It would be like donating old underwear, socks, or that tea-shirt with paint on it -- some things just need to be thrown out."},{"rating":"2","title":"THERE IS ABSOLUTELY NOTHING WRONG WITH THIS COFFEE MAKER","review":"Anything worth having in life is worth some effort. The coffee I have had from this machine is worth the effort. This coffee maker is not that difficult to master. If you are willing to forgive yourself a couple of times for things you forgot to do, or did wrong, then you should have no problem with this product. If your usual learning curve is fairly short you will enjoy the Krups combination grinder/brewer. It only takes about 10 minutes to brew 9 cups (I timed it) not the 20 I feared from reading other reviews. I also read a review that included complaints about the noise level of the grinder. (If you sleep in the same room with it, I would consider it loud.) I thought, from comments made, I could double it as an alarm clock but it is not loud enough for that. The day I tried that, I was awakend by the great smell of coffee, not the noise. So, I like my machine and would recommend it to friends.

I spoke to them last week about the fact that the coffee grinder is jammed, you can't get at it to clear it out, it takes 25 minutes to brew a pot of coffee, and yada, yada, yada. I was hoping they had already decided to recall the darn thing and I would get a newer model that doesn't have all the problems.I was told that it does indeed take 25 minutes to brew coffee and that the grinder getting stuck is probably my own fault if I keep my beans in the freezer. I said it requires too much attention to work properly, and they countered that a Jaguar requires a lot of attention too. Believe me, this is no Jaguar.

Thinking about the Capresso."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a good buy","review":"I bought this coffeemaker in June. It makes great coffee, but there are too many hassles to make it worth it. The carafe is thin and rounded and will break at the slightest bump. I had to replace this the second day I had it. It does not come with a permanent gold filter. The steam cleaning is a nice idea, but you have to remove the bean filter and dry the chamber and blades if you want to make a new pot. It is slow to brew. The water filter is also a good idea in theory, BUT you must replace it and it is only available from Krups. The pause and serve on my unit broke off two months ago, Krups replaced it as a warranty item, but it took almost two months.If you're in the market for a good grind and brew coffeemaker, I'd recommend the Cuisinart, my friend has one and has had no problems. I think Krups was in such a hurry to get all their good ideas into this coffeemaker that they didn't properly test and ended up with a costly and poor unit."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad design waste of money","review":"I bought this coffee maker on April 2001.

If you read the rest of the reviews, you'll see some common threads: 1) Starts out great; 2) After 2 weeks or so, brewing a pot of coffee takes over an hour; 3) Shortly afterward, it just stops working. All that was true for me. There are a variety of design flaws (height of the machine, coffee burns almost immediately on the stay-warm plate) but they pale in comparison to the unbelievably bad engineering.Krups was a favorite brand of mine, but I think the quality of their products has declined dramatically.

Additionally, a minimum of at least a half cup of water boiled off, making the coffee stronger than usual for the amount of beans used. I took the unit to the service center - and eventually a new unit was mailed to me from the factory. The second unit worked great....for about a month and a half.

As others have stated in their reviews, the machine is terribly noisy, beans do not feed through the chute on their own accord, and it takes forever and a day to get a pot of coffee. You also need to drink quickly before the machine automatically shuts the warming plate off.I took the time to write Krups about this product, and was basically blown off. Their only suggestion was to send it in for repair, a process that would take 4-6 weeks.

It seemed okay, but 1 hour into a trip with 4 bikes on the back of the van, the rack collapsed, denting my tailgate and one of the bikes. I weighed the bikes, and we were not above the 140 lbs that they say it will hold. The problem was caused by the top straps not staying tight. We had to put one of the bikes in the back of the van and tie a knot in the straps at the buckle in order to get to a friend's house, where we could borrow a different bike rack and leave one of the bikes behind.

I am in a country cover band (www dot fourfaceswest dot com) and this is a song (Wave On Wave) we almost have to do. We get alot of requests for it, but it is almost to simple to play.

Good for you Pat!"},{"rating":"1","title":"ripped off","review":"I know i'm not the only one who noticed that \\"wave on wave\\" is a blatantly obvious ripoff of Mike and the Mechanics' \\"In the Living Years\\". I dare you to say otherwise. There are forums all over the internet with posts from really pissed off fans like myself. Even if you're not musically inclined, the similarity is striking. Even my mom picked up on it when it played on the local country station. Bottom line is: Green is marginally talented, but that is overshadowed by his total lack of artistic integrity. I am surprised that there has not been a bigger backlash regarding the song. Oh and a word of caution regarding the rest of this so called, er..., critically acclaimed album: I'd venture to say that the lyrics are pulled straight out of a confused teenager's journal. If rambling, nonsensical musings about broken hearts and redemption are what you're after, then Pat Green is your guy.

Unfortunately, this CD seriously strays from what Pat is good at and replaces it with a form of \\"country\\" that many of Pat's old fans will agree is far from the Texas country tunes we have come to appreciate. Seriously, ever since Pat got married, his lyrics have gone soft. Who wants to hear about California? Let's listen to songs about what the heart of Texas country is based on: drinking beer, going to parties, and just having fun. Pat, what happened?I highly recommend against the purchase of this CD, and would advise people to buy his old CD, \\"3 Days,\\" or get a cd from a real Texas country artist, like Cory Morrow or Robert Earl Keen. Then you will hear what TEXAS country is all about"},{"rating":"2","title":"He did it again .....maybe better??","review":"..

His title cut, as well as \\"Run\\" and \\"Eden's Gate\\" exemplify that honest, down-to-earth but never simple Pat Green sound.

The ability to twirl the dial and set the alarm to beep is what I need in my work as a Physical Therapist. It reminds me to check back in a set period of time. Digital watches have too many buttons to push, taking way too long to set an alarm. This analog watch's ability to quickly set an alarm of varying time periods is marvelous. I can't believe Timex is the only manufacturer of this type. It has this model and one that is shinier/dressier. This is the one I wear every day. I hope Timex continues to make these into the far future. If there is one thing I wish Timex would improve on, it is the volume of the alarm. I'm now in my 60s, and of course, losing higher frequencies. The alarm can be difficult for my aging ears to hear if the ambient noise is great. I don't think that this is a defect in the watch. I think it's a defect in me... :-)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Watcha Think","review":"I bought this watch for my boyfriend for Christmas. Time was easy to set and features are also easy to use.

Like all Timex products, the Indiglo backlight feature is great for night, movie theater or other dark place viewing. It has a 2 function alarm: twice / day at the specified time or every hour at the minute setting. The leather band is atractive and high-quality.Now the not so good things:I'm not really wild about the styling of this watch. The face itself looks great but is small and disproportionally overwhelmed by the bezel. Setting the alarm takes practice getting down pat. Once that's been figured out, it has a good sound - louder than alarms on other inexpensive watches. One really bad thing is the stem which controls having the alarm turned on in either mode is easy to push in which turns it off. This can happen by simply flexing your wrist.

My major problem is that the alarm set stem detached entirely from the watch while I was trying to do a \\"set\\" job for the day.

Always a good value. I thought this model was out of production. Glad I found it on Amazon."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good while it lasted","review":"The easy-set alarm is great -- fast and convenient. However, the alarm became unreliable after about 2 years, as it depends on the tiny pull-out stem to activate it, which became sticky, and therefore the alarm sometimes fails to go off. An unreliable alarm is worse than no alarm. Another problem: the leather wristband became very smelly after a few months. When it gets wet -- from hand-washing or sweat -- it gets stinky, and cannot be removed. It leaves your wrist smelling bad too. Cleaning the wristband with leather cleaner did not help. And yes, it's big and clunky, but I don't really mind that. I like this product in principle, but unfortunately, durability and build quality issues make it a short-term disposable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Quick and easy to set alarm watch","review":"Analog alarm watches (mechanical or quartz) used to be fairly common, but are now somewhat rare. Timex makes a very nice quartz model that you set with a bezel and a two detent alarm knob. Either as a 12 hour alarm or a 60 minute timer. It's accurate, loud enough to use as a travel alarm(plus the dial lights up with the alarm tone), reasonably priced and durable. Also the hour and minute hands are luminescent and the entire dial lights up with the indiglo feature by pressing the main crown. The date is also easy to set with a quick set feature (two detent crown pull for time or date). Battery lasts a long time and it's a common 2016 lithium battery that you can easily change yourself with a cheap jewelers screwdriver set."},{"rating":"2","title":"Glad I purchased this","review":"I bought this watch because of a previous review where the reviewer loved the Easy Set Alarm's ease of use. Working in a lab, the short alarms are exactly what I was looking for, for both my short and long incubations. It allows me to walk away and do something else and still be in time for the next step. Definitely recommend it for anyone who needs a timer.It looks great as well. Great value for money. The indiglo is a little sensitive when I bend my wrist back but that also makes it a one-handed operation which is great.Love it.

What is truly sad is this watch is mostly unavailable for women and it is getting scarce in the Men's version as well. Turning a dial to get an alarm to sound anywhere from 1-60 minutes later is the greatest little watch feature ever. I am time challenged so it is truly helpful to simply turn the dial and have a reminder of when to end something or when to leave for an appointment, etc. Unfortunately the Men's version is too big for my wrist so I've passed this watch on to a friend. I just had the women's version of this watch's battery fixed. I wanted a backup given my watch is now several years old.

The crown that controls the timer is broken and when I pull it out it just falls out of the watch. Turning the bezel doesn't change the alarm setting anymore. There is a 1-year warranty but they make you send in shipping both ways. That would amount to $7 I have to spend to ship it to them in addition to $8 that they require you send them to cover return shipping.

I had to remove and replace the backpack for it to work, even though the POWER SAVER MODE was set to off.Which means, the Rio unit is shorting out the battery.(Before, I only had to charge the battery every other day and I would have the player on two and a half hours every day while working out.)I hope this helped"},{"rating":"1","title":"3rd player??","review":"Well lets just say this product is a joke.

I was very excited to see it, I had heard great things about the movie's creative premise. This is a great movie for people who aren't offended by husbands locking up their wives while they go to pursue other women. I believe John Cusak's character locks his wife up in an animal cage (twice) and binds her up with duct tape. Another distinctive memory is the creative puppeteer making lewd public display (on a sidewalk) of lust between a nun and a priest. I guess it's not for the religiously sensitive either. As an aside, the wife eventully \\"comes around\\" and begins to lust after the same woman as her husband. I'm sure I'm leaving out a lot of details from this dark, morally stunted movie. However, it's been a long time since I've seen it and I will NOT be exposing my mind to this movie again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dumb","review":"This has to be the silliest movie I ever watched.

After I saw it I was disappointed big time, it's so dumb they made a movie about going into John Malcovich's mind..and why only 15 minutes?...to be honest I dunno why some of these other reviewers gave it as many stars as they did.

Seeing Cameron Diaz as a dowdy, frizzy haired character had me totally forget how glamorous she actually is. I have never thought much of her as an actress until now.

There's twists and turns like you would expect from Kaufmann yet he always keeps you guessing.

While mind switching and occupation may not be the freshest idea out there, the direction this movie goes is so original it's scary. But it works. Both disturbing and entertaining, this movie succeeds on so many levels.First, the bizarre rules. Cusack lives in a bizarre world populated with bizarre people that drive the story along. He is subjected to the absurd until he finds a way to escape. I don't want to say much else, because it might ruin the movie. Suffice to say that there is a way to be in John Malkovich's mind, but to do so you must end up along side of the New Jersey Turnpike.In the tradition of Twelve Monkeys, Brazil, and any other journeys into the bizarre, Being John Malkovich is very entertaining and not a little disturbing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Zzzzzzzzzzz","review":"Not horrible, Truly original, But BORING...

But it is also lyrical and superbly witty. Every time I saw this film I felt like one of my surreal classmates from second grade had grown up and made a movie. But somewhere along the way it seemed that that kid had developed a tremendous understanding of life, of literature and of the audience.One of the refreshing things about \\"Being John Malkovich\\" is that it manages to be wild and unique without trying too hard. It balances an outlandish plot with a subtle and intelligent wit that permeates the entire film.Even the best American films tend to be a little too full of themselves at times. The great thing about this one is that it threw out all assumptions about film making and pushed everything to the envelope WITHOUT any visible trace of effort."},{"rating":"1","title":"It had its moments","review":"Ok..

Being John Malkovich works on an amazing array of levels. The outer layer is a sad fantasy story of a man who finds a portal into another man's brain, and takes his life over. But on another level it is a story of love and loss, and complex passions. on the deepest, best level, it is an exploration into the wants and needs of the human mind and soul. It begs to be examined over and over again in order to fully understand it's complexity and beauty. And if all that confused the heck out of you, don't get this movie.

The single biggest problem in this film is that you end up hating every person in it - the only person you can feel even a little bit sorry for is John Malkovich himself. The experience of watching it was like watching a train wreck in slow motion. The movie is so voyeuristic, it made the Jerry Springer show look like a walk in the park by its simplicity.I do think that the movie was well acted and filmed, sadly, but the plot left something to be desired."},{"rating":"1","title":"Different does not equal good.","review":"This movie came recommended. However, sadly enough - I must say that I don't agree with those who recommended it. It was different, yes. Fascinating, even, at times - the puppetry scenes were captivating. However, the movie left me wanting.I give this movie full points for creativity and novelty. However, I dock it just as many for being hard to follow, with lifeless characters who only make me want to hate them the whole way through.

I like John Cusack and I like the whole idea, so I really had high hopes. It really wasn't that bad, for the first half anyway. While it dealt with the implications of getting in someone's head and Cusack's character's growing dependence on it, it was funny and interesting. Unfortunately it turns into a sappy, feminist struggle for true love. Hey, I know the lesbian implications in it, and I appriciate them as much as anyone, but not in this movie. It's kind of like \\"Chasing Amy,\\" good for the forst half, but the ending is so rediculous, it's just sad. It's just a disappointment, don't bother."},{"rating":"1","title":"So What?","review":"1999 was a really great year for movies and I didn't get to see all the ones I wanted in the theater. So when this one came out on DVD I bought it from trust in the reviews that it was something great. Unfortunately there wasn't much to be seen. I was completely annoyed with John Cusack's preformance and I was never taken in by any of the story's quirkiness. Some genuinely funny moments aside, I am at a loss of words to explain why this movie was not only on ten best lists, but at the top of them as well. I agree with another reviewer here with the phrase \\"different doesn't mean brilliant\\". Too often these days leading critics are confusing those two words. While very different, BEING JOHN MALKOVICH was far from brilliant."},{"rating":"1","title":"Uncomfortable, unpleasant experience","review":"I'm a fan of John Malkovich and when I heard that he was going to be in the movie that bore his name I had to see it. Aside from a couple of parts where Malkovich is actually on screen (\\"Malkovich, Malkovich\\" and the Charlie Sheen cameo), this movie is dreary, unsettling, and for the most part pure trash. Not creative trash, mind you, gratutious \\"let's push the envelope and impose our own sick fantasies on the public\\" trash. This movie has nothing much to say aside from wasting our time showing how a pack of not-so-nice low life people sink even lower while engaging in sick sexual fantasies and backstabbing each other. It wasn't entertaining nor thought-provoking, just provoking; a dismal and self-involved effort that wastes a couple of hours of your life when you could be doing something much better than fill your mind with this trash. I didn't even watch it to the end. Two-thirds of the way through was all I could stomach."},{"rating":"1","title":"There's nothing to get!","review":"This is one of only 2 movies I have almost walked out of. The characters were shallow, the plot was thin, and the only entertaining aspect of the movie was the overall concept and imagery.

The premise is interesting. That's the reason I watched this movie in the first place. However, the execution leaves a whole lot to be desired. I don't want to ruin the movie for anyone who still wants to see it, but I will say that I was surprised at how poorly some of the actors acted in this movie, especially Cameron Diaz. The movie also takes far too long to get anywhere and when it does, you're left wondering how much better this movie could have been with a stronger script. I know that Roger Ebert said this was the best movie of 1999 (it says so right on the box), but he really missed the boat on this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"122 mins on one premise?","review":"This movie became excrutiatingly boring after about 20 mins.

I'm glad, because I wouldn't have wanted a single moment spoiled by knowing what was going to happen in advance.That said, I won't be giving away any plot here. All I need to say is that this is one terrific film and its a fair bet it's unlike any other you've ever seen. While it's humour is intellectual, at times downright black, it manages for the most part to remain lighthearted and playful; an uncommon feat. Still, it isn't the most accessible film around. If you like your comedy lowbrow, this film probably isn't for you. OTOH, if you're looking for something utterly different from the run of the mill experience and have a taste for somewhat darker humour, you won't be disappointed by this one.Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"At last something original from Hollywood","review":"Definitely a strange idea - a portal into the mind of John Malkovich. An office with unusually low ceilings. This is the kind of thing that you don't get away with, unless you do it well. Fortunately for all it is done well. Funny, oddball and entertaining. Charlie Sheen was an unnecessary adjunct, but otherwise good."},{"rating":"2","title":"Being John Malkovich","review":"This might be the weirdest movie I've ever seen. BJM is about Craig Schwartz, who is a puppeteer who works on the 7 1/2 floor of a building in New York. One day, he finds a door in his office that lets him be John Makovich for 15 minutes and it ditches him on the New Jersey Turnpike. He lets other people try it for $200 and he begins a little something called \\"J.M.INC\\". Mr. Malkovich finds out about it and he wants to find out what's going on. Craig explains that it's a \\"business\\", and that entices him to go into the portal himself......."},{"rating":"1","title":"Being Bored Stiff","review":"Yawn. Ooh, wait.

I did not like the characters. I did not care about them. I thought the premise stupid not weird. The actors have all done better work. [ I DID like Mary Kay Place a lot though.] It was mildly amusing in spots but never laugh out loud funny."},{"rating":"1","title":"umm...well it was definitly weird, I'll say that for it","review":"This was a VERY strange movie. It started out alright...though John Cusak and his puppets was weird..and Cameron Diaz and her animals was even weirder. I will say that the movie was interesting and had a plot that kept me hooked--at least for a little. The thing that got to me was that one character was having sex with John Malkovich WHILE Diaz was inside MAlkovich and the character (Maxine) and Diaz both new it and were doing this to have sex with each other....gross. No offense to gays out there, but I think that \\"gay\\" sex did not need to be in that movie, because it really could have been good without it."},{"rating":"1","title":"HELP","review":"Has anyone else had problems playing this disc? I have a relatively new DVD player but when I play it I'm told that the disc cannot be played. I obtained another disc at my video rental store and I get the same message. Is there too much information on this disc and has my Pioneer 414 become obsolete?"},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT A COMEDY","review":"This so called comedy is one of the worst films I have ever seen.While I love Cusack and Diaz this film ranks as their most lackluster performances. I must admit the the storyline is the most unique in recent times. But this alone cannot carry a film. The repetitive nature of this film adds to the annoying nature of it. For example, falling out of thin air onto a hiway on-ramp, while humerous the first time, lost its affect after the 8th and 9th time. So, if you are wondering weather or not you should view this garbage, my advice is a resounding no!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Stupid plot and proding story","review":"Waste of time.

This is a joke - no, I don't mean it's a bad film, I mean the film is one big joke - so if you like this sort of surreal, oh-so-terribly-clever if you're of the yuppy generation and think YOU'RE so terribly clever, exponent of meaningless and purposeless film making, you'll be in heaven. I was not. Inexplicably nominated for direction and screenplay - proving once again there is a great contingent of artless voters in the Academy's roster - however, one does have to doff the hat at two performances, the rightfully Oscar nominated supporting work of Catherine Keener, and the unjustly Oscar-neglected work of Cameron Diaz. They are both quite fine and the only reasons to see this bizarre little film."},{"rating":"1","title":"Being John Malkovich","review":"This movie really made me think about what it would be like to be someone else. The whole time I just kept wishing I could be someone who WASN'T watching Being John Malkovich."},{"rating":"2","title":"...","review":"This is an amusing movie. It spends a lot of time just showing us how bizarre the world of these characters are and by its end, it hasn't given us many new ideas or followed through on everything nicely. How Craig could manipulate J.Malkovich because of his career is kind of a MacGuffin, really. We never get too attached to the characters because they are all too often, there for a joke or cartoon-ish and not fleshed out too well. For this movie to be ideal, it would have to have more genuine characters and emotions depicted. It's dreamlike in the perfect way however, you just have to like it for what it is."},{"rating":"1","title":"a bleak and boring fantasy","review":"I generally like fantasy & sci fi; maybe the trouble for me with BJM is that I have seen -- and read -- too much of the genre to be impressed by a mere bizarre idea. And that's all this movie has going for it. In particular, in order to like a movie, I need to like and sympathize with at least one of the characters. In spite of the basic premise that these characters get a kick out of being someone else, each of them is totally selfish and self-absorbed, and therefore, for me, totally unengaging. This is a complaint about the writing, not the acting. The only thing I enjoyed about this movie was the puppeteering."},{"rating":"1","title":"I thought the movie was terrible","review":"I disagree with the consensus, and think this was one of the worst movies I've seen this year. I had high expectations for this movie since the advertising on the box says it was nominated for 3 academy awards, and Roger Ebert said \\"best movie of the year!\\"I found the story original, but sort of silly. The floor 7 1/2 joke gets sort of old, and super-babe Cameron Diaz looks horrible in this movie (I was expecting something better to look at). John Malkovich, himself, is also a very boring personality. The whole movie was very unfunny, and quite unentertaining -- I just don't get what people find so great."},{"rating":"1","title":"Inane, pointless, stultifyingly stupid","review":"Being John Malkovich was one of my worst cinematic experiences, ever. Fortunately I walked out before the end of this disaster, and I actually stormed out of the theatre. Pretentious, asinine, stultifyingly stupid, pointless, execrable, insufferable garbage. Mind-numbingly awful. Incompetent. Inept. Ludicrous. Third worst film of all time, behind 'Rent' and \\"Vanilla Sky'. Words cannot express how much of an outrage this film is. Those responsible for this dreck would not know what creativity is if it hit them in the head with a hydrogen bomb. The negative should be burned and the ashes scattered to Madagascar. I HATED this movie!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of Time and Money","review":"This movie was really messed up and hard to follow. Don't waste your time watching it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ugh!!","review":"I adore John Malkovich. I havent missed any of his movies. Intelligent, super suave, extraordinarily attractive, a true gentleman (or so he seems), superior actor. How could he allow even his name to appear in this so-called movie? How could he allow to be represented in such a manner? Was he really in such a need of money that he accepted this shameful parody of himself? I could not believe my eyes when I watched this...., I do not know what to call it: it is not a movie, it is a farce and an insult to the intelligence of any living person. Ugh, and ugh and ugh!!! Pure trash."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dire","review":"Sometimes a movie comes along which everyone cracks up as a masterpiece, nominates for Oscars and all that, when actually it's terrible. \\"Being There\\" was one of those. This is another. It's pointless and silly without being funny. Actually, it's rather painful. You sit watching it wondering what idiocy is coming next. It's slow, and really rather boring. There is absolutely, totally, utterly no point in having half the film set in an office with a shoulder-high ceiling. I was willing to laugh, or even smile, but after about ten minutes I couldn't. Contrast this mess with \\"The Purple Rose of Cairo\\", a genuinely witty, touching and ingenious film, although founded on a similarly wacky premise. Oh dear Oh dear Oh dear. What might Woody Allen have made of this basic material?"},{"rating":"1","title":"I guess I just don't get it...","review":"My wife and I anxiously awaited this DVD to come from Amazon, and when it came in we popped it in and sat back to watch it. But when the final credits rolled, we both looked at each other in amazement - \\"That's it?\\".Don't get me wrong...it has a couple funny lines, but overall this is just a bizarre movie. I guess you either get it or you don't. We didn't."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thought Provoking","review":"It has been awhile since I have seen such a good movie. It is probably the most thought provoking movie I have ever seen. And I find myself pretty hard to impress. It's not a slapstick comedy like most comedies, but it is pretty funny. I think everyone would agree with me that the funniest part was when John Malkovic entered the vessel that goes into his mind. Being John Malkovich is very clever and well thought out. It is much better to get the DVD because it includes the orientation film about the 7th floor. It also includes other great things. I saw this late at night and went to bed afterword. When I was trying to sleep, all I could think was, \\"Wow.\\" Not, \\"WOW! That was so cool!\\" but, \\"Wow.\\" You know. The kind of \\"Wow\\" you let out when you are just so amazed. I'm not saying you should buy this, for it may not be your kinf of movie. But you should most definitely rent it."},{"rating":"1","title":"icky","review":"I didnt like this movie. All the characters were wretched, except for malkovich, whom I felt sorry for. Although there were a few comedic spots (the half floor, charlie sheen) over all, I found this movie to be depressing and sad. The whole time I was watching this, I couldn't help but wonder why I would want to spend 2 hours with any of these people."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bizarre!","review":"I went through 3 months of intensive psychotherapy after watching this.

Watch this movie, if only for this scene!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Most Original Movie Ever","review":"Well folks, if you're looking to have your mind blown, then this is the right place to start. This movie is without a doubt one of the most mind expanding movies ever made. I mean come on, how bizzare is an office on a floor disigned for midgets with a secret portal into John Malkovich's mind? The most memorable sceen is is Malkovich's trip through his own mind. It is pretty creepy at times, and just plain wrong at others, but it keeps you going. I was shocked that this movie didn't get the recognition it deserved in the Academy Awards though."},{"rating":"1","title":"This film is...is...well, not good","review":"I'd give this film one - yes, one! - star if not for the engaging and imaginative first half hour. After that, it's all downhill. A promising beginning that had my full attention dissolves into an unfunny mess, and it's painful to watch it happen. You can sense the movie is just not going to take off, and guess what? It doesn't. In the portal. Out of the portal. In the portal. Out of the portal. Dopey characters that were more like cartoons than real flesh and blood people. A plot that might have sounded good on paper but on celluloid failed miserably to hold my interest. Plus, a script that thought it was far more clever than it actually was.My own mother said I had to see this preposterous nonsense. Shows you what she knows."},{"rating":"2","title":"weird but wonderful","review":"this movie is totally whacky and wonderful, forget the metaphysical, philosophical meanings and everything else. this is one very hilarious movie. the plot is quirky, but what stands out are the brilliant lines, great situations and absolutely outstanding acting.****spoilers herein****john malkovich is totally mindblowing, when he plays craig schwartz, you see john cusack and not malkovich. truly brilliant. catherine keener has the most attractive role and she does full justice, cameron diaz in a deglamorized role shines.apart from the acting, the quirky movie is radiant with brilliant humor that makes one laugh out loud. the weirdness of the situations get more and more complex and are very well handled by the director spike jonze. this movie has a terry gilliam feel to it, without going totally overboard. the plot gets quite absurd, but honestly, i didnt care. it was a fun movie. weird, yes, but wonderful"},{"rating":"1","title":"Surrealist film collapses in a mundane second half","review":"I was so looking forward to seeing this film. I agree with a previous review -- it starts off well, but collapses in the second half.Story begins with much surrealism and bizzareness (such as the low offices on the 7 1/2 floor -- wedged between the 7th and 8th floors). Some sharp witty lines. Cameron Diaz \\"stretches\\" and takes risks -- still beautiful in her brown contact lens, frizzy wig, and lisp.But the parts of this film are greater than the whole, and despite good scenes, the last half drags into a mundane politically correct story."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful and Unique","review":"This film is great. I saw it and was amazed, it used the point of view like a paint brush and the plot kept me guessing. It is unlike any thing else. I would definately recomend this film to anyone wanting to view their world a little differently."},{"rating":"2","title":"Have you ever wanted to be someone else? Now you can...","review":"Wow! To begin, I've always enjoyed John Malkovich's talent as an actor, but to be fair he is very nearly outshined by John Cusack and Catherine Keener.Imagine for a moment that you find a strange door somewhere, and once you enter, you become John Malkovich, and see his world through his eyes. Then after 15 minutes, you're spit out into a ditch on the side of the New Jersey Turnpike. Throughout this odd sojourn into J.M.'s mind and body is an odd love triangle between Cusack, Keener, and Cusack's wife, played by Cameron Diaz.The greed and avarice that becomes apparent in all three of these characters is intense, as John Malkovich becomes simply a means to an end, much to his own dismay.Buy, rent, borrow a copy of this film. You will not be disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another great 1999 movie","review":"It's a good thing this wasn't Being Ned Beatty or something like that(still can't get over Deliverance). This film is brilliantly directed - most likely the best directed film of the year. The script is way, WAY out of left field, but it manages to satire our fascination with celebrity and still tell a genuinely moving story. And the performances are first-rate. John Cusack is one of our most underrated actors, and I also thought Cameron Diaz was terrific. John Malkovich and Catherine Keener though, their craft is on a whole other level. Do not miss this one. Wish the DVD had running commentary, but oh well, nothing's perfect."},{"rating":"2","title":"Stunningly original and the first half-hour is priceless","review":"I think John Cusack said it best when he said, \\"This is a screenplay that no one could have written, thinking it would ever be made\\". It's that original and off-beat. I'm so glad it was also successful since it may open doors to some other off-the-wall ideas that might not seem commercial enough otherwise. This movie is very well-acted the whole way through and the plot is so fresh, you find yourself wondering how anyone ever thought of it in the first place. Cheers to the brave cast who took all this on and to writer Charlie Kaufmann whose unique vision deserves more recognition. The film lost a bit of steam for me by the end but it's never boring and the first half-hour is as funny and startling as anything I've ever seen."},{"rating":"1","title":"Quirky? Unique? Original?","review":"Fargo was quirky, as was Raising Arizona, The Gods must be Crazy, Waiting for Guffman,,,etc. This was the most dis-jointed film I have had to endure in a long time. I like to watch films that have a somewhat plausible relationship with reality. I agree with the reviewers who compared it to Alice in Wonderland. Also, I couldn't get the humor about the secretary who couldn't understand someone speaking, she was just irritating. There were a few humorous, original scenes but not gut wrenching. I watched this just like I did Chariots of Fire, hoping for it to get better and it never did. I'm glad I didn't buy it, just rented it. I did hurry back with my copy to get the $1 credit for early return. I guess I'm from a different era than the ones who loved it or I haven't done enough drugs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Believe the Hype","review":"Unfortunately, we're so desperate for an interesting movie these days that people can be tricked by pretentious pieces of fluff like this film. A clever premise does not a good movie make. Jonze cut his directorial teeth on music videos, and this film, with its complete lack of three-dimensional characters, dramatic structure, or any emotion whatsoever, reflects that. Don't let your psuedo-intellectual friends trick you into thinking that you have to like this movie, because you don't. It's a waste."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hugh?","review":"Sorry, when I watched this movie, I sat there with my mouth open watching in curosity as to when I'd finally be free of this torture.

Not really that funny or entertaining. It feels as if it is trying to hard."},{"rating":"1","title":"Confused and contrived","review":"What a load of old cobblers! This is like watching 6 short films strung together and not one of them has anything to do with another. There is no consistency here. It's just another reason why music video clip directors should not be allowed to make films.Ask anyone why he or she liked this film and the standard answer is \\"I thought it was interesting.\\" 'Interesting' is how you describe bad haircuts when you don't want to offend.Malkovich and Cusack should be ashamed of themselves... oh no, they already did Con Air. That was enough."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not funny, bizarre - or maybe I don't get it?","review":"I, too, waited with baited breath for this DVD to arrive - thinking that I had a rare comedic treat in store. Instead I found a plot that is plain old bizarre. While I did get a laugh or two, I couldn't find anything to write home about. I have to wonder if the movie-going public is so desperate for entertainment that ANYTHING the least bit different is greeted with cudos. The friend that I watched it with agreed with me that it was strange. Neither one of us enjoyed it and, indeed, wondered what drugs Jonze was on.Frankly, I thought it didn't have a plot. The charactors are pretty much disagreeable. And, it's not very funny. Different, yes. Good, no. Maybe I don't get it? Maybe I have pedestrian tastes in movies? Whatever it is, this is not one I want to watch again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Huh? Was that necessary. . .?","review":"I enjoy \\"deep\\" movies, but sometimes \\"deep\\" movies appear deep without truly being deep. This is one of those movies. It was at times thought provoking, but the so called twists and paradoxes, to me, had no deeper meaning other that to have them so people who professed to understand them could feel more intelligent than the rest of the population who did not. Maybe it is sour grapes, but to me if they had cut out some of the \\"deeper\\" idioms the movie would have sustained the true depth and thought provoking ideals it was looking for."},{"rating":"1","title":"I watch it all the way through but not sure why...","review":"May be creative but I like to think the average veiwer has a little more taste and education than the target of this film.

As in, the person who wrote it may not so much be an immoral person; rather, that the person has no moral compass whatsoever. You tell me which is worse.The message of these amoral movie-makers: Hey, it's all relative, right?Setting aside the all-too politically-correct condoning of lesbianism, this movie also condones adultery and spousal abuse (i.e., locking your wife up for hours on end so you can go chase another woman!).To top it all off, it's not funny. If there were some funny scenes in it, maybe they were left on the cutting room floor or something.Just because a movie is quirky, does NOT necessarily mean it's funny.If you want to see a quirky movie which is actually funny as well, go rent Raising Arizona again, and nevermind this colossally overrated stinker."},{"rating":"1","title":"Being John Malkovich","review":"One of the most boring, obscene, disgusting, repulsive movies I have ever seen in my 25 years of movie-watching. The movie had no obvious plot, going through the mind of some one else is childish, and the music put me and my companion asleep. A real snoresville of a movie. In reality I would give this movie a quarter of a star if I had that option or maybe an eighth of a star."},{"rating":"2","title":"I have to go back!","review":"I loved this dark comedy about the thrilling experience of being John Malkovich. You don't want to know anything about what happens, just see it. The entire movie is surreal. It is never predictable, sometimes very dark and pessimistic, and oh so delicious to watch. What it all means is up to you. Enjoy!"},{"rating":"1","title":"It was","review":"...to put it mildly, just very ok. The story was very weird, which I did like, but the characters were all very unlikeable. Very much so. In fact it was so bad that I did not care one way or another about what was going to happen to these people. I felt the different subplots just made the movie longer and several of the jokes did get real old, real fast. I know that this movie is not for everyone. Some people will like it, others will hate it. I am sort of split. I liked parts, but on the whole it was a very dull movie. I would highly recommend renting this movie before you decide to buy it. It may save you lots of head aches in the future."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good movie that takes you on a laid back rollercoster ride","review":"I liked this movie but I thought it was choppy in some sence but other wise this movie was grate it was nothing like the usuall movies and thats a big part of why people like this movie so much. Well for me anyway. You get sick of the same old stuff and this movie was defintly not the usuall stuff. It was also not based on anything that is another big part of why it is such a good movie I mean we only see the same things over and over again because when you look at it they are the same thing over and over again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Immensly Overrated","review":"I am a lover movies, and can appreciate even the worst of films. This happens to be one of the ones I appreciate, not love. The plot was creative, but not my taste. It was very corky and dumb, despite it's immense originality. Leaves me to the better question of: why not somebody more entertaining than John Malkovich?The one thing this film does right is cinematography. When you actually are John Malkovich, the camera work is brilliant, as well as the depth perception, sound, and lighting. Basically, what the film does is make a peice of crap LOOK really pretty. John Cusack and Catherine Keener had great performances, but John Malkovich and Cameron Diaz had mediocre performances at best. The film leaves you with nothing. You watch it and you go \\"oh,\\" there is no \\"wow\\" not \\"OH MY!\\" no \\"I can't believe it.\\" You are left there completely apathetic and in utter disappointment.*Side note* If puppets creep you out as much as they do me, than don't watch this film."},{"rating":"2","title":"My favorite movie for some time now.","review":"I love the combination of scifi existentialism, reality in the fact that John Malkovich plays himself, and subtle comedy.There are scenes in this movie that stick in my head and make me chuckle when I think of them long after seeing it.I would recommend it to anyone who enjoys a lot of quirkiness in their movies."},{"rating":"2","title":"Stunning filmmaking with a perfect cast","review":"\\"Being John Malkovich\\" is my choice for the best film of 1999. Forget what Roger Ebert says... allison5000 has deemed it so! Stemming from a brilliant script, the film features mandrical performances from the entire cast. Many of today's movies suffer from predictability, but that's never a problem here. The ending is truly a sublime treat. And how can John Cusack make us care about such an insipid character? What a swell actor! Best Picture of 1999, hands down. \\"American Beauty\\" was a turkey."},{"rating":"2","title":"Being John Malkovich Review","review":"Being John Malkovich is an inventive comic fantasy about a struggling puppeteer who finds, on the 7 floor of his office building a doorway into the mind of John Malkovich. Very well thought out and enjoyable, with a great cast including John Cusack, Cameron Diaz and John Malkovich.This offbeat comedy is full of offbeat special features including the \\"7 Floor Orientation\\" and \\"An Intimate Portrait of the Art of Puppeteering.\\" A commentary would have been nice and might have bumped my score a little.Overall, if you're looking for a smart, inventive comedy, then definitely watch this movie. But since it is offbeat I would suggest renting before buying."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply the Best!","review":"\\"Being John Malkovich\\" is an amazing story of sexuality, love, betrayal, and the one thing that many people say to themselves... \\"i wanna be someone else\\". I thought this film was well written out because all these different emotions got tangled up in the 4 lives of Maxine, Craig, Lotte and John, creating an amazing story starting off with the 7 and half floor and little door that lead into a big change in not just Craigs life, but many others. Be sure to listen to everything said 'cause jokes a easily missed and you might not understand the situation at the very end of the film. It would be a big mistake to miss this film as it makes you think a lot about yourself. And if your into creative writing it wouuld be perfect as it gives you many of YOUR OWN ideas."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's hard to believe this was an American film!","review":"I typically avoid the film product delivered to us pablum style by Hollywood. It's typically mindless and dull. Being John Malkovich renewed my faith in the capacity for creative thought still lurking out there. What a fantastic concept...getting inside the mind of Malkovich. And John Cusack is at the top of his form as well. If you're the least bit cerebral, you'll enjoy this film."},{"rating":"1","title":"Definitely on the bizarre side...","review":"Everyone raved about this movie so I had high expectations. But they were left unmet. There were moments of brilliance in this film and also moments of pure stupidity. The real John Malkovich is a good sport for going along with this one.

It doesn't make a whole lot of sense."},{"rating":"1","title":"This movie is ok at best","review":"Ok I rented this movie wanting to like this movie and buy it. I could just not get myself to like this movie or understand WHAT IS THE POINT OF ALL OF THIS?

Especially memorable: what happens when JM enters his own \\"portal\\" and the surprising turn of events when Craig (John Cusack) manipulates JM for his own benefit. It's so refreshing to see a movie devoid of that \\"Test Audience Mentality\\". My sole regret is that I knew anything about the plot before seeing it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Go ahead, open that metaphysical can of worms!","review":"You cannot go wrong with this movie ( as long as you dont need to like the characters to enjoy a movie! All of the characters are dispicable and selfish, in one way or another.Kaufman weaves the details together like a master, one example is the \\"Jewel thief\\" movie misnomer that spreads though several characters and gets back to John himself.As for the humour, it is as funny and more intelligent than anything released in years."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Idea, Witless Execution","review":"There's a brilliant idea at the core of Being John Malkovich, and when I first saw this flick I expected to like it a LOT. Few movies have disappointed me so thoroughly. To begin with, there's absolutely no one to like here...John Cusack whines his way through his role and plays nothing more than his greasy, stringy hair; Cameron Diaz is little more than a doormat; and the much-touted Catherine Keener is all stiletto heels. Then too, there's Spike Jonze's direction -- off just a shnoop (to quote Chico)...IN EVERY SCENE. What should be funny is either thrown away or, more often, belabored beyond even a smile. What should be touching is handled with sledgehammer finesse. This is one movie I won't be watching a second, third or fourth time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Weirdness for the sake of wierdness","review":"This is possibly one of the most overrated films I have ever seen.I feel complete indifference to all the characters. The plot is a meandering shambles and the best thing in it is Charlie Sheen! How bad must a movie be if Charlie Sheen is the best thing in it!I can't even see the point it's trying to make. Is it a satire on the nature of celebrity or a surreal sci-fi movie?Either way it fails. If you want to track down surreal try Terry Gilliam. In fact the whole film would have worked much better as Gilliam/Python animation than a live action movie.If you want a satire on celebrity try DeNiro's 'King of Comedy.'On a final note the whole movie just looks terrible!

It has a bizarre idea and turns itself into a mockery of the craft of abstract movie making. It's so pretentious and stuffy, I want to gag myself with a pipe-cleaner. I like malkovich as usual, he's a very formidable and demanding presence, but other than that the movie blew. I was bored and apathetic by the closing ten minutes. May Spike Jonze succeed with his follow up Adaption."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wha? Didn't like it.","review":"I hate EVERYTHING about this cruddy film. Ugh. I hope they all died.

Yes! Entertaining? No! What turns out to be a great idea becomes a terrible movie. BEING JOHN MALKOVICH has a great premise,but the execution suffers from a dreary romance and some downbeat characters. The idea of going into that tunnel and ending up in the mind of a second rate actor, then being forced onto the New Jersey turnpike is funny the first time, but it doesn't go anywhere. The love triangles are not worth looking out for and the characters (especially Maxine/Catherine Keener - -who played the same kind of \\"@#$%\\" on an episode of SEINFELD) are not sympathetic. Also, Cameron Diaz looks awful. As usual,John Cusack plays the same character he always plays in most of his movies except in this film, he looks like a bum. The ESPN commercials using the idea were funnier. A movie to watch just one time and that's it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I wasn't laughing...","review":"I'm not going to say this was a BAD movie, it just wasn't a very good one. Somehow the comedy was lost in the wierdness and twisted thinkings of the movie. This movie was just strange. Most unusual is just thinking about the later part of the story, with Malkovich becoming the puppeteer, and how that would fit in real life. While there are some entertaining moments, and some interesting ideas posed, they are lost by the imagery of the darker humor, such as the animal cage part. This is one of those movies that's too silly to be a drama, and too seriously written to be a comedy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Constantly surprising, imaginative, and hilarious.","review":"Being John Malkovich casts a spell of enchantment over its viewers by creating its own wacky world, with its completely strange characters and out-of-kilter rules, and then remaining absolutely true to that world. You get a big, wonderful surprise every five minutes; the \\"Malkovich Malkovich Malkovich\\" scene alone is worth the price of a rental! John Malkovich himself was robbed when he didn't get a Best Actor or Supporting Actor nomination, but considering the sheer glorious weirdness of this movie, I must bow to the Academy for breaking its usual bonds and actually giving this film nominations for Best Director, Screenplay and Supporting Actress.

Each box contains 2 pouches and each pouch makes two large (2 cup) serving of soup. So basically, if you half the pouches, you are paying for 96 (24 x 2 x 2) servings, which is not a bad deal at all. Compared to the Sun-Bird brand egg drop soup mix, it is a little harder to mix (harder to get the clumps out), and a little less flavorful in my opinion, but you get more than twice for the price (the cheapest I found Sun-Bird is 48 servings for $45). To help with the flavor, I stir in a little soy sauce, and chives. It tastes good.The instructions on the box are odd. It says to add noodles (I've never heard of adding noodles to egg drop soup), and then continue to simmer it after adding the egg, but you shouldn't need to do any more than just bring it to a boil, stir in the egg, turn off the heat and let it cool. The egg is done enough by then."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thin Red Line vs. Private Ryan","review":"These two films have been one of the most compared films in recent memory. The majority of moviegoers who see either Thin Red Line or Saving Private Ryan pick the latter as the superior film, but I assure you almost all educated, experienced moviegoers prefer Thin Red Line. Personally, I prefer Red Line. It may not be as brutal, realistic or emotional as Saving Private Ryan, hell it Ryan may even be the better film, but Thin Red Line was an original film. Instead of taking the normal bloody route great war films usually take, it took the poetic, much more intellectual path. Also, like \\"Contact\\", it explored and questioned the true value of human life and nature of living things, while Ryan made its own conclusions with in-your-face Hollywood situations and left little room for true discussion. Terrence Malick may well be the next Stanley Kubrick. His quiet, beautiful, confident attempt at storytelling in this film reminded me of 2001: A Space Odyssey."},{"rating":"2","title":"High Art - Malick's Genius Shines Through","review":"The Thin Red Line ' isn't a movie for everyone. Especially not the vegetable-brained. If you're one of them, go back to your ' Saving Private Ryan's ' and ' Windtalkers '.' The Thin Red Line ' is the kind of movie which needs a little heart, soul and mind to appreciate. Terrence Malick shows that he might have left hollywood for 2 decades, but his genius has'nt diminished one bit. Jim Caviziel, Sean Penn, Nick Nolte, John Cusack and Elias Koteas turn out hauntingly brilliant performances and do justice to a beautifully written script.A must for all those who appreciate good art. This, my friends, is one of the best you'll ever see."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thin red line: A classic still in progress","review":"I remember quite well the simultanious release of 'Saving Private Ryan' and 'Thin Red Line' in 98. I watched them back to back. Back then, I was still very young and semi-educated when it comes to watching film. That is why I had more appreciation for Private Ryan in my youthful years. I shocked me and I loved it. And with 'Thin Red Line', I fell asleep halfway through. But what an idiot I were!! There is no comparison. Thin Red Line is such a beautiful crafted film. O.K., maybe the action sequences were a bit ordinary, but that is not of real importance in the film. Terrence Malick is a genius, not like Spielberg, a machine. He has a greater understanding of man. Why he doesn't make more films I honestly don't know. He's very similiar to Kubrick.This film will eventually become a classic. It is too good to be ignored forever. Best war movie of all time? I think so"},{"rating":"1","title":"Fantastic photography.","review":"The photography in this film is fantastic, but that's about all it has to offer. Malick's attempt to philosophize was didn't seem to come off as far as I was concerned, and if he spent twenty years preparing and making this film I feel it was time wasted. I guess the only War movie that's ever going to hit the mark is Saving Private Ryan. However, any aspiring filmmaker shoudl see the Thin Red Line for its photographic conent if for nothing else."},{"rating":"1","title":"OH COME ON, BETTER THAN \\"SAVING PRIVATE RYAN\\"??","review":"I have to admit, the cinematography was well done and the film was beautiful. But this aint no war film. There's about twenty minutes of war battles through the 2 hour and 50 min. film and it just drags on and on until I want to be shot myself. This is isn't war, it's a National Geographic Special on the Rainforest. Saving Private Ryan is better, and it was recognized with 5 Academy Awards. TTRL won none. It does reflect on the film because Oscars stand for film excellence, and Saving Private Ryan had it. The horrific battle scenes and excellent score by Mr. John Williams. The Bottom Line on the Thin Red Line: It's too pretty to make a great war film. And it is very boring. The script is average. This is basically the script: a day-by-day account of World War II.

I watched this movie and even though it was three hours and didn't have the greatness of \\"Private Ryan\\" in the war scenes, I loved this. It really made me think. What is war?

If you can't stand the filosophical aspect, you shouldn't watch this at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"A real snoozer! NOTHING Happens for long periods of time!","review":"I didn't expect to see a national Geographic nature film when I saw The Thin Red Line! Director/ Writer Terrence Malick butchered the James Jones Novel of the same title. What an abomination of a story! With all the hype and comparison this movie had with Saving Private Ryan -- I left the theatre thoroughly disappointed. Saving Private Ryan reigns supreme as the definative WW-II movie. The Thin Red Line has three things going for it -- excellent cinematography, well choreographed battle scenes (which don't happen very often in between all the poetic ramblings on why is there air etc etc), and an intense acting performance by Nick Nolte as Lt. Col Tall. That's it. Are you suffering from insomnia?? The Thin Red Line is your cure -- rush to get it when it comes out on video!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Rent this movie before you buy it.","review":"I know that everyone wants to hear how great a movie is. Well, I can't say The Thin Red Line is a great movie.Maybe my expectations were too high. After all, I bought this movie after watching Band of Brothers, Saving Private Ryan, and A Bridge Too Far. So, I was expecting The Thin Red Line to be on that level. With 7 Academy Award Nominations including Best Picture, a cast that includes many of the top names in Hollywood, and a huge budget, the bar was set pretty high.To me this movie was way too artsy. It just wasn't a \\"war\\" movie in the same way as Saving Private Ryan or Band of Brothers. The all star cast contributed mostly small parts, almost like cameo's. None of the \\"stars\\" had a huge roll.I would strongly suggest that you rent this movie before you buy it."},{"rating":"2","title":"BEST FILM OF THE YEAR","review":"The Thin Red Line was a truly moving and intriguing look into the minds of men faced with war. Excellent direction, beautiful cinematography, a wonderfully heart felt score (Bravo Mr Zimmer) and outstanding acting turn the Thin Red Line from a great film to a masterpiece. This film was far more powerful than Saving Private Ryan and should have cleaned up at the Oscars. As long as you are willing to pay attention, and appreciate the emotional depth of this film, aswell as the riveting action scenes, then there is never a dull moment in this exceptional film. Do NOT miss this one!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A yawn that tries to look deep.","review":"Sorry, showing a bunch of grunts running around scared out of their wits while you hear their voices reciting pseudo-poetry is not sophisticated film-making; it's just a clumsy, heavy-handed attempt at scoring stylistic points. And it's just pathetic the way this movie has so many people crowing about their own intellectual superiority just because they happen to like it. It's proof positive that this actually is a movie for very shallow people. By taking trite, hackneyed sentiments, couching them in stilted, spuriously philosophical language, and topping it off with some run-of-the-mill nature footage, this movie has succeeded in duping many people into thinking it's \\"deep\\" and \\"artistic\\".

It covers war as it really is, endless boredom, short battle with lots of gore, endless boredom, repeat. The movie seemed longer than the battle.It is a shame that such an important battle is represented by such a bad movie. Perhaps John Milius or Steven Spielburg will do Guadalcanal and the men who fought there, justice, like they did in \\"THe Rough Riders\\" and \\"Saving Private Ryan\\", which are as good as this movie is bad.If I wanted someone to talk, I would duct tape them to a chair, clamp their eyelids open a-la a Clockwork Orange, and force them to watch this movie.The movie is torture."},{"rating":"1","title":"What can I say?","review":"Bad and unfinished character development stuck out like a sore thumb.

It was overshadowed by Saving Private Ryan which is a just as powerful film but I feel that The Thin Red Line is a better movie. Unknown people like Caviezel, Ben Chaplin, Elias Koteas give beautiful performances. Nick Nolte and Sean Penn are excellent. To me, every actor was worthy of an academy award nomination. The film itself is beautiful. The camera work shows just what Malick wants. He wants visual art. What we see on screen is nothing but beautiful visual poetry. Ben Chaplin scenes, when talking of his wife, are just great. But in my opinion, it is Jim Caviezel who gives the best performance of the film. He shows the innocence, the lonliness, the depression of PFC Witt. All in all the best pic of the year and one of the best war films ever made, if not the best.

To sum it up, it is a celluloid calamity. Truly, one of this decade's greatest movie making fiascos. All of the elements were there for a truly great movie- beautiful setting, human drama, even gifted actors. Why then, did it fail? The director was far in above his head (or talent or ability).

Too long of a movie + bad character development + the worst philosophical mumbo jumbo EVER placed on a film (hey, we know war destroys nature since it was stated like 2 hundred times {exaggeration}.Over-rated movie.

I've never seen such a slow, plodding, aimless, pretentious piece of garbage. This is one of those movies that claims to be artistic when it's really just a rambling of philosophical ideals and poetry. Why did people love this? Why did this win all sorts of awards? The casting was awful, the action scenes were awful, the film didn't seem genuine or accurate at all. It just jumped from scene to scene, with little or no transitions, and everything was thrown at you.Once again, Sean Penn's weak acting bores us all, and we all wonder collectively what Madonna saw that we didn't. Saving Private Ryan, Enemy at the Gates, and even 1941 is infinitely better.However, if you did like this - you'll enjoy a similar droning, boring movie - Tigerland."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not History","review":"This movie is not a war movie. It is not remotely related to history either. Guadalcanal was not like this as anyone who knows the people who fought there and the history.

Not only do the characters endlessly pontificate (to themselves, no less!), but the director chose to portray American GIs as nothing more than brutal animals.

To say it was boring would be an understatement. It seemed like it would never end. The urge to hit the fast-forward was overwhelming. It had no story, poor special effects and jumped around so much it made my head spin. I never connected with any of the characters and still didn't know any of their names by the end of the movie.

It has been said that war is 99% boredom and 1% terror. Perhaps the director sought to provide just such a balance. The juxtaposition of poetic musings against this boredom, while interesting, really doesn't make for much of a movie experience. I can do without the 30 minute setpiece of Ryan, but the attempt to have us simultaneously attain the suspension of disbelief AND care about ANY of the characters fails on both counts. But that doesn't mean that I'm a bad (or stupid, or insensitive) person!J.

Not strictly commercial as Saving Private Ryan, for instance, but just a piece of real art."},{"rating":"2","title":"Powerful! A beautiful, haunting masterpiece!","review":"Beautiful, haunting, poetic, surreal, thought provoking. This movie goes much deeper than the typical war flick, delving into the minds of the soldiers on the frontline; their fears, thoughts and where they draw their inner strength, and the reality and brutality of war. Jim Caviezel's performance as Private Witt is outstanding; his eyes conveying everything without a word! I was thoroughly transfixed throughout the entire length of the movie. If you're only interested in shallow warmonger flicks of artificial bravado, look elsewhere (although it does have its share of violence) If you're interested in the reality and tragedy of war, stunning cinematography and the most ethereal soundtrack I've ever heard in a move, this will not disappoint!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Not a film for everyone","review":"As you can see if you browse the reviews of other members here at Amazon, many did not enjoy this movie.

This is a philosophical masterpiece. A painting, if you will, that's open to interpretation. If you're looking for a good action flick, or prefer movies that drive their point home, this one isn't for you.On the other hand, if you've ever been wrapped up in a particular work of art and tried to deduce what the artist is trying to say, you're going to love this picture movie.To me, Director Terrence Malick is showing war vs. nature.

Luckily, it's on TV a lot, so you can avoid getting burned buying the DVD. Use matchsticks to keep your eyes pried open while you watch it, or if you have insomnia, it's the perfect cure. One very small action segment early on, and then a lot of meaningless anti-war blather and choppy flashbacks are all you have left. After the early action segment where they assault some bunkers and a Japanese base camp, you can go ahead and turn it off and watch a Simpson episode. You won't have missed anything."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Watch it","review":"There is only two words I can use to describe this movie: NOTHING HAPPENS. They simply just walk around the whole time. The first hour is the platoon walking around doing absolutely nothing. Then there's a good battle seen. Then, they do nothing again. After that there is a short fight seen, and then more of nothing. I can't understand why people would like a movie where people walk around. The only reason I give this a two, is because the few fight scenes are good."},{"rating":"1","title":"Thin, yes.. Good, no..","review":"Simply not an enjoyable film. Nick Nolte's performance was poor and monotonous, as were most the actors within the film. As a member of the US Army, I've seen my share of battles, both in the theatre and upon the battlefield, yet this movie however lived up to neither. A long list of names does not equal a meaningful film."},{"rating":"1","title":"unreadable","review":"Disk is unreadable in most DVD players I have tried.

Given the reviews, I expected to at least to enjoy this movie. What I didn't realize is that it is a film travelogue not set anywhere near Guadalcanal. There is a plot, and some acting, but mainly there are gorgeous shots of rainforest. Interspersed are philosophical narration, and flashbacks, which serve to make the movie even longer.The beginning and end of this movie are too far apart."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why can't I give it 0 stars?","review":"There really isn't much to say about this movie. I'd just rather die a slow painful death than see this movie again. A week ago I went to COSTCO and there is a five dvd war set at a very good price but I refuse to buy it simply because this movie is part of the set. I'd rather pay more for the other movies individually than get this one for free. Thats just how bad this movie is.Finally, I'd just like to say that they should have (...) the lady who spends the whole movie on a swing. That would have earned this movie at least three more stars.In conclusion, go to the dentist and have a root canal because you'll enjoy that more than this movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"One more vote for thumbs down","review":"Lots of ruminating over the evils of war and the fear of death set to brooding elevator music against a backdrop of promotional film from the South Pacific Tourism Bureau. One good scene, however: American soldiers charging into a Japanese-occupied hamlet. Absolutely gripping. I suppose the director's assistant was responsible for that one success. While the movie is not a total failure, it comes damn close. So save your time and money. The tragedy of this film is far more about missed artistic opportunities than it is about the Battle of Guadalcanal (of which we learn next to nothing from this movie, by the way). As is often the case, we are better off just reading the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Thin Dead Line","review":"This was absolutely the worst movie that I have watched in recent history. I was so disappointed when I watched this movie, I must have had the wrong intentions: I expected to be entertained. Instead I was lulled into a sleepy, lobotomizing stupor. This movie took place in WWII so one would expect some sort of action right? Well the only highlight in this movie for me was when Sean Penn blew his [rear] off with his own grenade, and I only cheered because of the distast I have for Sean Penn! If you enjoy watching the fuzz on channel 1, then perhaps this movie is for you (they both have the same entertainment value). However I recommend you pass on this lemon."},{"rating":"1","title":"Suck, suck suck","review":"If it were possible to give a rating of no stars, then that still would not be sufficient. This is perhaps one of the worst movies ever made not because of what it is, but rather what it tries to be. I suppose someone should have informed the director when he returned from his 20 year hiatus that these days, war movies have action, characters who you can relate to, and an overall storyline. Every time I would get the tiniest bit interested in what was going on, there would be a flashback to Sometown, USA, and I had no idea where that was and I could only guess who the people were. I guess that I might not be the best person to criticize this because I walked out after almost two hours of total boredom, but then maybe that makes me the perfect critic. Bottom Line: If you value your time and/or money in any way, shape, or form, rent Saving Private Ryan and see what a real war movie should be."},{"rating":"1","title":"I would like to give a negative star rating","review":"If it were possible, I would give a minus 2 star rating. This movie, which I watched with my father, a veteran of the era, was best described in his own words. \\"Garbage.\\" I felt duped into seeing this movie because of the sheer number of big stars on the roster, but instead was bored out of my mind by the numbing stupidity of the story. The only saving grace was the cinematography, which was spectacular. Just no story. Horrible, predictable ending. This movie did a favor to all the other bad movies I'd ever seen, by elevating them because it was so bad."},{"rating":"1","title":"Was there a battle in the background of the movie?","review":"A Thin Red Line is the worst war movie and one of the worst movies that I have ever seen. Who cares about the characters?! If only the troop ship had been sunk in shark frenzied waters early in the movie!!!! Why were they even fighting? To take a hill. Why? This was not questioned nor answered. The battle flow was very poor. The poor choreography of the battles was very inaccurate and uncomprehensible. Who gives a damn about some awol soldier talking to himself, another inaccurate conception. Chances are he would never have received the extra chances in life. Realism was lacking. What was the goal of the movie? Even a non-military person would not make the military blunders this movie does. It does not even capture the life of a soldier in the Pacific during WWII. To have watched this movie and enjoyed it means that you were duped or just plain ignorant on history."},{"rating":"1","title":"The year's most disappointing film","review":"Malick's return to the screen should have been with some other project... ANY other project. Filled with beautiful images, this film offers very little else. With a staggering amount of historical and continuity errors, not to mention military decisions that would never have been seen on a WW2 battlefield, this film just doesn't stand up to the obvious \\"Saving Private Ryan\\" comparisons. I was just unmoved by the characters and did not care what happened to them. In the end, it's a movie about nothing, and that's sad because it does a great injustice to the veterans of the Pacific war. If you want a much better film about this battle, see \\"Guadalcanal Diary\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"This movie cured my insomnia","review":"I have been experiencing long episodes of insomnia recently. I went to my Internist who recommended that I rent the Thin Red Line, get a glass of warm milk, and find a comfortable place to lie down. Needless to say, it worked! I was asleep within 10 minutes. I highly recommned this movie to help you sleep, Undoubtedly it is the most boring, sleep inducing story made. Those who interpret more into this were simply looking to fantasize something to interpret. Great sleep aid!"},{"rating":"1","title":"This was a collosal wasted effort","review":"After I saw Thin Red Line on opening day, I was so disappointed with the lousy directing and character acting, I decided to never again see any movie hyped and directed by an unknown director. This was commercially hyped to attract the Saving Private Ryan market, then thinly (and poorly) attempted to appear deep, mysterious and profound. It missed the mark on all accounts. This is just a waste of time. Failure, big time!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Too loooooooonnnnnnnnnngggggggg","review":"I don't know how some of you people liked this movie. It was toooooooo long. Fairly boring. Some parts were good, but overall the movie wasn't that great. \\"Saving Private Ryan\\" is a much better movie. I wouldn't recommend buying this movie. You should rent it instead and make sure you have a good 3 hours to be bored out of your mind."},{"rating":"2","title":"Highly Underated, Wonderful WW2 Film!!!","review":"I rented this movie not expecting to like it very much. I had already seen \\"Saving Private Ryan\\" in the theatre, and had heard that Thin Red Line wasn't NEARLY as good. Well, I have to say that the critics were wrong! Both are wonderful films, but I really don't see how you can compare them, even though they're both about the same war. I was especially impressed by the performance of relative newcomer Jim Caviezel, who gives a haunting portrayal of Witt. Just another example of a time when you shouldn't listen to the critics. I give this movie an A+ (and yes, this is another tearjerker!)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Somehow, it did not engage me.","review":"Somehow, it did not engage me.

Besides the exquisite cinematography, haunting music and moving performances it goes beyond the obvious horror of war in several respects: soldiers play their roles and reveal their characters in how they come to grip with what is expected of them...but we also become aware of their inner selves, something that cannot be inferred simply from outward behavior; the suffering of the Japanese soldiers is considered as well as that of American soldiers...though certainly not in as much depth; the pointlessness of war as a human activity.Perhaps the harmony of non-human nature and low tech societies are romanticized excessively, but I can't say I minded. I just wish it received more attention when it came out."},{"rating":"1","title":"not the greatest","review":"This movie has great locations to watch.

Although I was not in the European Theater, I fought in the Pacific, Thin Red Line does not come close to Saving Private Ryan in any aspect of war. Losing many friends on the field and dealing with war itself is something I cannot describe. Watching Private Ryan is as close as you can get to REAL combat. The thin red line is a good movie that takes war in a different perspective, but please do not compare it to a great movie like Saving Private Ryan."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than Private Ryan","review":"I love both and watch both over and over - but for me at least TRL is the winner. The Hans Zimmer touch is probably a piece of the difference - but greater subtlety is a simple way of describing the other difference.The characters have more depth - particularly more flaws - and the contrasts in characters are greater.This being said - I'll certainly say that everyone I know feels the opposite - that Ryan is the better and the TRL is boring.

The movie is extremely boring if you just want to see hardcore action the whole time for 3 hours go ahead and buy but if you want more of a storyline go for something like enemy at the gates or apocalypse now or hamburger hill. At first its a little entertaining but after an hour of it u start to get hungry and start wondering if theres anything on tv to watch.I think the movie was made for more the actors pleasure then the audiences.After the review of the movie i usually give a synopsis of the storyline but there really isnt one what you see is what you get.If you would like to know a little more about me check out my site on amazon.

Please do our vets a favor and research the truth about Guadalcanal and the heroic job they did against the odds. I think anyone who believes the Imperial Army was victimized by the warmongering Americans really should read \\"Rape of Nanking\\" or at least talk to the men that actually fought the battles. Bottom line, war is a horrible waste of human life, but so is twisting history. PS, this movie drags out waaaaay too long. Thank you for your time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing but antiwar propaganda","review":"Know a hardcore anti-war nut? This movie is for them. Thin Red Line is definitely not a movie that honors men like my neighbor who lied about his age to join the military in WWII. It tries the disguise of being artsy in order to brand the men who fought for our freedoms as cowards and psychopaths. This movie was a waste of my time, a waste of my money, and a waste of resources. I should have known what the result of movie would be, considering the cast. So, to the director, quit having your actors emote so much. To the writer, please visit with those who serve.

This makes a mockery of many reviewers' claim that TRL is only appreciated by a small, intellectually superior minority. And by the twisted reasoning of these same people, who hold that a popular movie must be a bad movie, then TRL must indeed be pretty bad. And if it's true that the majority opinion about many films is often initially misguided, only to be changed and revised over subsequent years, then the passage of time will see The Thin Red Line recognized for the pretentious drivel that it is."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dune, done to WWII","review":"This movie was a sincere disappointment.

They are to watch this unending cinematic dreck and then invent a glowing report of it.This is good practice for most professional critics as well.

I couldn't wait for this slow paced movie to end! A weak storyline and none existent plot further plagued this attempt to personalize war. The overacting of Nolte and barely noticeable Penn do nothing to overcome the poor directing. I still can't grasp why some people give Penn so much credit for this and other performances. His acting skills are simplistic and unbelievable, unless the part includes a drunk or drug addict.My advice is to skip this movie and choose one of several better alternatives."},{"rating":"1","title":"WASTE OF TIME","review":"JK REED IS DEFINITELY WRONG ON THIS ONE. THIS MOVIE IS A WASTE OF TIME, AS WELL AS A WASTE OF TALENT. MOST OF THE PEOPLE I'VE TALKED TO WHO'VE ACTUALLY EXPERIENCED WAR TELL ME THAT THIS MOVIE DOES NOT DO IT JUSTICE. CONTRARY TO POPULAR BELIEF, THIS MOVIE HAS NO ARTISTIC MERIT WHATSOEVER."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sorry, Too Much Meandering","review":"I was in the mood for a war movie and rented this one mainly because Sean Penn and Nick Nolte are in it. To that effect, Nick Nolte provides the most interesting thing in this movie. I don't consider myself to have too short of an attention span but I definitely found my attention wondering way too many times during this movie; not a good sign. I like a fresh approach to a genre such as Stanley Kubrick's \\"Full Metal Jacket\\". But that was a compelling movie that can be watched several times, unlike this film which I would not recomend to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Malick gets lost in his own artistic skills.","review":"I cannot deny that Terrance Malik is a master with the camera. The visual imagery in The Thin Red Line is remarkable, but as I watched this movie I had the sense that Malik was just being overtly self-indulgant. I have a feeling that if the studio would have let him, Malik would have added another three hours to a film I frankly stopped caring about after 20 minutes.What is the story of war if it isn't about the individuals who fight it? Malik tries to tell some deeply emotional stories, but in the end I didn't care about what happened to any of the characters because I lost any interest in them during Malik's mushy and unmoving narrative.I don't mind films with unconventional methods of storytelling, but in the end, The Thin Red Line played like a three hour Haiku. I think I understood what Malik was trying to do, I just think he failed miserably at it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Psychodramic Babble!","review":"This was the most bizarre and boring movie I've ever seen. My wife was clinically dead halfway through this movie about philosophical World War Two grunts in the South Pacific. I've never heard so much psychobabble in my life. Through the entire movie these soldiers rambled on about everything from killing the enemy to cheating wives. I was expecting a therapist to jump out of the jungle and help these tortured souls.I have read some of the reviews and people loved it or hated it. Well I understood the story, got the point, and I thought it was a terrible movie. Weak plot, no character development, and the story moved at a tank-like pace. I hope Mr. Malick takes another 20 year coffee break."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hint: Not a War Film? This Isn't a Film at All","review":"Ever since it's release I've been amazed at the critical reception and nods at the Academy Awards show. Best movie? Best Director?After watching it, you realize, if you were trying to get a WWII film fix, you sure as hell weren't going to get it here.It fails, even as an \\"anti-war\\" film. This film is so aimless, fractured and droning it's hard to pull any redeeming qualities out of it at all. What small qualities it does show are so short and few they're hard to spot.After the constant drooling by so many actors and film buffs of the return of Terrence Malick to directing, you'd think he'd pull a much more coherent, approachable movie out of his butt to make his debut. He's obviously way too self important for that.In the end, it looks as if the studio took all the money they saved from the stars' paycuts to be in the movie and used it to grease the palms of the Academy.If I could give it a negative star rating, I would."},{"rating":"2","title":"The perfect war movie - so much better than SPR","review":"This movie was head and shoulders above Saving Private Ryan. Where SPR takes safe roads, The Thin Red Line shows art; where SPR resorts to an \\"A-Team\\" like ending, The Thin Red Line keeps you on your toes. I could go on and on about this movie, but let me tell you, even my 13 year old son thought this was far better than SPR."},{"rating":"2","title":"Haunted","review":"The first time I saw this movie I was dissapointed having just been private Ryanized. But something about this film stayed with me. When it came out on video I was able to watch it.......over and over and over again. This is not a run of the mill war story. Every time I watched I found a new dimension. Now without getting to deep, the action and battle scenes were second to none. But they were presented beautifully, the first two soldiers get shot, and the sun changes the landscape right before your eyes. When we overran the Japanese base the emotions and images I felt and saw were haunting. The relationship of man and nature is never far from the main story line.It also has a very interesting soundtrack. If you choose to view this movie, you'll need to see it several times to get it. I think I did."},{"rating":"1","title":"Most of it was boring","review":"This movie had some very good battle scenes in the middle, but the beginning and the end were almost unbearably dull. The viewer is forced to sit around and listen to the pseudo-philosophical monologue of some Southern soldier who was AWOL. After seeing Saving Private Ryan, this movie was a big let-down. I wanted to leave the theater thirty minutes before it ended."},{"rating":"2","title":"The finest contemporary war film","review":"The Thin Red Line is a brilliant movie. I am angry at those viewers who penalize us (who enjoyed it), by assuming that our reason is because of the director. The Thin Red Line is unconventional, yes. That is how it's meant to be. It is intricately and intelligently designed to be like this, like a trail of stones strikingly etched on the ground for you to see. The Thin Red Line is extremely poetic and haunting, unforgettable, and the finest contemporary war film. What makes a movie good? To be striking, to be EFFECTIVE. This movie does more than that, and ranks among the finest movies of all time."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best movies I've ever seen!","review":"This movie is just as much about questions as answers...but as in life, the beauty is in the journey.

Regardless, The Thin Red Line is a haunting, achingly-beautiful _masterpiece_, firmly establishing Terrence Malick in the pantheon of legendary directors."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great flick, just a tad bit too long","review":"This movie would be a perfect movie if it was about 40 minutes shorter. It gets a little bit too long-winded in the portrayal of the soldiers hitting the Japanese base in the jungle, and in the story about the soldier whose fiance ditches him while he's at war. If they'd just focused on Private Whitt a little more, I think it would be a perfect movie. To me, a perfect movie (five stars) is one that you a: never get bored while watching, and b: always find something new. This movie fails to achieve perfection due to part a."},{"rating":"2","title":"A unique war movie masterpiece","review":"This unconventional film about the multiple facets of war strikes gold. Based on the novel by J. Jones (from here to eternity) the film actually surpasses the book version in its almost poetic vision through the addition of a philosophical antiwar character. The acting is superb with an impressive performance by Nolte. The cinematography is excelent as well. In short this is a movie not to be missed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best war film of all time.","review":"Don't allow the length of this movie to prevent you from experiencing the most gripping and emotional war film ever. Terrence Malick has not hidden behind a contrived plot, but rather tackled the real issues associated with war - what makes us kill each other, how can we be capable of such horror and what pushes us over the thin red line? Discover the true power of cinema."},{"rating":"1","title":"Heavy going .......","review":"Don't go into this movie expecting another Saving Pvt Ryan ..... the two are worlds apart..... This movie is more of an attempt to get inside the soldiers heads as they invade and fight their way across Guatal Canal (sp).. I found myself squirming a lot during this movie ..... it's a good idea but - the movie seems to labour the point a lot. In some ways the movie reminded me of Kubrick's Full Metal Jacket, i.e. the complete mania of war.... Other times, I felt I was watching Hamburger Hill or The Green Berets..... Nick Nolte does a great job of the Company Commander on his own private crusade..... Sean Penn is kind of a wishy washy character but he delivers a good performance.....My thoughts ? When you are absolutley out of options at the video store - check this one out. But, get lots of beer and pizza and take the phone off the hook..... your in for a long night."},{"rating":"2","title":"Finally.....an intellegent war film","review":"Anyone who did not like this movie should stick to Armaggedon and Independence Day.

The collection of vigneittes did not hold together, and the character's were archetypes. Some might call their narrations \\"deep\\" or \\"poetry\\" but it is really shallow BS.And FYI, juxtaposing images of war and nature is not new, original, or any of the other adjectives used to describe the film. It is cliche and hackneyed.Another reviewer compared this movie to Apocolypse Now and 2001, two of my favorite films. This film is far from those two masterpieces. It is just Malick spitting out some \\"art\\" and people being spoonfed it and exiting thinking they are all smart because they got the message: WAR IS BAD."},{"rating":"1","title":"This gets two, instead of 1, ONLY because I'm a WWII buff","review":"When I sat down to watch this film I thought I was really about to see something great. As it turned out, however, I sat through a 3 hour talk-a-thon. I can respect the opinions of those that think it was a smart cinematic move to listen to the soldier's stories, but I can only handle it in moderation. I don't really care if some private's wife leaves him for an Air Force pilot...I really don't. There were so many thought-reading segments I thought I was going to puke. Compare the beginning of TRL to Private Ryan. In one, a couple of AWOLers are caught mingling with Aborigines - wow, exciting. In the other, assault troops are getting shredded to pieces on the Normandy beaches. Not that I'm some neo-Nazi who enjoys watching Americans get killed, but at least it didn't put me to sleep.

At 45 minutes I had to let it go. I rented it for $4.99 at Blockbuster. I could have bought some of those \\"sea monkeys\\" you see advertised in comic books with that money and got better entertainment. Remember when Sean Penn \\"stormed the beaches\\" of New Orleans with a shotgun after Katrina? THAT was more entertaining than this movie! This movie isn't about the meaninglessness of war so much as the meaninglessness of Hollywood preaching about it. Hollywood! Land of our nation's morals! Yeah, right. Save your money on this one. Better you should invest in 8-track cassettes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good idea, horrible undertaking.","review":"Watch this movie for the sound, picture, etc, but not the plot. There is no plot, just unsatisfying glipses into the minds of soldiers. True, it is an interesting attempt, but in the way it is executed the entertainment fails misersably."},{"rating":"1","title":"War movie or National Geographic Special?","review":"One of the biggest movie dissapointments I have ever seen. Long, boring and stupid. Whats with all the alligators, natives, animals, bugs, etc? When I see a war movie I want some blood and guts. This stuff bored me into slumber. Especially disapointing since so many great actors are in the movie with a great director.I hate the voice over narration. Get Saving Private Ryan instead. This film has no likeable characters whatsoever. I am amazed so many critics like it. This reminds me of a boring National Geographic special with all the wildlife scenes. Also hate the flashback scenes. Avoid at all costs. Also way,way way too long"},{"rating":"1","title":"Is It Done Yet?","review":"Sorry - I grant everyone scads of talent all around: it takes EXCEPTIONAL talent to turn such naturally exciting and interesting material into such a soporific wet noodle. But this movie is a huge snooze. First comes storytelling and THEN you can get artsy all over the place, OK? There are better war films... but not a huge number of worse ones. This is one of those DVD's where you keep checking the \\"time remaining\\" to see how much longer this can go on. Trust me, it'll seem longer than the clock indicates."},{"rating":"1","title":"Editor's Day Off?","review":"I guess Terrence Malik really has been away a long time. Maybe he didn't realize how many great actors he had assembled. Nolte would have had some academy award hardware coming his way had this dog not limped along for nearly 3 hours, when 2 hours, or 90 minutes should have done the trick. Malik could have taken a lesson from Curtis Hanson's work on LA Confidential. His guys took a novel and whittled it down to a movie screenplay that was manageable; while at the same time exploiting the talents of every actor hired. With 30 minutes left in \\"Thin Red Line\\" I was warming up the car ready to return it to the rental shop. It didn't have to be that way. It was fragmented. Too many stories going on at once. You just can't bring out the esoteric inner brainworkings of 20 characters in one movie the way you can in a novel. If I was Clooney, Harrelson, and a few others, I'm angry for ever getting involved."},{"rating":"1","title":"STAY AWAY FROM THIS MOVIE !","review":"This movie is horrible and extremely boring. I reccomend this film for only the die-hard of fans. It was sad to even watch this horrible film. I love war movies and find this movie as an insult. Nothing compares this movie to war greats such as PLATOON and SAVING PRIVATE RYAN. In my opinion the only thing thid video would be good for is to be used as a coaster."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rather crude filmmaking despite the beautiful images.","review":"What could be more obvious, when your subject is the ugliness and futility of war, than to alternate hideous battle scenes with beautiful images, i.e. breathtaking shots of nature and somebody's lovely wife on a swing back home?And what's a more obvious and contrived way to convey the psychological trauma experienced by soldiers than to have them recite protracted, cliche-ridden, pseudo-poetic monologues at the drop of a hat?And people find this film deep and profound? The only thing I get from it is that Terence Mallick is trying really hard to be great.This movie may be visually breathtaking, but it doesn't change the fact that it's an artistic failure."},{"rating":"1","title":"And this was nominated for seven academy awards?????","review":"Do yourself a favor and save three hours of your time for something better, like walking aimlessly into a wall. I wouldn't have thought it would be possible to make a 'touchy-feely' war movie, but this is it.Almost every man from high command on down is portrayed as being mired in self doubt and looking for direction, not to mention scared, to the point of going off to hide under a large conch and babbling incoherently. Hey, you're soldiers stopping foreign aggression before it ends up at your doorstep, it's been done before, and with conviction and honor by our WWII veterans. I wonder how many days director Terrence Malick has spent in a foxhole to be such an expert on what combat soldiers go through? John Toll deserves praise for excellent cinematography, hence the stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"HORRIBLE FILM!","review":"\\"The Thin Red Line\\" fails at everything except battle scenes, the only reason I gave it a second star! There were too many stories, and the stories were acted and directed like a horrible High School play! A boring piece of cinema! Skip this garboage, and watch superb war films like \\"Saving Private Ryan\\" and \\"Gods and Generals!\\" Grade: D-"},{"rating":"1","title":"Doomed to fail","review":"Many people have already compared this to Saving Private Ryan, so I won't bother with that. What I think is a more interesting comparison is the film of TTRL vs. the novel. To put it succinctly, the novel is amazing. I think everyone should know by now that when you try to transform an amazing novel into a movie it will always be lacking. As others have stated, they should have given this movie a different title, because it is not, and could never hope to be, The Thin Red Line."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your time!","review":"This movie was so bad I turned it off halfway thru. It's not worth the time or effort of even renting this flick.

It was hard to tell the characters apart and even more difficult to identify with any of them. Don't bother with this new version but check out the old original which is really an excellent old WWII genre flick. I saw the original in the theater as a kid and thought it was really cool because it focused on the gi that stole the 45 side arm and how he went beserk. Also, a better and more interesting WWII film is Hong Kong 1941 by John Woo with superstar Chow Yun Fat. This is an excellent action movie with a dynamite plot and sensational acting."},{"rating":"1","title":"One star from a mouth breather","review":"I could only give this a one star rating. I was hoping to find a war movie (surprise surprise) Gomer Pyle USMC was more warlike than this philosophical lovefest. It is true that there is a place for both genres in this world, but those that enjoy war movies are not going to enjoy this type of movie. I can sit down and enjoy a 3 hour movie that kills a couple of people (with boredom), but I don't want my war movies like that. I don't want my westerns like that, I don't want my action adventure movies like that. If Terrence wants to take off 20 more years to recover, be my guest. Keep you long winded opinions to yourself."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful Awful Awful","review":"This is probably the worst war related movie I've ever seen. I am particularly incensed by several actors who are featured as being in the film are present for as little as a single minute or two.

This is not one of them. A total waste of time and money."},{"rating":"1","title":"one of the worst war films ever","review":"This movie was a mess. The director was trying to copy other great movies and ended up with a brokenplot that lurched from scene to scene. Very boring.

Spend millions turning a $10 scriptinto a movie and you end up with this crap."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst movie ever","review":"I can't believe I actually sat through the entire movie. I kept waiting for the good part. The trailer talked about all the big stars that were in it. Most of the \\"big names\\" had only cameo roles that lasted no more that three minutes. I don't understand why this movie received all the awards, etc. that it did. I would never recommend it to anyone..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible.","review":"I wish I could've given this movie zero stars.This was the worst movie about war EVER! Just boring boring boring. I've seen some Simpsons episodes that give a more actual portrayal of combat. If you want a war movie, rent or buy Saving Private Ryan or Platoon.Don't get me wrong. I'm not just an action addict, I like intriguing dialogue and good photography, but when these things failed to get you into the movie, you had to rely on the action scenes, which were just plain bad.Don't waste your time with this piece of drivel."},{"rating":"1","title":"You'll love it","review":"If you happen to be a pseudo-intellectual. Ignore the comments about \\"getting\\" it, there's nothing to \\"get\\". Any attempt at a thought provoking scene is usually thrown in where it isn't wanted, and the same images are thrown at you at least 12 times each throughout the film's 400 hours. Like that flashback to the guy's wife? Like it the 2nd, 3rd, 4th, 5th, and 6th times? And the historical inaccuracies are truly annoying. So unless you get some sort of twisted thrill in bragging that you've seen the nonexistant \\"deeper meaning\\" of a hackneyed film, avoid this piece of crud like the plague."},{"rating":"1","title":"I would give it zero stars if I could.","review":"Anyone who has been in the military will look at this movie as a slanderous piece of garbage. Aside from the inaccurate technical aspects of the movie, it portrays the soldiers as a bunch of quaking cowards. The great majority of our soldiers were/are highly trained professionals who understand the risks of combat and will zealously carry out their missions with little or no whining and sniveling. Obviously this movie was made and hyped by the Hollywood bleeding liberal crowd."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible...","review":"I'm a fan of good WWII movies and this is the worst one I've seen yet. It's like what you'd get if you had someone who's anti-war and who's directed Calvin Klein ads for 20 years make a war movie.For the first twenty minutes I thought it was a movie about Vietnam! It doesn't look like WWII at all. The voiceovers were meant to sound deep but came across as funny instead. Terrence's obsessions with nature and symbolism are quite evident. At nearly three hours, it's two hours too long if you ask me.If I could give it 0 stars I would."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fast Forward","review":"Great cast, terribly misused in this 3 hour plus experiment in torture. After watching this through ff scan most of the time, I developed a newfound appreciation for Saving Private Ryan. That's the war film to watch. Even if it's not as great as they say, it's still better than this pretentious drivel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ponderous mess","review":"This film doesn't know that it is a war film; it thinks that it is nature documentary. We get long lingering, loving scenes of natives at frolic, owls, insects, bats, trees, parrots, etc. The human characters, when they appear, are most often engaged in psycho-babble musing accompanied by the heartfelt drone of melancholy strings. The effect is one of an ethereal travelog. Egads what a mess!The director tries his best to re-create \\"Apocalypse Now\\", but he forgets a few minor cinematic elements: Character development; Plot; Continuity of action;Style above all in this boring, confused, over-long mess. I will avoid any work by Terrence Malik in the future."},{"rating":"1","title":"Still don't know if WAR is HELL?!?!?","review":"If you're a veteran, like me, you will hate this movie. If your a self-defined intellectual, who believes you can figure out the very nature of mankind, no matter what time period he is from, or where he was raised, this is for you. If you really want to know what went through a soldier's mind during WWII, ask a WWII vet, before they have all passed on and you have to learn our history through Hollywood's eyes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good movie-if it had been 30 minutes long","review":"About an hour of fluff and fill and 30 minutes of the WW2 action that was advertised."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst War Movie Ever","review":"This movie is just a waste of time and money. It has nothing to do with the book, and plenty of good talents are wasted. Complete lack of everything, and you'll find yourself falling asleep multiple times. Do yourself a favour, and pick up a copy of the original film, or the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"VERY DISAPPOINTING. Do Not Waste Your Money.","review":"As mentioned, this movie has great cinematography and visual sequences, but the plot and focus of the movie is bewildering.

You will most likely change your mind after that."},{"rating":"1","title":"very disappointing","review":"I rented this movie, but was thoroughly disappointed at it's blasse, War is hell message that everyone has tried to do in the past 70 years. I am truly stunned at those who found profound meaning to this long, dull movie. It crossed the line and wasted my time. Those who found meaning here were either starved for something to do, or simply creating something in their minds that certainly didn't exist on screen. Bad movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"A stinker!","review":"This movie is the most overrated of the decade. Skip it and see Platoon instead. It tells the same story in a much more linear and compelling fashion."},{"rating":"1","title":"This movie did not live up to its hype!","review":"This movie was a great disappointment, especially after watching \\"Saving Private Ryan.\\" The movie starts off really slow and at times doesn't even make sense. It focused too much on the plight of the soldiers and had one too many flashbacks. I deeply respect the bravery and service that these young men went through for our country but this movie did not do them justice. Too long and too boring for my taste."},{"rating":"1","title":"Absolutely horrible","review":"This may very well be the worst movie I have ever seen. I would like to meet the individuals who liked this movie, because I have not encountered anybody who enjoyed it.

Not even close. I had trouble staying awake and relating to the characters."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Waste of Money Ever!","review":"I highly anticipated the release of this movie. I went expecting a different approach from Saving Private Ryan. I should preface this with a reader's knowledge that I love independent films, art films, and film noir. I feel that the movie overindulges in voiceovers and insults the viewer's intelligence by not allowing us to draw our own conclusions. The cinematography is excellent but wasted by the constant drone of narration. I understand the multiple images of man's invasion not only of a Japanese island, but also of nature itself - I did not need it rammed down my throat. I, and many audience members, applauded when the guy's wife left him. It is incomplete, and probably intentional. I understand that the movie is supposed to be loose, and stream of conscious (as the book) - however this movie never found a pulse or a semblence of life to me. I hope Malick remains in seclusion this time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Quality Product - Decent Film","review":"The film came is quality packaging and looked as if it was manufactured the day before.Quality product.The film itself it mediocre as best. Many inaccurate portrayls of war. Also very slow paced. Do not expect a 'Saving Private Ryan'.I will say the cast is excellent, and it is entertaining to see so many A list actors in once film, also be prepared for some cameo's from other big actors.For the price - I paid 5$, it's well worth it.Thanks for reading."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too bad there aren't negative ratings","review":"This is the biggest waste of film stock (and a LOT of it) ever. While Saving Private Ryan is probably the best war film ever, this is without a doubt a contender for the worst.Suffering from incredibly poor direction from an overrated buffoon, this film fails on technical, as well as artistic levels. It probably has at least 20 minutes of closeups of leaves, and suffers from an all-star cast without a decent script (no fault of the original author) and a director that has less talent than he believes. All in all, a waste."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too much taaaaaaaaaaalking","review":"This mostly-(over)praised movie is typical of the new (American?) tendency to kill and agonize at the same time. Though this may be the politically correct thing to do, it sure makes for a dull war flick.Although long, it seems endless, and many a times did I find myself glancing (and more) at the newspaper during the showing.The director should definitively have adhered to the eternal dictum heard in Sergio Leone's \\"The Good, the Bad and the Ugly\\" - IF YOU WANNA SHOOT, SHOOT, DON'T TALK!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I have a 350 IQ","review":"Yes, I'm smarter than Marylin Vos Savant. Yet I was STILL bored by this movie. A reviewer below from Canada droned on about how he understands why people wouldn't like this movie, it's only for intellectuals who can truly appreciate poetry and beauty. Please. Yeah I know war contrasted with the beauty of nature blah blah. I admit, some of the cinematography was stunning, and the acting was exceptional. But I felt as if all this beauty and poetry was shoved down my throat, especially by the pointless narration. Maybe Malik's view of modern day movie goers is low with all the dumbed down action flicks they seem to enjoy and he felt he had to spell out the premise for people to \\"get it\\". If so, his movie suffered because of it. It was boring, to me anyway. So, I wouldn't insult anyones intelligence who liked this movie, nor would I for people who hated it. I \\"got it\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"this is so stupid.","review":"this is too long and boring and just wasting time. I'm sorry I bought and watched.

Good cast of characters, ashame that the majority of them only appear for a few minutes, through out the whole movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too many stars,Too little acting","review":"After viewing \\"SAVING PRIVATE RYAN\\" and then veiwing this film, it made me wonder Why? Why did I spend my hard earned money on a movie that I could have slept through. The films' only redeeming quality is that there were a lot of stars, although they did not seem well connected. One of the reasons I go to a film is to see something with at least a little entertaining content. This film left me wanting to slit my wrists in depresion and the realization that I just spent 10 bucks and 2 hours that could have been better spent washing my car. In my opinion this is a definate pass!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A terrible movie","review":"Up until the time I saw The Thin Red Line, I thought White Hunter Black Heart was the worst movie I had even seen. This one, however, will be remembered as a great all time \\"stinkers\\" list. It is a shame too. There was so much talent in it. Bad script, bad story line, bad everything. I believe I'll send a complementary copy to my ex-wife, and her attorney."},{"rating":"1","title":"Avoid","review":"This movie is the worst ever! I tried to go to sleep when I was in the theatre watching it. Do not buy it! I highly recommended AGAINST it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Sleeper","review":"This movie is NOTHING like Private Ryan. The action seens are mundane and boring. The lush sceneary and the showing of the native tribe is completely irrelevant to the story line. It will put you to sleep and I don't reccommend it at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Best 30 minute film I ever watched for three hours","review":"This film contains 30 minutes of entertainment trapped in three hours of confusing voice over, aimless photography, and almost incomprehensible pointless story line. It is probably the worst war movie ever made and may be in the top ten worst ever movies. Anybody contemplating purchasing this film should consider spending three hours clipping their toenails or perhaps arranging their paperclip collection. Both would be more entertaining."},{"rating":"1","title":"The big red snoozer!","review":"This movie is very long, very slow moving, very boring! It seems like the producer was more worried about making his point about how bad war is than making a good movie. The Japanese soldiers surrender at the first hint of danger (I THINK NOT)!Another bother about the film is that there are so many big stars with such tiny roles (such as George Clooney-he has a whole two minute scene in this three hour film!). They were probably just thrown in to help it sell. It was a real chore for me to finish the entire movie (I fell asleep TWICE). Buyer beware."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't care for subliminal messages","review":"Maybe I read too much into the movie, and I've only seen it once, but I didn't like the projected implication that the American's were being in any which way 'evil' for attacking the Japanese. Throughout the movie, they talk about how what we were doing was wrong and how war is wrong. As a soldier in the US Army, I hate war but I must say that this was one war America fought that we should have been fighting. The aggresion we faced needed to be oppressed and stopped before it reached our soils. Granted, our military is now a totally volunteer military, but I seriously doubt that even during WWII there were officers as inept as those shown in the movie. They portrayed the officers as being fearful leaders who would send their men off to their death without a thought. I found that highly offensive to the US military of today and days gone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Soap Opera Dramatics","review":"If you are more philosophical by nature you will certainly enjoy this movie. But if your traits lean towards the analytical side, be advised, skip this movie.Militarly, this movie is so full of holes it distracted me from the supposed real message of the film.I was more involved with the mistakes made than with the struggle of man,war and nature.(Which in most war movies I always felt that it was implied that war created fear and anxieties).In reflection, I could see where this movie could stir a lot of emotion, but I get enough human drama in every day life that I don't want to watch it for entertainment."},{"rating":"2","title":"The most memorable movie made to date","review":"I've read many of the positive and negative comments about this movie and have wondered what makes me think this is the best picture ever made. I've seen the movie a few times. It appeals to my senses. I don't think its a matter of level of intelligence whether you \\"get\\" this movie or not like some have suggested. I do think though that those who love it have a spirit, a deeper soul. Those who love it probably also like mellower music rather than heavy metal or hard rock. I would suggest to those who did not like the movie to watch it again in five years, you may be at a different point in your life than you are now and you will appreciate this movie for the masterpiece that is is."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best","review":"I am amazed that people are trashing this film. It is completely obvious that anyone who rates it with one star is just blaming the movie for their own incompetence and frustration. Just because it went way over your head doesn't mean it is a bad film. I will watch this with my children some day and hope that they too can question the nature of humanity as well as all living creatures who inhabit the Earth. I have thought about its message for days and I wish that more people in this country would use their minds instead of acting like brainless meatheads."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing - Too much fluff and retrospection.","review":"I was very disappointed in this film. I expected something akin to Saving Private Ryan and got \\"I'm a broken-hearted deserter with a flawed conscience\\". Too much emphasis on the \\"kinder, gentler side of combat soldiers\\" versus the real courage, anguish, and horror of war. Too sensitive to classify as a war movie and not enough focus on real soldiers. From my experienced point view, the combat scenes were overplayed, unrealistic, and totally overshadowed by Hollywood's poor attempt at collective left-wing conscience. Regret I spend the money to see it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst WWII movie EVER!","review":"If you rewrote history and had all the marines sent to the Pacific as melancholy grad student poets and cynical narcissists, MAYBE you'd have this movie. It is beyond silly, it's truly insulting to the soldiers who gave everything for our freedom. Granted all soldiers go through their dark nights of the soul, and war sucks- but this movie is like a bad joke. Someone read the Cliffs notes of this battle and then made up everything else based on their own fantasy."},{"rating":"1","title":"A BUNCH OF RICH ACTORS PLAYING WAR!!!","review":"This was so horrible. I thought it might be mildly interesting, but I was so far from the truth."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Waste your time with this movie!","review":"This is one of the most boring, slow, piece of gibberish I have ever seen. I was hoping that it had just 1/10th of the greatness that Saving Private Ryan had. It wasn't even that close. I cannot imagine a more boring movie to watch, EVER! Watch Saving Private Ryan, or Platoon, Even the old series Combat is more interesting and realistic that this garbage!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The worst war movie ever made","review":"Is it really the worst war movie ever made? Maybe not, but I felt like a balance had to be struck with all those who say it's the best ever. It does, however, represent the biggest waste of talent ever, from the actors to the camera work to the score. Nobody is given a chance to suceed, due to the stupifying writing and what has to be the worst editing in movie history. For God's sake, how can you spend five minutes building up to a battle (the creekbed scene near the end)and then just cut to 'after the battle'? I did hear Mallick's first cut came to around seven hours, so what can one expect with 70% of the film chopped away, apparently with a weedeater. This may be fine for photography students, but for anyone wanting a film that tells a story, look elsewhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst ever!!","review":"This is the only movie that I have ever got up and left the theater before it was over for. BORING BORING BORING....supposed to be about Guadalcanal during WW2 but most of the time it seems like the writer wanted to make a Vietnam film. This portrays the Americans as the aggressors and the poor Japanese as victims. The real problem with this film is the never ending flashback scenes...i cant even fully describe how much I hated this movie. Dont waste your money or your time on it!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Quite possibly the greatest movie I have ever seen","review":"I am tall, dark-headed and from Kentucky, needless to say, I closely identified with the Idealist Witt. Malick was masterful in this movie and it is a shame that too few people appreciate a movie which directly addresses some of life's less glamorous tones. It only took one seeing of this movie for me to determine that it was my favorite movie of all time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful film","review":"This is war, not seen through the eyes of some macho Rambo-type goon, nor even through the eyes of simple, naive, young men. This is war through the eyes of a contemplative, someone who is just a bit more sensitive and introspective than most. It is beautifully filmed, and the contrast between the beauty of the environment and the extreme violence of the war is harrowing. There is a definitive scene about half-way through where a young soldier, pinned down by gun fire, touches a small plant in front of him....the leaves of the plant close in reaction...but this is heartbreaking...innocence and beauty and subtlety juxtaposed against violence, hatred, and high caliber machine-guns. This is both a great war and anti-war movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"an extras perspective","review":"having had the oppurtunity to work on this masterpiece i can only say that terrence malick and john toll are both geniuses.to work with them was both a pleasure and honour.i have worked with both good and bad directors including john frankenheimer,bruce beresford,peter jackson,john woo and others and can only sat that terrence is amazing. as for the film itself i think that you can only make up your own mind.you either love it or hate it depending on your preferences but for all those who hate it all i can say is go back to your mass produced american crap.this might be an arty farty movie but it is among the best.how it did not win best cinematography and best soundtrack(losing both to SPR) just shows the mentality of the academy and how you have to spend money and suck up to people to win oscars.anyway it won most of the awards that matter.i just hope that terrence malick does another movie soom and that i have the priviledge of working with such a visionary director again."},{"rating":"1","title":"national geographic meets new age gospel","review":"I like movies that make you think.I like to be intellectually stimulated.

I felt the inner thoughts of the characters in The Thin Red Line were choppy, over acted, and down right boring. My grandfather and his brother, both of whom were WWII vets felt the movie was an absolute joke. Overall, I thought much the same. The only thing that saved the movie from being a total bust was the overall madness the movie presented. The confusing thoughts of the soldiers, the slow fustrating battle scenes, all of these gave the viewer the closest thing one could possibly get to of fighting in the Pacific in WWII. Saving Private Ryan is the best movie I have ever seen. Compairing it to the Thin Red Line is useless. No contest. The Thin Red Line, in my mind, joins Hamburger Hill in the over hyped, just another war movie barrel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Over-Rated","review":"The beginning of this movie started off slow, with seemingly no point, then the characters finally started to interact and the action started, then the movie dropped off from there. The Thin Red Line could have accomplished everything in less than an hour instead of going on for almost three hours. No true plot, no flow, very little character interaction, showed little of the true horrors and fears of war, and did not deserve an academy award nomination. Many other war films made did a better job of showing the horror of war."},{"rating":"1","title":"Brilliant Cinematography and little else","review":"I can only assume that this movie received Oscar recognition because of its beautiful cinematography. The scenery was spectacular and I appreciated the inclusion of exotic South Pacific wildlife in this movie.My problem with this movie was that the soldiers acted and behaved as though they were senselessly fighting the Vietcong in 1969 as opposed to the Japanese at the WWII Battle of Guadalcanal.I was in neither war, however what validates my belief that this movie was a joke (historically speaking) is that few if any WWII Vets came out to speak in favor of the film. Not to my recollection at least.I also disliked the cast. The only soldiers in the film that I found believable were the extras. The casting of Nick Nolte and John Travolta each as military officers was unbelievable to me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Proof of Art","review":"This production is that rare example of a motion picture as art...as poetry. It is beautiful, poignant and mystifying. Read as many of these reviews as possible and you'll get the idea. 1's or 5's. It is a shame this is being compared to Private Ryan which along with it's gruesome initial battle scene was much more a cliched cartoon meant to tug at your emotions (as all of SS's movies are). Thin Red Line says, \\"Think\\". I can see why people who like to be fed everything would hate this movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Time for a nap","review":"This was another film with an agenda. War is Hell? Gee! I didn't know that until I saw this film. The film was boring. To make certain that it was boring, the directory pulled out every contrived artsy trick in the book. It was not an entertaining movie. It was boring. The cast didn't have to act. They were fitted into the scenery; made out of boring cardboard. Or, huh? Were they bored also? This is a bad movie. It was not even anti-war. It was pro-nap."},{"rating":"1","title":"This was the worst movie I have seen in more than a year.","review":"I would not recommend this movie to my worst enemy. It was an almost incomprehensible storyline, with little or no action. I kept watching and hoping that it would eventually \\"pick up the pace\\". I love many of the stars, but I would recommend that they find new agents before accepting any more scripts in the future. This was a VERY poorly written film, and it definitely deserves \\"two thumbs down\\"!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful, simply awful","review":"Having never written a review, I feel compelled to add my \\"2 cents\\" after renting the TRL yesterday. It was collosally slow. Sure, it is a \\"deep\\" movie, but it is so confusing and disjointed that it looses all but the most attentive. This movie was a C grade director's attempt to be profound. Instead, it was slow. I must admit, I had to fast forward through the slow parts, and I actaully spent 45 minutes seeing the movie from start to end. I missed nothing of the plot, and the beautiful visuals looked good also on fastforward. Not a movie worth renting."},{"rating":"1","title":"the best movie ever made?","review":"The Thin red Line is the best evidence I have ever seen that foks looking fro meaning in ANYTHing can find meaning anywhere. The grand nature of this movie is that it is really a collage of random thoughts, and about 10 minutes of war scenes made to ride on the tail of Saving Private Ryan to attract an audience.This movie will never stand by itself, and absent the crowd that loved Saving Private Ryan and were duped into thinking this would be like it, it would have recieved snooring reviews on the opening weekend."},{"rating":"1","title":"very confusing","review":"I don't know about any of you people but I totally could not understand this movie.Even the beggining was confusing.

I think I was falling asleep within the first hour! If I had gone to see a travelogue of the South Pacific, I might have been happy, but I had gone to see a war movie. This was an \\"art house\\" film that got a big budget and some big name actors. A member of the audience summed it up best at the conclusion \\"thank #%$ it's finally over!\\"Fine.What really chapped me about this movie is that it was the Ross Perot of the 1998 Oscar race.

In my opinion, The Thin Red Line is the best novel in James Jones' trilogy of World War Two (\\"From Here to Eternity\\", \\"The Thin Red Line\\" and \\"Whistle\\"). Instead of being true to the spirit of the work by giving the viewer an honest, gritty portrayal of infantry combat on Guadalcanal, Terrence Malick chose to create some post-modern mess of an anti-war film. A shame, because Jones' work delivers an overwhelming anti-war message through simple, brutal honesty. There was no reason to cloud the story with cranky, cheap poetics. The masterful art of James Jones deserves a better effort than this. Indeed, the director would have done better to make up the story out of whole cloth instead of trashing a great novel. (I wouldn't be surprised to learn that Malick didn't read the book at all). I found the film false, empty and an insult to those of us who cherish the work of one of our nations most brilliant authors."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yawn","review":"I'll keep it short (unlike this movie): It was boring.

With VHS you can use it to hold open a window or as a door stop. With DVD you can use it as a frisbee or beer coaster. And that's before you even put it in the DVD or VHS player! The movie itself tries to come off as a high-brow socialite war drama. However, it is nothing but a sappy drama that has a very left-wing aura to it.

Why else would people be willing to throw perfectly good money away by paying to see this movie, if there wasn't an abundance of personal discretionary cash!. I liken Thin Red Line to a potent general anesthetic. On opening day, I actually heard someone snoring in the movie theatre, while a group of teens sitting next to me decided to do homework while watching this movie. On exiting, I heard a father tell his son that if he didn't clean his room, he would be forced to come back and watch this thing again. Cruel punishment no doubt.

The 1st time in the theather with 10 friends. Only one liked it. In my opinion this movie is a slap in the face of OUR American Vets who were there!! Penn was the only person in the movie I liked. He tryed to save it but gave up. So many historical mess ups that this 1000 words can't describe, like fresh fruit for the soldiers?? NOT, only officers got fresh fruit. The soldier ate out of cans, Surrendering Jap Soldiers. Not many surrendered anywhere. Surrender was not in their code. Americans did not hang out with the Natives,ect. My advice don't waste the time with this movie. As a WW 2 Reenactor I am talking to many Vets and this movie is nothing about them or what they did.

The plot is reminicent of an anti war viet nam movie, and is slow and redundent. We get the picture that war is hell, but I feel the mood of the era, and the attitudes of the men were completely off base. This was a just war, we were attacked and we had a real purpose, but that was never depicted. This is Liberal propaganda at it's finest. DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY.

Now if only the video would come down in price..."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Thin Red Line was a good depiction of war.","review":"This was a quality film. I enjoyed it from start to finish. However, The Thin Red Line was a little to artsy for my taste. I didn't really like all the flashbacks that the soldiers had of their life before the war. One example of this would be one soldiers wife swinging in slow motion on a swing. They kept showing this seen over and over. It was hard to tell who was having the flashback too, because a lot of the soldiers looked alike. This is the reason that I liked Saving Private Ryan better. It is kind of ironic that the plots of 1998's two war movies, Saving Private Ryan and The Thin Red Line were opposite. In Saving Private Ryan, a bunch of men were dying to save one, and in The Thin Red Line one man died to save the a bunch of men. I would recommend this movie for everyone that is old enough to see it."},{"rating":"1","title":"War is Hell...Again","review":"This just in: war is hell. This motif has been played out time and time again in films ranging from \\"Apocalypse Now\\" to \\"Saving Private Ryan\\" to \\"Full Metal Jacket.\\" Do we really need another one? Even if we do, why waste so much talent doing it? Many of the best actors here: Travolta, Cusack, and Clooney to name a few, were relegated to almost characterless roles that could have been filled by the far less skillful thesbian. This film dragged considerably and could have made its points in an hour's less time. On the good side, the cinematography was excellent, the natural environment beautifully filmed, and not ALL the talent was wasted."},{"rating":"1","title":"Crossing Over the 'Line'","review":"A prolonged war picture about the battle for Guadalcanal Island, \\"The Thin Red Line\\" hits and misses. Terrence Malick's direction is correlative to nobody else. Characters come and go. Sean Penn thinks he knows a lot about life and death (substantial). Jim Caviezel is one with nature (habitat boy). Nick Nolte is an irate sergeant with really needs to calm down (his veins are full of merit). Woody Harrelson loses his hind end (twinge!). Elias Koteas doesn't like the sergeant (not good). George Clooney, John Travolta and John Cusack make appearances (why?). There are plenty of shots to make any cinematographer jealous. Good acting, but three hours of almost nothing will leave you empty. If you are willing to see how long you can last before you fall asleep, try it out. If you feel like meditating, watch this. If you feel like torturing somebody, watch this.

Even big names like Travolta, Nolte, and Penn generate little interest. You'll fall asleep before you even catch a glimpse of Clooney.

Buy the movie if you want to feel good about how much you hate the military, but any other serious war film fans should stay away.

The combat doesnt look real either. The actors portraying Japanese soldiers act like a bunch of twelve year olds who have never seen a gun go off before. They throw their hands up at the first sign of an American soldier without putting up a fight (yeah right!). In addition to all that, the history is all messed up.

I could not for the life of me comprehend what the critics saw in this movie, nor what AMPAS members saw in it that qualified it to be nominated for best picture. This is what happens when ego gets in the way of creativity. Meandering storylines that peter off into nothingness, characters that are indistinguishable from one another, and no clear concept of where the story is going. All the big names in this movie were wasted, only useful for the drawing power of their names on the marquee. Terence Malick should stay gone for another 20 years as far as I'm concerned.

It was almost a reflection of the director's personal dysfunction and confusion. If you think about it, where, but in Hollywood, can someone get paid so much to spew such debris onto the screen. The eager minions of art see this dribble as culture and chew on the bone of stupidity in seeing this movie as art. It is simply a long boring movie trying to make money by luring the Saving Private Ryan crowd. Dont be fooled, it is a waste!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Half of the movie looks like Calvin Klein perfume commercial","review":"This movie is the worst war movie ever made... I never walked out of movie theater before but this movie almost made me. Half of the movie looks like early ninety's Calvin Klein perfume commercial.....in short, lots of style, NO SUBSTANCE. It is amazing to me that this movie received good reviews from film critics."},{"rating":"1","title":"I've seen better jello commercials!","review":"How in the name of anything intelligent could any viewer withhalf of a brain cell say this was a great movie? All it was meant todo was ride on the tail of Saving Private Ryan. Look at the way it was advertised- big name actors who made cameo appearances, designed to attract us to the theatre. Staggered release dates, extra long viewing time to get the concession stuff sold ( the best thing one could of done at this movie is get an extra big buttered popcorn). It flopped. Awful movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"BEAUTIFUL WAR","review":"Terrence Malick is a reclusive, picky film director. After directing BADLANDS and DAYS OF HEAVEN - two of the more remarkable movies of the 1970s -- he disappeared for twenty years. In 1998 he resurfaced with THE THIN RED LINE, an adaptation of James Jones's 1962 novel set during the battle for Guadalcanal.Equally loved and hated, this is much more than an epic war movie; it is also a deeply philosophical meditation on man, nature (God?) and violence.Beautifully photographed, the images reflect the surreal, often transcendent tone of the films deeper meaning. Hyper-real sensual images of the natural world abound - the world that surrounds and in effect embraces the pain of war.The fine cast features Sean Penn, Nick Nolte, James Caviezel and Woody Harrelson.And yes, the Blu-ray Criterion transfer is breathtaking."},{"rating":"2","title":"Magnificent","review":"There is little I can add to the praise given to this masterpiece, so I'll be short. This film , I believe, is one of the greatest motion pictures ever made, and it is safe to say it will never be surpassed. The story explores the thoughts and lives of American soldiers on Guadalcanal, an island over which the U.S. fought the Japanese during the Second World War. As previously stated, however, the war merely serves as a backdrop to the feelings and emotions of the men, whose stories and emotions are powerful and deep. Excellent cinematography as well as great acting add to make this beautiful movie one of the most memorable I ever saw. It is the type of film that , as the credits rolled in the movie theater, you remained in your seat still, trying to comprehend what you've just seen. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very poor war flick","review":"If we assume that this was a war flick, it was a pretty bad one. The combat scenes are unrealistic and the protagonists are wooden and unconvincing. If it had really been like this, the US would have lost the war.The worst thing about the movie is that it was boring. The second worst thing is that the acting was poor. The third worst thing is that the story was a bore. The fourth worst thing is that this was not really a war flick at all.The only reason I gave this one two stars instead of one is that I was able to watch it to completion. Mind, I had to try multiple times, but I finally did finish it. I guess because I'd already wasted my money. But the movie was a bore.Pass this one by. It does not deserve to live."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible War Movie","review":"This movie had no plot, no character developement, and barely any action. In Saving Private Ryan(I gave 5 stars) you are taken from one place to another knowing exactly what is going on. In The Thin Red Line nothing makes sense. You are taken from one scene to another without much explanation of what is going on. The acting was nothing special in this movie either. Half of the actors in the top credits barely have a 5 minute part. I wrote this because of a review I read about Saving Private Ryan. Some guy gave it one star and said that this movie was brilliant. I guess you have to decide for yourself."},{"rating":"1","title":"Second Worst Film I Ever Saw","review":"I had the misfortune of sitting through this one in the theater, and I am sad to have wasted those hours of my life.The acting was absolutely horrible. There was no reason to feel anything for any of the characters, so the melodramatic deaths that were meant to be tear-jerking and thought-provoking were either unintentionally funny or just plain boring.The films best quality is the copious amounts of beautiful cinematography, showing lush fields of grass. If you like grain, swaying in the wind of helicopters, and fertilized with dead soldiers, then you might get a few moments of enjoyent in the midst of several hours of excruciating boredom."},{"rating":"1","title":"thin red ass","review":"its easy to see why people dont like this film. It aint ya average war flick sure the battle scenes were far more realistic than windtalkers but at least in windtalkers there was never a boring moment. The film is basicaly 3hrs of spiritual crap its a war film nobody gives a sh*t about peace and spiritual hoha. Half the main characters pass by and you never really notice them and big stars like george clooney and john travolta have only a handful of lines. Pass film by and save your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money!","review":"This is why one doesn't listen to critics. They loved it because of its artistic features. The scenery was nice the rest plain boring. You got better combat action in the television show Combat! I would only recommend this movie to insomniacs with a high threshold for pain."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a waste of time!","review":"Few movies have left me feeling as if I had totally wasted my time and money. This is the ultimate crowning achievement of boring pseudeo-intellectual movies! In fact, I can see all the Dobie Gilles types counting their axillary hairs as an equally meaningful exercise in spending more than 3 hours. What an awful movie. It makes those who try to intellectualize it seem really bored and looking for meaning!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A Disappointing Film","review":"I had high hopes for this film with its inherently courageous material based upon the Guadalcanal campaign. However, the movie itself has a relentless boredom, much more like a Benneton commercial than a feature film. Malick, despite his Days of Heaven classic, lost touch with audiences and maybe even filmmaking over his 20 year absence. The art of conveying ideas and powerful visual metaphors within a story worked with David Lean. With Malick's work here, it's a whimsical, uncertain philosophical reference without meaning.Several actors like Jim Cavizel were good to watch but overall the movie meandered so much that, when it ended, I thought that they had left off a reel of film."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Thin Red Line","review":"This movie seems to be purposely confusing. It has good action sequences but each one is followed by at least half an hour of senseless nature shots and absurd voice overs. It seems never to end, and if it had been cut down to an hour and a half it would have been a very good war movie. My advice, skip all the non-battle scenes."},{"rating":"1","title":"MAJOR SNOOZER","review":"ONE OF THE THREE WORST MOVIES EVER MADE.

Actors appear and disappear while we're treated to shots of just about every living thing on the islands. Snakes, birds, lizards. When I see more flora and fauna than Japanese soldiers during a World War II movie, I know I'm in trouble.The flashbacks of the guy with his wife got about as tedious as BJ Hunnicut whining about \\"Peg and the kids\\" during the last jumped-the-shark seasons of MASH.The voice-over narrations got so numerous and ponderous that I lost track of which character was talking at one point. \\"Where did we lose the magic?\\" Ugh.This was a big disappointment after the previous summer's SAVING PRIVATE RYAN."},{"rating":"1","title":"easily the worst movie ever","review":"I expected a movie along the lines of private ryan but then in the pacific theater. If you expect that don't buy it.This is easily the worst movie I ever saw. The storyline jumps up and down and it is impossible to capture what he is trying to state. This all is mixed with a lot of mumbo jumbo supposed to be poetry.There is something good about the movie as well however. Awesome shots of nature and a very clear depiction of what men in combat go trough psychologically. Further there are nice examples of equipment used in WW2 including Japanese stuff.I guess this is a nice example of taking creativity to far.If the movie would have been a bit more down to earth it might have been a nice b movie.

I invited my grandma who is a big fan of war movies and I also invited my two cousins. After seing Saving Private Ryan, I was expecting a film alot like it or even better. When the film started I almost fell asleep in the theater. Through the whole movie, my cousin wispered to me \\"This movie S***S!\\" I just keeped my mouth shut continued watching it. The plot was very dull and boring. I was begging for the movie to be over. The only thing that cought my attention was the battles scenes. By the time the movie was over. It was a big dissapointment, what a disaster for 20th-Century Fox. My folks reaction was even worse than mine! They said it was a joke. This movie is like a cartoon compared to Saving Private Ryan. This movie is so bad it is not even worth renting it on video. I do not recommend this at all!"},{"rating":"1","title":"comprehensive summary of reviews","review":"Since the site won't access any of the reviews past the last 10 I'll do a summary of all previous reviews. Either people loved this movie and believe it's the greatest movie ever or people thought it was the boringest movie ever. The people who love it spend a lot of bytes insulting the people who don't. That's about it."},{"rating":"1","title":"I wasted 3 hours of my life","review":"First off, the cinematography was excellent and the cast was unsurpassed. Aside from several great sequences in the film (not all of them where action sequences), the film dragged its feet. There was at most 2 hours of redeemable film stretched out to 3 hours. Malick has a vision in this film, almost \\"Apocalypse Now\\" like vision, showing the motivation behind each character. That part is not the problem, telling the emotional and mental pain soldiers go through while at war is a wonderful goal. Unfortunatly that goal is not met in this film. One of the problems is Malick tried to do this with too many characters. At times, I had no idea which charatcer was narrarating. The short scene with John Cusack is the most exhilarating scene in this film and the best one I've seen in quite awhile. Overall its a good film if you want to study human behavior in time of war, but not if you want a war film. It's not about war, it's about soldier's reaction to war."},{"rating":"2","title":"only malick could make this haunting, strange movie","review":"it's not perfect, not for everyone, probably not a masterpiece, but only an artist with malick's eye for beautiful images and ear for poetry could make such an interesting and moving movie. only malick could give us soldiers who quote homer before the battle..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too much of a good thing.","review":"The movie was beautifully filmed, the actors were well-known, and the writing was superb. The only problem is that soldiers did not comb and spray their hair before an excursion, the average day did not have a spectacular sunset, and war is not poetic. I really wanted to like this movie, but the many loose ends within just were not tied together. When too many variables of a movie are made to be perfect, some aspects of reality are lost. I watched this movie and just had a terribly hard time believing it. Play this movie for a war veteran and most, I think, would tell you they had little time to ponder the questions of life presented within it. This movie is like too much sugar in a cake... It makes it too hard to swallow."},{"rating":"2","title":"absolutely brilliant.","review":"\\"the thin red line\\" - either you love it (and \\"get\\" it) or you hate it. simply put: it is one of the best films ever made. actor portrayals were brilliant, direction beautifully shot, and overall a masterpiece. there's no use in comparing it against \\"saving private ryan\\" because the movie isn't just about war; it's about the psyche behind it. about how each man deals with their own personal situations and \\"fights their own war\\". in the end, it's very enjoyable with oscar worthy performances by sean penn, jim caviezel, and ben chaplin."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wish I could give it no stars.","review":"I love war movies, particularly, WWII movies. And let me just say, this is the absolute worst movie I've ever seen in any genre. It's been several years since I watched this movie and I still regret the time in my life I spent in the theater watching this film. I could have spent the time doing anything else. I could have gotten a root canal in half the time and it would have been less painful. The director, not so delicately, drives home his politics beginning to end. With that all said... if you want to watch a political-hack piece of extreme anti-war rhetoric then this is definitely the film for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Totally Inaccurate","review":"Movie so inaccurate hard to watch. If you have ever seen documentaries of this island...it's nothing like this movie. The island was bombed before the Marines arrived...what's with this island paradise look? Didn't like this movie at all. Marines (or at least I think that's what this movie is portraying) acted like they've had no training, the officers weren't believable in their behavior. Don't remember seeing natives in the documentary films."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can we please wait for the Blu-Ray?","review":"OK, I understand that this is a film that many people like (it has been out on DVD for a while, and there are plenty of reviews of its quality around--on DVD). When I come to this specific site, I know the film, what I don't know is what is the film like TECHNICALLY as a blu-ray. These reviews do not help with that goal. They just take up space at the \\"front of the bus,\\" so to speak. Can we hold off waxing about how good the blu-ray will be UNTIL we actually see what it is like? One star for the fan momentum, four stars for the film, and who knows how many stars for the blu-ray."},{"rating":"1","title":"Way too long!","review":"This movie was obviously written by someone with little understanding of the military and history. There was an excessive amount of narrative and monologue that was not needed. There were too many side stories that never developed nor contributed to the plot. In fact, there is no congruent plot here. This film may seem star studded, but it is underwhelming at best! Worst of all, this movies is SLOOWWWWWW! The emphasis is needed here. There are way too many dramatic death scenes and not enough action. Also, there are way too many scenes of people just sitting around. I understand this is supposed to be a work of fiction, but this is an utter waste of time and does little to honor the true heroic actions of the men who fought and died during the battle for Guadalcanal. Introspective and poetic it might be, but underwhelming and not deserving of it higher ratings for sure!

Tell the director to watch the above three films and ask himself if he can come up with the same garbage in 20 years. Get with the times brother. Dipreesed Thin Red Line watcher.

From simple rustic airs to the swirling strings of \\"Street in the City\\"....Till the Rivers All Run Dry to a foot beating out a rhythm, and a dobro thrown in for good measure.Enough of me going on..do your self a favour (sorry Molly), and take the chance to listen to this album. I feel even now this wonderful piece of music stands up well...and with the loss of of Ronnie Lane we will never hear the likes of this again.I understand someone has performed at least one of the songs off this album.

One of the things I love about it is that it isn't overproduced like most of his later releases were. The songs are simple and the melodies come through. Like the reviewer said before, this isn't the Who-styled rock, it's more acoustic based folk music. Some songs are up-tempo like \\"My Baby Gives it Away\\", \\"Catmelody\\" and the title track, but for the most part it's a quiet affair.

It is a really great book. It takes you back, all the way to Germany and the Stauffer influence on Martin Guitar. It has all the different models and the history of changes taking place not only with the company but the effect upon the instruments they were building. Maybe I'm just crazy about acoustic guitars but now, I have a greater appreciation for this genuine American guitar company. Richard Johnston and Jim Washburn really did knock the dust off lots of cool Martin guitar memorabilia too. Inside the cover is and acknowledgement to Dick Boak as Consulting Editor, he is a Martin man through and through and wrote the text for Martin's Kit Construction book and drew the plans, I do believe. This is an authoritative book and great photos on most of it's 264 pages. Yeah, I kinda liked it, and you will too if you like acoustic guitars, especially Martins.

I thought that enough books had been written about the company and there was nothing more to say. I'm happy to admit I was wrong.

Surprisingly, the authors also delved into the less than rosy times, labor disputes and the near end of one of the country's oldest family run businesses.

I am happy to say the album is brilliant. The opening track \\"Mad Dog\\" is a bomb blast of keyboards, bass, guitar, and drums. Not to mention Justine's great voice. If you heard the EP and enjoyed it then you will love the LP. The songs are much more polished and have more Elastica and less of Mark E. Smith. The songs \\"Human\\" and \\"Nothing Stays the Same\\" have great melodies. \\"Generator\\" and \\"How he wrote the Elastic man\\" has a great mix of catchy syth hooks. To sum up this review I am very much into English indie and pop music. I own all the Blur, Idlewild,and Republica albums etc, and Elastica's \\"Menace\\" is my favorite album so far. I can only look forward to the singles now, and if I'm lucky they will tour the U.S. and stop by Arizona. Cheers!"},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT AT ALL WORTH THE WAIT","review":"After 5 years, it's hard to believe that this is the best that Elastica could come up with. I was anxious to order this because their debut was/is one of my favourite albums of all time. This CD really had no high points for me. All of the tracks that I could bring myself to listen to more than twice, were just so basic. This CD has none of the infectious pop stylings of their debut, so if you are looking for another \\"Stutter\\" or \\"Connection\\" forget it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"New Sound for Elastica, Poor Execution","review":"It's been five years since the release of Elastica's debut album, but apparently they didn't spend much of the intervening time writing songs or working in the studio. Most of the tracks sound like amateurish doodling instead of finished songs. There's lots of screaming, discordant guitars and odd time signatures. When the Pixies used these same elements in the late eighties they created awesome masterpieces; in the hands of Justine Frischmann and her bandmates-du-jour we get a bunch of unmemorable tracks that don't hold together. There's also two new keyboard players in the band, but their contributions are uninspired and don't add much to the overall sound.Don't get me wrong; I'm glad Elastica had the guts to try something new. The last thing I'd want to hear is a carbon-copy of their first album. But they should have worked on refining their new sound before committing it to disk."},{"rating":"1","title":"New Sound, Poor Execution","review":"I made the expensive mistake of buying this CD as an import. It's been several years since Elastica's eponymous debut CD, but they apparently didn't spend much of the intervening time writing and practicing new songs. There's lots of discordant guitars, screeching vocals and odd time signatures. When the Pixies used these same elements a decade ago they created masterpieces. In the hands of Justine Frischmann and her bandmates-du-jour, all we get are a bunch of sloppy tunes which don't hold together. To boot, the two new keyboardists in the band don't add much to the overall sound, except for amateurish doodles here and there.Don't misunderstand me; the last thing I'd want to hear would be a carbon-copy of their first album. I just wish they'd spent more time polishing their new sound before committing it to disk."},{"rating":"2","title":"Six years is worth the wait!","review":"I am glad they have returned--albeit with an altered line up--with an awesome sophomore follow-up to their self-titled debut. The album exudes punk energy, and combines the postmodern grooves that playing with synthesizers and ramming together guitar riffs can provide. My favorite tracks would include the tongue-in-cheek cheeky \\"Your Arse My Place\\", as well as Elastica's interpretation of Trio's \\"Da Da Da.\\" Driving in a Volkswagen will never be the same. I highly recommend this album in the face of the cheese-pop produced factory-style today. Hopefully \\"The Menace\\" can menace the boy bands back into nowhere-land where they belong."},{"rating":"2","title":"Elastica Unpredictably Follows A Predictable Path","review":"On their debut album five long years ago, Elastica magically recaptured the sound of the first wave of British punk bands, most notably Wire circa \\"Pink Flag\\" and the Stranglers circa 1977. Now, after emerging from the smack haze in which they almost were permanently lost, Justine Frischmann and band have progressed... to the sound of the New York bands circa 1980. They've added a depth and complexity worthy of Eight Eyed Spy and the Bush Tetras, leavened by the occasional pop reference to Blondie. Interestingly, the album is punctuated by ambient sidetracks into Eno's little green world -- and it works! Thank Heaven they're back. Not as exciting as \\"Elastica,\\" but with definite signs that this will be the rare punk band that, like the Clash, can be counted on to pull off their third album."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as good as the first one...","review":"...so don't get your hopes up, cheese!An interesting, but ultimately disappointing second album. There are brief flashes of brilliance here and there, especially Mark E. Smith doing his thing on How He Wrote Elastica Man(-uh!), but overall this disc is a mishmash of half-baked ideas and throwaway tracks.Only really worth picking up if you already have the first album, the 6-track EP (because the EP has Smith on both HHWEM and KB), and the Radio One Sessions--and don't pay big import $$$! Look for it at your favorite used record shop at a bargain price."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is a MAJOR disappointment!!!","review":"I remember loving Elastica's first album when it came out. The whole CD was great, but \\"Stutter\\" was especially a standout. Back then, Elastica had a sound that was reminiscent of classic British punk bands like the Buzzcocks.I've been \\"out of the loop\\", musically speaking, for quite some time now. I saw this CD on Amazon, and decided to give it a shot. I was concerned about the departure of guitarist Donna Matthews, but figured I'd give it a chance anyway. Well, all I can say is that DONNA MATTHEWS must have been to ELASTICA what MICK RONSON was to DAVID BOWIE! This album is totally WEAK. No songs, no guitars, no punk attitude--just cushy synths and little else.A REAL bummer.I seriously want to throw this CD against a wall..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ho-hum","review":"What happened to the hooks? The melodic sense? The structured pop compositions like \\"Stuttered\\" and 1995's classic candidate \\"Waking Up\\", which had distinguished this feisty band from the pack?All is gone on The Menace, a mishmash of noise, punky distortion, and smartass lyrics. This time around, Justine Frischmann's legendary bad attitude rings out empty, her proclamations and posing boring and unsupported, just because the songwriting's down in the gutters. The departure of guitarist Donna Matthews seems to have drained this band of its previous pungent hookery, for on The Menace, there isn't a single memorable moment, a single catchphrase or guitar hook, to be found, all buried beneath some kind of too-hip-to-be-true cyberpunk noise, seemingly the work of an undisciplined producer twiddling knobs rather than a fully functioning, songwriting band.Five years to cook *this* up? At least Boston and Def Leppard had the tunage to make the wait worthwhile. Elastica, on the other hand, does not."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing, Disappointing, Disappointing.","review":"Disappointing, ugly, and underachieving. This CD is under 35 minutes which indicates that Elastica is out of ideas (even after 5 years from the last release). The synthesizer / keyboards instantly kill this one on arrival. Zero direction, a bad case of writers block, who knows where it went wrong? Who's idea was it to cover Trio's \\"Da Da Da\\"?

Really strong. I was excited that it worked so well. The next morning, at 5am, before I even had a chance to use it, I was awoken by a loud bang. The source of the noise was this gripper simply falling off the shower wall and onto the floor of the shower. Less that 24 hours after it was affixed, and with no provocation whatsoever. How can I trust it to use even to balance myself if it falls off on it's own? So...it's going back. The search continues."},{"rating":"2","title":"Get the job done","review":"My 77 year old father lives with me and he recently had a hip replacement. I wanted him to have something to hold onto when he gets in and out of the shower. So far this bar has worked great. My father is a very strong man, so I was afraid that he would pull the bar off, but once it is latched to the shower it stayed. The only thing I noticed is that it slowly slid down over the course of 3 weeks. I am not sure if it just slid or did it slide a little every time he pulled on the bar. But so far I think it works perfect. My dad physical therapist said he recommends these bars to his clients all the time.

This will not work on a tile wall of 4\\" tile. The spacing of the tile will not allow the suction cups to fully cover a tile, so the grout lines keep it from making suction.

I used to like this movie, but now I see it as a bad TV parody. There are a couple of good bits, like the commercial about the phaser, unfortunately that is followed by a sketch about a game show where contestants are rewarded for revealing their bad behavior, like child beating. The worst part was the sketch about the very dysfunctional gypsy family. There are a couple of prophetic pieces (four television networks and an oil company with an Exxon-like name spilling oil into the ocean), but this is a sadly-dated movie that should never have been made in the first place."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tunnelvision - They don't make movies like this anymore.","review":"\\"Tunnelvision\\" is a movie that pokes a lot of \\"R\\" rated fun at serious television programming. Perhaps the definitive film of it's kind. Even more so than it's predeccesor \\"The Groove Tube\\". And yes, it features some comedy stars that you would easily recognize today such as Howard Hessman, Laraine Newman and Richard Belzer to name a few. This movie is still one of my favorites from the '70's. Standout bits include a sit-com about a very disfunctional family called \\"Ramone and Sonia\\", featuring the above mentioned Miss Newman, and a \\"commercial\\" about an attractive woman who wants to look more butch. A nice little \\"throw-away\\" touch is the cool looking \\"eyemouth\\" station logo.

It is a look at a simpler world, when San Francisco stopped for three days while its citizens climbed on rooftops and walked to the waterfront to watch the drama unfold in the Bay - a drama that could not be played out on television (1946 was a radio and newspaper world), but instead flashed on movie screens around the world.

The music stays heavy but never seems to repeat itself. My personal favorites are definately \\"Pout\\" and \\"Hymen\\". Don't be fooled by the titles of the songs, the music is complex and not like a Drowning Pool or Saliva. The only fault in the cd is that I wish the lead singer would sing for longer stretches of time. As is, most songs consist of him either him screaming or at a near whisper.

The main advantage of this is it is stackable or you can daisy-chain several of these to manage more than 8 servers. It works with most PS2 to USB cables or adapters so servers with only USB ports can still be connected and controlled using this KVM switch. Pressing a single button to toggle is frankly quite faster then looking up and searching for a right button corresponding to a port number which other KVM switches have. The only minor issue I experience very rarely is the loss of connection of mouse or keyboard after a power outage. It does not do it all the time but on those rare occassions, I have to unplug the console keyboard and mouse from the back of the primary kvm then plug them back in and that resolves the issue.

The first third of the book is a beautiful, heartbreaking story of one schoolboy's love for his male friend. However many schoolboy romances there are, we can always use more of them. On the other hand, the last two-thirds of the book gives us an overlong mishmash of interactions between largely uninteresting characters (with some notable exceptions, such as the boy who earns a little money by sharing his body with a man in the neighborhood).

This is one of those books that you usually find after you've gone through a few ok, not ok or not bad books. The Author puts you in the scene and you find yourself turning pages wondering what's going to happen next. What I like most is the pace and the \\"feel\\" of the novel. I work in a high-tech environment and I can attest the characters Mr. Bronson described is a \\"to-the-bone\\" and right on description of the \\"characters\\" that populate this \\"Bizarro\\" world. If I was to rate what I liked best about this read I would have to say the feel. As strange as the characters may be they are really out there (no pun intended)."},{"rating":"2","title":"A fine bit of storyteling","review":"I feel that in this book, Bronson has humanized Silicon Valley to an extent. The main characters in this book are actually fleshed out characters and not stereotyped uber-geeks.Some of the other reviewers said that the book glosses over the technical aspects of computers too much. I disagree. I don't think Bronson dumbed down the computer explanations as much as summarized them in normal language. Having a lot of technical info in this book would detract from the main thing, which is the story.All in all, Bronson has written a fine book. The book has lots of twists and turns and is a page turned until the end."},{"rating":"1","title":"Insultingly stupid and extremely cheesy","review":"Bad characters, inane and obvious plot and zero writing style make this one of the worst books I've ever had the misfortune to read. If you have any interest in the world of business or silicon valley and the computer industry you should find this book laughable. And to make matters worse Po Bronson takes the kindergarten level theme and story so seriously it makes you doubt his credentials.I actually thought this might be a fun read as I was going through a similar situation as the lead character but just found this to be insulting me on every single page. I hope Amazon don't take it as a spoiler if I tell you the ending is unbelieveably stupid. In a word: Avoid."},{"rating":"2","title":"Liar's Poker of Silicon Valley","review":"Po Bronson is Silicon Valley's Michael Lewis. Po Bronson does with this novel what Scott Adams did with comic strips. The characters in the book reminded me of the movie Office Space. Although, the book has a much superior plot. This book caricatures the personality of the Silicon Valley and is written to be made into a movie. It made me burst into laughters and some steep turns in the story made me gape in wonder.It was a nice and fun read; with a peppy and ruthless sense of humor. It is a casual read for the most part. When the plot thickens, you've got to pay attention to some details to convince yourself that you did not get tricked.

But sometimes things are funny because they are real.

He has too many anecdotes that have no purpose other than to simulate a true understanding of Valley culture.A real disappointment, and clearly an attempt to appeal to both the lowest common denominator, and movie executives."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just Didn't Pass Muster","review":"Silicon Valley is one of the hottest topics right now and as with all new things, writers with a strong facility for language are not going to gravitate towards this subject just yet. Unfortunately, Bronson is not that person. While he has a passable writing style, I still don't get a sense of the society and environment he's trying to describe in this book. And he better watch out, since Michael Lewis is in his territory now and that man can string words together very well.

The action takes place in Spain, but the focus is on the Chinese community of Triads and Tigers (the Chinese Mafia). It poses the question, if you knew who had killed the person you loved most, what would you do about it?A woman who is half Chinese and half Spanish seeks her parents' killer and joins forces with an introverted young Spaniard whose history includes time spent wrongly incarcerated for raping another young woman.The Yellow Fountain is symbolic of where you go at death and meet those who preceded you.The plot is silly and thin.

Goldfinger is the gold standard of all the films. A perfect mix of fantasy and humor.

Most of the Jedi Council from Eps I and II get one paragraph each in a collective entry, with a few omitted completely. The podrace competitors get about the same coverage as the Jedi Council, if not more. And a personal quibble, I would have liked to have seen an entry on Captain Tarpals.

At times I felt the book was misinforming, especially on Unitarian Universalism, which is my own leaning. However, in retrospect, I think the author never intended to be an authority. Through this book I saw Catholic practices and rituals in a new light and with renewed inspiration, and had my interest piqued about Sikhs, Mormons, Amish and the Scientologists.

The author is very brief with his proofs as though the reader is reviewing the material and not learning it for the first time. On the other hand, he explains some simple topics excessively when it's not at all necessary. I think the reason for the style of this book is that Marsden is really an applied mathematican. I would not use this book for self-study, unless I had to. There are also many errors in the book.

For that, this book loses a star."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poorly written; to be avioded","review":"This book has been used as the text for an undergrad analysis class at Stanford for a number of years. It is overly verbose, poorly organized, and terribly written. The language is imprecise, and relies too much on intuition than solid reasoning. Furthermore, the proofs often lack elegance.A much better text is Rudin's Principles of Mathematical Analysis. Concise and eleganty written. The language is precise, and the proofs are often full of beautiful and clever ideas."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not So Hot.","review":"Unevenly written. Full of typos. Some sections, like the one describing types of matrices, are so incompetently worded as to defy complete comprehension, even with repeated readings. Although some of the coverage of topological material is good, overall the informal explanations don't really do much to supplement the rigorous proofs -- they're just sort of... verbose. Not recommended. (Instead, try \\"Yet Another Introduction to Analysis\\" by Victor Bryant, as a fine introduction to the subject.)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Garbage","review":"I don't know who in their right mind designates this as the class text at any college. Lousy presentation of every part of analysis. The seperation of the theorems into their own section at the end of the chapter is a terrible way to learn math. Learning the proofs is crucial for doing math at the advanced undergrad or graduate levels. Could be used as an informal text to give engineers or physicists a general idea of multivariable analysis, but I think it would be a waste of time and effort. Might as well do it right and step up to Rudin or Spivak."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed!","review":"I love the premise of this book but the stories felt very contrived, like the author was trying to tell a story that taught her values.

The color is as you would expect from this price range -- very white, only slight opalescence, but decent enough to wear. I wanted these pearls as I've lost most of the ones I've had over the years and didn't want to spend a fortune on very high grade pearls. I have found that single pearl studs make a simple and pretty statement and can be worn with just about anything. They can \\"class up\\" jeans and a tee shirt or complete a classy outfit. For the price, you can't go wrong, as long as you're not expecting a rich, deep color that can only come with spending a lot more money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pearl Earrings","review":"The earring is well made and perfect for my needs.

Everything she could have asked for and more. Sadly, one of those pearl earrings fell out and she lost it. So I bought her another pair for Christmas. She had them in for the day and now her ear is having an allergic reaction to them. I don't know if it's true 14k gold or not because the first ones didn't do this to her. http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004UGKP8M/ref=oh_details_o00_s00_i00 were the original ones I purchased in May. The only difference between the two are the color of the gold, size of the pearl, and quality of the pearl. I'm not happy that this caused her ear to get infected."},{"rating":"2","title":"14k Yellow Gold Akoya pearl earrings","review":"Received these in two days as promised, on Christmas Eve. The pearls are very pretty and perfect size, not too big to be overbearing but large enough to be adult classy, not child size, just right. The pearls are a perfect match size and color. The only downsides are that I wish it came with a nice velvet box for wow factor when box is opened but did have a nice velvet drawstring pouch with divider so they don't rub on each other. Also the back posts seem thin, not thick or heavy duty. I hope they hold up over the long haul because they are very pretty."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor packaging","review":"They came in a paper box and black fake velvet bad. Really not gift worthy.

Out of a total of 6 earrings, 2 were not glued completely to the posts, at danger of falling off posts, but these pearls were good, very minor blemishes, almost flawless. Two were very severly blemished on the front, most visible part of the pearls, with many dents and bumps. Two had dark spots, swirls and blemishes, again on the front of the pearls. None were near as pristine as in the picture. The blemishes/dark areas were visible from across the room. The good thing is that the posts and backs were solid and secure. Also, Akoya pearls have a nice, lustrous sheen. Returned for refund, as I would not want to give these as a gift to someone I liked. With Amazon jewelry, it is real hit or miss. I'm glad they are good about returns. Thanks Amazon! Very disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good bargain","review":"I bought these earrings for my mother who lost the ones my father gave her for their engagement 40 years ago.

They are not the best quality in the world but they are fine- like the other buyers there are small divits in them but I don't think any one would notice unless they were really looking at them.

I ordered the 6.5-7.0 mm, but what I received was (according to Amazon's own scale and then measured with a metric ruler) was 5.5-6.0 mm. Two sizes smaller than what I ordered!

The handle of this carafe is made up of 2 plastic pieces that are supposed to snap together, however they don&#65533;t, the outer handle keeps coming loose, so I had to resort to my super glue and glued the sucker in permanently. I have used this machine for about 5 times now and noticed that if you do not pour the water in VERY SLOWLY, it will overflow. Using Starbucks Whole Bean House Blend coffee, I noticed that the coffee tastes like it does in any other drip coffee maker and not close to the coffee served at my local Starbucks. The last disappointment about this coffee maker is that the LED clock/timer is extremely hard to read, you literally have to stare down at it to see it, even then, if you don&#65533;t have bright light nearby, you will have a hard time determine the time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not a Musicologist","review":"If you love the piano, as I do, then this is a great CD to listen to.

Personally, I think this had a lot more romance than the other books. However, I really liked it. It still had all the action, drama, and romance that came with the first four books in the series. Meg still has all the elements to make a perfect book and a perfect ending. I think it is fantastic! Jess really shines in this one, and she finds herself, which is one of the most important things that anyone can go through. All of the questions about Rob are answered in this book.

It wasn't bad but this was better. I loved the beginning, it kept you informed about everything that had happened, so you wouldn't be asking yourself later, huh?. I reread this book after i finished it the first time, just cause i couldn't get enough of it.In this book Rob and Jess are not together anymore. She lives in New York with Ruth and goes to Julliards. She doesnt have her powers anymore because of having posttraumatic stress syndrome. so when Robs shows up on her doorstep cause he needs her help to find his missing step sister, it gets really interesting..This was my favorite in the series just cause i love ending. it doesnt let you down.and because as a character Jess grew so much that it was hard not to love and hate her."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not even close to the Jess I knew","review":"Sometimes it's better to let things lie. This finale was a mistake and an insult to what was a great teen series. The previous 1-800 books were quick, humorous, and eventful. This book panders to the broadest audience, layering on the romance thickly instead of focusing on an actual plot. What made the first four books great is that their author did not allow the romance between Jess and Rob to detract from the main plot. This book decided to go the Mia Thermopolis route and make Jess into a whiny, brainless girl who moans a lot about whether her boyfriend likes her or LIKE LIKES her.I recommend reading the first four and pretending this book doesn't exist. It was so boring, so trivial, I kept having to force myself to reread passages because I would find my mind wandering.

The story is suspenseful and has a solid moral underline: that not all persons may be what and who the reader thinks they are. I will be passing the book onto my children to read. The book captures the adventure and free sprits of the children, and thier desire for the truth. Ms. Whitney should be very proud of this story, for it is still timely today as it was when published nearly 30 years ago. The children are taught lessons in tolerance and compassion for the elderly, who have suffered through terrible times. The events captured are history now to all of us, but to many, were the world of thier own youth.

The characters were interesting and they seemed like real people.It was with all of this in mind that I order The Green Cat for my 11 year old daugher.

Unamazing author.","review":"Ms. Oldenbourg sets out in what I considered a catholic-apologist style, but one clearly leaning away from the 13th century Church. Her tale of the generations of Counts of Toulouse and thier various enemies: the Church, characterized by Pope Innocent III and Simon de Montfort, a brilliant tactician, and the French King (and later Regency) is less than gripping. The events should be read and discussed, for they are fascinating. But Ms. Oldenbourg throws out opinion after opinion, giving a full page of \\"oh, woe!\\" after a particularly gruesome murder by a bishop.If you are a schoolteacher, you will bore your students to death. If you absolutely love history, you can get through this book and learn a great deal; the sections describing the Catharist heresy (chapter 4?) and the beginnings of the Inquisition (chapter 11) were definitely informative.If you have to, read this book.

So far it works great with my wireless mouse, keyboard, and digital camera plugged in simultaneously. The AC power ensures that your USB-powered devices will work properly. However, there is one issue to be aware of: this hub only works when plugged into AC power, which was not clearly indicated in the specs. For this reason, it is not a good hub for laptop users on the go, which is why I give it only 4 stars. Other than that, it is a solid performer. It is small, so it doesn't clutter your desktop too much, and has rubber feet to keep it from sliding. The AC adapter is sideways so that it only takes up one plug, which is a nice detail. This would be a good choice if you are planning to use it for a desktop, particularly if you have several USB-powered devices."},{"rating":"1","title":"My Experience: Underpowered and Unreliable","review":"I was excited to have this 7-Port USB 2.0 hub until I discovered that it cannot handle more than four devices reliability and it cannot handle any high power devices, such as an external hard drive at all. I tried USB powered externals (Seagate 100 GB) and external hard drives with their own power supply (Western Digital 250 GB) It just doesn't recognize these. My Seagate 100 GB external started making that funny noise it makes when it is not getting enough power.I also had trouble with my Linksys transmitter for my wireless Skype phone. It worked fine when plugged directly into one of the computer USB ports, but would not work at all with the D-Link Hub.I would think the unit was defective, except that the mouse, Cruzer USB drive, and keyboard that I have plugged into it work fine.This device has its own power supply, but it doesn't seem to be able to handle the load. I would not recommend it. I plan to replace mine with another brand."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can't properly mix and match devices","review":"What's not specified in the item description is that if you mix and match USB 1.1 and USB 2 devices, the hub may only provide the much slower USB 1.1 speed for ALL ports. You don't read that in the product description. You have to wait until you purchase the item and read the documentation. So, don't plug an iPod mini and a USB 1.1 device (in my case a wireless mouse) into the same hub or your iPod may have major problems, as mine did. The iPod wants to run at full USB 2 speeds.Why is there a problem with the manufacturer providing that info in the description before you purchase the hub? This is highly deceptive, in my opinion."},{"rating":"1","title":"2 high speed charging port issue","review":"In order to get full charging power from the high speed charging ports, the DUB-H7 must be disconnected from your pc disabling all of the 5 non-high speed charging ports.

This could not be farther from the truth. The power adapter is the same as the older version (it is a \\"wall wart\\"), and only works with 120 volts of AC. I tried using an older version device (which has the exact same power supply) with 240 volt power, and the power supply exploded and smoke poured from the \\"brick\\".

After the third one died, I just gave up. I spent more on shipping than I would have spent on just buying a new hub from a different manufacturer.So what went wrong? In each case the hub seemed to overheat and die. I could actually smell that distinct odor of frying circuit board. Never had anything particularly power-hungry hooked up: two iPods, a scanner, a digital camera.I understand if it happened once, or even twice, but three times a bad hub? Not likely. Since the new hub I got from a different manufacturer is working well, then the conclusion must be that it is the D-Link design that is at fault."},{"rating":"1","title":"Problems while using with iMac","review":"I have had this 7-port hub for a couple of months now and am using it with an iMac. Its performance has been erratic. I had all my peripherals plugged to it - printer, camera, keyboard-mouse and my iPod sync cable.It worked fine for a couple of weeks. Then the keyboard-mouse started failing to detect on startup. Unplugging and replugging would solve the problem but it was not worth the trouble for every time. Then the iPod refused to sync through the hub. So now I am back to using the ports on my computer.So I'm not happy with the product. Either I got a bad piece or Mac users should stay away from this USB Hub.I'm unhappy because I was a believer in D-Link.

The device is small and attractive and gets the job done. However I do have a couple qualms about the design. First, the provided USB cord connects straight on into the back of the unit, but the power adapter connects at a 90* angle, so they don't lie parallel to each other. Second, the device does not indicate if it is running on USB power or wall power. And finally, the indicator lights below each port are always on, so they have no function. I would have expected them to come on green when something is plugged in, flash with activity, and maybe turn red when there is a malfunction. Overall though, its small and works, which are my primary concerns."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unreliable","review":"This hub has 7 ports, and is quite compact. Those are all things I like. However, I have found this hub to be unreliable. From time to time, one device connected to the hub will stop working. Just disconnect and reconnect the device, and everything gets back to normal. The interval between two incidents can be of a few hours or a few days. I have a keyboard, mouse, headset, printer, and scanner connected to the hub, and never have any problem like this when they are connected directly to my laptop.For a while I thought this was maybe problem specific to my Windows machine. Lately I got a MacBook Pro, and was surprised to have exactly the same problem with that machine as well. So this is definitely some problem with the hub, or of the interaction of the hub with the devices I am using.Bottom line: I can't use this hub.So my verdict is: not recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wouldn't even run the keyboard...","review":"I'm baffled, too.

All of the above items worked as soon as I plugged them straight into my MacMini's USB ports. Everything lights up I've plugged and unplugged the hub, and each time I get the \\"low power\\" warning, even for the keyboard. A hub like this is supposed to be plug and play, especially on a Mac.

I'm using a Microsoft Natural Ergo 4000 and a Microsoft Intellimouse Explorer - neither have given me problems plugged directly into the computer or other computers, but plugged in to this hub I get mouse dropouts (even the laser light blinks out) and repeated key presses (every 1-30min, the last key I pressed will get typed a dozen times). This makes it incredibly frustrating when typing, and removes the value in the device.

For example, only two of my USB drives will run concurrently. Worse, I've seen data corruption when a drive is plugged into four of the seven ports; I thought a La Cie USB hard drive was defective until I plugged it directly into the PC. The center three ports seem to blank out occasionally, but recover after a reboot.I'm on Amazon now looking for a more reliable replacement.

Looks like I'll have to post this review elsewhere since Amazon will not accept responsibility. 8-19-11: Complaint filed with AG's office since Amazon will not acknowledge this issue!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad","review":"I remember looking forward to Frampton's follow up to Comes Alive back in 1977, but after seeing the cover of the album in the record store being too embarrassed to buy it. Pretty boy in sissy cloths - I didn't want to be caught with that. After hearing it later, I was glad I never got it. It was definitely a love song album for teen girls. Love songs heavy with strings and synths. This album ( and the Sgt Pepper movie) was a real career killer for Frampton which is a shame because he did much better later. He is still playing well and has put out some really good albums in the last few years. Still rockin. But I'm in You is bad."},{"rating":"1","title":"PETER \\"MANILOW\\" FRAMPTON","review":"Uau, one must have real courage to buy an album with this kind of cover art and still says that Frampton is a rocker....

I think Frampton went in exactly the right direction after that horrible \\"Comes Alive\\" atrocity and finally got back to recording some heartfelt thoughtful songs. That live album everyone thinks is so wonderful is actually his worst. Try any of his other CD's and you'll find out what Frampton is REALLY about. He's not the popstar you thought, huh? No way, he's much, much better. \\"I'm in You\\" is a great disc from start to finish, with no filler. Buy it, enjoy it, and get over that ridiculous kid stuff you thought you liked. This is the real thing. My second fave Frampton is his new one, \\"NOW\\". Get that one too!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Frampton at his Best!!!","review":"I have been searching and searching for this CD. I originally owned this title on 8-track (yes, 8-track!!!) years ago and of course they no longer work! I was ecstatic to finally find it available on CD and immediately ordered my copy. I'm in You was probably my favorite Frampton song. I remember seeing him in concert and he performed it twice - once with only himself and the piano on the stage. It was fantastic!!!! If you like Frampton, then you will like this CD. If only they still made music like this!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not so hot","review":"Following on the heels of great success for Frampton, this album was a letdown. \\"Tried to Love\\" is OK, and \\"Signed, Sealed, Delivered I'm Yours\\" was written by a better musican, but the rest is not so great. The title cut reeks of mediocrity. Don't Put Your Heart on the Line for this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent overview of the grizzly bear & associated issues","review":"National Geographic once again does a fantastic job presenting a controversial subject with an objective eye. NGS crews take us to Alaska and elsewhere to show us up-close and very intimate views of this often-misunderstood predator. There is excellent footage of many types of grizzly behavior, a very good historical overview, anecdotes from grizzly attack survivors, a large portion about bears within Yellowstone Park and how we have taught them to become \\"problem bears,\\" advice from park rangers, and many other attractive features to this video.Though produced in 1987, the film comes from a very conservationist-based point of view, respects the grizzly, and does a very good job of teaching us about this magnificent animal. Peter Coyote does a wonderful job as narrator, too. If you are at all interested in bears, their behavior, and how to live in harmony with them, this is a great video to start with."},{"rating":"2","title":"Iz: The Song Book Collection","review":"I bought it for the Uke tabs, but it may drive me to start learning the guitar.

For those who may not realize it a couple of points:1. The chord diagrams supplied are actually for the Baritone Ukulele. Look closer and notice that there are two strings in the diagram not used (The E and A strings which are the difference for the Baritone Ukulele.2. Capo at fret 5 of a guitar or baritone ukulele results in the Standard \\"C\\" (G-C-E-A) tuning I believe.In short, what you need for the most part is provided for you with a little insight from you."},{"rating":"2","title":"IZ song book","review":"This book is really great for a Baritone Ukulele.. True, it is tuned differently than a suprano or Tenor But if you want to have fun with the Baritone Uku.. This is a great way to go.... I am enjoying mine very much... I recommend this for all Baritone Ukulele players... Rock"},{"rating":"1","title":"Love IZ but the book is NOT really for ukulele, misleading title","review":"The book has the chords and tabs for several popular IZ songs, but ALL the chord diagrams and tab diagrams are for guitar. And while yes you could just look at the letter and play the G chord or F chord on an Ukulele, the tab diagrams do not help for finger picking on ukulele."},{"rating":"1","title":"Would have been nice if it were really IZ Songs","review":"I am a huge fan of Iz. Lets get that out of the way and I am a guitar player and have set my sites to learn Uke. I bought this book under the assumption that it was a Uke book, After all it said it was on the cover and description. I was wrong. Sure, I can transpose, I am not musically illiterate but when I spend money for a Tab book of an artist, I expect that I am buying tabs that represent that artist not some interpretation of another artist on a different instrument. Sure wish I could get my money back for the simple reason I do not want the publisher of this book to have my cash. I'll shop around for a better book or simply use the internet. At least the tabs are close."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not buy the Kindle edition!","review":"I'm a beginner ukulele player.Yes the chords are annoying as they do not correspond to ukulele but to a fretted guitar, but the worst of it is that most of the pages look like a cheap photocopy. I have tried on my kindle as well as my PC and the image is really bad, sometimes impossible to read. I wish I have bought the printed version of the Ukulele tab."},{"rating":"2","title":"Must-have for Bartenders and other service industry workers","review":"Ripe with essential courtesies and everyday niceties, these life rules can be an important tool for anyone whose income depends on the whim of a customers tip.

Courtesy remains one of the most powerful uses of language, and all it requires is a bit of style."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Ideas","review":"This is a book for men who are already motivated to be more polite, who truly desire to treat others courteously and with grace and gentility.It will not motivate you (no book will!). But if you are already motivated, it makes it easy for you. Instead of lengthy discussions of theory or history, it simply says \\"Gentlemen do\\" or \\"gentlemen do not\\", followed by a short description of an action gentlemen do (or do not) do.It provides clear examples of what NOT to say and gives you good ideas on what TO say.Great idea for reading for young men (ages sixteen plus), if they care to do more than wow girls and truly want to treat ladies as ladies and colleagues as colleagues."},{"rating":"1","title":"if you buy this book","review":"If you buy this book it is not necessary to buy any of the other in the series.

The money would have been better spent on a DVD rental."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is written for someone who does not understand American Culture","review":"I bought this book thinking it would be a helpful book of manners. It is very simplistic and approaches manners as if the reader has no sense of American culture. I would suggest this book for someone from another country trying to understand the basics of manners in America. I would not recommend this book for someone who is just trying to improve on common knowledge."},{"rating":"1","title":"sent me the wrong book, but let me keep it, with full refund","review":"They sent me the wrong book, but gave me a full refund promptly, and let me keep the item."},{"rating":"1","title":"Simply Terrible","review":"Nothing more than a collection of common sense.

I bought this CD to hear those 3 songs but since they are much, much shorter than the originals. I want my money back. I never would have purchased a CD where the songs are just samples of the originals. What's the point?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great but beware of abridged versions","review":"These two CD's are a very good introduction to WAR. The only problem that I've found with this CD is that, in order to fit in as many songs as possible, they edited and abridged many of the songs (Ballero, Deliver the Word, The World is a Ghetto all fall into this category). And as mentioned before some of the songs on the second CD do not do justice WAR, mainly their attempts at disco fall short. This also lacks many of the groups songs that they did with Eric Burdon (Spill the Wine and Tobacco Road are the only ones to make the cut) and it would have been nice to see more those songs on the album instead of some of their later work. This is a great introduction to band but do yourself a favor and check out more of them so you can get a full sense of WAR."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it!","review":"I finally found a small Revere skillet with a non stick coating.

Anyone who has been through the process of applying and interviewing for an internship knows how challenging it can be. Dr. Megargee's book was extremely helpful to me in this process. Among other things it helped me prepare a good CV! The chapter on possible interview questions was great as far as gathering my thoughts and preparing for the many interviews I had. I highly recommend this book to those preparing for internship. It will be money well spent!"},{"rating":"1","title":"This process is about getting gouged!","review":"Anyone going through the process of getting an internship placement knows that one gets gouged financially. Too bad that Dr. Megargee has to join in. The really useful information in this book could be condensed into a small booklet. Instead, the authors (and likely the publisher) have added tons of \\"fluff\\" (common sense information) to make this a \\"book\\" for which they can charge full price. I reluctantly recommend this book for the 10 or so pages that ARE helpful."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good and thorough resource","review":"Excellent and detailed information about the internship process, not the best resource for someone looking for quick tips but great for developing a fuller understanding of the process. Definitely helpful to read several months (or years) before internship, but also helpful for the procrastinator."},{"rating":"2","title":"chic craft for the holidays","review":"This has to be one of the most beautful craft ideas books I have ever seen.Mary Norden has a very contemporary eye for detail, there is a touch of Martha Stewartness about the presentation but without any fussiness (Nordern suggests tapered candles in a galvanised bucket, but she never suggests you make the candles yourself!) A glorious indulgence - you know what I mean, the sort of bed you can take to bed with you before you fall asleep dreaming of actually getting the christmas cards in the mail before New Years Eve"},{"rating":"1","title":"Lovely photography but few details and some odd ideas","review":"The best thing about this book is the photography, which is lovely. What is being photographed ranges from the mundane to the odd, and the ideas rarely said \\"Christmas!\\" to me. For instance, for the white decorating scheme the author suggests tying string around a white rock and putting it on the napkin in your placesetting. The author gives few details on how to achieve the looks she writes about. I was very disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Concord 6340 z","review":"If you plan on buying this camera look no further.

Cannot handle most bread slice sizes and ingredients ooz out of machine while cooking. This cooker only works if you use SMALL bread and very little filling. Definitely a waste of money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for basic sandwiches","review":"This is a good little machine for making basic hot sandwiches, quickly and easily. The 650 watt burners heat up quickly. The twin pockets can hold two sandwiches and easily make nice toasty meals.The only complaint is that the burner pockets are not deep enough so larger pieces of bread or overstuffed sandwiches make a bit of a mess.Though with the non stick burners, clean up is easy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Jaffel??","review":"Being from australia, i loved our jaffel maker over there. I needed a replacement since being in america and i brought this sandwich maker. It works well. A little time consuming with the clean up.

With PYGMALION, they make a very disappointing stumble. The package states that this is a \\"gorgeous new transfer, with digitally restored image and sound\\". I'm sure this is what they intended, but the product does not reflect either restored image or sound. It is, on the whole a good print, though not at all up to the normal Criterion quality. It is - in places - terrible. And the sound is all over the map. Yes, it can be heard, but because of a poor audio mix, one has to raise and lower the volume with almost every scene. Criterion remains by far the best distributor of DVDs, but they should be told by their consumers that in this case, the product is plainly not deserving of the Criterion name."},{"rating":"2","title":"The most intelligent british comedy in the thirties","review":"The smart script from Bernard Shaw made it possible this monumental film. The myth of Pygmalion was translated to cinema with a dazzling direction and obviously one supeb cast ; this couple Leslie Howard and the always beautiful and charming Wendy Hiller stealed the show.The tale about a poor girl who sells flowers in Covent Garden; a gamble between two men; the awake as human being is a match against all a new world of possibilities for this woman who suudenly transforms before us and everybody in a woman with class, charming and glamour.All the script is filled with ingenious and laughable situations with that clever sense of humor, so typical of Shaw.This unique match will impact the life of these three people with unthinkable consequences.A delightful movie and one of the best english comedies ever filmed.Remade in 1964 as My fair lady. But this one is one million years light better.A must in your collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"A true British classic","review":"This review is for the Criterion Collection DVD edition of the film.This film is based on the play by George Bernard Shaw. The film was even scripted by Shaw so it definately is the best version of the film.The story later inspired the much more famous musical film \\"My Fair Lady\\" I have not seen \\"My Fair Lady\\" so I am not one to compare.The film follows a phonetics and linguistics expert, Henry Higgins. He has such a knowledge of accents that he can tell what town a person is from by hearing them speak for only a few seconds. He later makes a bet with a colleague that he can train a common girl from Cockney to speak \\"proper\\" English and fool people into thinking she is a duchess.The Criterion DVD has no special features but the picture quality is quite good for a film of its age.This film is one of my new favorites!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Not my favorite but well worth seeing","review":"This film is a wonderful story. I personally prefer the musical version titled \\"My Fair Lady\\" starring Rex Harrison - but this one is well worth watching. This version is more of a romance than the musical - and the leading man is less likeable. I'm pleased that I decided to get this - it is a nice addition to my movie collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"The First Fair Lady","review":"Before she ever sang \\"Wouldn't It Be Loverly\\", Eliza was sellingflowers in Covent Garden and crucifying the king's English. Wendy Hiller made her film debut as Eliza and is magnificent. Shewas nominated for an Oscar. As Henry Higgins, Leslie Howard isabsolute perfection. The supporting cast is ideal. Alan Jay Lerner adapted Shaw's screenplay nearly word for word for MY FAIR LADY. In fact when Leslie Howard says \\"I've grown accustom to her face and appearance\\" we nearly add \\"it almost makes the day begin.\\" The Criterion dvd is a superb transfer. Cathleen Nesbitt has a bit part in the Embassy Ball scene.part at the Embassy Ball and you can also see Anthony Quayle ina quick shot. One of the best. I watch this more than I watchMY FAIR LADY."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful Film","review":"This is the original version of My Fair Lady. I love this because Leslie Howard plays an excellent Professor Higgins and is very convincing. The romance is great in the end; both Eliza and Higgins cannot do without each other it seems. A most excellent film worth watching, Leslie Howard is great in it."},{"rating":"2","title":"pretty good, for black and white...","review":"This was a very good movie. Higgins is rather a jerk who cannot express himself the way he should, but Pickering is a perfect gentleman. The transformation of Eliza Doolittle is a pleasure to watch... I enjoyed the Maestro deciding who she really was. I would have redone the ending (after the party), and worked with the script until the movie actually ended, not just stopped. However, all in all, it was a refreshing break."},{"rating":"2","title":"George Bernard Shaw, ingeniously...","review":"George Bernard Shaw was simply ingenious when he wrote Pygmalion, and when the story was brought to the silver screen it did Shaw justice. Pygmalion is a socioeconomic drama where the distinguished Dr. Higgins (Leslie Howard) takes the a flower girl Eliza Doolittle (Wendy Hiller) under his wing in order to set a bet with Colonel George Pickering (Scott Sunderland). The bet consists of transforming the poor flower girl into a lady of class, but this also means changing Eliza's manner of speaking. Asquith and Howard illustrate several different topics such as tolerance and understanding using a familiar approach that the audience can recognize as Eliza undergoes the change. In the end, Pygmalion offers an exceptional cinematic experience."},{"rating":"1","title":"caveat emptor","review":"Thinking that \\"Pygmalion\\" was public domain and that the bargain-basement price for the VHS tape was therefore understandable, I went ahead and purchased the least expensive version. Alas! It's recorded in EP (extended play) mode. The visuals are fuzzy, the sound is muffled, the tracking is awful. Factor in the postage, and what appeared to be a swan is a costly ugly duckling. This is one Eliza that gets tossed in the trash heap."},{"rating":"1","title":"They don't sound like they're having fun","review":"I fell in love with Monteverdi's -Scherzi Musicali- after finding a sprightly favourite record of this work with the Boston Camerata.Bought this one in hopes of replacing that aging vinyl. It is no match for it. The tempo here is too often sluggish. Some more instrumental colours would be nice here, too: pieces like -I bei legami- beg for recorders or flutes added to the mix. Instead, all of the ritornelli are played on violins, and towards the middle of the programme it begins to drag.This is essentially simple early Baroque music, written for amateur musicians to have fun with. There doesn't seem to be much life here, unfortunately."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gift","review":"Love it and so did my friend who I sent it to. Its well made and a fun gift. It shipped as promised.

The bears are at eye level, so they blocked their view. Not to mention the bear bar keeps popping off the chair. Very annoying. I finally stopped using it when my kids reached about 11 lbs because my boy toppled the whole thing over because it didn't restrain him well enough and it's not very sturdy. He wasn't hurt, just upset, but that was enough for me. I'm getting rid of it. Too bad"},{"rating":"1","title":"Hardly ever used it","review":"Cute bouncer. Looked nice in the corner of the playroom. Hardly ever used it, though, because it bored my daughter stiff. To be fair, she liked listening to the various sounds, as long as we didn't make her do it while sitting in the bouncer.Also, the bar quickly became deformed (it popped off one side and wouldn't stay back on). I ended up detaching the rabbit and bears from the bar and giving them to my daughter to play with and then stored the chair itself in our basement.We had much more luck with the Fisher Price Soothing Motions Glider. One of my daughter's favorite things to do in her pre-sitting up days was to lie back in that chair and rock back and forth while listening to music.

So disappointed, read teh warranty and the band is not included! Watch functions ok, but no strap, now what to do? They should at least warranty the whole watch 3months or something! Don't buy due to band!!!!Edit: Returned watch to TnT Watch & Jewelry with their RMA (even though I had to pay for s/h), they promptly sent me a new replacement watch. Service and responses were quick and professional, hopefully the watch will last more than a couple of months!

Don't let the photo fool you - those four protrusions are just big knobs that house four pinhead-sized buttons that take great force to push, and are VERY painful to use. Why nobody seems to mention this problem in their reviews of this watch is a mystery to me. I have read some reviews of other timex watches, even ones with large buttons, that complain of this problem. One reviewer said of the Timex Expedition Trail Series watch \\"maybe one is supposed to put the watch in a vise and then use a screwdriver to push the buttons.\\" And that watch has very large buttons.My fingers are not particularly sensitive and I have a very high tolerance for pain, so I can only figure everyone else is using thimbles or something to set their watches.No more Timex for me - back to Casio."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good inexpensive watch","review":"It's a watch with a lot of stuff that works well.

This includes not only meats (we're talking steak, hotdogs, salmon, chicken, any kind of meat) but leftovers I microwaved (curiosity) water for proofing yeast (I never followed that part of the recipe before) and even bathwater (again, curiosity.)I gave this thermometer 4 stars instead of 5 because it is very sensitive. Or maybe it is afraid of the dark. You see, I keep it in a drawer. It really, *really* seems to like being used because every time I open that drawer something bumps against it and I hear the little chirp of my thermometer turning on.Also, one time I heard a very quiet high-pitched sound and it was the thermometer which was on. I had trouble figuring it out at first, but the sound was so persistent that I finally figured it out. So now I am paranoid when I open the drawer and hear the chirp, that it will stay on and make that noise again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Maverick Pro Thermometer - Lukewarm","review":"Much larger than picture led me to believe, a bit bulky. Tip is too large to be fast responding. Meat is consistently overcooked."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent for non-liquids","review":"This thermometer is very large and easy to handle (32 cm / 1' 0-1/2\\" long) and its large display (both done-ness and actual temperature) is easy to read, making it ideal for oven, BBQ or stove-top use. It works perfectly for measuring the internal temperature of meats, breads and other non-liquid items as they cook.The upper part of the thermometer is obviously not waterproof (which I did not need to be told) but the description does not point out the fact that the probe must not be used to measure the temperature of liquids. It cannot, therefore, be used for the many liquid temperature applications I had planned. This limitation should have been stated clearly in the description.4 stars overall: 5 stars for the specific uses I have stated, 3 stars for \\"liquid incompatibility\\" and the five second wait time (for the display to register the temperature) which seems somewhat lengthy, given today's technology - no doubt because if the heft of the probe."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Pleased","review":"As pointed out in some of the other reviews, this thermometer has a very large copper tip that makes it difficult to check the doneness of thin cuts of meat. Also, I used the thermometer to check the doneness of some baked chicken breasts. It worked fine, but when eating the chicken at the point where the probe entered the meat, I detected a distinct metallic taste. (This was after washing the tip thoroughly with soap before use.) Although I like the digital temperature readout of this product, as far as I'm concerned, it's DONE. I have since purchased a different thermometer with a stainless-steel tip, and am very happy with it."},{"rating":"2","title":"The greatest folk band ever","review":"Being the biggest Cass elliot fan on the west coast, I was shocked to actually find this collection of works from her band The Big 3, before she became mama cass with the mamas and the papas. This is a great album. I had no idea how great and spectacularly sounding this would be. I saw it in the store and had to get it. If you are a cass fan, you have to get this album. It's amazing to hear the way she sounded before her solo career.

As a big fan of folk music, and of the Mamas and Papas, the decision to buy the albums was easy. I wasn't prepared for how much I actually loved them. The voices blend beautifully in excellent harmony. Anyone who is a fan of Cass Elliott will have to add this CD to their collection. My old albums on FM are all mono, so hearing these songs in great stereo was also a treat, and all the songs on those two LPs are included on this excellent sounding CD.

Wow, THAT makes me want to like her.I've been depressed so I can say that other depressed people aren't that interesting. What we're looking for is the spark between people - if that doesn't exist, what's the point?

It's nothing more than a lame ripoff. I did not care for Stella at all. Sure she suffered a tragedy, but she had a couple who was willing to adopt her. Some kids aren't even that lucky. I don't buy the way her adoptive parents treated her. Especially the stupid explanation that from day one Stella had been glaring at them, judging them. Anyone who adoptd a child, especially one that had been through a tradgedy know that child is going to have some emtional problems. You'd think the adoptive parents would be sympathetic and try to get her pyschiatric help and show her love.

There was barely a plot; all you really know is that she's smart and she wants to kill herself. She never comes across as depressed - the only reason she ever gives for wanting to commit suicide is because she wants people to talk about her once she's gone and she wants people to wonder why they didn't see her suicide coming. Her parents did die when she was young (which could easily lead to depression) but there is only one part of the book where she even seems sad they're gone. She doesn't have any good friends in the beginning, but that doesn't bother her either. She makes one good friend towards the end and the book goes slightly uphill because it seems like something is finally about to happen, but then the author abruptly ends the book before anything can happen.In a nutshell: She spends the entire book doing absolutely nothing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Kill Me Now","review":"I was half way through this book when I realized how much it was draining and depressing me. There are no redeeming qualities in any of the characters; they all seem to be disassociated, inept or flawed in some way. This bright young girl has NO ONE that she can count on to help her and it's awful and sad. The only thing I got out of this book was that it made me glad that 1) I am no longer a teenager and 2) I don't HAVE any teenagers. Is this how they really are nowadays?? I knew that I would be upset with the ending since she would either not kill herself or kill herself. I couldn't bear to read anymore, so I skipped to the ending and yes, I was upset. This is an awful book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Haunting and scary....","review":"I've always been an optimist, despite experiences with anxiety and depression. I've also always believed that when people are incurably sick they should have the right to end their lives the way they want, when they want. I'd never really thought about people that were mentally ill, but after reading this book I was stunned and speechless. If the main character where my friend I would have no idea what to say or do. The author does such a frighteningly good job of conveying the emptiness and inability to attach to anyone or anything that I could think of no other way for the book to end. I kept waiting for something to change, some magic intervention and it didn't come. And although I was sad, I was also profoundly respectful of an author that could not only make me feel for this character but didn't insult the book with a slap-dash happy ending. I didn't see this book coming. It's not really about depression, it's about meaninglessness. This book took a while to shake off."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great book!","review":"I don't get why everyone is obsessed with comparing Stella to Holden. Like the Red Panda and Catcher in the Rye are two diffrent books.

It is a very funny well written book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Only passable","review":"It's a difficult thing to spend 280 pages inside a character's head and still find them dull, but that's the experience of this book. In the hands of a better writer, this attempted revision of Catcher might have been good, maybe even in the hands of this writer five years from now it will be good, but as it stands, I was underwhelmed.The characterization is sketchy, the observations unilluminative, and the point missing.

The result is coffee all over the counter, floor, etc. It has ruined my wood floor!!! I am always careful when I put the carafe in, but it happened anyway.

I had a nice Braun FlavorSelect maker in which you could adjust the temperature of the heat plate to keep coffee warm. But the Braun carafes kept breaking, so thought I'd try something new.Thought this thermal model would keep it warm. NOT!!! Awful coffee maker for the high price. Sure it looks nice (I was taken in by the steel finish), but in every other aspect it [is not good]. No water filter, coffee is cold (even when i pre-heat the carafe with hot water). And finally, after 1 month, the carafe handle came unlodged and the screw is rattling inside the outer shell of the carafe.I just bought the Cuisinart steel model, and it is great. Hot coffee, retro good looks, so many nice features, and a great carafe..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Coffee, Lukewarm Carafe","review":"Bought this unit (stainless-steel) because of the timer feature and because we were tired of keeping a separate \\"thermos\\" carafe on the counter top. The timer works great but we're less satisfied with the carafe. The advertisement leads you to believe it will keep the coffee piping hot for quite a long time but in reality it's luke-warm after 3 to 4 hours. At that point it needs about a 30-second hit in the microwave to get a cup back to the temperature it was at immediately after brewing. And, yes, we know you have to take the carafe off the unit in order for the top to snap shut and trap in the heat.Other than keeping the coffee not-so-warm, we really like it. It's very tall, so it won't fit under the overhead kitchen cabinets but that's not a problem for us. The stainless-steel version is a good-looking unit, so you don't have to hide it after you make the coffee, and it does do what it's supposed to do -- it makes very good coffee."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good idea, poorly executed","review":"A thermal carafe is a nice idea because it keeps the coffee hot without scorching it. But...(1) As others have reported, the handle does indeed come loose over time (about six months) and there seems to be no way to fix it. This is just inexcusable.(2) The timer feature would be a lot more useful if the clock did not reset itself randomly. It seems to be highly sensitive to power spikes, which cause the time *and* the programmed start time to reset. Too often this makes the coffeemaker start itself in the middle of the night instead of the morning, so you get a pot of 8-hour old coffee the next day.(3) The coffee drains through a complicated lid that you cannot really clean. I doubt the carafe will last much longer (the handle seems about ready to fall off completely) but if it did, accumulated gunk inside the lid would get pretty nasty over time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Proceed with EXTREME CAUTION","review":"All:I purchased this piece of \\"eye candy\\" and was grossly dissapointed.

I can set it up to make coffee at night and it is ready for me in the morning. Two little things I don't like are the caraffe and the brewer. First, you need to turn the caraffe for it to pour where as my other one you did not. Second, it is a little difficult to remove the caraffe from the brewer. Overall this is a very good coffee maker. You will be glad you bought it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great coffee maker","review":"I love this coffee maker. I really makes some of the best coffee I have ever had without going to a fancy coffee shop. You don't have to worry about leaving the coffee on a burner. Just take the carafe with you and it will keep the coffee hot for around four hours. I have had no serious mishaps. I did not buy it new, and was able to purchse it online for about half the price. The one thing I can't firgure out is the clock will reset when I run my coffee grinder. I don't know if this is a power surge issue or just gremlins, but it really hasn't upset me very much.

This 229 model looks nice but,it does not have a removable water resevoir, the fill area is small and hard to fill without spilling.

The first time I received it it had been so poorly packaged it was totalled, if that can happen to a coffeemaker. Amazon kindly resent a new one in better packaging but it too was received broken! The tiny bead that the coffee filter swivels on was missing, presumed broken somewhere in transit.

I loved the features and the stainless steel caraf, but the main selling point was because of a reviewer who said she had hers for 8 years. Now, after a little more than 2, the timer has gone out, and there is no way to turn off the pot except to unplug the unit. It has turned into a fire hazard. Not sure what brand to buy now, as my $130 coffee pot will have to go the same way the Black & Decker & Mr Coffee's did in the past.

The simple action of placing and removing the thermal carafe strains the flimsy base; let the base rest on the cord, resulting in less-than-solid footing for the machine, and the base is guaranteed to crack in short order. Its good looks don't last long, either, because the materials are so desperately inferior. I've owned Krups coffeemakers for more than 20 years, but they've lost a loyal customer.

Using the same grounds and water, the coffee taste is very bad, not full flavored at all. Combine the lack of flavor with the fact that coffee is hot enough for only 10 minutes or so after brewing. The lack of heat retention is a problem even with doing all the right things (taking the caraf off of the machine and making sure the top is closed tight). I really don't think it brews hot enough in the first place. Even with my first cup, adding a very slight splash of milk, cools the brew to nearly lukewarm and all cups after that are hopelessly flavorless and cool.

Therefore, often it must be held closed so that the coffee will drain out. Further, it is difficult if not impossible to get the automatic brewing functions to work in absentia as the coffee will remain mired in the filter until the filter holder is manually held closed.The aroma control feature is overrated if not useless.Unbelievable to me that something so expensive could be so dysfunctional.

The coffee does not stay hot unless you charge the carafe with hot water and remove it immediately from the brewer when finished, both of which are too much to do just to make coffee. As with others, I have to microwave coffee that isn't immediately poured into a cup when brewing is finished. The coffee is weak because of the poor design of the basket, which causes hot water to flow through the middle and not seep in the coffee toward the edges. Finally, the automatic shutoff stopped working 14 months after purchase. I shipped the brewer to Krups in New Jersey several weeks ago to repair under an extended warranty and still don't have it back.

Sometimes I have to do it several times before it's on securely and evenly. Pouring from the carafe is messy at times since there is no lip for this function.

It is an object lesson, both for parents and uncles/aunts on the influence of extended family for good or ill. It also happens to star one of my all-time favorite performers, the late John Candy, in one the hilarious and heart-tugging roles for which I think he is best remembered.The only reason I gave this film 4 stars instead of 5 is because of what i consider excessive use of profanity. Some of it is actually appropriate and even clever in the way it's handled with the younger children. But a lot of it is just annoying and makes the writers seem unimaginative.Still, I highly recommend this film."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hysterical!","review":"Uncle Buck is one of the funniest movies around.

Uncle Buck is a Slobby, Unorganized, Middle-Aged Man, and is asked by his brother to stay over his house, so he can take care of his 3 kids, while he and his wife are out of town visiting her sick father. Even though Uncle Buck seems like a careless slob, we get to see his paternal side as we see how he actually really cares for each of these children. Best scenes are the ones where he has to look after the oldest child who is a rebellious teenage girl, also starring in this film is a very young Macaluay Culkin and Gaby Hoffman as the 2 younger children.

Uncle Buck tries to be a light-hearted comedy/drama but I can't seem to find anything special about this stinker. Candy's acting is awesome but even his delightful face can't save this silly farce.

Shouldn't the girlfriend be a \\"plus size\\" as well? That's right - the majority of men don't like big. I forgot.If you like listening to little kids use vulgarity every other sentance, then this is the movie for you and your family.

In this movie, John Candy is the last resort babysitter for his nieces and nephew when his brother and sister-in-law suddenly have to go out of state for a medical emergency on her side of the family. He sort of fumbles a bit at the beginning, but he learns quickly how much he cares about the kids he barely knows and what extremes he will go to just to protect them (especially from mean principals and boyfriends named \\"Bug\\"). In the end he changes his own ways, realizing how he has been alienating those he loves with his reckless gambling.Macaulay Culkin is memorable as Buck's nephew Myles and Laurie Metcalf as the wacky neighbor Marcie. This is a funny movie, but also has some touching moments. Truly a gem for the whole family to enjoy."},{"rating":"2","title":"I just love Uncle Buck!","review":"Of all the movies John Candy made, this is my all-time favorite!!

Daily, they weighed their lives against those of their comrades for whom they were preparing and the harshness of reality against the bond of their word.With enough background and history to provide clear understanding of the parties and resources involved, the book offers a suprisingly detailed look into the lives and hearts of these valient men.

I tried all the suggestions made by the factory. The following year I opened the unit and tried to see what was wrong. I found totally frozen fan bearings. I suppose that the cartriges to repel mosquitoes are corrosive and corroded the bearings. To end my agonies with the unit, I took it to the garbage dump. The unit is cheaply made and therefore unreliable. When it worked, it worked well. I believe it cost me about one dollar per killed mosquito."},{"rating":"1","title":"It works!!

The 2nd time we used it on a far more humid night, we tried to sit on the deck to eat and the mosquitos were swarming and biting us to the point that it was impossible to eat out there and we went inside. The mosquito trap had only about a dozen mosquitos in it from the 2 nights combined.

I figured, Andy C had to share the decks with Hype, but it couldn't be all that bad, could it? I was wrong here. There's simply too many tracks in which Hype has a cheap sound effect played over the track of some guy blasting out, \\"Dj Hype\\" or, \\"Hype in the Mix\\", etc. Way too much shameless self-promotion and not enough emphasis on the music itself.The track selections are okay, but they dont' always flow together well at all.

But like Seabiscuit, getting past a quick initial glance will find a racer with the will of champion.Released in 1978, director Bryan Forbes tackles the sequel to National Velvet with a keen eye on a compelling script. Nanette Newman (a grown-up Velvet)and Tatum O'Neal (her niece) are wonderful in their roles, with the storyline centering on the niece striving to become an Olympic-caliber rider.Sir Anthony Hopkins portrays a veteran trainer who has seen many riders boast about such goals, but end up falling away when the going gets difficult. He has a special eye for talent, though, and there just may be unique potential with this young rider.These are four movies which families can enjoy together, but the life lessons can be appreciated by adults, as much as children."},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic Horse Favorites; 4 Film Favorites","review":"I LOVE International Velvet.

I will just say now that this band is phenomenal live, these guys put on a sweet show. The music was tight, in fact the performance was equal to, if not better than the studio album. After the show I made up my mind to get the album and see if I could speak with the guys-I actually was able to chat a bit! I spoke with Tim Dow & Jeff Garber; I can't express enough how genuinely nice these guys are and appreciative toward fans. Definetly go out and buy the album because they are not only good people/musicians, but the sound of the album is very fresh in today's music environment. I gave the album 4 stars because (1) I expect the next album to be even better, and (2) they don't have 4.79.PS Go see these guys live, Ken Andrews and the crew will not disappoint."},{"rating":"1","title":"not all i'd hoped","review":"With all the good things I heard about this cd i expected it to be MUCH better than it is. I thought a few tracks were worth listening to, Vaporize, for instance. On the whole though I thought the music was repetative, the singing pretty typical and the lyrics like so many others I heard before. I will keep it in my collection for the few songs I like but I won't be listening too it very much. I was disappointed. I have heard good things about the band Failure as well, and was going to check them out, but now I am hesitating. There are cds I have that got worse reviews that I find more inspiring than Year of the Rabbit."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not so fast","review":"Overall this is a decent CD, but it's nothing spectacular. The songs just come off somewhat bland and corporate, not noteworthy at all, and this is coming from someone who likes Linkin Park and Cold.

Save your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dull. With a side order of boring.","review":"Always a sad thing when you witness a gifted artist finally running out of ideas, and this is exactly what the YOTR album represents for Ken Andrews (ex-Failure front-man).Sounding like Failure might have if a crazed burglar had broken into their house and stolen their tunes and energy, this album starts promisingly and then immediately takes a detour via dirge-ville.The CD limps pointlessly from one instantly forgettable song to the next, still adhering to the older-than-sand 'quiet/loud' formula and bringing precisely nothing new to the table.The lyrics (including excruciatingly embarrassing '30-something-man still uses the F-word in songs' moments) would make a love-stricken teenager wince at their banality. Byron it ain't.Frankly rubbish, even for a big Failure fan like me."},{"rating":"2","title":"pretty good","review":"I'm a fan of failure and I was glad to hear about Ken Andrew's new band Year of The Rabbit! I was not dissapointed with this cd at all, there are like 2 songs I skip over but the rest are amazing and well written! My favorite song on the album would probably be \\"Lie Down\\". I wish they would've put \\"Burn\\" on this but all in all it's a good listen!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Ken Andrews and Co. bring it back to the basics...","review":"My personal anticipation of this album had me at my local record store the day this album was released. I was not disappointed. I had seen some live footage of YOTR on their website and had an idea of what to expect. More straightforward than Fantastic Planet and not as caustic as Magnified, this album will please just about any fan of Ken Andrews old work. He has hooked up with some amazing musicians to make this record. Pick this record up, you will NOT be let down."},{"rating":"2","title":"Year of the Rabbit debut album","review":"You can definitely hear Ken Andrews' distinctive production style in this album. There are little musical seques between tracks that keep the music flowing continuously. Definitely not as heavy or \\"grungy\\" as Failure, but definitely original. I can't think of another band out there today that has a similar sound. A few Failure songs that may give you an idea of what Year of the Rabbit sounds like: Another Space Song, Bernie, Solaris, Blank, mostly songs from Fantastic Planet. The enhanced-CD video footage is hardly worth the space, and I would much rather have had more songs on the album instead, but musically this is a stellar performance."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome!","review":"This is a must buy, Ken Andrews does it again with his newest project Year of the Rabbit.

Immediately I had water and good pressure over a hose run of over 100' feet away. I'm very pleased with the ease of using this. I ran it for hours without a hitch. I recommend it.

As many times as I watched it, it always makes me dizzy. I liked the story, although I have to admit I got it from watching this movie the 2nd time. My favorite part is the fight in the showers with abnormally huge \\"Silent Hill Pyramid Guy\\" ripoff Zombie. I always wondered, where have they found such a huge actor. It could be CGI though.

There's no tension, and thus no real horror; it's a superficial action flick with sci-fi elements have have completely fallen off the rails.

It seems the biggest problem is the focus on 3D. Or more accurately stereo... Every shot, every aspect of this film was engineered to take advantage of stereo effects. The characters motions seem robotic and cinematography is gratuitous and without purpose.This is an example of what is wrong with stereo. It can be used well and in a way that elevates the experience. This has shown with Coraline, Avatar, How To Train Your Dragon, and many others. Problem is there is nothing here to elevate.

If you don't play video games and I don't, there will be some disorientation going from one film to the next. Anyway, I enjoyed the visuals of the burning and abandoned city and the humongous prison citadel in the middle of it. The action was non-stop and kept my attention...I was never bored.

The movies are action packed, fun and infinitely re-watchable. I feel the same about the \\"Aliens\\" franchise. As great as these franchises are, they both have one thing in common; one installment that is good but not great and doesn't really do anything except ride the coattails of the other installments. For me, \\"Afterlife\\" was that installment just as Aliens 3 was in that franchise. It was fun but it just seemed to be the first part of a whole. It's as if the movie they wanted to make was to long, so they chopped it in half with that big monsterous zombie axe and released it as a stand alone installment. I gave it a four because it is almost awsome. One thing I hated was the Matrix copycat scenes. Resident Evil is good enough that they don't need to copy someone elses decade old idea.Note: I did not see it in 3D so take that into account when reading my review."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrific.

Turns out one of the transistors in the control module was flakey, so I just wired that lock over to another transistor (each door has its own).

Mr Dawson wrote: \\"My turn had come. My first day of school was January 4, 1996. I was 98 years old...\\" What a heart-felt, inspirational, insightful story on the life of a remarkable man who never felt remarkable. This book has a special place on my shelves. A must read for every high school student taking an American History course. His common sense view of life, his humor, humility, appreciation for what we take for granted are even more valuable now than the day the book was published. It's timeless."},{"rating":"2","title":"104 and still going&#65533;","review":"Imagine being the grandson of slaves, learning how to read at the age of 98 and living through one whole century. A rare life like this is proudly owned by one very lucky man named George Dawson. A writer named Richard Glaubman and George wrote a book together called \\"Life is so Good\\". This book takes you on an amazing adventure through this man's life. He lived all the way back to the awful times of segregation between blacks and whites, and the Depression at the beginning of the 20th century. Fast forward the date all the way to the 21st century, he is still as healthy and active as ever at the age of 104. One of the things I enjoyed the most about Mr. Dawson's book was that he would always do his very best and never gave up even when things were really tough."},{"rating":"2","title":"A supreme lesson in dignity","review":"This book offers extraordinary lessons in human dignity, grace and compassion to readers of any race. Moreover, George Dawson's account of his life is full of history lessons that most of us never had access to in school. The never-ending assaults on the self-esteem of African-Americans, their endurance and grace, and most of all, their forgiveness, are epitomized in his story, as transcribed by Richard Glausman. Some reviewers may forget that this book was written from taped interviews, from stories that came to Mr. Dawson's mind during the necessarily limited number of hours that the author and ghostwriter had together. It was never intended to be a comprehensive document, I believe. In my opinion, the book deserves the highest possible rating for what it contains, not for what it does not."},{"rating":"2","title":"Life is So Good: One Man's Extraordinary Journey throught the 20th century","review":"What an inspiring short novel.

I could hardly put it down (except that life sometimes insists on getting in the way :). Mr. Dawson has seen a lot of stuff, has immense wisdom, and is a great role model for us all, but yet neither he nor Mr. Glaubman are heavy handed at all. There is a light touch, a friendly, subtle touch, to the book, while, magically, it is simultaneously most profound. If you were to read only one book this year, this perhaps should be the one."},{"rating":"2","title":"A \\"good for your soul\\" book","review":"This book is excellent. One reviewer said the book was good but not riveting. This is true, but it is not meant to be riveting. It is a book that humbles you, makes you think, makes you appreciate life and appreciate the lives of others. After reading this book I could better understand my 71-year-old mother's life experiences. She left home at 14 to work but never talked about how she felt about having to do this. This book helped open up a dialogue with her about that experience. This may be like talking to your grandparents (as a previous reviewer stated) but should be read in addition to the talk you have with your grandparents."},{"rating":"2","title":"Life is So Good","review":"This is a wonderful story of a simple but great man who was black and lived for over 100 years. There are many simple lessons to learn from him. It is told from the perspective of a poor black man who has dignity and there is absolutely no whining in this book. He never stopped learning and learned to read when he was 98. Although he was poor all of his life he has a lot of gratitude for the basics. Here is a poor man who had a rich life; likely having to do with his general positive attitude.

When I try to describe the effect segregation had on our part of the world I often find my self short on words. A list of facts (seperate fountains, schools, resrooms) seem strange but don't convey the damage done to both the black and white people of the region. When Mr Dawson tells about his trip to Mexico and his search for the colored water fountain there it hits you how much a part of life (like breathing) the segregation and prjudice was. Mr Dawson never blames those that mistreated him. He says they really didn't see him. How many people do we deal with every day that we really don't see? I really appreciate the memories this brings back of elderly people telling me stories about their life and how the history from books did not always relate to what they found important in their lives.

Mr Dawson's life experiences are invaluable to an America that has become so technology driven that we may forget the struggle 19th century Americans had to survive. It is good to be thankful for what one has. For me reading is like breathing so I'm so glad that he was able to learn to read and have the joy it brings. What may this country have lost because he could not go to school when young. Most likely a brillant contribution to us has been lost.

From the opening bone crushing title track up to the 12th and final song your head will be banging hard. I saw Halford live in Montreal during the Iron Maiden tour and I was amazed at what I was hearing. His songs are pure metal power that makes you bang your head non stop. Although his cd was not out yet when he came to Montreal his songs sounded great live including past great Priest songs such as The Hellion, Electric eye, Breaking the Law, Tyrant etc. On this wonderful night I even caught Bruce Dickindon\`s wrist band at the end of Iron Maiden\`s great live performance. What a night. So for those of you out there who are still not sure about buying Halford\`s Resurrection, let me tell you that this cd is a destined CLASSIC - Guaranteed."},{"rating":"2","title":"The voice is back!","review":"Absolutely amazing!Great riffs,powerful hooks,memorable songs,and THE VOICE blast me back to the days of SCREAMING FOR VENGEANCE!A muther of an album!"},{"rating":"2","title":"THE METAL GOD IS BACK TO SCARE YOUR MOTHER","review":"I was so gald to hear that Rob Halford was going back to his metal roots. Not that Fight and Two were bad or anything, but they just did not give you that same rebellion angst that the Priest did in the early '80's. This is by far his best work in over a decade and a must for any Judas Priest fan. Sorry Tim Owens, buy you should listen to this and see why Rob is the only person who can be the singer for Judas Piest. There simply is not a weak track on the album, and with only one sort of ballad \\"Silent Scream\\", this is definitely a hard rock metal attack. Hopefully, this album along with Zakk Wyldes 'stronger than Death\\" and Pantera's \\"Reinventing\\" the boy bands will go away and never come back. This is a must for anyone who considers themselves a metal or hard rock fan, BUY THIS NOW AND ROCK ON< THANKS ROB!!!!......Best cuts: Locked and Loaded, Silent Screams, Resurrection, Drive!!!!!!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not SO FAST, FOLKS ...","review":"COme on, guys.. I know we all loved Halford when he singed in Priest. We all desired that he would come back to form someday... So, with the release of RESURRECTION, whre Rob finally comes back to metal, people got so excited that forgot to see the obvious flaws in this album. First of all: it was clearly produced, by Roy Z, with the intention of copying the amazing Dickinson's albuns ACCIDENT of BIRTH and THE CHEMMICAL WEDDING. The sound is the same, even Bruce Dickinson appears as guest in one track. Second: the tunes are weak, just that. There one or two exceptions, but most of thema are dumb ( mainly the song DRIVE - it's awful - \\" I've got you under my wheels, baby...\\" What's that ????!! ). Third, the lead breaks. There's not one lead break played with emotion or real mastery of the guitar. Resume: it's a cliched metal album all the way."},{"rating":"1","title":"CAN'T BELIEVE THESE REVIEWS !!!!","review":"I can't believe the greta reviews this album is getting. Listen, I'ma huge Priest / Rob Halford. I admit I felt chills into my spine when I bought RESSURECTION and heard Halford singing and screaming in top notch form after such a long time !! But this is an album you enjoy only once, the first or second time you listen to it. Then, it becomes clear how the songs here loose their appela fastly, you realize the album is boring, flat, the guitars are uninspired, the lyrics so silly (not even in Judas the lyurics were so silly!!!), the overall sound seems \\"mass-produced\\", with no feel or heart. And people came to me saying this is \\"THE BEST METAL ALBUM OF 2001...?\\"\\"\\" Are you joking guys. Please, learn to observe the difference between the admiration for a singer from the quality of his work !!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"What a loss !","review":"The days of Judas Priest with 'Pain Killer' and/or 'Ram it down' are clearly missing out of this !. Rob has made it clear that he is getting OLD as he hardly brings that powerfull 'screaming-type' into any of the songs. - You'll find yourself skipping tracks very quickly as you tend to get bored while listening to ANY track on this CD - I think the fact that his oth Priest band members aren't with him this makes for a VERY POOR SHOW. - Pity ! - I still maintain that Pain Killer is his best work. ;-)"},{"rating":"2","title":"A very good metal album","review":"This album reminds me of CHemical Wedding with Bruce Dickinson in his solo career.

If you like Judas Priest is a must as its an album that you will hear for many times ."},{"rating":"2","title":"Judas Priest should sound like this!!!","review":"This is the CD that Judas Priest should have recorded instead of \\"Jugulator\\" and \\"Demolition\\". Not that those are bad, but they just can't compare to this. This one has got a lot of catchy & melodic (but not wimpy) tunes. These songs bring one back to Priest's \\"Screaming for Vengeance\\" & \\"British Steel\\". There's hardly a bad track on it. My personal favorites are the opening track \\"Resurrection\\", \\"Made In Hell\\", the somewhat lighter \\"Nightfall\\", \\"Silent Screams\\", which starts out slower, then halfway through really gets crankin', \\"The One You Love To Hate\\" (Rob's duet with Maiden's Bruce Dickinson) and finally, \\"Slow Down\\", not a fast one, but one of his best nevertheless. Slowing down is obviously something that hasn't happened to him. His voice is in it's prime on the whole disc. But someone is always going to criticze it. But who cares?! Ignore those losers! Just buy this and turn it all the way up. It's awesome!"},{"rating":"2","title":"All hail the Metallion!","review":"Both Rob Halford and Bruce Dickinson went through a period of experimentation,sailing the difficult and often confused musical waters of the mid-nineties.The good news is that both had the good sense of returning to what they do best,i.e.,ROCK! This album is a hard hitting return to the glory days of Priest while keeping an eye on the present.Having surrounded himself with a most competent band of young and diverse talents,Mr.Halford proceeded to deliver the goods like only he can-just one listen to his new work will suffice. Welcome back,Rob!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Judas Who?","review":"This album kicks ass! If you are a Metal Head then GO OUT AND BUY THIS ALBUM! Well go on! Stop reading this silly review and pony up the dough for the best Judas Priest album they never made. This album picks up where JP's \\"Painkiller\\" left off and never looks back. Halford's post Judas Priest career has had its highs(Fight: War of Words), middles(Fight: Small Deadly Space) and lows(2 or Two?), but Resurrection is the new pinnacle of his career. The energy is undeniable and there is not one bad song to be found on this album. For older metal acts searching for relevance(Metallica, anyone?), this album is a demonstration on how you got hit it big in the first place. So for all you metal groups and fans out there, THIS IS HOW YOU DO METAL!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The BEST METAL album since Painkiller","review":"This album holds the essence of TRUE HEAVY METAL better than literally anything since 1991's Painkiller. This simply IS Metal, sung by the only man who embodies the Metal spirit. While all of his contemporaries have lost what vocal talents they had in their youth, Rob's voice is unbelievably as strong as it was 20, 30 years ago. You need proof? Check out \\"Silent Screams\\".Rob put together an excellent line-up here, especially the drummer who is absolutely fantastic. I'm just glad he didn't rehire those dweebs from Fight.As a whole this is pure METAL from tip to tail; one of those few albums that cannot possibly be better."},{"rating":"2","title":"At last...","review":"This album is what the 'Jugulator' album of Judas Priest should have been! Rob Halford remains a skilled vocalist who never seems to give in on power."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best Metal CD of 2000!","review":"RESURRECTION is, quite simply, the best album Rob Halford has done since Judas Priest's SCREAMING FOR VENGEANCE. The production of Roy Z (who did Bruce Dickinson's outstanding ACCIDENT OF BIRTH) is excellent, as are the songs he co-wrote with Halford for the album (Halford also co-wrote tracks with Bob Marlette, who produced Black Sabbath's REUNION album). Combining the power of Priest's PAINKILLER with the hooks and melodic sense of SCREAMING FOR VENGEANCE, RESURRECTION is classic Halford. Standout tracks include the Title Track, \\"Made In Hell,\\" \\"Locked And Loaded,\\" and the outstanding \\"duet\\" with Bruce Dickinson, \\"The One You Love To Hate\\" (a how-to lesson in Heavy Metal singing if there ever was one). If you like Metal with strong melodies and hooks, while still being Heavy, this album is for you. -(and if you like this one, check out Bruce Dickinson's ACCIDENT OF BIRTH, Iron Maiden's BRAVE NEW WORLD, and Armored Saint's REVELATION and SYMBOL OF SALVATION CD's)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Return of the Metal God","review":"The first thing that comes out of your speakers is a piercing scream that brings a smile to your dial. Then it's repeated. This albums first two tracks absolutely rip, both Resurrection and Made In Hell somehow being deeply personal diatribes yet also having an almost universal appeal. This album is worth buying for these two tracks alone.The standard does drop a touch after that but nobody is likely to write a whole album of face melters like the first two tracks. Other highpoints would be Locked and Loaded, The One You Love to Hate and perhaps Nightfall for something different.This is a rousing return to form, in fact it's an album that can be enjoyed by general metal fans and not just the Judas Priest fan who is the person most likely to read this review. A very very fine album from someone who genuinely cares about craft and it's also an album that really benefits from having another great production job by Roy Z."},{"rating":"2","title":"VERY GOOD","review":"This is really a great metal album. Except for the song \\" DRIVE \\" ( which has the dubious merit of having one of the silliest lyrics ever written by a rock band !! )each track is a thunderous journey into metal's best. This Cd seems more like a follow-up to Bruce Dickinson's amazing twin albuns, \\" ACCIDENT OF BIRTH \\" and \\" THE CHEMICAL WEDDING \\". To make proof of it, the producer is guitarrist Roy Z, who also contributed in a lot of the songwriting.

This is ultimate cheese album...imagine Every 80's Judas Priest album combined with newer \\"fantasy\\" metal bands. The lyrics are all about being a metalhead, loud music ect... It's pretty lame. But the music is definetely cool!The songs hit hard and are just what the music world needs right now. I saw these guys live with Iron Maiden, and they ROCKED!! Man, these songs sound 143,532 times better live than on the album. These are very good musicians, and very good performers as well.Final Verdict: It rocks buy it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Light and funny","review":"Being a huge Dave Barry fan, I had to read this book, and I was not disappointed. The book is a collection of columns he wrote, mostly from the early 1990's; presumably, these are his funniest and the ones that got the most responses from readers. And you'd be surprised the kind of responses he gets from readers, some of whom can't seem to grasp that Dave's columns are supposed to be funny.I, unlike those readers, had no trouble finding the humor in this book. I've probably read it 100 times, and parts of it still crack me up. He writes mostly about unusual news stories sent in by \\"alert readers\\" regarding exploding toilets and other such oddities. Its format-short essays of about 2 or 3 pages each-makes it ideal for people with short attention spans, but others will enjoy it too. If you've never read a Dave Barry book, you need to start, and I'm guessing this one will help get you hooked."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another hit from Barry; this man does not disappoint","review":"I can read three or four Dave Barry books in a row before I need to take a break.

Highlights include the two-part \\"Worst Songs Ever Recorded\\" and the stand-out expose on a UFO situation in Gulf Breeze, Florida."},{"rating":"1","title":"not my style","review":"Sorry, my husband and I listened to this for quite a bit and did not find it funny at all and didn't even want to continue listening to it, it just seemed long and boring--I guess we have a different sense of humor than most of the other reviewers."},{"rating":"1","title":"yeap, borring as hell I am not making this up also.","review":"I learn from my experience if only a handful of people rated 5 stars don't believe it. I only read 15% of this book, and it is really really borring. I didn't laugh one bit. This book say if I am not laughing than I don't have humor. That's a lame excuse for a boring book. If this is really 5 stars, I can write a 10 stars book for people to laugh at intelligent and witty jokes, not stupid unlaughable joke like this book. But, Amazon is way cool, 5 stars bookstore. I have bought quite a few books (> 50) at Amazon, and I will continue to buy it. Recommend: I did laugh with for better or for worst by Lynn Johnston. Clean and witty whole some family jokes. Judy Carter is also very funny. These two ladies are way cool !"},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome!","review":"If you call yourself an MxPx fan, than you already have this. If you don't, GET IT NOW!!

One of Grisham's better novels. A good read.","review":"This is one of Grisham's better novels. The suspence and action kept you interested and quickly turning every page. I liked it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"One of the worst novels from Grisham","review":"The problem with Grisham is that his novels are either very strong or very weak. I've read 10 or so, and the rule has never failed. This is one of the lousy ones, right from the outset. The whole thing is unloaded on you like a ton of bricks, in a clumsy and forced manner. The situations, the characters, the conversations have no credibility whatsoever. I cannot believe that such drivel comes from the same writer whose magical pen produced classic thrillers and political suspense novels. The stylish writing and the typical wit you've come to expect from Grisham are just not there."},{"rating":"1","title":"Readerwriter","review":"Grisham's copy editor must have been asleep at the wheel on this book. I'm about 30 pages into the story, not too impressed at this point, although it is a page turner, until I stumbled on one narrative passage on page 12: \\"heavy man with the red face was running through the weeds, holding on to the car and growling.\\" Can anyone say dangling participle? How does one run through the weeds while holding on to a car? That's some trick. He could have shuffled, side stepped, or what have you, but run? I mean, this is Grisham for God's sake. I would assume that he'd have better copy than this, not to mention better sense than to write such grammatically incorrect sentence."},{"rating":"1","title":"can someone explain whats so great?","review":"I read this book and at first I was interested as to what he was going to do, but as it dragged on it got a little dull. The reason it got such a low rating was b/c the entire book is building up to a climax but there is no surprise at the end. Couldnt he be a bit more creative than just saying that Mark goes with the FBI? What about all those threats that the Mafia will kill him anyways? I mean that was the WHOLE book! SHEESH!"},{"rating":"1","title":"wrong genre, Grisham","review":"Come on, now. A kid goes into shock for the entire length of the novel,just because he saw his big brother in a precarios situation? What kind of stuff is this kid made of? Does he wet his pants whenhe gets a bad report card? This and many other elements of The Client are the makings of a great fairy tale. but not serious fiction. The only reason I stayed with this one was to see if Cinderella and Snow White would make appearances."},{"rating":"1","title":"The plot is fatally flawed, and the hero is insufferable.","review":"This book, like most of Grisham's books, is based on an utterly asinine premise. A little kid learns a secret and the mob doesn't want him to tell. The protagonist -- an insufferably precocious and sensitive 11 year old -- believes that if he does't tell, the mob won't kill him. Its absurd. So long as he keeps the secret, the mob has a good reason to kill him. This book was no surprise -- Grisham's other books, most notably The Brief, are similarly flawed. The story is contrived, the prose is mundane, and the ending is predictable."},{"rating":"1","title":"You'll be mad if you read this book","review":"Caveat: I'm not a huge Grisham fan, so I'm sure some bias has slipped in here. But I think this book is just awful. While his other books are at least entertaining, this thing dies quickly after a semi-decent premise. The biggest problem is that there's only about 50 pages worth of story, and a writer with his minimal powers of description can't get away with hundreds of pages of fluff. Don't read this book--read Presumed Innocent instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horribly boring.The only one laughing is Mr. Grisham...all the way to the bank!","review":"I'm three quarters through this. It's been a trial (pardon the pun) just getting this far. It's so unbelievable. An 11 yr old who can out smart FBI officials? Sure. A lawyer out just 4 yrs, with balls of steel? OOOOkayyy! Just give your readers a break John...this is dreadful! I enjoyed The Partner(except the ending of course- that hurt), and I also liked reading The Runaway Jury (lots of fun there), but this is just slow, painful and I think before the end I'm going to have to get myself a stiff drink...anything to help me wade through these last few chapters."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Client fails to inspire","review":"The Client's story is a new twist on the contemporary thriller. The main protagonists are an 11 year old child with the wisdom of a cantankerous old man and a 52 year old female attorney who fights dirty to help society's most disadvantaged.A good, but uninspiring read with a lousy finish. Do they get the body? You will never know?"},{"rating":"2","title":"A 11yr. old, a lawyer and the Mafia","review":"If one was to go merely by the reviews online this book would have been overlooked. This book has everything a 'good book' should have. The book opens up with Mark, a 11 year old boy who is in the woods smoking with his younger brother, Rick. They see a black car pull up and watch in suspense as a man attempts to committ suicide. You have to get this book to find out the whole story. I loved it from the beginning to the end! I most definitely will be reading more books by him.Highly recommend!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Just incredible","review":"\\"Incredible\\" is the only word that comes to my mind describing this book. I think it's Grisham's best book so far. Though English is not my native language, I found it amazing to enter the world of little Mark Sway and go through his \\"nightmare \\" together with him. Originally reading this book was meant as a mean of improvement of my English.

Any reader who is interested in murder trials, this is a great book to read. There is a suiside witnessed by a young child. He then ends up being the only person to testify aginst the killer. Myself, I enjoyed this book and I strongly recomend that anyone who gets a chance to read it their self."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best yet!!!!","review":"Once I started, I could not stop! I would read it again. Loved this one!!! It's a must read! From start to finish, Grisham layed out the guidelines for the stunning conclusion. That was all I read for two weeks. Never have I been so impressed."},{"rating":"2","title":"You can feel the emotions...","review":"What more can I say about this book that hasn't been wrote in some of the other reviews? I want to echo the incredible way that John is able to build characters that you have a relationship with. I felt the pain and somehow related to his story and why he had to seek safety in his lawyer.This story kept you wondering what was around the next corner and how it would end. John does not let you down with a sad ending, and keeps you on the edge of your seat. Near the end I thought he was going to let the Mafia have its day and make for a real twist and ending that you would not expect (in fact I was rooting for the bad guy for some reason). Anyway, the family fly's off save and sound; as safe as the FBI can keep you.Hope I did not give too much away. You will enjoy the quick and easy read that just may keep you up at night. Save some time, because you will want to quickly finish this book and see what happens."},{"rating":"1","title":"Child character has no brain.","review":"Grisham books are great - I've read many - but this one has a serious problem.The main character, Mark Sway, does the unthinkable.Like J. Weavers' earlier review...I kept thinking to myself, kid (Mark Sway) you're an idiot. Tell anyone and everyone where the body is, then no one will hunt you down.But I guess if you can accept him (ridiculously) keeping the secret to himself, then it all goes down fine.Must be the movie was better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesnt look like Grisham at his best","review":"I remember reading \\"The Chamber\\" distinctly. Somehow, this book doesnt even near that standard. The story line is vague with unnecessary twists and turns.

Great movie! The book is so far much better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Predictable Grisham","review":"Like other reviewers, I was very disappointed with this very predictable \\"formula\\" book from John Grisham, who has certainly lost his edge, teaming up with unknown writers. The book dragged on and on and I found myself unabsorbed and uncaring about the outcome, which I could have predicted from page one. I managed to plow my way through the book, not really caring about the characters or the plot. The first fifty pages were the only ones worth reading and the book finished the way you knew it would all along. I think that this is the last Grisham book I will waste my time reading. Very disappointing!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Read","review":"This book was well written, Grisham creating a wonderful page turner full of suspense and mystery. But the book got boring at parts, for instance, the scenario when the lawyers gathered seemed rather dry. But the fact that I read this at 12 may add to that emotion. I suppose that it was necessary, and it is rather hard to make lawyers seem interesting. (I should know, my dad is probably the most boring person to grace this planet. And he just happens to be a lawyer. Coincidence? I think not!) Anyway, I recommend this book to anyone, but be prepared for some heavy reading."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another Great Thriller","review":"The Client was a very good book. The reason I gave this book a four star rating is because it kept me wanting to read the book and not put it down. Another reason is because Grisham related teenagers very well to this book. The two boys in this book had to face a challenge that teens all over the world have to face everyday."},{"rating":"2","title":"A PAGE TURNER THAT KEEPS YOU UP ALL NIGHT!","review":"I've been asked by my Dad on numerous occasions to put the book down and go to sleep. The book really is that good, it keeps you hooked from page 1 to page 560+. The characters are very real and you feel you know them. The plot is simple but makes for a very good read. Just in case you wonder, I am 13 years old and despite this, I enjoyed the book immensely. This is my first John Grisham novel and I look forward to reading many more of his books."},{"rating":"2","title":"Teriffic suspense novel","review":"The Client, by J. Grisham was a terrific suspense novel. You actually feel like you're living in Mark's, the client's, shoes throughout the novel by the way Grisham intelligently words the book.

Starts out with a suicide and follows a young kid through all the twist and turns of a murder. You see how a kid handles knowing something he shouldn't know and being pressured by the FBI to tell and being threatened by the Mafia to stay quiet. At the end is the classic John Grisham action part followed by a cliffhanger ending that leaves you to wonder what happened to Mark Sway. All over it is a great book that I would recommend to any people that enjoy legal thrillers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Engrossing, Entertaining, and Emotional. What else do you want?","review":"THE CLIENT is one of my favorite books. It is superbly entertaining and immensely engrossing book that you aren't able to put down at all. Plus, it has constant emotional depth that leads to the unexpectedly tear-jerking ending.I won't tell you about the plot, since you can get that elsewhere. I'm writing this so you will read this book.Many of the complaints from other customers are about the fact that this book seems made to film. True, it does, but it's not anywhere near the point to where it lacks any depth. The characters are perfectly developed, and the dialouge is snappy and smart. Every part of the book is utterly thrilling and the entire 566 page book is a fast, enjoyable ride. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Even better than the movie!","review":"Yes I know the book came before the film, but I happened to read the book after watching it on the big screen.

The plot was better too."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not good in J.Grisham scale","review":"As having read J.Grisham's The Runaway Jury and The Rainmaker before this title, I can't say that this novel has given me the same excitement and thrill which author's other titles gave. I am still trying to come to the end of the book just to have finished the book; not that I enjoy. It's not enjoyable while knowing how the story is going to end.

The plot has numerous barely-believable twists, the most ridiculous of which is the protagonist's attorney assisting him in eluding authorities after escaping a juvenile detention facility. Said lawyer then drives from Memphis to New Orleans with the little delinquent in her car basically at the kid's mere suggestion. Absurd! No attorney in his/her right mind would do such a thing!The \\"storybook ending\\" just prior to the boarding of the FBI Director's private jet is implausible as well as gratuitously sappy. Also, I highly doubt that the FBI Director gets personally involved in many -- if any -- such cases.Thankfully, I paid only 25 cents for this book in paperback form at a garage sale 2 weeks ago. Given that it's written at about a 4th-grade reading level (and I have no children), it'll make good fireplace kindling next fall.First Grisham = LAST Grisham."},{"rating":"1","title":"avoid this","review":"The book started out great and I had high hopes. Soon though, it went quickly downhill - what a shame. Mr. Grisham undoubtedly has talent (read 'The Firm') but unfortunatly it's obvious he's writing within the constraints of a deadline. After the first few chapters, the story and quality quickly falls apart. Come on, an 11 year-old kid outwitting the mob, not mention getting a lawyer out of danger ? Too unbelievable. Also, his brother goes into a coma because he witnessed someone killing themself ? How can anyone believe this let alone be entertained by it ? I realize it's fiction but there are limits as to what we can be expected to believe. 'The Firm' was a pretty good book but this one was pure cr***p ! Grisham should rethink his career and decide if money is more important than self-respect - he's lost mine."},{"rating":"2","title":"GRISHAM IS THE GREATEST LEGAL WRITER OF OUR TIME!","review":"John Grisham is my favorite author. He is without a doubt THE BEST, not one of the best but THE VERY BEST legal thriller writer of our time! Anyone who can read will like this book! If you like science-fiction, techno-thrillers, or horror, it doesn't matter! Try this book right now! I guarantee that after reading just the first chapter you will be hooked! It is great! This is the first Grisham book I read and the first chapter alone convinced me that he is the best!"},{"rating":"2","title":"WOW!","review":"This was the first book that I read by Grisham. It kept my interest every step of the way. The legal information was easy to understand and limited enough to keep my interest.

A black judge and a woman lawyer, the heroes of this deplorable novel, combine to help this brat obstruct justice by withholding this information from the FBI. Their motives? First, to make life hard for the FBI, the villains of the piece. Secondly, to extort as much as possible from the FBI and taxpayers in return from the information on behalf of the teenager and his family. Add boredom and preposterous plotting and you got the substance of the novel. Don't waste your time on it."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Cleint","review":"This book was excellent, with its good plot and good climax. The characters were very real. The story took place in Louisiana with a story about kids that witnessed a suicide and thought the mafia was after them. The characters were Mark, Ricky, Dian, Jerome and doctor green. Mark and Ricky were walking in the to have a cigarette. After about 5 mins. A black Lincoln pulls up and stops about 40 ft from were the boys are sitting and stopped. Mark and Ricky were about to run when Mark said let's stay here and see what's going to happen."},{"rating":"1","title":"I \\"misplaced\\" this \\"book\\" after 50 pages... Absolute trash.","review":"We all know well that Grisham has Hollywood in mind when writing novels. But does he have to be so conspicuous about it? I mean, com'on -- this book had no plot; it was more a screenplay than a novel. The characters were not believable (a 9-year old kid cannot do those things... Except maybe in Hollywood). Basically what I remember from this book was a great deal of senseless, trivial dialogue, a boring story line, and unrealistic situations."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unbeleivable","review":"What silly, outrageous book.

The \\"good guy\\" is an 11 year old boy, who won't talk about what he knows. The story is completely ridiculous and the boy's attorney makes everything overly complicated.

I had never read any Grisham but there isn't much english selection in German book stores. Frankly, I was unimpressed. The story is halfway decent, but Grisham has no identifiable style to speak of. It reads like a 3rd grade essay on the pyramids. The characterization is forced and contrived. There's not one character with any depth, and even their names are ridiculous. As a study abroad student I can't help but feel ashamed that our country somehow made this book a bestseller. If you have a reading level above that of a 10 year old, pick up a John Irving novel, or even a Harry Potter book! Save yourself from the mind-numbing nothingness that is John Grisham."},{"rating":"2","title":"My first Grisham Novel","review":"John Grisham really hooked me into this story from the beginning with two boys just doing boy things at their age like sneaking into the woods and smoking.

When the boy finally escapes a chain of horrific events happen to the boy, his mother, and his brother. The FBI wants information and the MOB wants him to shut up. What happens next?

If you have not read this book you definately can't pass a judgement on the author, get it and read it, dont re-read it or read between the lines, that might prove to be injurious to the author's sales graph."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just Okay","review":"This book started out good. The middle was okay. And the ending was stupid.To Grisham's credit, he did manage to portray an 11 year-old kid pretty accurately. Mark was constantly thinking back to TV and movies he has seen for advice.I am a pretty big Grisham fan, but this is certainly not him at his best. If you are looking for a good Grisham novel involving the mob then read The Firm.

I don't mind stereotypes and ham acting (see, I keep thinking about his books as movies) but I want some thrill and suspense to compensate.

Halfway through the book I decided to quickly read ahead and see how it finished and I'm glad I didn't waste more time on it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Riddled with logical inconsistencies.","review":"I don't think Grisham really thought too much when he wrote this book. I can't specifically discuss the many lapses of logic in the story line without giving away the plot. Suffice it to say that I found the story that Grisham wove to be most unrealistic, and frankly, downright silly. He paints Mark as a clever, wise beyond his years 11-year-old, yet some of Mark's reasoning towards the end of the book is weak even for a typical 11-year-old. He paints Reggie as a woman who is wise in the ways of the world, yet she makes errors of judgment that in the real world would get her disbarred, and probably land her in jail.All in all, a big disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"So-So- nothing to write home about","review":"This book had an explosive start and then fizzled out. I was hoping for a big, unpredictable ending but the ending was no surprise. Several aspects of the story are left unfinished at the end and I was hoping more details about what happened to some of the other people would be presented. The story takes so long (566 pages) just to get to the end, and then it all gets wrapped up too fast. I've read 4 other grisham books and I put this one ranked #4 out of the 5 I read. (#1 A Time to Kill, #2 the Firm, #3 The Partner, #4 Client, #5 The Testament)"},{"rating":"1","title":"The Client","review":"Seems thrown together by Grisham to capitalize on the popularity of his earlier books, to which I would asign an average of 4.5 stars.

But most or the characters in the book (at least the main ones)are very unrealistic. The main character of an 11 year old child is absolutely rubbish. His lawyer a 52 year old lady behaves a no sane human being would. If u are looking for even a bit of substance or a pinch or relaity then dont even look at the book.

I think Reggie Love is one of the best characters John Grisham has created. I'd love to see her again sometime. This story doesn't quite measure up to The Firm, but it is still a quick, exciting read that still manages to make you think at the same time. Who knows if 200 years from now if Grisham would be considered one of the \\"classic\\" writers, but for now he's enjoyable."},{"rating":"1","title":"FAST PACED, BUT A DUMB STORY","review":"THE WEAKEST OF ALL GRISHAM'S BOOKS.

The characters are horribly boring, the writing is boring, the plot is boring, you know what the whole book was boring.I didn't care for one person in this book. It was a chore to finish this book. I will say that it was less a chore than watching the film though. I didn't care what the ending was. I continued to read this book our of respect for Grisham's previous novels. I would not recommend this to anyone. This is by far the worst of all his novels. It is close between this and The Chamber, but at least JG attempted to be thought provoking in The Chamber.

Sure, every once in a while you can see things in ads, and sometimes they may have been placed there intentionally, but there is no evidence whatsoever that these subliminals have any effect on behavior. If Key had a doctorate in psychology rather than in journalism (or whatever) he would not write such malarkey. well, maybe he would since this has certainly been lucrative for him.If you want to find out the truth about subliminal stimuli, read \\"In the Mind's Eye: Enhancing Human Performance\\"which was written by the National Research Council (National Academy Press). Now, have you found the hidden message in this review? If not, I'll be blunt: DON'T BELIEVE EVERYTHING YOU READ!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Soap Opera of Subliminal","review":"This book is the most unique of all of Key's books.

From Gun Shot Wounds, to a Moter cycle accident, Caroline B. Cooney's Emergency Room was action packed.

This is definitely a must have book for anyone who likes action packed books!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent book!!!!!!!!!","review":"I read this book a few months ago and was attached to it. I finished it in less then a week. The book gives an inside look to what really happens inside an ER, and it gives many different points of view, 2 volunteers and I think 3 patients.

If you have the means I highly recomend picking one up!!!!!! Exellent, Magnifisent, Terrific"},{"rating":"2","title":"Filled with suspense and action.","review":"I like this book a lot because it gives you an idea of what the ER is really like. If you like medical things then I think that this book would intrest you. There were a few things that I didn't like and that was how it was so jumpy. It can get confusing at times because they jump from past to present frequently. It also doesn't follow up on the condition of the patients which is very frustrating but if you have a good imagination, then this is for you. Overall, a very well written book."},{"rating":"2","title":"This book is thrilling exciting and full of surprises.","review":"Emergency Room is an excellent because it keeps the reader in suspense throughout the whole book such as when one of the interns friends is shot,when a young boy is killed in a motorcylce accident, and worst of all one of the interns finds herself face to face with something she hasn't faced in years."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent","review":"Good bridge to keep your child sharp during the summer between grades.

The grade 4-5 book has a nice balance of busy work and thought provoking writing assignments. The structure of the book seems to take the pressure off of me, so I don't feel like I am hounding them to do their work.

Do you know what a drive-in theater is? Anyway, I have the VHS tape of this movie and have watched it 3 or 4 times over the years. It's a fascinating sci-fi movie with very good special effects (weird-looking monsters, miniature aliens, UFO's,etc.) There is a scene where the husband & wife are taking a leisurely stroll through the desert at night. Suddenly, some lights start coming toward them. Then 2 UFOs fly directly over their heads within 20 feet or so. That scene is awesome! I re-played that scene several times just so I could experience the impact of it. The movie has a great \\"presence\\". What I mean is....it takes you on an adventure into the desert of the American Southwest and holds your attention.

They shipped quickly and I now have a new provider :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great item at a low price","review":"After reading some of the reviews I was a little hesitant to purchase, but I am glad I did get it. The tool worked flawlessly. I had my watch opened in two minutes from opening the tool. Very easy to figure out. The only hard part was finding a store that carried the replacement battery, Walmart came through with it. I would recommend this product and seller."},{"rating":"1","title":"Almost worthless...picture shown, not what you get","review":"Just received it. Boy was I disappointed! The product comes in a very very poorly constructed wooden box that has Chinese characters on the top. I didnt even know that that type of wood existed. Must have come from a sick tree. The box top and bottom don't line up well. The tool itself comes covered in oil to prevent rusting. Unfortunately, so did everything else. The opener is very flimsy. All of sockets that come with the tool are all about the same size. Resembles something you would buy in Chinatown. On a good note, I was able to use it to open the watch casing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great tool for the price and worked well","review":"Needed to remove the back of my diver watches, so I got this tool since it had a nice yellow box. Waterproof watches are tricky and need these special caseback opener tools to grip the edges. This tool was beyond my expectations... it was very high quality unlike some other versions from other merchants. The box has a nice holder for all the little bits so I can store it safely. Also, with the yellow box, I'll easily find it anywhere. I'm sure this tool will last for years. The price was right too at under $15, it can't be beat. Last time I got a similar tool and it was all rusty and had no box, which cost me $10, glad to spend an extra $5 for something I plan to keep for years."},{"rating":"1","title":"one hole does not hold the clamp","review":"One of the holes is kind of loose.

In oder to use it, I have to leave this wrench up side down and have the watch on top of it. The dial which is for adjusting the size was not giving a tight grip.

Susannah and Gaaron were very likeable characters. Romance readers will probably want more than the gentle double romance in it. Shinn is just unique. I loved a scene early in this book when Gaaron joins a group to sing and they all discover they have completementary voices. It was a happy moment -- cheered me up, too. There are many scenes like this, making the world of Samaria a nice one to explore."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not her best","review":"I honestly enjoyed Ms. Shinn's Samaria series. The plots were interesting, and the characters varied, although she started slipping after Archangel, they were still readable. Angelica is just terrible, and took way too long to accomplish its goal which was to get Gaaron and Susannah together. As hard as I tried I could barely finish and finally just skipped to the ending in frustration. Before reading this I was tempted to pick up Angel Seeker, I doubt I will now. Lif is too short to read boring books."},{"rating":"1","title":"Again?","review":"I love Sharon Shinn, LOVED every book she's written including the first three books in this continuing series. Halfway through ANGELICA I found myself wondering if I'd accidentally bought one of them over again. It's the same basic idea repackaged, though, this time with less insightful social commentary and more drawn-out chapters that revolve around the less enthrawling (and sometimes annoying) supporting characters. I did read the whole book so I can't complain to much, I guess. But when I'm paying top dollar for a hardcover from an author I've grown to ADORE, I suppose I expect progression and not reiteration. The cynical part of me wonders if she is padding ANGELICA in order to stretch the story line into a second trilogy."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointment","review":"This book is just okay for me. The characters are not as engaging as other characters in Shinn's previous books. The storyline is basically about a marriage of convenience between two characters, a plotline that has been written before in 'Archangel'. Unfortunately the book doesn't work out quite as well. Mainly because Gaaron and Susannah spend the majority of their time apart from each other doing their own thing that I find it very hard to believe these two manage to fall in love with each other in the end. The secondary female character, Miriam, is an annoying, spoiled, selfish, whiny brat that I don't care much to read about. The conclusion of the mystery is not much of a conclusion either. All in all, a disappointing read to me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Time For A Change!","review":"Sharon Shinn, one of my favorite authors, usually provides an intelligent and entertaining view of her wonderfully imaginative worlds. She introduced us to Samaria (a world colonized by Terrans so long ago, no one remembers that they're a colony) in \\"Archangel\\", a very good book. That was 5 books ago, and it is long past time to leave Samaria and open up fresh story lines. I know she can do it, because she has, beautifully, in \\"Summers at Castle Auburn\\" and in \\"Wrapt in Crystal.\\" But, in Angelica, Shinn has simply plagiarized herself. This story line is done, and past done. If you've never read Shinn, you'll enjoy this book, because you won't know any better. But what's great is you can then go on to others much more worthy of a first rate author. I give \\"Angelica\\" 2 stars only because I'm comparing it to other Shinn novels."},{"rating":"1","title":"Probably good for real Samaria fans","review":"Sharon Shinn's world of Samaria was an interesting concept in Archangel, and her blend of romance and SF did pretty well for the first few books. I think it's pretty much run its course by now. I won't bother to re-summarize the plot here, others have done it well already. I will say that there's nothing new here to keep us interested in this world. Shinn spends a lot of time setting up the characters and the danger they're in, but solves it in an unsatisfying rush at the end. And while these books can be read as stand-alones, unless you've read at least the first two you'll be totally confused by the ending. I like Shinn's characters and think she has a nice ear for dialogue and good skills in character-building, but she needs a new idea for this world. Die-hard Samaria fans will be happy to spend more time here, and I will give her next book a chance, but I hope it has more to offer than Angelica."},{"rating":"2","title":"4 stars to the author, 0 stars for the actual networks/executives","review":"In a fairly entertaining behind-the-scenes account of the major US networks' programming decisions, the author provides a glimpse of the inner workings of TV executives (and intentionally or not, doesn't necessarily show them to be geniuses). The initial discussions surrounding Survivor's introduction is perhaps the better written part of the book. Past blunders (always in hindsight, though) by all the major networks as discussed by the author is an interesting read as well. The \\"characters\\" themselves seem particularly myopic and is very difficult to believe these people shape what the rest of the world gets to watch on television. The book itself is well-written in an easy-going narrative style. A good read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Politics and luck","review":"This was a really fascinating book. It started off slowly (the first pages were tedious) and the writing is disjointed. The author jumps from time period to time period and network to network almost convulsively. You'll be reading about NBC in 2004 and then next thing you know it's ABC in 2000 and then back to CBS in 2005.That said, the story is compelling: networks passing on shows like Desperate Housewives, Simon Cowell doing American Idol in the hope of discovering talent for his record company. Careers depend on the ability to predict what the public will watch, and what they will and won't watch isn't as obvious as one might think, even to people in the business with years of experience.If you have any interest in television, personal politics, or the fallibilities of corporate execs, this is an interesting read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Insider's look at network TV","review":"A highly readable and thorough survey of the current state of affairs in network television programming. The author was able to interview major industry figures who provide a rare insider's perspective. See how some of the few hit shows to emerge in recent years, like \\"Survivor\\" and \\"Desperate Housewives,\\" did so almost *despite* the so-called expertise of network programmers. For anyone wondering where network television is going next, this is a worthwhile read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Who cares?","review":"The problem with this book for a general audience-that is, anyone who doesn't work in or want to work in television-is this:It is very hard to make heroes of people who, even if they lose, walk away millionaires. Carter deftly managed this with his intensely readable book about how NBC let David Letterman get away, but here, honestly, who cares if Simon Cowell leaves AI? Who cares if Les Moonves is a nice guy or not or if Jeff Zucker should have been fired?With the exception of Desperate Housewives creator Marc Cherry, whose failure-to-success story is a writer's dream (and he knows that well) there's just no reason for anyone outside these men's immidiate families to care about any of this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Part Close Yet NOT Direct Fit","review":"Part Listing: Lead thinking would be a direct fit; had to make several mods for fit / unusal time for arrival also--Amazon did a \\"Good Job\\" via email up dated info arrival / delay.

Then main thing I hated was that it is only available in full screen and not widescreen like poly matrix. That wasn't so bad on my old full screen tv but now watching it on an HD tv it does matter. I usually never buy anything that isn't widescreen because you miss a lot of the picture. The only other thing that was very annoying was the lighting during the final battle on the skylift with the two armitage copies. It was so dark during most of the sequence that you can't see anything. Yeah I know it is supposed to be a night scene but it still should have been done differently. Otherwise I loved both films.

From the chilling cover of Dylan's Desolation Row to the original, and somewhat chilling, title track where \\"The dead don't get no vacation down it that subway station\\" this work is crisply original and shows that Smither's work has come to full maturity.

Unable to rely on special effects, these movies were made scary with lighting, music -- ambience.I wish I could talk about the quality of this particular edition, but I don't have it.

The rest were all crushed. Then I read a review here that noted problems if you tried to tamp the powder too much, so I tried more times without tamping at all. Same problem. I figured it could be the capsules, so I ordered a different brand of vegetarian ones. Same problem.In short, I don't understand how this got positive reviews.

This does beat the heck out of hand filling and the output, when the pills aren't damaged, is pretty consistent.Make sure you follow their instructions and use the included desiccant bag with your capsules!Would like to see this design in a size 3, and see the upper spring plate widened so it doesn't crush the tops of capsules by ending midway."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not good","review":"It broke after about the 4th use.

Since the batches are relatively small this can be a drawback and extend the time it takes. However, filling each capsule by hand would take FOREVER.Basically, you take each capsule apart, pop each side in, pour the contents across the capsules, slide a little plastic piece across the capsule halves that have the contents in them, put the sides together, push down, and you have your pills. It's a simple process, only complicated by the constant cleaning - otherwise the capsules get stuck and spill everywhere.Overall, this is a decent little machine that shortens a quite lengthy process.

Every single cap top and bottom gets smashed to bits.Due to my experience this I will be happily buying the Cap-M-Quik model, which I thought at first must suck having to put the tops all on.However, given the problem with this is the tops/entire capsules getting stuck EVERY SINGLE TIME, seems the much better alternative.Can't even begin to mention how many capsules and powder I have wasted on this POS."},{"rating":"2","title":"EASY TO WORK","review":"This filler machine makes it very easy and very fast to fill capsules. The only thing that takes time is separating the capsules and putting them in the holders. Some complain about smashed capsules, if you gently rock it back and forth, no problem!! Glad I bought this capsule filler machine!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as easy as it sounds","review":"The filler is well made and good quality but I had a hard time making the capsules.Separating tops and bottoms to put in the filler, spreading the material equally to fill the capsules and tamping that down took more time than manually doing the job with each capsule. The cleanup after capping was an unexpected added chore.Personally I will go back to doing the job by hand, one capsule at a time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Capsules get stuck","review":"The shorter half of the capsules frequently get stuck in the holes. When you try to remove the capsules after filling them, they just come apart again. It would probably be quicker and less frustrating to fill the capsules individually by hand."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works Great","review":"Set up to finish might not be two minutes, maybe more like 5 to 10, still not bad. After the first time it goes faster, instructions are clear, simple and illustrated.Using the supplied desiccant bag will keep your capsules from swelling and sticking in the machine if you are using gelatin capsules. I had one out of 98 come apart.I use it for bitter herbs and powders and it works great."},{"rating":"1","title":"Product does not work well at all","review":"I'd like to return the product, but I've already used it, or attempted to, rather. I followed the instructions precisely, and was unable to close the capsules.

It is one that grows on you the more you listen to it. My favorite songs change like the weather. Current favs: \\"I Breath You,\\" \\"Sexy Dancer,\\" \\"Reach,\\" \\"Crash\\" and my ultimate favorite: \\"Wish.\\" With such a versatile album, you can never have just one favorite. That being said, all the tracks are strong and likable. The entire album can be listen to fromn beginning to end without ever having to fast forward through any of the songs--One of my major pet peeves.

All the songs are great and you are sure to love atleast a few.My personal favorite is \\"Reach\\". This speed garage-\\"ish\\" track ROCKS!! When the heavy bassline hits alongside the seductive (oh my gosh I want to meet this girl) vocals, you will melt.Concluding the album is \\"Wish\\". This track is another beautiful track that will relax you after listening to this fulfilling album.Do I highly recommend this album? Yes."},{"rating":"2","title":"WOW! and the next grammy goes too.......","review":"The New Mephisto Odyssey album has my head swimming!

I bought this movie because I love this kind of music, and there is a lack of truly great latin jazz performances on video. The idea of this film is simple -- short profiles of a dozen or so of the most influential musicians in afro-cuban jazz. There are some great musical moments here, but the emphasis is on visuals rather than sound. For this reason, the most memorable moments are visual, e.g. Chucho Valdes walking down the streets of Havana greeting old friends, his enormous frame dwarfing everyone else. Another cool scene is conga master Carlos \\"Patato\\" Valdez jamming with three other conga players and three bata drummers in what appears to be a large warehouse.This is a good DVD to own if you like this style of music, simply because well-shot latin jazz is hard to find. 4.5 stars because I would have preferred more music and fewer artsy shots and interviews."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Magical Salute to Latin Jazz","review":"We are both music lovers and decided to see this movie because the description intrigued us. Neither of us knew anything about Latin Jazz music at all. We were completely spellbound by the combination of masterful filmmaking and exquisite music. The music is so beautiful in this movie that I literally could feel myself starting to float away in the air. In the beginning of the movie, the narrator mentions how Latin Jazz has changed his life -- I can certainly agree that just seeing this film has changed ours. Besides the awesome musical numbers, this movie has a wonderful way of revealing the character of each of the musicians with skilled cinematography and editing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Be Warned!! This is NOT the version you saw in the theater!","review":"What idiot completely destroyed a first-rate jazz film with incessant narration OVER the beautiful music? This is a scandal and a sacrilege, and this product should be removed from the market and the correct, original film should be made available. I went into the DVD main menu to see if there was an option to remove the offending narrator, and one does not have this option. This is a waste of money.The film is great. Check to see if there is a narration-free version!"},{"rating":"1","title":"latin music video for jazz fans","review":"As a passionate lover of Cuban music, I went to see Calle 54 on the big screen at a film festival. The film has a very disjointed feel, consisting as it does of a series of studio performances by the artists, stapled together by the intrusive narration of director Fernando Trueba, who completely fails to get out of the way.The music itself is a real mix. Elaine Elias was a delightful inclusion, but Chano Dominguez and Michel Camilo in particular are simply relentless. Despite all this, there are some great moments, most especially the final scene, a duet between Bebo Vald��s and Israel Lopez playing Lagrimas Negras.If you like your latin jazz more jazz than latin this is worth seeing, but don't think this is a great documentary on the lines of Buena Vista or Tango Mio - it isn't."},{"rating":"1","title":"Calle 54","review":"Excellent production, sound quality and video image. The problem I had with this production is that there is too much talking and narration. This is unfortunate becuase as a lover of latin music I was really hoping to have a musical DVD and not a documentary about such great performers. Very little music to listen and enjoy because the narration is simply too much. The information about the life of these wonderful performers could have been recorded in a seperate chapter/section of the DVD. Let the music play.

Some parts I just pressed fastforward because it was just toooooo boooring!!!! Does not come close to Buena Vista's excitement. But if you like Latin JAZZ, then this is for you. The best part was seing the places where the performers grew up, going from streets in NY to Havana.Maybe I'll watch it again when I'm 50 and suffering from a bad case of insomnia."},{"rating":"2","title":"They wrote the book!!!!!","review":"This film is a master's work put together by a truely gifted film maker.

It is fine for the most part. But if I wanted to use this on a crossbar of a backdrop, I have to do a balancing act because the nubbies don't grip on the crossbar well with the flash on top of it. The clamp is strong and is rock solid if I attach it to a table or some kind of surfaces where the clamp can get a proper grip.The other thing I hate is right below the hotshoe is a wheel that you can tightened so the flash doesn't twist (not the ball). It gets untwisted easily. I'm also afraid to tighten it because it is made of plastic. It is the weakest link on this thing. Everything else is rock solid.It is definitely a must have for off camera strobist and I may buy another if it was a bit cheaper.EDIT: Look into the Manfrotto super clamp. Much more versatile than this clamp."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well built and versatile, but wonky cold shoe ... & you can make your own ...","review":"All current Nikon flashes fit on the cold shoe without excessive force. The clamp provides industrial strength grip and the ball head supports the weight of the flash no problem.I deducted a star because the Achilles' heel of this product is the plastic cold shoe that depends on friction for retention. Eventually, the plastic friction retention tab will wear out. I swapped mine out with Stroboframe flash shoe and feel much better not worrying about expensive OEM flash slipping out and hitting the floor.Although these are great, they are also pricey.

The plates just don't get hot enough to brown anything. I use a thermometer probe to check when my food is cooked. I can't believe that my chicken, turkey, and beef reaches 170 degrees and STILL no nice color on the outside. Turkey and beef turns gray when it's done, and chicken turns white. And since you continue to let it cook because it actually looks undercooked, the meat becomes overcooked and dry.Looks like the other models of this grill work well.

What I did find was the stereotypical pictures, sayings and gestures that unfortunately television portrays Italian/Americans to be.

I love the Star Wars series and wanted more background. The visual dictionary series is pretty good for this purpose but I was looking for something that would provide more background and I would forgo the pictures.This book, however, goes way beyond my interest. It's basically an exhaustive account of the people and events of the ENTIRE Star Wars universe ever created from a very, very long time ago in a galaxy very, very far, far away.There is little information about the 6 movies but pages upon pages of information on characters from before the pre-trilogy and after the trilogy. While I'm certain this appeals to true diehards this is not at all of interest to me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very nicely done!","review":"I just received my copy of this book the other day and I can't put it down. It is extremely thorough for a book of this size. It covers every major (and most minor) aspects of Star Wars history in a clear and concise manner. The galaxy map at the end is very nice, and like the text, up to date. The only problem I have is with some of the artwork. Most of it is nice, but some of it I would consider mediocre.

'Prevail' is an incredible opener; pounding drums, jagged thrash interchanges, catchy lyrics, a breakneck tempo that reminds of Slayer's 'Dittohead', but better. 'Catholics Despot' follows up in ferocious fashion, storming through with genuine irreligious menace. But then the momentum stops dead. There is no vitality or charm here, no abiding aesthetic to cover up the inconsistencies. A dangerous road to take. When the song-writing inevitably dips below inch-perfection, all impact is lost. Occasional decent riffs and chorus lines arise from this arid desert of calculated creativity, but never evolve into anything remotely exciting. It plods along in the indulgent fashion of similar post-thrash yawn-fests; 'Roots', 'Diablous in Musica', 'The More Things Change', etc. Too many disparate ideas and not enough raw substance, give me 'Tormentor' or 'Carrion' any day of the week."},{"rating":"1","title":"not their best moment","review":"foregoing their usual thrash attack for a more groove-laden mid paced downtuned chug, Kreator sounds a bit lost on this album. there are a few good riffs and the talent of this unit cannot be denied, but there is no spark of greatness that they showed on their earlier albums...and the vocals are in a New York hardcore style kind of yell; in other words, lame. songs like \\"Catholic Despot\\" show that they still have some firepower left in their teutonic speed metal veins, but overall Cause For Conflict is an uninspired album."},{"rating":"1","title":"A waste of money.","review":"The pins bent when trying to insert a CF card.
