Most of the information overwhelmed me at first but I was able to research my garden plants for this summer and hope to have a full season of color.The local University Horticultural Dept. had said \\" If you own only one reference book on garden plants, this is the bible of gardeners \\". Pictures are beautiful and the cross referenced index from common to scientific is very easy to use.Don't be scared off by the price tag because it's truly worth the money.

This book is angled toward Americans, and it lists the AHS hardiness zones, the common names used in the States and such; but beware, this is book is not written by Americans. Check the credentials of the editors, which is given straight off in the front of the book. The information contained within is very good, but clearly lifted from the RHS (Royal Horticultural Society). This will be apparent when the text is studied. I was disappointed. When will the AHS come out with a real \\"American\\" reference? Why must we keep using foreigners as our experts, dear AHS? We have AMERICAN experts. Use them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good book for identifying plants","review":"I identified alot of plants I had & didn't know what they were.

I buy nursery plants through mail order and I look for new and unusual plants to add to my garden. Everytime I look up a plant in this encyclopedia I find it, along with growing details, comments about species or varieties, and a color photograph. Very comprehensive, very complete, and great information.The only downside is that this 1100 page book is so heavy it takes two hands to lift it out from the bookshelf (I guess that's a small price to pay for completeness). If you can measure information by weight, than this book is a bargin!Every serious gardener must have this book.

Hagin, explained how we are always praying for something when we just need to receive! I had an epiphany! Jesus said on the cross that it is finished. The Father has given us everything, now we just need to receive. An example of this would be when we pray for healing. However, according to the word of God, by the stripes of Jesus, we are healed. We already have our healing. Now just receive what has already been given to you. This was an Ahaaaaa moment!

Brookmeyer is in top form here, and how can you go wrong with Osie Johnson on drums and Hank Jones at the keys. Jimmy's playing is a masterclass in itself and he proves that the guitar can truly be a melodic single line instrument. His sentiment echoes Charlie Christian's, as melody takes priority over fancy pyrotechnics. The whole band cooks on every track, so you may have to listen to this short affair more than a couple of times to really digest everything that's going on. Great solos on this record as well, hint, hint."},{"rating":"2","title":"ENTRE HERMANAS","review":"BYANKA SIEMPRE HA SIDO MI CANTANTE FAVORITA Y DESEO OBTENER TODOS LOS DISCOS DE ELLA.

I wasted my money on this product seeing as i am an old sonic fan used to collect the old archie comics. The older sonic the hedgehog series is alot better to buy if you want a good story.

I think she is just trying to be another Brittney Spears, don't get me wrong she has a great voice for singing and I wish her all the luck in the world."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cheesy pop at it's best!","review":"Everything To Me was Brooke's debut single from her album This Voice that unfortunately never was released due to record company complications. Because of this, Brooke decided to go to R&B which ruined what could've been a great music career. Everything To Me is by far Brooke's best single, showcasing her vocals quite well with appropriate lyrics for her younger fans. The CD comes with the standard version of the track along with an instrumental, karaoke, and 2 remix versions, all of which are very enjoyable. I definitely recomend this little gem, and get it while you can as it is out of print."},{"rating":"1","title":"leave the singing to real singers....","review":"this girl just doesn't cut the mustard when other talented singers are working hard everyday to keep their careers going. after hearing this song, i can see why she didn't get a record deal until a couple years later...."},{"rating":"2","title":"brookeamania rules!","review":"My name is Ashley Ruth Im 8 yrs old.

To only be 14-15 years old she is really amazing as far as her voice, and maturity.

It doesn't help when your dad is a wrestling star, seeing as wrestling is pretty much a \\"fake\\" version of entertainment. Moronic lyrics, lame beats and a general sense of \\"been there, done that\\" permeate this disc. Still my fantasy is that Hulk is just using his daughter as a vehicle to regain his own sense of stardom back. picture it, Brooke on the TRL stage singing her heart out when the evil Zeus enters screaming, \\"BROOOOKKKKEEE HOOOOOGAN! BEEFCAKE BARBER!\\" Then Hulk runs in, rips off hsi yellow tee and delivers a smackdown all the while Brooke shouts, \\"but Dad, this was my shot at the spotlight.\\" Then as she sobs on the stage, Hulk poses for 20 minutes (just like he did after winning a match."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another Generic Pop Song","review":"Here's another half-anorexic teenage girl who actually thinks she can become something. Maybe she will. Probably she won't. Her first single \\"Everything to Me\\" sounds like every other semi-hit pop song that goes to Radio Disney for a month and is then forgotten forever. I was reading that Brooke is the next Britney, but even though I'm not a major Britney supporter, Brooke \\"Hulk\\" Hogan can't even begin to compare herself to a-list singers like Britney, Christina, and Hilary. She either needs to wait a while and find her inner musical abilities all over again, or just accept the fact that she can't make it and fade out before she begins."},{"rating":"2","title":"An engaging look at the actor/director relationship","review":"\\"Actors Turned Directors\\" is a probing insight into the methods used by some of Hollywood's (generally) more successful Directors. It's an excellent reference for anyone interested in the art of filmmaking, as Stevens talks at length with his subjects about their secrets and experiences. At times the book assumes a general knowledge of the filmmaking process from its reader, lacking explanations for the odd technical term. Some of Stevens' subjects are a little puzzling too - Kevin Bacon for example is not renowned for his skills or track record as a Director, however on the whole the book opens a door to not only the relationship between Actor and Director, but also the Director's role in the entire filmmaking process. Of particular interest is Stevens' style of asking the same question of different Directors, illustrating that each Director's methods are unique, and that there is no one 'rule book' by which filmmakers follow."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't work","review":"Bought this and can't get it to work or even update online.

It will keep you on the edge of your seats, and it will push to keep watching. I love this series, it is on my top anime list. And as for this box set as a product, it is very classy, with all of the first season's 24 episodes and even an episode of Shakugan no Shana S (an OVA episode) and more!

This read had me in stitches many times but also left me with pain and compassion for not only the nanny, but her charges. I think the author does a creative job getting the message out that sometimes the caregivers in our homes and out in our communities are often under valued, overworked, and under compensated for caring for other's children. Anyone who is a nanny, a caregiver, thinking of becoming one, or even hiring one would greatly benefit from this experianced nannies story."},{"rating":"2","title":"Living the So Called \\"Good Life\\" isn't so Good, after all..","review":"This story has a lot to teach all of us about what we assume wealth buys. It goes beyond what we have always been taught... \\"Money doesn't buy happiness\\" even though many of us have secretly believed...\\"if only I had that much money, I KNOW I could live happily ever after\\".....I suggest you read this funny and surprisingly insightful memoir and have your mind changed, just like mine was. I wish this former nanny all the best and would like to thank her for taking the risk to write this book. I will never look at Hollywood the same again."},{"rating":"2","title":"I bought this book after a nanny conference... loved it!!!!","review":"I heard Suzanne speak at a nanny conference that I attended a few months ago. After hearing her read parts of her book at the conference, I knew that I needed to buy it (I guess that may have been part of her purpose for reading it aloud to us in the first place, LOL). Well, it worked, I bought the book and I'm glad that I did. It was very funny and I was sad when it ended (like I always am when I read a good book and feel like I \\"know the characters\\"). I liked this book soooo much better than the Nanny Diaries."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun and very real","review":"This is a wonderful book. Professional nannies and the people that employ them should read this. Suzanne manages to entertain as well as educate people at the same time, which is true gift. I know that the average person that employs a nanny may not feel that they are in the same league as the rich Hollywood elite but they often behave as poorly. This is one small step to educating the general public about nannies and what they do. I was very lucky to meet Suzanne at the International Nanny Association Conference this past April. She no longer is a nanny but still has a passion for children and the nannying profession which shines through when you hear her speak! If you haven't all ready guessed, I am a nanny and found that the situations in the book are all too common in our profession. I have recommended this book to alot of people and they have all enjoyed it. It's a great summer read!"},{"rating":"2","title":"MY FAVORITE READ SO FAR THIS SUMMER!","review":"Loved it! Loved it! Loved it! I was calling my girlfriends up and reading passages, since we grew up in a SMALL,(as the author calls it \\"less than thriving metropolis\\")TOWN. We could really relate. This is an enjoyable read for teens through baby boomers, I just wish the author could of given us an update on the children that she cared for."},{"rating":"2","title":"VERY hard to put down - SAD to finish it","review":"I loved this book. Possibly since I am from Eugene I overly enjoyed the constrast written between the two worlds. But overall, as an avid reader (5+ a week) I can honestly say this has been my most favorite summer read yet this year.If you liked Nanny Diaries, if you are a Nanny, want to be a Nanny or are a Mom who just loves/needs to laugh over what others will do as a caregiver (the scene where the parents don't even know how many naps the child takes.........) - this is the book for you. A nanny story that relates to stay at home moms.GET THIS BOOK - NOW!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I laughed out loud","review":"I laughed out loud several times while reading this book. It is both fun and a really unique story. You won't be sorry!"},{"rating":"1","title":"No wonder it was self-published!","review":"I love all the tell-all books written by former nannies, so I thought I'd love this one too. But this book really suffered from a lack of an editor. The format (in which the book is \\"organized\\" according to a movie theme, and the author creates imaginary scripts for how scenes could have played out) is just SO ridiculously cheesy that I actually rolled my eyes several times. I see that it will be published soon by a major publishing company, and I can only hope that they will have subjected this work to some major editing. Hopefully they ditched the movie theme too - it made it read like a high school report. Read this only if you really don't care about how well a book is written or if you are that desperate to read any former nanny's tell-all story. There's not really that much dirt here to make it worthwhile."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not that funny and a little depressing.","review":"I thought this book would be fun to read, but I found it to be poorly written and a little depressing.

I would not recommend this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Badly Written and Boring","review":"This book is so poorly written, it is almost embarrassing to read. It just isn't funny, it's boring; in fact I read it with a morbid fascination wondering how much worse it would get.

The Nanny Diaries it isn't."},{"rating":"2","title":"Have to read it!","review":"This book was hilarious. I loved her journals, they gave a look into what she was really thinking and feeling, even when she appeared calm and together on the outside. It's a total crack up!

While it is slightly annoying to have to remember to take the pills, the next morning I told my finace I would gladly pay for Chasers any time I drink in the future.Now since this was my bachlorette party, I had a LOT to drink.. About 6 shots and 8 beers. Not only did I not have a headache or stomachache the nesxt day, I actually felt really good. The only residue of the hangover I felt was the slight head fog, but even that was remarkaly less than normal.I recommend this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Actually works","review":"This product works.

For some reason my body is not so great at taking the poison that is Alcohol.

I drank almost a 750 Ml of rum last night and i took 7 of these, 2 when i started drinking 2 more about two and a half hours later and 2 more right before i went to sleep and i woke up 6 hours later feeling fine.

This monitor will not act as a computer display, producing an overlapping band of three fuzzy images. There was no way to adjust it. When I contacted the vendor he said that it was not a to be used as a computer monitor, despite what the product description said. It was for POS displays, not for use with a computer. He offered to refund the price of the monitor, but would not pay for return shipping. He took no responsibility for the misinformation in the specs or product description. Obviously by the time I paid for the shipping I would be no better off then before.

It is a cool idea but does not really serve any purpose. I cannot use it at work even for my own internal papers because it does not staple more than three pages and often doesn't work even for 3 pages. I don't have the time to play around with this thing so I requested to return it, was told to keep it and got a gift certificate for the cost.

The \\"stapler\\" does punch out a tab and cut a slit in the paper, but it fails to tuck the tab into the slit. This is a problem for two reasons. First, the hanging tabs of paper catch inside the devise when trying to remove your paper. Secondly, you now have to flatten out the tabs of paper and try to push them up through the slit.

Both films are in fine condition, and in Tongs, it is great to see Christopher Lee in yet another villainous role. Some of the gruesomeness is surprising given the British Board of Film Censors' attitude toward these films, particularly shots of cut -off hands in Stranglers, making me wonder if this is a restoration or the original release.

Not necessarily bad unless you're a feminist, I guess; still she, like other Heinlein heroines, comes across sharp as a tack compared to the rather obtuse hammer-sack jocks she's compelled to work with.The paternal commander played by Hayden Rorke (aka Dr. Bellows in I Dream of Jeannie) is obviously a stand-in for Heinlein himself -- think of SiaSL's Jubal Harshaw in uniform -- who bizarrely shows his kink in threatening to spank his unruly female subordinate. Definitely creepy.This work anticipates Kubrick's 2001 etc by 15 odd years, but scans like the other straightforward, stiffly acted clunky space operas typical of the time.

Perhaps the book hold more weight had it been written by a successful Fortune 500 business owner, instead of a pastor using his success in the Christian church to try to teach on corporate success."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just OK","review":"This had too much about what results you need, but not enough how to get there for me.

It took only a few moments to figure out how to make it fire, and we've had hours and hours of fun with these things! They seem to fire some sort of IR signal, and operate much like a remote would. Hits make a very satisfying explosion sound, and there is a tone for \\"last hit warning\\" that is very obvious. The reset button is easy to get to, and the game starts over. We've run all over the house with these things, and have had a lot of fun. Just like with a remote, you can bounce a signal off walls, which gave me a great advantage until he figured out what was happening. They don't flash visibly or anything, but there's a \\"fire\\" sound that lets you know its shooting. They seem to have about the same range as a typical remote would. The wrist strap is too small for my wrist, but it works well on his, and they are quite easy to operate with only one hand, even without the strap."},{"rating":"1","title":"My reaction to this product","review":"According to the ones who received this, the toy does not really registerhits by either laser or infra red during play, but just beeps.

He was finally dragged to where all go who have lost their way but are in need of a nice safe place with rubber walls, the academy. There, he can host all sorts of \\"dangerous\\" readings and workshops while congratulating himself on their failure out in the crass commercial world where what's truly dangerous is what's good, not what makes Stuart Ostrow feel good about himself.

The ability to place before the reader a large number of ideas in a straightforward and easy to grasp manner while remaining objective is not always easy or even possible. Still the author has managed to do this rather well. No one could possibly mistake my stance on my own writing, but this book I find much more neutral.

Christians want one thing...... for all to be saved. But also as TRUE biblical Christians we don't believe we need to bully anyone. Many have past and present gone against God's Word and called themselves Christians and done shameful deeds. When God created us He gave us our own will hoping we would do His and not satan's will.

This book is well written and informative. The chapters don't end with the same intensity as the opening, actually, it's somewhat inverse.

Either way, it is a great CD that I recommend highly."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a Disappointment.","review":"This book has very little content, just random facts that lack any sort of overall cohesion.The chapter on Africa talks only about ancient Egypt. The chapter on trade, commerce and law has nothing on trade.It's also boring."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing Resource!","review":"There are a lot of guides on the market that say they are going to help you with writing fantasy, but this is the first one I've found that actually has useful information. I've read a few guides that give generic advice about following the hero's journey or not being afraid of using fantasy stereotypes, which really isn't all that helpful if you are looking for advice on building a whole world. Where those books fell short The Writer's Complete Fantasy Reference excels. With sections that deal with medieval social systems, building fictional societies based on real ones, and information on tactics and weaponry this book is an indispensable asset for fantasy writers."},{"rating":"2","title":"awesome","review":"i was really surprised when i saw this online but i was so excited when i finally got it in the mail. the delivery was fast and the price was great. thanks a lot!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Well worth the price","review":"This book gives a great overview of world-building and the various things to consider. It covers no topics in depth, though it gives more detail than other reference guides I've seen. There is enough information on each subtopic to point the direction for more detailed research if you so choose."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good for those just starting out","review":"This is a good book for anyone who needs to research their fantasy stories. It's packed with information about different cultures, religions, and folklore. It's also good for getting ideas for stories, and it's great for quick reference. I'd recommend this book for anyone starting out in writing fantasy fiction. I love it."},{"rating":"1","title":"No no no....","review":"The entire concept of writing fiction of ANY kind is to use your imagination mixed with the things that you know. A book to TELL you how to write fantasy does not make a bit of sense! If you are building a world, use common sense and round it out, smooth the edges, be as 'realistic' as you can for a Fantasy story. The problem with Fantasy these days is that all Elves are the same; all Dwarves are the same, all Goblins are the same...every book written is basically a carbon copy of the last one. These races DO NOT EXIST in our world, therefore you cannot say they MUST be one way or another. Get back to IMAGINATION - just use the sense you were given. TRUE old fashioned imagination has created the BEST books ever read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Way to basic","review":"If you are a fantasy guru, and have been studying and reading fantasy books for most of your life... don't bother with this book. It's main intent is geared towards people who have very little experience with fantasy. I found this book to be pretty useless."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mediocre","review":"The two best things about this book are the title and the cover artwork. This book is exceptional only in its mediocrity. Anyone who has read much fantasy and/or played fantasy role-playing games will find this book somewhat unhelpful. The contents deal mostly with medieval customs and clothing, as well as modern witchcraft. If, however, you know next to nothing about fantasy writing and would like to try writing it, this would be a reasonable book among others to buy...though I can't imagine why someone in such a situation would attempt to write fantasy in the first place."},{"rating":"2","title":"Much better than other complete references","review":"My inital review of this was 4 stars, but upon further analysis I belive it deserves 5.This covers a variety of topics, similar to other \\"complete\\" fantasy writing books (The Complete Guide to Writing Fantasy). This is far more detailed than the others and is an excellent reference. The sections on clothing, arms, armor, and castles ave instructional pictures. There are long lists of common jobs for the rich and poor, as well as a surprisingly thorough (for the amount of space) run down on creatures of myth. The magic section is fascinating, and covers topics such as what animals symbolize, the Freemasons, and astrology. There's a nice chapter on world cultures that looks at their government, military, religion, economy, arts and science.Without a doubt, this is the best book of its kind."},{"rating":"1","title":"Uninspired and stereotypical","review":"The book, while written in an entretaining way, lacks substance. Full of the classic stereotypes of the genre, which are just assumed instead of though about, it's barely more that a high school level revision of medieval europe because, supposedly, all fantasy happens in europe. Granted, it has a few words to say about some five other cultures, but too sketchy to be interesting. On the other hand if you're looking for names for castle parts, armor, or medieval clothing, this is the book for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"You'd think writers would know what words mean...","review":"compendium ( P ) Pronunciation Key (km-pnd-m)n. pl. compendiums or compendia (-d-)A short, complete summary; an abstract.A list or collection of various items.This book is a complete COMPENDIUM.

I would definitely recommend this to any writer who has a vocabulary big enough to understand that.Useful information, almost invaluable once you start using it. Whether you use it to be inspired, or for a general idea of what you're talking about before you start writing, this book really is indispensable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Incomplete and dispensable","review":"The greatest lack of this book is the lack of recommended reading. I don't mean fantasy recommendations I mean reference works where more details can be found on the subjects presented. Parts of this book are an overview of famous fantasy worlds, parts of it are simple dictionary like lists of occupations, clothes, weapons, animals and so on."},{"rating":"1","title":"Incomplete, inaccurate, and inaccessible","review":"This book is really little more than a glorified glossary. Many critical terms are left undefined or are defined incorrectly; I found chapters 5, 9, and 10 particularly troublesome, perhaps because I have a strong academic background in those areas.Overall, this is a very weak effort. It does little more than provide a few more terms for lazy authors to sling around incorrectly."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as Complete as the Title Suggest","review":"It's definately a good starting point for a reference library, yet it still seems to leave a lot out. For example, it does little to explain world-building and gives less-than-detailed examples in a lot of the book's sections. Most of the info in the book can be found with a search engine. I recommend it only for those of you who want to build a decent reference library."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Very Usefull Book","review":"An excellent Reference, I bought this book looking for information like: How many men in a legion? How far does a longbow shoot? And what is a plinth? I was not disappointed.Pro's:Easy to read, covers a lot of ground, including sections on: Arms, Armor and Armies, Creatures of Myth and Legend, and Magic. Well organized, with a complete 14-page index, and a nice cover.Cons:This book is a Fantasy reference, so if you're looking for solid historical fact, look elsewhere. It covers a lot of info, but doesn't tell you how, where, or when to use it.As a Reference I give it 5 stars, and I highly recommend it to beginning Writers and Fantasy Fans alike.If you are looking for a book on how to write Fantasy, check out: How to Write Science Fiction and Fantasy, by Orson Scott Card. Another Great book."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must, for fantasy writers.","review":"If you have ever thought of writing a great fantasy novel, but were intimidated because you did not know the difference between a cape and a cowl, or an axe and a mace, this book is for you.The authors have superbly listed descriptions of everything from types of dress, typical lifestyles, and governing systems for your medieval settings. Not only is this a great reference tool, but when I am looking to just write for fun (or practice), I often use this book to create a minor scenario that I can build on.I suggest you get this book while it is still available."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is an incomplete book.","review":"I thought this book would cover ALL FANTASY topics as in creatures that could be within your novel. This book is more like a history lesson about castles, the dress that one would wear in a castle, what the people would be back then. And when we do get to the creatures it is like just throw in some of the basic creatures that one would see in a fantasy novel like a unicorn to a pegagus, nothing about how to create your own different creature or at least a suggestion on how to create your own.I found it lacking in a lot of things. If I had known that it just contained the basic information, I would not have purchased this book but looked for another book that is more worthy of being in my reference library. I like it for the basic information if you are a beginner in writing fantasy novels, but this book is totally incomplete."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth owning even if there were no recipes","review":"In this well-conceived and beautifully written cookbook/memoir, Ms. Brennan transports her readers to a rural and rugged area of France that lies only an hour north of the glamorous Cte d'Azur.

Initially, it seemed like a great set, but it doesn't hold up. I would not recommend this product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Solid Overview","review":"Pro:Sometimes I found myself reading this history book as if it was a thriller - which obviously doesn't happen very often! I align myself with other reviews - the book offers what it promises: a short and indeed well written overview of russian history. Although the part before the 19th century is somewhat less good than the rest of the book.Contra:Lack of references in numerous quotations. Although this book clearly is not intended to be scientific, I would have welcomed more references nonetheless. Also, many times the author uses present when describing the state of economy during Yeltsin's precidency, which seems to be from the first edition and should be adjusted.This book is a great starting point for further, more in-depth reading, because it made me wonder about the details and because it really helped me in developping a mental frame of the vast history of this country."},{"rating":"2","title":"Concise!","review":"If you want a concise and well written primer on Russian history, this is the book for you.

I didn't know much of Russia's story except as it relates to the World Wars and the Cold War. This book provides a masterful overview of the Russian state from it's inception till Vladimir Putin's government. The text is entertaining and easy to read. Ascher does a good job of providing sufficient detail without overloading the reader's brain."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Read and Coffee Table Book","review":"This book is great. It goes into, although briefly the rise of marvel comics. The meat and potatoes of this book though is the study of the marvel characters. Captain America, Spider-man, The Incredible Hulk, and the X-Men are looked into in depth. Other characters in the marvel universe are also explored but not in the length of the others mentioned. Whats great about this book is that it looks at the characters major story lines and their origins but also their representations in other mediums. WOndering about Captain America in the movies or on t.v.? Then this is the book for you. There is also another great book titled \\"marvel universe.\\" That book looks at the characters in the comics only. So if you want just a study of the comics go with \\"Marvel Universe.\\" If you want a book that looks at everything invovled with the character go with this one.

ARE YOU KIDDING?The author has no trouble giving all due credit to Stan Lee, but avoids Kirby as much as possible. (And I'm a HUGE Stan Lee fan, LOVE HIM!!!! But fair is fair.)Don't buy this book.

We thought he'd really enjoy it but when he turned it on and heard the creepy haunted house style music and the strange British voice (said with no prejudice as my husband has a British accent, though not a strange one) he turned it right off again and refused to play with it. My husband pushed a few buttons and found the setup to be poor and lacking any creativity. All of the dinos sound the same. Also, the questions are basic as is the information given. There is no room for growth once a kid has played with it a few times and memorized all of the little bit of information it has. Plus, my son already knew much about the types of dinosaurs presented in the game, thanks to the show Dino Dan; which, compared to this game, is a better use of time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not very modern","review":"Bought this for xmas for my 4 yr old son. He likes the toy but I'm disappointed with the quality. The audio is very old-fashioned, sounds like Max Headroom.

My son actually brought this to my attention. \\"Mom,\\" he said, \\"why do the t-rex and the diplodicus have the same voice?\\" Good question, kiddo.

If you doubt this listen to their radio programs, go into their book stores and look for quotes by their leaders. For Jenkins to ignore this flood of anti-Catholic hatred to make a case that liberals (including a number of actual Catholics) are the source of scorn and hatred of the Catholic church and Catholics is dishonest.To see real anti-Catholic diatribes you should try to find what people such as Jean Kirkpatrick and Al Haig said about the Church women murdered in El Salvador.Jenkins is just another neo-con on the make."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's da bomb !!!!","review":"One of the best west coast dvd I have ever seen : contains a lot of live and intesresting interviews of how the music is created by west coast artists...especielly jay tee from N2DEEp and spice 1 !!!the movies from the cars shows are also tight !!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Paint peeling","review":"Fountain is nice looking & works alright but the paint that that put on is not sticking, It is peeling everywhere.

Would not have purchased it had it not been a book club choice."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Eye Opener","review":"A ground breaking book that outlines the paradigm shift that must occur for America to become prosperous again. Some of Parker's comments will annoy true liberals (ie: faith and intact families as the bedrock of successful communities) and why government must shrink greatly and get out of the way of the individual. This is not an anti-gay book, BTW, as some reviewer's comments may lead you to believe. Parker just feels that traditional marriage is what makes solid foundations for the successful rearing of children and hence successful communities. Every American should read this book and take away from it that which they agree with and take the rest with a grain of salt. Perhaps she *is* onto something."},{"rating":"2","title":"An eye opener...unless you chose to be blind.","review":"Excellent.

I did find one factual mistake in it that I just wanted to bring to people's attention: No doctors in the Tuskegee Syphilis study ever infected a patient with syphilis. Rather, they withheld treatment when treatment became available and did not give the patients informed consent. When Nixon heard the trial was still going on, he had it shut down at once. If anyone is teaching a course on welfare policy, I would recommend this book for one of the readings."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Job!","review":"Star does a great job of informing people that the approach the government has taken in the \\"war against poverty\\" has not worked and never will.

I mean someone who hasn't even read it gave it 5 stars. Also, after some negative reviews there was a flood of reviews in the 4-5 star range. It makes it appear as if some people are trying to skew the results. It really makes you question how good a read it is."},{"rating":"1","title":"why does this book cost $186?????????","review":"I probably won't read this book because I won't spend $186 on an unknown.What in the world makes this USED book cost so much??

I am conservative but this book seemed very closed-minded and I decided not to continue reading it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Skewed","review":"I wish I had not agreed to review this book. Half way into the first chapter I found myself becoming angry. A majority of my family has been apart of the working poor. Facts are, people who are in poverty seem to be \\"happy\\" because they make the best of what they got, not because life is somehow better. Also, to suggest that if we left small business alone to do what they want that they would not only do \\"right\\" by their employees but consumers is putting more faith in business than I am willing to. Business is about making money and left to their own devices, it will revert back to the Industrial Revolution.

This type of learning is about intuition and creative interactive freedom. It doesn't need a manual or directions since there is no winning involved.

That's what I was expecting with this order since the header for it on Amazon says \\"filter pack.\\" Apparently a single filter qualifies as a pack because that's what I got. It also took a while to arrive. Nevertheless, it is substantially cheaper than buying directly from Hunter, fits my Hunter air cleaner and works fine.

Enveloped in a simple novel type format are 5 simple truths about choice. My favorite is the reminder that there is always a next choice. The book takes less than an hour to read and is perfect for women as they graduate from college, are beginning their lives as mothers, are at the age of retirement or at any other phase of their life. I'm purchasing several copies as gifts for special women in my life."},{"rating":"2","title":"This book is difficult reading but worht the effort.","review":"Roman Nature does indeed make the life and times of Pliny the Elder come to life or at least make the age seem more real. Yet for me the value of this book is the contribution to thought which it makes concerning the relationship of man to nature and man to God. Pliny seems to view God as suffused through nature and part of it. God is Nature. This book may help to shed light on the remarkable revolution brought about by the Romans in the area of architecture. It may also help to shed light on the meaning of buildings such as the Pantheon. The Pantheon surely makes some kind of statement on the relationship of the Roman world and life to God. For this reason alone Roman Nature is well worth the trek."},{"rating":"1","title":"Inaccurate, until it lock up entirely","review":"The calibration was off about 10 degrees, from installation (compared with several reference thermometers).The thermometer entirely stopped working after the first rain: pointer locked up, requiring you to tap it repeatedly until it moved to its (still out-of-calibration) indication.

There are six photos to a page with a large margin so the photos are pretty small. More than two thirds are in black and white. Every other page on the left is a sketch so there are no photos there. The photos on the included CD are very small and can not be zoomed in without getting fuzzy.All color, less blank space, and high resolution on the CD would make this much better.If you want full color and high resolution, try other books. For example, check out \\"Art Models\\" instead. You can get it with a disk that has all the photos and they can be zoomed in so they are HUGE."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not enough balance between men and women","review":"I think the book is wonderful, and has many active poses which I find very useful, but I would have liked the book much better if there had been an even distribution of poses between men and women. I also would have preferred a side-by-side format where you could see the woman in one pose and the man in an identical pose beside her. In this way you could see the differences more clearly between how a woman should be drawn and how a man should be drawn. As it is the women take up the majority of the front of the book and the men the back 1/3, and there are absolutely no shared poses."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unnatural Poses","review":"If you wish you had models to pose for you in strange and unnatural poses, this is the book for you.

On the upside it provides several angles of the same pose, which is great for sculpture.It was about two weeks later that I put the CD-ROM in my computer.

There is even some retouching on the photographs - come on! The book itself is also filled with someone's completely unnecessary and not very good drawings.And the CD is no better - it is filled with music instead of photographs in higher resolution.

Unlike some of the other reviewers I do not mind that the photos are predominantly black and white, as this can make tonal studies easier; but I do mind that the reference photos are too small and commercially photographed in flat light making them virtually useless for any real study.

If you are a Christian, do not buy this book believing that the \\"god\\" she speaks of is God Almighty that we worship. This book is humanism at it's worst. Teaching people that whatever path they choose is right as long as it feels right to them is a terribly misleading lie. This is the kind of teaching Paul was referring to when he said \\"For the time will come when men will not put up with sound doctrine.

I was stunned at the accuracy of the material, as much as I was delighted by the messages that will bring solace to so many. The authenticity of the messages, and how it can change life as we know it, are the reasons for why I recommend this book. You will learn much, and your search for answers and spiritual truth are all here in this enlightening book.

The questions that were presented at the end of each chapter made me turn the page to find undeniable truth and amazement in the answers on the page that followed. If you are looking for Divine Truth, solutions to the problems that plague you on a deeply personal level, as well as how God truly views all of humanity and what we are all doing, this is the book to read.

That consultation has changed my life, just as it did for a friend of mine as well.The same is true for the answers that flowed \\"through\\" Barbara in If God Was Like Man. This book (and I have read many) brings extraordinary insight, answers and information to humanity no matter what your background or preferences. Even if you DON'T believe in God, per se, this is fine too. The wisdom is completely non-judgmental, and you will find answers to the most controversial topics covered. Barbara Rose has a rare gift. I HIGHLY recommend both her and her extraordinary book."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Beacon of Light for Humanity. Profound!","review":"If God Was Like Man will light a new path for humanity to follow.

It is the path that is truest for you, and you alone.Barbara Rose steps aside, and allows God to speak to humanity with truths so daring that many will have a difficult time relinquishing control over others.I found myself awestruck as I read about how other civilizations live in other galaxies. They are way ahead of humanity on Earth, but we can all get to their level if we understand and follow the messages in this momentous book.This book will impact humanity far beyond any other book I have ever read. It hit home with me in many areas, and I believe that there are messages that will hit home with just about everyone alive today.

For example, God suggests raising the age of adulthood and voting to 21-25?I started skimming the 5-star reviews and noticed most were in a six month period starting in November 2003. Rather curious.

Barbara Rose took dictation and allowed God to send the messages that will bring positive change, solutions, enlightenment, and most of all TRUTH to all who are fortunate enough to read this book. It covers so many areas that are impacting our planet, and brings astonishing solutions for each area addressed. This is one book that you will want to re-read, as I found that some of the messages sank in deeper, bringing me further understanding after I read them again.

We all need the messages!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I thought God could do better","review":"Looks like I go against popular opinion here but, I didn't think much of the book. I was so excited to get it and read it. I genuinely wanted to hear what God had to say about some very confusing issues. I'm just kinda dissappointed that God didn't say anything I hadn't heard (usually more eloquently) before. I can't believe God doesn't have something original to say! It was also sort of weird that God's opinions were often focused on problems specifically germaine to Ms. Rose's life. And I suspect his sometimes limited view of complex issues (like the environment)probably mirrors Ms. Rose's own opinions. Bottom line is its a bad Neale Donald Walsh knock-off and I'm sorry I spent $18 on it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Much Needed Messages","review":"The messages in this book are much needed among humanity. There are many topics covered, and one of my favoites is when God says \\"do not kill in my name, because my name is your name.\\"This is a great book that unites all of humankind in modern day language. There might be people that quote from the bible, and which \\"bible\\" is the \\"right\\" one? The King James version? the Koran? the Torah? What about everybody else on the planet? This is just one topic I am selecting because in this book, the messages God sends view all of humankind as one humanity, equal, and divine at the same time.I got a lot out of this book, and I believe that many people would, no matter which path you are on. That is the foundation of the messages."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pass this up","review":"I bought this book at the thrift store completely based upon the cool hallograms on the cover and throughout.

Rory's world is clearly delineated here-the mother who works too hard to provide the family's financial necessities, the father driven to paint, even though he is unsuccessful financially, his reluctance to get a paying job of any sort, her mother's yearning not to have to work so long and so hard, and Rory's relationship with her dearest friend, who is developing an interest in the opposite sex that Rory does not yet have. An excellent book."},{"rating":"2","title":"What a Wonderful Book for the Young Teenager!","review":"Reviewer: A former librarian in the children/young people's department of a public library. When I was head of the Children/Young People's section of our library, it was a challenge to find good books for this age group. So, when a friend gave me Tracy Mack's book, Drawing Lessons, I was curious to see if it would prove to be one that I would put on our shelves. After reading it, I was thrilled to discover a beautifully told story of a young artistically gifted girl who endures a painful family problem. I shall pass it to my young niece with confidence and pleasure."},{"rating":"2","title":"Drawing Lessons","review":"Drawing Lessons shows how dispute and change in a family affects children.

However, the tracks that are on are brilliant, and if you are a Meth fan you need this album (if only because he only has one other one!)...There's a lot of bull on this cd, most of the middle-closerto-endof it is pointless, the skit with Chris Rock is annoying. Too much stuff that sounds like Puffy might if that fag ever got some talent, and a bit much with the hardcore gangsta-wannabe bull...in other words much of it is unoriginal and only for 'hard core hip hop fans', it having bored this 'hard core good music fan'...and that's enough dissing out of me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Personally, I Like his tape, he is tight.","review":"Personally, I like his tape,he is tight.Method Man and Redman is off the hook together."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is just marketable!","review":"Method Man's Tical was awesome. I love Rap, Hip hop and many other types of music. I can't stand the typical rap genre, that polutes our airways. Gansta is old, it's not productive, and it's no longer part of the fabric of decent rap.Let's get one thing straight. Rap get's too monotonous, far too quickly. Money bags, pimping and fast cars is old.MM has produced two great tracks on an album that is so far inferior to what he normally does. I hope fore better.Eminem was a refreashing change, and so was MM when he \\"broke\\" away and did his solo work. I think Rap music should be more creative. However, if you are a wanna be gansta, only dream of girls and fast cars and have nothing better to aspire to....listen to this and the rest of Cashmoney records..... Master P stuff.I for one await something that takes talent to produce, I'll be listening to Tical (one), and Predator (Ice Cube)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Meth fell asleep for this one","review":"For all of us who were long awaiting meth's sophmore release, I could sadly say that Tical 2000 is a big time flop. With the exception of a couple of tracks including his hot single Judgement Day (which he produced himself) and Break ups 2 make ups, this album lacks much in terms of quality and beats. Many of the beats are boring and repetitive, and some of the guest rappers like Street who have shined before stink up the joint on this one. The simple and grimy beats and smooth flows of Meth's first album Tical prove to be one of Wu's classics, but Meth's attempt to go mainstream on a solo fail, for not only does he not draw the mainstream MTV crowds, he fails to retain his old school Wu followers. Better luck next time meth!"},{"rating":"2","title":"ALL UP IN YO MOTHAF*#@IN' MOUTH!!!!!!","review":"I know you be Johnny Blazing cause I do too. Listening to that headbanger boogie, Tical 2000.

Ever. It's tight and dark, with a horror-movie feel. The rest of the album is crapola. It always seems that with Meth it's hit or miss, there's no in-between. Either his track is a classic or it's unlistenable. If you like the title track, get the single instead (the somewhat annoying intro is shorter and it includes the video). If you're new to Method Man, get Tical instead. He was hungry then, not Mr. MTV.Overall, Meth has an incredible flow and one of the best voices in Rap.

Perfect World, Dangerous Grounds, Party Crasher, Snuffed Out, and Break Ups 2 Make Ups are all good. The only songs I didn't like were Cradle Rock, Retro Godfather, and I thought there were too many skits but besides that it is a dope album. It also features good guest appearances by Streetlife, Cappadonna, Raekwon, Masta Killa, Inspektah Deck, Mobb Deep, and Redman with some solid appearances by a couple others.

The plays also provided less known monologes for auditions. Additionally, the various plays provided ample selections of scenes for scene study work.

This disc from 1967 is among the latest batch to make the move to the digital format, and it's very welcome. Thought not one of his biggest sellers, \\"In London\\" perfectly sums up Trini's appeal. There's a mix of singalong tunes (the Lopez original \\"Happy\\"); reworked covers of then-current hits (a swinging \\"Strangers in the Night\\" and a rather sexy reading of \\"Mame\\"); standards (a hand-clapping \\"It Had to Be You\\"); and a few surprises, including a solid take on take on the Rolling Stones' \\"Lady Jane.\\" The singles from the album -- \\"Gonna Get Along Without Ya' Now\\" and the double-sided \\"Takin' the Back Roads\\" (wonderful!) and \\"Your Ever Changin' Mind\\" -- didn't break out to become huge hits, but it doesn't reflect the quality of the album.

I liked the song about Massachusetts, because it seemed honest.However, after listening to the entire two-disc set, I can't understand why the Bee Gees were so popular for a long time.

The digital remastering is identical to all other releases. There is however, a lyric booklet which is sorely missing from all other releases.

I couldn't ask for a better collection - it's like I had burned this for myself."},{"rating":"1","title":"OVERPRODUCED SYMPHONIC MESS","review":"In the case of the Bee Gees, less is more.

All albums have been covered,including their 2001 release.I should you guys to purchase the CD itself and let the tracks speak for themselves.You will love the new recordings of \\"Emotion\\", \\"Heartbreaker\\", \\"Islands In The Stream\\" and \\"Immortality\\"......Absolutely amazingly done. These songs are worth the money,and also the packaging is really done well......Go for it!!! Highly recommended.I loved \\"EMOTION\\" the best.I wonder why they didn't come up with tracks like \\"Chain Reaction\\",\\"Woman In LOVE\\"........Awwww......that would have been great too...But this is a GREAT compilation."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tragedy","review":"I love the bee gees.I love the songs Night fever,tragedy Stayin alive, Macchuetess, You should be dancing,How deep is your love, Guilty ,Fanny, To love somebody, I startd a joke and many others.

As we neared out destination, I picked up the cd jewel box and read the list of songs on it. I noticed a song called \\"Heartbreaker\\" which was originaly sung by Dione Warwick. I remembered the Bee Ges doing this song on their previous cd called 'One Night\\". On that cd the boys only recorded about 1 minute of the song. Since I didn't hear it with her, can someone tell me if this CD has the full length recording of this song? Many thanks. By the way, the parts of the cd that I did hear were all wonderful and brought back many memories of my better days."},{"rating":"2","title":"They're not the greatest, but they're really great","review":"The Bee Gees are a really great band that made great music in almost any genre imaginable. They even had a Hard rock track on one of their early 70's album (Mr Natural's Heavy Breathing). comparing them to the Beatles won't do them any justice because they both belong to two different worlds. The Bee Gees are the greatest at what they do and the Beatles were the greatest at what they did. So stop these meaningless arguments and enjoy the music.

They managed to remain popular during the 60's, 70's, 80's and 90's. They are the only group that has managed to have 5 singles in the US top 10 and this is a feat that will be hard pressed to be topped or matched. They have managed to go with what is popular and have changed their image numerous times and their ability to write amazing lyrics have often been overlooked and their vocal abilities must be considered some of the best in the business. The book-let is one of the better produced with nice shot photographs, intresting text and an outlay that has awesome font and the only problem is that they decided not to include the lyrics. Even so this is a stupendous greatest hits album from one of the most succesfull rock/disco bands ever."},{"rating":"2","title":"100% Pure Playboy","review":"A few corny scene set ups are a part of the package, of course, but this video fully deserves its five stars. High quality photography. Stacy Sanches is spectacular: achingly voluptuous figure, very sexy eyes and lips, gorgeous skin, and a great dancer whose hip movements really focus the mind. In short, an outstanding Playmate at all levels of dress and undress (anf fortunately here there's plenty of undress). But for many, the highlight here will be the additionally featured Playmate, Donna D'Errico: a classic Playboy blond beauty (and perhaps the best example of the Playboy-Baywatch connection). Donna is incredibly sexy and fun from her first moments on the screen, and it just keeps getting better and better. The scene in red and the fantasy routine in the back of the limo stay in one's imagination for a long time. This video is a great way to get locked onto Playboy (if you weren't already)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Both hot women","review":"Im not exactly sure why I dont give this five stars since it is a very hot video and both playmates are very sexy but there is something missing overall. Stacy has one of the all-time great bodies and Donna is really built but its not exactly the best in video. Still a very good video."},{"rating":"1","title":"Excrement","review":"In an age of loose morals and available prostitution this video still manages to offend me."},{"rating":"1","title":"never received so how do you rate that?","review":"Will never order from this vendor.

My husband has wanted me to erase the parade and stadium events because they take up a good deal of room on the DVR, now that we have the CD's.

I am really sorry I spent so much money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome Phillies Action!","review":"My husband was so excited to get these DVD's for Christmas since he has waited 28 years for the Phillies to win the World Series. The games and the extra footage shown on the dvd's are awesome!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great set, one annoyance","review":"This is a great dvd set for any Phillies fan. But as mentioned previously, you really have to wonder what genius decided to place the MLB watermark in the upper right of the frame. Though it's small, it gets distracting. A simple lower opacity watermark in the lower 3rd would have sufficed. We get it, we're watching an MLB product. A glaring negative on an otherwise great product."},{"rating":"2","title":"GO PHILLIES!!","review":"This is an excellent summary of the Phillies 2008 World Series victory.

Prior to DVD, the best you'd find were VHS cassettes of NFL Films blooper reels. With this set, I can relive every moment of NLCS Game 4 and 5, and every game of the World Series in widescreen format.The packaging design is fantastic, with stats and facts on each DVD case.

He takes Aine's lyrics and uses them in their concert!!! Because of that, he decides that Aine should be their lyricist, and she does.Even though I highly recommend this book, it is rated M for mature.

The main female character is so weak she cannot stand up for herself and depends on guy to stand up for her every time. The guy happens to be very hot and all the other girls have a crush on him. If you can get pass the idea that the girl is really weak then i guess the story ain't so bad. The artwork isn't bad."},{"rating":"1","title":"Broken","review":"1. The songs are all mislabeled. 2.

When reading this book, one tends to find themselves imagining that the contents are based upon a wonderfully moving, humourous, exciting and particularly enlightening feature film starring the immensely talented and deep-thinking Shirley MacLaine. Instead, amazingly......... the book is autobiographical and therefore makes absolutely stunning reading. I have read many books by Shirley MacLaine and within all of them, there is a complete honesty which made me personally, look a little deeper into my own life.

I have fond memories of this from my childhood and purchased it for my daughters (I guess I was expecting something a little more substantial). Even though there are only 24 pages and a handful of poems and prayers, I think it is a sweet collection, and one I plan on using for memory work for my children."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Sissy Duckling","review":"I am furious that I was sold a bootlegged copy of the Sissy Duckling!

She called the company and was told another could be shipped in 8 weeks - too long! With difficulty, she returned it to the store (BABIES ARE US), where they had three others in stock. She took one home, unpacked it and found it had almost identical damage. Back to the store. It turned out that three of the four changing tables were similarly damaged due to how the company packages the item. She did manage to get the fourth one available and is happy with the item (the only reason I give it 2 stars). This is unacceptable, especially given the price of the item and that my poor nine month pregnant sister had to go to these difficult lengths. I was VERY unhappy with the furniture company and will not purchase with them ever again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good job, Dad.","review":"My Dad wrote this book in 1942 when I was a year old.

These CD's are not the original artists as the label clearly lies to you. I bought this a couple years back as Tower Records was dying and got it for just a few bucks. I paid way too much. The label says \\"Made in the E.C.\\" which I guess means the \\"European Community\\" as elsewhere it admits to being made in Holland. Perhaps they mean that the CD tracks are all by \\"Original Artists\\"... as in ones so original you've never heard them before, but the boxes name all the original hitmakers. But, if any of them are on these discs, those tracks are studio takes that didn't get released. My ear says these are all sound-a-likes and not good enough to make listening enjoyable. It's tiring in fact, because your ear is searching for the familiar and not finding it. It's a real annoying experience. Steer clear of this pile."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good story","review":"Other reviews will tell you more about the story that I will. I will say that the story was written in a non-fluid way that made getting through the text rather slow, but the story and it's originality were great.

The colors are washed out, grainy and soft, and sound lacks any kind of stereo/surround luster. It appears as if they used some old and cheap copies to produce their DVDs. I only would hope that another company gets hold of the masters and cleans 'em up for true quality DVDs. The original episodes in Japanese language with English subtitles would be nice if digitally remastered properly. Voyager Entertainment is the worse effort for this type of material."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great series bad dvd treatment","review":"The Series Space Battleship Yamato, and it's u.s. counterpart starblazers deserve to be remastered. Mono sound is not acceptible in this day in age, neither is 1980's style bad video quality transfers from vhs , or laserdisc. Voyager Entertainment needs to talk to Mr. Leiji Matsumoto, or whomever currenttly owns the copywrite and convince them to make new digital source masters. Now all they have to do is track down the original japanese and english dialogue tracks, and music and possible original stills, hand drawn cartoon artboards to do the remastering. The original telecine reels would work nicely, just like Rhino used for transformers remaster. They want to see how remastering is done they should talk to the people who remastered star wars, and Star Trek to dvd with beautiful pristine images and 5.1 digital sound."},{"rating":"1","title":"Voyager Entertainment Sucks","review":"These DVD presentations of the fantastic YAMATO movies are typically bad, but BE FOREVER YAMATO in particular (the fourth film) is the worst DVD I have ever seen. The colors are washed out, there's no detail, and it looks like it was recorded off a TV with a bad cable reception using a VHS tape that's been used 300 times. What an insult to a great movie. Voyager Entertainment needs to take a cue from the ROBOTECH REMASTERED series and present YAMATO (the series too) in sparkling new digital transfers. BE FOREVER in particular is begging for an anamorphic widescreen presentation (the film switches to a widescreen aspect ratio for dramatic effect when the crew enters the Dark Nebula). Come to think of it, why does ROBOTECH get such grand treatment and YAMATO, the granddaddy of anime, is left to fester on these criminally overpriced DVDs that are completely unwatchable?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good","review":"this one is good.Its fit to the body so close. we can use this after 6 month.My son is 4 year old, he is small for 4 year old.Xs is for 3 years old."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Product","review":"I felt this product worked as it was designed.

Having shopped around in 'real' stores, I at last found a swing with the features I needed here on line. While this seat nicely fits two, I personally was looking for a seat to be cross legged and upright in. An especially nice feature is the adjustable back which allows for even an upright posture. A socket wrench was required though not specified in the directions. Visualizing the positioning of the ropes was a little tricky. Overall, it was failry simple to construct and has a sturdy quality."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best lawn swing ever!","review":"We have had our swing for 4 years and it is wonderful.

The seat is short and the back looks awkward the way it sits straight up. The first year I had it (last year) it blew over and the wood split in a few places. I've had to replace the wood and keep the swing because you no longer carry this item. It was expensive and I never have liked it.

The answers to these questions may surprise, but Bosher backs them up with solid readings, including plenty of primary sources.The book reads dry in places, and the person reading (like I was) simply to deepen their understanding of a somewhat confusing era may feel as if they need to skip a page here and there. However, there are some very quotable, very funny (even) places in the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"An explanation of the French Revolution.","review":"A well written history of the French Revolution. Bosher describes in detail why the French monarchy, along with the Catholic Church and nobility perished in this revolution/civil war. Louis XVI was a weak king with liberal political thinking. He strove to be inclusive in leading a reform of the financial administration. However when the nobels and provinces rebelled at this event, he called the Estates General to go directly to the people. The Estates General evolved into a legislative grouping further taking away power from the French monarch.Eventually, the groupings of different factions splitered the country and caused the King and much of the royal family to be killed.Bosher does a great job of detailing why the French Revolution occurred. As such, it was not simply a class war, but a frecturing of society that led to the political reformation of European society.

Returned!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad Customer Service","review":"I bought this phone, absolutely loved it, but when it was just over a year old (just out of warranty), I broke the belt clip. Called V-Tech, they said they couldn't get a clip for it any more. I asked to be bumped up to a supervisor, who nicely said that they were just on order, not in stock, and would I like two when they got them in? I said yes, but two months later when I called, even though they have a record of me as a customer in their system (located by phone number), they had NO RECORD of the previous conversation, and again told me that the belt clip was no longer available.Nice phone, but I will NEVER order another V-Tech product, because of poor customer service, and being lied to. I have three of their phones, one now has a display that is funky, another has sticking keys. I will eventually replace them with ANY brand except V-Tech, and them write them a letter, telling them why."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ok phone with poor usebility","review":"This phone is just ok, but has some major usebility flaws. Top 2 are:1. No way to switch from handheld call to speakerphone without major feedack.2. Most annoying is when you are on line 1, and line 2 rings, and rings LOUD in your ear, and your voice is muter to ther person on the other end at the same time. I don't know about everyone else, but this is a business phone to me, and when it sounds like I have call-waiting to my customer on the other end, it's amateur hour.Only problem is I bought this phone after I returned a 2-line cordless Panisonic with similiar issues.It's like wating for Gadot. Hopefully I'll find the perfect 2-line cordless phone someday; I'm not holding my breath."},{"rating":"1","title":"keypad goes bad after a year or so + Poor customer service","review":"I am very disappointed that after only about a year, the keypad on the handset went bad.

I will never buy another VTech product again!"},{"rating":"1","title":"2 Line not as Good as Single Line","review":"As a satisfied owner of VTech' single line phone I was surprised to find the programing and caller ID retrieval functions far more complicated on the 2 Line phone. Another feature lacking on the \\"new\\" 2 line phone is the ability of the phone to recognize which line is ringing and automatically pick of that line when the handset is removed from the base. My 10 year old AT & T 2 line phone does this and I miss it."},{"rating":"1","title":"The worst phone ever","review":"The sound quality of this phone is awful. Sometimes you hear a dial tone from the other line. The phone cuts out and rings loudly when the other line rings. I wish I would have returned it. I'm putting this thing in the basement and buying a better quality phone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed with this phone","review":"I too was disappointed to realize that this phone doesn't have a line-in-use indicator, and that the backup battery will not power the phone during a power outage. Both features were present on earlier VTech models. Also the speakerphone isn't nearly as good as my previous model VTech 2-line. This phone is a big step back, feature-wise. What really burns me is six months out of warranty, the displays on both the base and the handset are losing segments. The handset is no longer readable, and both displays get less readable by the week. VTech wants over half what the phone cost to repair it, and I'm afraid it will just go out again in a year. I don't recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'm suprised they still sell this phone","review":"in Office Max and Staples. Brought mine before I came across these reviews. The message and call light were cute features. Very convenient. But the volume was too low whenever I added a headset.

I'm returning it this afternoon for a better model."},{"rating":"2","title":"Roller mount needs better engineering","review":"Great trainer, the resistance is good, the product is solid and the mechanics of the roller and resistance unit are superb. I have a lot of confidence in those parts holding up. The plastic mount plate for the resistance and roller unit is not well designed. The bolt and sleeve that hold it on (allows the resistance unit to be rotated up and down) is sloppy. That may be insignificant when it is tightened up against the tire, but it's one of those \\"feels cheap\\" things that you would think they would take care of after building everything else so well. Also, they offer a replacement tightening bolt for \\"when\\" it strips. Nice of them to admit that this part will eventually crap out, but again, how dumb to make such an insignificant part on the cheap when the other main components are top-of-the-line. All told, it's reliable and smooth enough that all you have to worry about is your work out, not the equipment."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful!","review":"I bought this for my husband to use and he LOVES it! The only thing I can say negative is that it is quite noisy and he has to have the TV turned way up in order to hear the directions above the noise of his spinning."},{"rating":"2","title":"nice trainer. instructions don't cover it all though","review":"i just got this trainer and have put about 50 miles on it so far. very nice. great feel. the instructions makes this a 4 star rating. it does a good job explaining/showing how to put it together. what then threw me for a loop was what i was to do with the included skewer and the cup with the skewer adapter. there is zero explanation of what to do, why i should change the skewer, how to change the cup, etc. thankfully, all the explanation i needed for what, why, how was on youtube."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great customer service to replace defective product","review":"The frame sleeve for the l-bolt is not welded properly. Assembly is impossible because of the poor workmanship. I do not see any similar issues in other reviews so maybe this is a one off and not a sign of larger problems with manufacturing.However the customer service response was great. I sent a mail on Saturday evening describing the problem. By Saturday night, Erin in customer service had promised to send out a new frame."},{"rating":"2","title":"very nice","review":"I really like this unit compared to the Cyclops magnitrainer and fluid 2 trainer. Seems well made and almost like real riding."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thats one ncie trainer!","review":"The Kurt Kinetic has become a somewhat permanent fixture in my living room. Although the wife thinks its misplaced, she does like the convenience it brings to her life (as do I). It feels nice, it's pretty quiet (my 7mo old and my 20mo old sleep while I'm using it 20' away), and it's Kawasaki green paint job is second to none. Install and setup were a breeze. The only recommendation I can make is be sure to buy a trainer tire unless you want to burn through your normal outdoor/road tire."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cold snowy winters on a trainer","review":"I am avid cyclist living in Upsate New York where the winters are cold and snowy. I spend more time than I like riding indoors on a trainer. I have used two other trainers for the past several years before purchasing the Road Machine. There is a world of difference. The Road Machine has a much truer road feel and I can actually get a great work out on it. It has quality construction and is easy to assemble. If you are looking for a trainer, I highly recommend the Road Machine. It may be a bit costlier than some other brands, but it is clearly worth it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great indoor exercise!","review":"This is a great indoor bicycle trainer. I got this for my husband for Christmas and he loves it! It is good quality construction. It takes up just a little space when not in use. This is his first bicycle trainer, so we have nothing to compare this to, but rate this 5 Star. The price was $319, the quality is there. The Super Saver Shipping sure helps."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great trainer!","review":"Length:: 1:38 MinsThis trainer was super easy to set up. It literally took about 5 minutes to go from opening the box to mounting my bike. I have only put a few miles on it so far, but I can tell that I'm going to have a great time working out this winter when it is too cold to ride outside (I'm a huge wimp when it comes to cold weather). It is also really quite when in operation. I was riding it at 20mph and the noise wasn't too bad at all, most of the noise came from my bike's drive train and not the trainer. This applies to any trainer, but I recommend that you buy a high velocity fan to go with this because without any wind (even though we cyclists normally HATE the wind) it is really easy to work up a sweat in stagnate air."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic Purchase","review":"The Kinetic by Kurt Road Machine was a fantastic purchase. It is very quiet, it doesn't wake anyone else up in my house when riding at ~250W. I can have a comfortable conversation when riding with someone sitting next to me. It is built solid and the resistance unit doesn't get hot even after an hour, just warm to the touch for me (when riding in ambient temp of ~78F). I have had no problems with the spindles staying tight in the holders."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it","review":"When I can't get outside I turn on the DVR hop on the trainer and have a great and healthy ride."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent","review":"I've been using it almost every day and I am really happy with it. It is very sturdy and it makes very little noise. I like it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Solid and very quiet","review":"Just got this a few days ago and have been very impressed with its stability and ease of setup. I've used other trainers before, and this one is amazingly quiet and stable. I also love the quick release feature, so swapping out bikes takes literally 30 seconds (important because my son and I both use it).It's very quiet and does NOT get hot. Used it for 2 hours and it was just warm to the touch, but certainly not hot."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great","review":"This product has been as good as advertised. Since buying this, I have ridden hundreds of miles without issue. My speeds are typically between 12 and 18 mph, and the resistance feels life like even at the 18 mph range.I did tighten the tire way too tight at one point which wore down the tread on my tire, but the instructions do give specifications on how much to tighten it.Assembly was relatively easy and hooking the bike up was simple. I would highly recommend this for anyone wanting to ride their bike in the comfort of their home."},{"rating":"2","title":"Quiet and Easy","review":"The trainer arrived proptly and was a snap to set up. I use the trainer through the week and I can have my bike off the trainer and out the door in under 45 seconds for a week end ride in the great outdoors. Although it is quiet, it is not silent so you will need to make some volume adjustment to your music/video source."},{"rating":"1","title":"A trainer is a trainer is a trainer","review":"I expected more from the descriptions and reviews. Basically it is just another trainer. I found it does not imitate the feel of riding on the road. A low gear is ok, but larger gears and you run into the same old problem of increasing resistance that does not mimic the feel of the road. On a side note, I was very disappointed wit hthe wireless computer. Turns out it is not truely wireless as you have the cadence wire. display is small for an indoor trainer. All in all I would recomend on of the more advanced trainers with the PC interaction etc."},{"rating":"1","title":"Far too frustrating to mount the bike","review":"I live in Colorado so training indoors in the winter is a fact of life here. My husband and I both use this trainer, so we switch bikes daily. I have found mounting the bike on the trainer so frustrating and difficult I often spend up to 10 minutes fighting to get the bike in the trainer. The legs often collapse when trying to get the bike in the trainer. Once in the trainer it works ok, but I'm so frustrated by that point. The positive thing is I'm so frustrated by the time I jump on my bike I get a good workout! If it weren't so expensive, I'd have taken it to Goodwill and bought a Cycleops trainer."},{"rating":"2","title":"excellent choice","review":"excellent product.I stopped using rollers recently and converted to a trainer.After researching in detail, the Kinetic took the purchase.Very happy with the product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just what I was hoping for","review":"I live in a small Manhattan apartment, so a cheap wind trainer was not an option for me. Have been on it 4 times a week this winter and none of my neighbors have come knocking on my door to complain. I set it up without really looking at the instructions, so it's not complicated to figure out. I do suggest you get a trainer specific tire or it will slip (at least mine did)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Product","review":"I'm new to cycle trainers, but after researching around it sounded like this one was the best. I have to say, I'm very happy with it. Easy to use, quiet, and gives a great ride. I'd highly recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good trainer","review":"Bought this for fitness versus serious bike training and to replace my old stationary bike. It does the job well and takes up a lot less space than the stationary bike. I haven't tried any other trainers out, so I can't compare, but it was noisier than expected and difficult for me to get my bike placed on the unit correctly. But as I use it more that should get easier for me. Overall, I am pleased with this unit."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Trainer","review":"This is the only trainer that I have owned so I have to qualify this review. I researched trainers online fairly extensively before making my purchase. My research led me to this being the most appropriate trainer for me. One thing that impressed me about it was that it lived up to all the hype I read about it. I don't often find products that this can be said of. Initially I thought that was not as quiet as they claimed but found that there is some break in period for the bike tire and resistance wheel. In no time however I found it to be as quiet as it was said to be. I thoroughly enjoy the ride. No trainer will ever be the same as riding the road but when conditions don't permit this is a great substitute."},{"rating":"2","title":"TeLL Me More","review":"Tell Me More is a great product for language learning. It teaches the way you learned your language, speaking then doing the grammar.

You can't expect to be able to speak the language fluently without, well, SPEAKING IT!!!!! T.M.M covers the speaking and listening part of the language really well. I know that some people are like \\"This is horrible for beginners... bla bla bla\\". This used to be a problem but know they have a program with a COMPLETE BEGINERS level.

The two authors, who between them have about 1/100th of Sontag's intelligence, integrity, and imagination, written in the most pedestrian prose possible, set about to undo her reputation.Each time they credit her with something, within the next sentence or two they somehow take it back, or cast doubt on it. Only her battles with cancer are described with anything like sympathy.Apparently it is beyond them that a woman, and a beautiful woman at that, could produce some of the most important essays of our time. That she has changed her position on some issues is treated as some sort of betrayal, hypocracy, or attempts to jump on a particular bandwagon. Perhaps, like the intelligent woman she is, she re-thought some of her earlier positions.Why they wrote this book is beyond me."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Star Is Born","review":"Always an admirer of Ms. Sontag's work, but admitting all the time I probably didn't know half of what she talked about, this book made me realize I bought into the Role, the Persona of Sontag. My admiration of her was a guilty pleasure, an enjoyment of the image. What she did do however was make me pursue the writers, the works of art she mentioned and gave those people and objects a validity that insured me of their importance even if I didn't understand what that importance was. I cannot image how these two writers managed to write this book. Their research material must be overwhelming. It is a rivieting mesmerizing account I am greatly enjoying.

It's something that should be read by all Christians but especially for people who struggle with who they are, what their life is worth and what God thinks of us. It talks about how people judge their own worth by their careers, relationships with other people, and what material things they have in this life.

You begin to recognize the Catch 22s and vicious cycles that you get sucked in to.The summary of this book can be found on page 10: \\"As Christians, our fulfillment in this life depends not on our skills to avoid life's problems, but on our ability to apply God's specific solutions to those problems.

Anytime I find I am being tossed about on the choppy, merciless waves of the opinions of people, I find comfort in the message of this book. Because I took its message to heart, I have been more successful in life than I could have ever imagined. People comment on how amazingly stress-free I seem in spite of a demanding job, and I can attribute this all to this book.

While I was out jogging with my 25lb sheltie (on leash), I encountered an elderly man with two large dogs off leash. The dogs began growling and running toward me and my dog. The man called his dogs, but they didn't respond. I picked up my dog to prevent him from getting attacked by these two dogs and kept moving. As I moved past the dogs, I readied my Direct Stop in case a dog jumped up at us. The man finally got his dogs (they were still not leashed).Once we were 50 feet away, I put my dog back on the ground. I looked behind us, and within seconds, one of the unleashed dogs began running full speed at us, snarling the whole way. Lucky for me, I had the Direct Stop in hand. When the dog was within 10 feet of us, I sprayed the dog in its face. The attacking dog stopped immediately and ran back to its owner! Direct Stop saved me and my dog today. It works!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I use it and it works.","review":"I have used this spray to stop my dog from barking at night. It works without hurting him. I guess the spray is distracting and the smell is annoying.I also use this when I go jogging... plenty of my neighbors let their dogs run wild, and I have occasionally encountered aggressive dogs. This spray definitely distracts dogs from moderate aggression. Stomp your foot and shout and spray the dog in the face and it will definitely change its mind about being assertive."},{"rating":"2","title":"But not on Bears","review":"I've had to use this product several times while at my local dog park. My dog is also like the other reviewers terririzer - her head spins and turns into Satan if another female dog comes near her. The spray has settled a couple of little fights but didn't stop one particularly bad fight. I used the entire can but it didn't deter either dog. So mild aggression will be detered but a determined dog won't be detered...and as the label says, it doesn't work on bears either. I still highly recommend the product and keep a can in my car at all times."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good insurance policy","review":"I've never had a reason to use this yet, but I like having it available. Originally I bought it to go to the dog run after reading horror stories about agressive dogs and worrying I wouldn't be able to stop a fight if needed to protect my dog. I've never had a problem, though, so i've never actually used it. I have noticed that they keep this in the training/play room at the ASPCA, so it must be a safe but effective product. If you are looking for something to bring to a dog run in case your dog is in a fight, you could also use a simple bottle of water - I once saw a fight over a toy stopped by someone shaking water on the dogs. Totally harmless, and it seems like it would be just enough to redirect their attention."},{"rating":"1","title":"Won't stop agressive dogs","review":"Just a warning,,as someone else stated this will not stop an agressive attack nor will it stop a pitbull. I have a greyhound that was attacked by a pitbull and I actually had to jump on the pitbull and wrestle it off as the direct stop was no more effective then spraying the pit with Chanel number 5. Once we were \\"attacked\\" but some little yappy mutt type dog and it did make the dog hesitate for a few moments which was long enough for us to get away ( generally greyhounds won't fight) but if you are looking for something to stop a real all out attack, this won't do it. I am pretty sure the directions even state it will stop mild to moderately agressive attacks ( it also says it won't work on bears,,,well duh) so you know what you are getting. I carry pepper spray rather then this product,,however one more thing. Pepper spray can blow back on the user, if Direct Stop does you'll never know it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't help","review":"I bought this product after my dog trainer recommended it to help separate my two dogs when they fight. Well, it didn't even phase them. Perhaps it's more helpful in stopping a single off-leash dog coming at you."},{"rating":"1","title":"down the drain","review":"I don't remember what inspired me to buy this book, but GOD is it boring. The author thinks he is the only one to understand Nostadamus, and proves it by droning on for page after page of mindless drivlle."},{"rating":"2","title":"Subtle Intellect","review":"The excellent scholarship that lies behind David's work mimics the 16th century's scholar's dedication to clarity and accuracy. This book will not be a clear or easy read for the mass market. However, clarity must not be confused with simplicity. This book is clear to some. Simple, it is not. The green language is, by nature, a code, and thus unreadable without its key. David supplies this key and opens a new door of understanding to those willing to invest a little time in thought. The green language was used because of its unique ability to express the most subtle of intellectual ideas. it was also used to shield these ideas from the calumny of the unlearned masses. Thus, revealing the code will certainly open the author to calumny, the student to enlightenment, and all fools to a field upon which they may practice there art."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pompous, full of false promises","review":"Unfortunately, the book does not deliver what it promises. The author indicates a new method of interpreting the quatrains, i.e. the Green Language. As with most writers about Nostradamus, however, he spends a great deal of time with a posteriori predictions (\\"postdictions\\"). If he has truly found a new way of accurately interpreting the quatrains, then why is he not able to provide predictions? The author makes a lame argument that Nostradamus, himself, specifically wrote in a manner to make predictions impossible. Additionally, the author writes in the first person plural, which I found incredibly pompous and annoying. Save your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Funny (in both ways)","review":"A book for the Schadenfreude crowd. How an author makes a complete fool of himself.He very aptly and concretely shows up in certain quatrains, where other interpreters cheated; and then goes on, cheating himself autrageously. Or he just leaves out half of the text of a quatrain to show his theories fit.He shows us, how little is known about Nostradamus (correctly), only to use the sentence \\"in Nostradamus very own way\\" or \\"as Nostradamus saw it\\" or similar turns of phrase, whenever he gets stuck with his system of interpretation.On the whole, he is almost as inventive as Rowling, but misses all the charm of Harry Potter. So - stick with Harry Potter, it's much more fun and tells you maore about live."},{"rating":"1","title":"Seductive but false","review":"Much as we would like to believe that someone has special powers to predict the future, there is no such person.Nostradamus' predictions are written in vague terms, you can twist them around after something has happened to try to prove that \\"hey Nostradamus predicted it!\\" So now we have this book that claims a new way of interpreting his writings. Gee.Think: why is it that no-one who's used these \\"prophecies\\" to forecast the future have done any better than someone who just makes an educated guess?It's much tougher to rely on your own thinking and reasoning skills to get through life, than to hope someone has all the answers...but that is really the best way."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must-read for lovers of Jewish history and thought","review":"This was a powerful and fascinating book that delves deep into Jewish history.

I use Monster PowerCenter to protect my home audio equipment. On top of the surge protection I didn't want the expensive appliances to be exposed to the electrical interferences from other appliances like the dishwasher to compromise the longevity of their longevity. I think it was overdue.While for home audio I need anything combing out of the wall to be suppressed I only needed power to be suppressed for these equipment so the ISOBARs fit the bill.I have no use for it, but the backside of the ISOBAR ULTRAs have a few mounting screws.

It's a substantial and heavy piece of equipment with a classic and plain, no-nonsense design.

I know it's not the \\"Home Theater\\" designated Isobar model, but didn't want to pay an extra $30-40 just for that...I figure this will do the job.

The true test will be when I get the next lightning strike near my neighborhood, but I have faith in Tripp Lite's reputation. The last strike blew up two less expensive surge protectors from APC and Belken, the failure cost me one computer and two scorched surge protectors. The strike actually blew through both surge protectors that were connected in line with each other then fried my motherboard. Now I'm willing to pay the extra cost for the top quality ISOBAR series. All my electronics have one and I will buy more as needed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Character oriented science fiction tragedy","review":"Note - my 4 stars for this book is based on the scale that Amazon shows when you mouse over - I liked this book. I found it better than okay, but I salos didn't find it game changing literature.I will second the thought that some reviewers had that this book is perhaps a little slow. It probably could have been shorter and had more action. But I don't think it would have been the same book. Instead of an introspective tragedy about a crew doomed by their own humanity, it would have just been a space opera version of The Poseidon Adventure and not as successful. However, if you have the attention span of a modern (as in 2011) teenager, you probably won't like this book.On the other hand, if you have patience and a liking for cerebral writing, The Wreck of the River of Stars will reward you with rich character study, plausible science, and an overall well crafted story."},{"rating":"1","title":"Read \\"Please Understand Me II\\"","review":"This book is completely overhyped. Although the author is a great wordsmith, this book is dry, uninspired, and artificial. It is the fictional version of Please Understand Me and an attempt to show all possible interactions between the sixteen personality types at an excruciating level of detail.This book is a fine example of the situation where research has replaced creativity and inspiration. Unfortunately, even the research was restricted to a single book while the whole situation can easily be transposed to any historical setting that involves ships and the sea.Truly a work of mechanistic extrapolation, The Wreck of the River of Stars is simply tedious."},{"rating":"1","title":"Over hyped, slow start -- left in first Chapter","review":"I went on a retreat this weekend looking forward to a highly rated and reviewed book. I didn't make it through the first chapter of stilted character introductions. If I hadn't read the reviews and jacket flap I would have been totally clueless as to what this story was even about.The idea of magnetic sail space ships providing luxury accomodation to decadent passengers only 40+ years in the future also set me off. Too soon, too slow, just an aching fabrication from the 1920's.Why is this book popular? Advertising budget is my guess."},{"rating":"1","title":"Drek","review":"I am not going to be particularly polite about this.

The author delves into the history, science, and theology of the Shroud of Turin. I call it the Resurrection Shroud of Christ for that is what it is. If you're being rational and objective, you simply cannot read this book and come to any other conclusion but that the Shroud was created at the moment of Jesus Christ's resurrection. It's not a relic of death but rather a relic of new life.I would highly recommend the DVDThe Fabric of Timeas a supplementary video to this exhaustive and extremely well researched book.The deniers and skeptics cling to the notion that the Shroud is a work of art from the Middle Ages. As you read this book you'll discover how absurd and irrational that viewpoint is. Jesus is Lord!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Resurrection of the Shroud: New Scientific, Medical, and Archeological Evidence","review":"This book is far more comprehensive than others that I have read about the subject.

Yujiro disappers but you never find out what happens between him and baki or between him and the guy they let out of prison to kill yujiro.You also never find out what happens between baki and kozway.There is also a great style in it i would like them to go further into. I know a little jiu-jitsu in reality. However the principle of aiki is a cool concept and although it's the basic principle of balance and balance points there are some concepts of ki in it.

And the real showcase of this album, the 12 minute version of the Jimmy Hendrix song \\"RED HOUSE\\". This song really smokes! I've heard many versions of this song, but this one is the best I've heard. The rest of the album is mostly your basic blues rock. More on the rock side than the blues.

There is not a single track on the album you will want to hear in entirety. This is coming from a fan whose favorite album of all time is \\" Men without women\\". If your thinking of buying this do yourself a favor and listen to what Little Steven was - not what he became. Absolute crap music. Nevermind his continual political rants that NOBODY wants to hear."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fine Effort by a Talented Musician","review":"In some ways this record is a departure from the usual Little Steven music but it still delivers the goods. Steven wrote, produced, and in large part performed the entire album. He is backed by two of the best talents in rock music today: Jon Bonham on drums and Adam Clayton of U2 on bass. This disc rocks a little harder than most of Little Steven's music, but it just shows a different side of his prodigious talent. Recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"What a selling point!","review":"I haven't even got the CD yet but what a testiment to Little Steven that after hearing \\"Salvation\\" twice, I HAD to have it! I never did that before with any artist, and I didn't even consider myself a fan! I ordered it from Amazon yesterday and can't wait to get it. Finally, somebody rocks again.

It's right here, thanks Little Steven."},{"rating":"1","title":"horrible","review":"If someone had told me 20 years ago that Little Steven could produce a record this bad I wouldn't have believed it. The music is third rate hard rock and is compounded by Little Steven's always deficient singing. The politics are laughable--who needs moral posturing from another middle aged rock/TV star from the cess pool that is modern rock music and Hollywood? The slogans he continually spouts are simplistic gibberish--as a grown up he should know better. This record continues Steven's decline both musically and lyrically.

The ad compared Little Steven to AC/DC and Led Zeppelin, if you want to hear good rock buy their albums instead. I found the lyrics sophomoric and childish at best. The only reason I gave it two stars is for Little Steven's guitar work and Jason Bonham's drumming. Don't even get me started on this guys voice. He is a good guitar player but he really needs to find a singer/songwriter to work with. Despite all this there are a few redeeming qualities to this album. My advise is try to find a used copy somewhere, as a matter of fact you can have mine."},{"rating":"2","title":"A totally rocking album!","review":"I first heard this album at a friend's party, and had to have it, immediately! Bought it the next morning. I've been a fan of his music for ages, and this album doesn't disappoint. I believe \\"Born Again Savage\\" - his fifth album - is the most aggressively rocking album Little Steven has made. The sounds of his youth - British rock, with some Dylan and punk mixed in, is obvious. \\"Born Again Savage\\" was the last in a series of sociopolitical projects he conceived in the '80's, with the themes being: the individual, the family, government, economics, and religion. It is perfect with Jason Bonham on drums, and with U2's Adam Clayton on bass.

The way it creates the little slit and tucks the flap inside is ingenious, and seems to hold just as well as a metal staple would.

This worked for a brief period til the glue gave up on holding. Because it's plastic, the pieces are hard to bond together. I used industrial strength glue and it did no good.

For those who seek eternal life from God, read the Gospel of John and drink freely of Christ's living water.

In an effort to be \\"seeker sensitive, \\" hundreds of churches have watered down the gospel, softening the harder truths with a blend of feel good gushiness and pop psychology. Dr. MacArthur, with bravery equal to his more secular military namesake, tackles the gospel head on. His explanation of the Reformed faith is simple to understand, bringing to mind Mark Twain's assertion that he did not worry too much about the parts of the Bible he could not understand, the parts he could were enough to worry him. Yet, despite the stark honesty, the book makes it plain that God loves us, and He wants us all saved. God's sovereignity and love are the message of this book. You will come away convicted and reassured. ****Reviewed by Amanda Killgore."},{"rating":"2","title":"OUTSTANDING!!!!!!!!!!","review":"This book is outstanding!! MacArthur does a fantastic job of not only telling us why the seeker sensitive ecumenical movement is so dangerous, but he also defines a true believer as defined by the Bible.

I was surprised how a series 8 seasons in could still be so gripping and entertaining. Most shows would have just churned out more of the same, but this season really pushed the envelope. Well, except for Richard Dean Anderson, who was mostly phoning it in this season. Also, the last two episodes seemed out of place as the story clearly ended during the third to last episode. The last two feel almost as if they were done to complete a contract rather than actually forward a story.Overally, I was impressed with Stargate season 8.

Samantha Carter is blond, beautiful and billiant and what does she get as her love interest? Short, fat and balding. Yes, Samantha Carter's love interest is none other than the director's brother. Presumably in an attempt to make their relationship plausible, they have tried to portray the director's brother as funny and charming and it is really quite painful to watch. I wonder how many handsome, talented and charismatic actors were sidelined so that the director's brother could get the part? For shame."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good season marred by DVD mishap","review":"I won't go into detail about this season as many other reviewers have written wonderful synopsis of the episodes, but I will say this: a potentially five star season DVD has been reduced to two because it is simply not complete nor up to the quality of the season seven and six sets.

Except for the first season boxed set I have brought all the rest from Amazon - Zone 1 - when I am actually situated in a Zone 4 area. I was disappointed with this boxed set especially since there was no extended Threads episode but even the shortened one did not have a commentary. The Zone 4 boxed set was released on August 17 - well before the Zone 1 - and it contains more features and the extended Threads episode. I see from another review that the Zone 2 boxed set also has more features. So I've got to wonder why MGM didn't include the extras on the Zone 1 boxed set? Will the same happen to the Stargate Atlantis boxed set?"},{"rating":"1","title":"I LOVE THIS SHOW....BUT..........","review":"this DVD set comes with the shorter version of the episode \\"Threads\\".

The fax number turned out to belong to a private citizen unrelated to the manufacturer. So I had to return the item to Amazon. Well, so that's a 50% success rate with this item. I probably will try a third time though, since Amazon's return policy makes it risk-free for me.

The bottom shelf is a yellow color and does not match the table at all so for cheap it is ok but we will paint it this summer outside.

I have put together many pieces of furniture in my day so I like to think I know what I'm doing. The holes on these do not line up!! At all! I had to find another way to put the table together and finally got it to work. So I thought table two would surely take less time...I was wrong! The layout of the holes for each piece was even worse. The price is good and once put together they look nice, but to me it wasn't worth it! I would have returned them but after 2 hours, sweat and lots of cursing, I wasn't about to take them apart to ship back!

It's organic, which I guess is good if that matters to you. The gum appeal (chew) is very good: Chewy, not too sticky, and not too soft.The main downside is presentation. It comes as a ~5 bulk packed bag of licorice \\"pellets\\" (~3/4\\" cylinders). It's not unpleasant, and it's not the \\"sticky clump\\" the previous reviewer mentioned (perhaps his sat in the heat too long), but no one will be reaching for on the basis of looks...That said, it's good stuff, and it's the real thing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Solid block of sticky mess","review":"Yes, I know it was a five pound bag. What I didn't know is that it would be a soft sticky mass of licorice. I literally had to break it off in chunks to eat it. I tried putting it in the fridge, but that didn't really help. The flavor is good, but this product is no fun to eat. I certainly wouldn't try to put it in a lunch, the kid would be hassled for bringing a bag of dog doo to school.

When I brought it home and played it my first impulse was to play Frisbee with it until I heard 'Come into the Perfumed Garden, Maude'. Each listen made me love it more and then it dawned on me - Its The Fugs English cousins!! More musically inclined but not as obsessed, they had a charm that was irresistible. Sadly, their records were impossible to find and before the internet in 1969 the only R&R news came to us from RS or Melody Maker, if I was lucky enough to find a copy, so any mention of these guys were rare. To sum up, if you play this a few times you will come to love it and find their \\"charm\\", trust me!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Swinging with the Liverpool Scene","review":"I bought this album secondhand on vinyl when I was a teenager and cherished it. Yes some of the poetry is self-consciously \\"hip\\" and politically conscious, but so what -- if you like albums recorded by beatniks like The Fugs or Allen Ginsberg then you will love this album. And the first reviewer neglected to mention one more beautiful song, Gliders and Parks (Spiders and Larks) which is one of the most haunting songs of lost love I think I've ever heard. The songs that are good are very very good. No aficionado of hippie/beat culture can afford not to hear Percy Parslow's Hamster Farm or Burdock River Run.

His comments about the construction of the scale relate only to the Western \\"equal Temprament\\" system developed about 250 years ago. this therefore can't relate to a subject that claims to be some 2000 years old and from the Middle East which used/uses a totally different scale construction. I can't comment about the author's knowledge of Kabbalah but the relationship between the two is clearly fallacious. Very disappointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Exploitation of This TV Phenomenon!","review":"Despite brief comments from minor members of the \\"Top Ten\\" from various seasons of AMERICAN IDOL, this DVD offers little information that the viewer didn't already know. Without access to the actual program, we get very brief scenes of contestants performing outside of the show... comments from very minor celebrities and comedians- this all adds up to a very boring and uninformative waste of time. Season Two contestant Corey Clark gets a lot of attention(he was kicked off for having a criminal record, and later briefly caused a scandal by revealing he had a relationship with judge Paula Abdul). And most heinous of all is the amount of time spent viewing \\"nobodies\\" of various ages singing the Nationl Anthem in a mock-audition setting! This DVD isn't worth the time renting, let alone purchasing!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Total Waste of Time","review":"This DVD offers a boring hour of hurried 10-second opinions, jokes and quips from forgotten contestants still angry that they didn't win. They speak of producer-created conspiracies that marked them for slaughter - a process they claim had nothing to do with votes or talent.American Idol Unauthorized authorizes nothing we haven't already seen on TV or read in the tabloids. The most shocking \\"revelation\\" is the one involving Corey Clark and Paula. Who cares?In essence, a bunch of long-forgotten losers blame American Idol for not soaring them to fame and fortune. They have a grudge and a score to settle. They made this DVD and then pawned it off as something new and deliciously scandalous. It isn't even close, and it's about as exciting as watching grass grow."},{"rating":"1","title":"Booooring amateur advertisement for \\"Technotreff\\"","review":"I was immediately bored with this movie.

All I can say, they are probably created by preteen boys. At their age, I can't fault them for it because I liked Voltron at that age too.The series consist of mostly fighting. As such the enemies become more difficulty as the series progresses. So, it's episodes can be similar to that of Angelic Layer without the fun, enjoyment, and an actual storyline.There is some romance. It can be as stale and lacking as is in Green Green or DearS.For a similar fast pace action and better series look toward Angelic Layer. For romance, choose Chobits. If you want gut breaking heartbreak then Elfen Lied would be a good choice. Warning, Elfen Lied is not a kid friendly anime."},{"rating":"2","title":"Clever and entertaining.","review":"This book is, a hilarious look at wordplay, images, and symbolism towards a very serious subject... war. A lot of the literal ideas I do not totally get (give me a break, I'm 27) but I read it has to do w/ vietnam. It relates to any inane/insane fight based on questionable info... a breath from that... it's humor is really funny... the games he plays with words are genius, (a horse named I = I is a horse)... stuff like that. I would have given it 5 stars if I understood it more... but a great read, if I had not researched it and found out it was about Vietnam, I would have enjoyed its funkiness, just the same."},{"rating":"1","title":"A real pain to use this suitcase","review":"I liked the looks of the case, and the color was perfect and the price was very reasonable--$80.

However it's very annoying to see someone being proud and showing off, or maybe simply justifying the slaughter of 250,000 thousands civilians (without accounting for the long term damages and army casualties). Why don't we see it the other way. Would we enjoy a Japanese documentary saying that it was the right thing to do to kill the same amount of US civilians by H-bombs or whatever, because there were no other way they could win the war?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't be Fooled","review":"I purchased this flatware set earlier this summer. I thought that it had to be great quality stuff, because it was very heavy and I bought it from a reputable department store. Boy, was I wrong. I washed my set one time in the dishwasher and almost all of the pieces had rusted while in there. The cycle was 45 minutes long and it had a heated drying cycle. So it is not like my flatware was lying in puddles of water. I am very disappointed with the quality of this flatware. I should have purchased the Onieda flatware like my mom said. Be smart...go with someone else for your flatware needs."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is a Great Book!","review":"This isn't the kind of book I would normally buy. I don'tusually read historical fiction. In fact, I stick to John Grisham,Scott Turrow, and James Paterson. But since it was a gift, and since I needed something to read on my flight from NY to LA, I picked it up. Once I started reading, I couldn't put it down. The first part read like a thriller and the second part like a legal drama. There are so many things going on, and yet Pesci made it flow. It's a great read and even more stunning because it's a true story. I can't wait for Pesci's next book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Uncle Tom's Cabin?","review":"If you're looking for an anti-slavery tome, read \\"Uncle Tom's Cabin\\". Harriet Beecher Stowe did a better job of writing her story and she did not confuse her readers by mixing historical fact with fiction.Frankly, the writer does the slaves no service at all by their stereotyped portrayal. While the main character Cinque (sp?) is breathlessly described again and again as the noble ebony Adonis, the other slaves seem to suffer a bipolar disorder-- either they are sitting on the deck muttering among themselves, or they are jumping around hysterically, shrieking and waving their arms. Surely a more human portrait of the slaves would have been the more accurate.Too often, authors who aspire to promote a noble cause wind up editorializing instead of writing and the resulting work becomes stale and lifeless. I'm sorry to say that Pescis book is more in this vein. \\"A Tale of Two Cities\\" it is not."},{"rating":"2","title":"The classic videos are the best!","review":"I started using these videos in 1988 and enjoyed their incredible benefits until 1995. Nothing else compares to them. The intensity can be any level you choose to make it. The Boomers workout is by far the best, especially if high impact aerobics have take their toll on your joints. After a break, due to illness for 7 years ( I blew up like a toad) I am once again a Firm Believer and can attest that \\"muscle memory\\" is a fact. Do not hesitate to invest in these tapes, they are more effective than Denise Austin and Kathy Smith combined."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works great, just right","review":"PROs- This is one of my favorite Firm videos. It's not so easy that you'd get bored or feel under-challenged, not so hard that you'd give up. When you get stronger, just add poundage.- There's a sufficient variety of exercises and good sequencing to keep you from getting bored and/or too exhausted.- Step-ups with barbells interspersed with calf pumps are my favorite part, and if your heart wasn't pumping before this segment, it will be soon enough.- The squats are excellent--you really feel your thighs and legs getting exercised.- Jayne Poteet is a good instructor, w/ great cueing, counting down the number of reps at every 4 reps (16, 12, 8, 4). This works really well for me because I know I'm getting closer to the end of the set.- I like the stretch before and after the workout.CONs- Not too much of a \\"con\\" but I think a longer stretch routine (for all the Firm videos I've tried, actually) would be healthier and more effective."},{"rating":"2","title":"excellent workout","review":"I see that this video is no longer being made. I would recommend this workout because it is great. One of my favorite \\"FIRM\\" tapes. I do not use the barbell as suggested, instead I use hand weights and rest them on my shoulders as in other volumes of the \\"FIRM\\". If you can find this tape, I would highly recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"THE BEST!!","review":"This is my favorite weight training workout for when I have more time. The routines are simple, so I can learn them quickly, and the workout is VERY intense and rewarding. You'll feel like a work-horse when you're done. Just doing this once or twice a week will make you ALOT stronger and will improve your posture. It's the only weight training video that has kept my interest and I've been doing it for YEARS. Make sure you get steppers that are the appropriate height for your height. The FIRM folks will tell you which ones to get. You can't beat it; it's one of my top 3 overall.

As it became clear that these attacks had been committed in the name of Islam, the struggle became to understand how religion could be used to justify the slaughter of innocents. The media, the government, and ordinary citizens sought answers to questions: Who are the extremists who perpetrate such deeds? Why do they hate us? What do they hope to achieve? Does Islam teach that such terrorists are holy warriors? In this brief, clear-sighted, and accessibly written book, John Esposito, one of the world's most respected scholars of political Islam, provides answers to these and many other questions that have risen in the wake of the attacks.Teachers/Librarians: 9th to Adult - Social Studies/Humanities"},{"rating":"1","title":"Very well written, but belongs in the fiction section","review":"Professor Esposito is yet another Muslim apologist. Dr. Ali Sina of faithfreedom.org has challenged Dr. Esposito multiple times to debate him over whether Islam is really a religion of peace, or whether it is a religion of hate and intolerence. Dr. Esposito has never accepted Dr. Sina's challenge. If you really want to learn the truth about Islam, I recommend Ibn Warraq's book \\"Why I am not a Muslim\\". I also recommend \\"The Crisis of Islam\\" by Bernard Lewis (Lewis is another apologist, but he is brutally honest about some of Islam's more hateful teachings.) Remember, Islam is not a religion of peace, but that doesn't mean we need war with Muslims. Muslims are the primary victims of Islam. We can win without war if scholars like Dr. Esposito were only honest and able to convince Muslims that their religion is a lie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Missed it by a mile....","review":"Esposito sure has a nice way of glossing over the truth. The heart of the matter is missed and the fundamental force behind the Islamic faith is left in the corner of the closet somewhere. Since he shared his ideas, and we do have 1st Amendment rights, here are mine - the Islamic faith and the teachings of the Koran are to drive the believer of these misconceptions with a goal of world domination - religiously and if necessary, violently. How blatant and how clear the Koran is. How necessary for us to realize that to stop the core of this terrorism is to stop the spread of this \\"religious system\\", or dare I/we say - militant system? It's also time to put an end to political correctness."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mark of Damnation","review":"In this episode of Warhammer, we find ourselves following the promising army officer Karl Hoche on the downward spiral of destruction. After discovering corruption within the ranks of the trusted Knights Panther Karl is sent to bring word to the proper authorities.If you learn nothing else from me, know this...NEVER trust anyone! Chaos is insidious and you never know where its tendrils may take root. Karl narrowly escapes death at the hands of the Knights Panther and is enlisted by the secret order of the Untersuchung. After completing the rigorous training he is sent to find the location of a missing agent. Along the way he is betrayed at every turn ( \`cause he didn't listen to me) and finds himself becoming that which he seeks to destroy.Infected by chaos Karl must find the source of the evil and destroy it before it subjugates him completely, before it takes over his entire world."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not quickly absorbed","review":"The description on this item says that this is quickly absorbed, however, in my case, that couldn't be further from the truth. I have tried to time out exactly how long it takes for this to be absorbed into my skin - so far it has been 4 hours today and I still feel VERY greasy. I'm guessing it will be at least another 4! If I try to put on a wet/dry powder foundation it gums up and looks awful. I won't say that this product doesn't do a good job of moisturizing, but I can't stand this greasy feeling. I have used Caudilie, Decleor, this, and now Dior Hydra Advantage. This, BY FAR, is my least favorite."},{"rating":"2","title":"Stiff Little Fingers - Now Then = The Clash - Sandinista","review":"While far from the inspired abandon found in their early work, I can't help but love the album because i love the band. This album, much like The Clash's Sandinista is often overlooked because it strayed from the formula. Sandinista is an incredible album, and so is this. If your a Stiff Little Fingers fan i would highly recommend it. If not, try some of the earlier stuff such as Inflammable Material or Nobody's Heroes, both are great."},{"rating":"2","title":"Green Day... ten years ago.","review":"Okay, so that's an exageration. But it's not too much of one. SLF, characteristically, produces a catchy and very musically rich album you just can't help tap your foot to.Modern punk bands such as Green Day and the Offspring, obviously have been inspired and influenced by SLF, with the fast paced drum-work and harmonic singing. In fact, at times you'd swear you were listening to Green Day.Some songs on this album seem a little watered down, as if they're not living quite up to their potential, but for the most part it's a lot of fun to listen to. Fun music with a punk edge.Great band, great album (though not their best.)

As the book's title implies, Csorba thinks untrustworthy leadership is or should be an oxymoron.My favorite quote from this book is: \\"The \`best and the brightest' only become the best when they are the modest and the moral as well.\\" Csorba includes plenty of contemporary examples of leaders who failed the public trust, not only in politics, but in religion and business as well.This book is well documented and worthy of anyone's time who cares to learn more about leadership.

There was some good information presented in this video. It did have a definite New-Age flavor to it but that is not, in itself, all bad. I would caution all viewers to do some research on this Two-Birds fellow. I have NEVER known a Native American introduce themselves without mentioning tribal affiliation. This information provides context for what is presented in that any given tribe will have specific beliefs and traditions.

I felt that John Twobirds gave alot of pertinent information here. I loved the work he did with the feather in diagnosis.I also felt a great sincerity in all that he offered.I am not going to look on line for negative assessment of Mr. Twobirds as I feel that this is a good informative, well considered video that has much to offer.

The author takes a narrow view of how an individual firm can improve its competitive position by 'playing the environmental card'. Although he cites von Weisäcker et al: Factor Four, he does not seem to be aware of the literature that takes a much more systemic view of how to reconcile ecological sustainability, economic efficiency and commercial success. The book is perhaps useful in that it vividly demonstrates the limitations of a perspective that is centered on the individual corporation and its immediate competitive advantage with a rather blinkered view both of the scope for innovation and the wider macroeconomic framework within which business operates."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Reading!!!","review":"Success Within shows that the important things in life are not things at all.

In the process, you will experience some of the greatest moments of your life.I like the fact that you can incorporate these activities into your life immediately, and they sound really fun. I can't wait to do the Listening Tour, or the Family Adventure Day.

No, I don't use bleach. They simply were not made of very high quality cotton and wore through at the friction point at the ball of each foot.I won't buy Gold Toe socks again until I hear that they've returned to their classic standard.Why, oh why, can't women get the same high quality socks that men can buy so easily?

The other book that I recently read which also captured the accuracy of this time and place is the wonderful and controversial \\"The Autobiography of Jesus of Nazareth and the Missing Years\\" by Richard G. Patton. Both these books evoke a forgotten and magical route. If your taste is present commentary on historic times, your choice should be \\"In the search of Jesus\\".

He puts more credence in any local fable over any 1st century documentation. His basic motive seems to be telling a tale with irreverence for any faith - something that sells, though he has to use two different title to even do that.The only reason I give it higher than a one is that it does give a view of Iran/Irac/Syria that most people would not be able to read about.It is a shame of our times that the area is too dangerous for the people who could properly understand what he encountered - and look beyond the narrow vision of Polo.The birth has not been adequately explained in any book yet, but is it worth buying the tale of one who believes the Magi were out to rescue Jesus when even the other information he gives detracts from that hypothesis?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Journey to Babel","review":"When I picked up this book I thought the premise sounded intriguing: a researcher retraces the steps of the Wise Men from Persia to Bethlehem, and then writes a book to tell us who they really were. After reading the book, however, I am not certain whether the author actually intends to be taken seriously. His work is a mishmash, alternating between a hilariously profane account of his journey and his philosophical musings about the descent of Judaism, Christianity, and Islam from Zoroastrianism. The result is something resembling \\"Chariots of the Gods\\" or one of those books about how the Ark of the Covenant is now secreted away somewhere in Ethiopia, hidden by the Knights Templar and their descendants the Masons.

This is one of those (too rare) books that is entertaining, informative, and thought-provoking, all at the same time. While I certainly don't agree with many of the author's opinions, he has done his research well and he raises a lot of good points. And the one issue that he is right on target about is the influence that Zoroastrianism has had on Judaism, Christianity, and Islam. In this case he isn't simply expressing his own opinion, this is something that most serious scholars would readily acknowledge.This book leaves one with a lot to think about, and I suspect that most people will want to follow-up with further research. While the author does include most of his references in the book, it is too often done in a haphazard and disorderly fashion.

The creation account, to my mind, was written clearly and concisely by God through Moses so that a child could understand.

I bought this plug and got the 6 ft one so I could control it all over inside the car. If I am in back it will reach me and I can change the songs.... Great item. It came on time and was in great shape. I also like the elbow piece that came with it so that the \\"flexible\\" cable part doesn't get bent by the connection part on the dash. It is a sturdy elbow and will help keep the flexible cable with no cracks at its connecting end. (I hope that makes sense...)

Eadie in a different light.","review":"Hello, did either of the people who posted a review here even read the title of the book they were posting for? This book is one of several books written arguing that Ms Eadie could not have experienced something that agreed with traditional Judeo/Christian beliefs. Betty J. Eadie's book, Embraced by the Light, is quite a popular book with Mormon's (my mother, who is LDS gave it to me). As an ex-mormon I found it rather distasteful... I could almost hear one of my childhood Sunday school teacher's voice telling the story while I read. I was horrified by how it presented her religious views (she is LDS and joined the church several years before her account was published although the event was said to have taken place prior to her joining the church). This book, Embraced by the Light and the Bible by Richard Abanes compares Ms Eadie's book with the truth as found in the Bible. I recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"would read it if you paid me too","review":"I wouldn't read this book ,as one person who has read all Bettys' books and also have had a nde ,how can someone condemn some one just for the fact they didn't experience any of what Betty did ,in truth we are all one Thanks S"},{"rating":"2","title":"real life stories","review":"this is a brilliant book.

Every detail is outlined in fine black thread which gives it a dramatic feel and some metallic details are included to add sparkle.

It's next to impossible to follow- never in my life have I read a book with more typographical errors. There are missing quotation marks on nearly every page, it seems. A character is speaking, and then isn't, but then was actually speaking all along but the end quotes were simply forgotten. It's bizarre. The plot jumps from point to point without transition & as I was reading I found my mind wandering more along the lines of the \\"What were they thinking when this was published?\\" train of thought rather than being involved in the horrid plot.

As such, this well designed book is a compliment to other works devoted to uniforms and equipment.Thers illustrates widely differing individual groups, including naval gunners, glider pilots, sappers, infantrymen, artillery officers, radio operators, and several other key teams. His choices allow Thers to give credit to those who are often overlooked in standard histories, such as the motorcycle dispatch riders who had an unheralded but often quite dangerous job--usually performed in complete anonymity.

In the linear notes to this album, Nobody gives up his influences as jazz, hip hop, psychadelic rock, etc - well then how come this album is so boring and unoriginal? The guest lyricist on this album are tight, but they are insulted by these pathetic beats that should have stayed on Nobody's shelf in 1996. Krush, Cam, Shadow, etc were pioneers in turntablism, abstract beats, and fusing musical styles, and this album is the result of their, and their counterparts, musical breakthrough and success - labels will look for anything to quench the thirst of beatheads.

However, the book is very disappointing. I have not been able to get through it, due to the sturcture and writing of the book. To begin with, there is hardly any narrative. All the authors have done is to display interviews of various people intersperced with police and court reports. The reader must look up each interviewee's name in the index; however, many of them are not in the index in back of the book, which leads the reader to the question: \\"who is this person anyway\\"?What could have been a very compelling book becomes more of an outline or a report.

My toddler took the cards out of the box and I don't have time to reorganize the cards back in sequence!

The problem is that there are so very very few recipes in all.

I was curious what they would have for a dessert for a toddler, well, I am still wondering) but they don't, they just discuss the topic. That is fine and interesting but they are so obviously filler for a lack of recipe ideas that it is frustrating since that is what I purchased this for.

In other words if you are already an experienced VB programmer I'm sure its great. But for a VB beginner like me its no good. (I have been programming other languages for ten years.)

It taught me how to build a WebClass, and more importantly, how to *depoly* it. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Too much code","review":"Even for a programmer, this book might seem overwhelming. The author delves right into programming without explaining some basic structure of VB, i.e: data types, available functions. Also, the reader is expected to understand all the code written in the book without any help from the author. The author only provides an overview of what the code does. There is very little explanation regarding the functionality of functions used from the VB library. I wouldn't recommend this book if you are a non-programmer or a beginner in programming."},{"rating":"2","title":"My bindings came off!","review":"I only have 3 complaints about this book. 1) 6 days after purchasing this book, the bindings came off. 2) As a previous reviewer mentioned, the author uses functions and subroutines in his code snippets that he expects you to know already. I had to use the MSDN Online Help to get explanations on them. 3) Even though the author has TONS of USEFUL code snippets, it would've been better to put all of them into exercises.

The author has judged very well what people need to be told and what he can assume they already know. There are a lot of tips and tricks scattered around, which appear to be real tips gained from the author's experience, not just cleverness - it's obvious that the author really knows the subject, and hasn't just regurgitated the manual.

While it's not for someone who has never used VB before, if you have some basic knowledge, and you *really* want to learn how to create world-class programs, this is the book. I found myself using some of his examples, within the first week of using the book, in my own programming. He goes over aspects of clean code, performance, theory, practice, and he's actually written samples for everything he talks about, which means that he actually went into VB and tried *everything* it has. He brings all of that information back to the reader, down to peculiar behaviors and workarounds to undocumented errors. I wish every author went to the trouble that Mr. Balena has both in learning about the software, and presenting all of his findings. Just buy this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Why am I writing a review for this supposedly outdated book","review":"Because Visual Basic 6 remains a very useful programming environment for me. Mr. Balena's style goes way beyond a tutorial through menu creation.

The gameplay is faithfully reproduced; it's just not as much fun as playing with other people."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't Work, Support non-existant","review":"Got the PC version so I could play on trips.

Its scope goes beyond generalities but deals with specific topics from the world of satellite.

Ozment's understanding of the Medieval German society and its effects on its citizens is wonderful. I wholeheartedly recommend this book for anyone curious about this period in history."},{"rating":"1","title":"vaguely interesting, but distasteful","review":"For a book about a sex scandal, it's very bloodless. Obviously all the passion was saved for court. The love letters are interesting, but very little of the charactor of Anna Buschler comes through in the rest of the book. Yes, women of that time and place left a very light mark on history, but she just doesn't \\"come alive\\" the way the charactor of her father does. Eventually, the story the book tells spirals down into just some nasty courtroom feuding among family members. Perhaps this book should have been written to focus on a long-running legal battle in a sixteen century German town, but sex sells better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Misleading. This is a Christian book not a Jewish one","review":"Mr. Stern is practicing deception.

He doesn't provide many facts, but he deals directly with the subjects we want philosophy to tackle, including: Why do we exist? What is free will? What is an ethical life and why should we lead it?Of course, he doesn't provide any definite answers, but you get the feeling that Nozick has led you a little along the road of understanding. It may only be a few inches along a very long road, but it's a start.I think the section on metaphysics is the most successful part of the book. The chapter \\"Why is There Something Rather than Nothing?\\" is literally awesome.I can't pretend the book is an easy read, although Nozick is very clear compared with most philosophers. I shall read it again and I'll give myself a month to do it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"EXCELLENT THOUGHT EXPERIMENTS!","review":"I found this book an excellent excursion into a variety of philosophical problems. The goal of the book is to provide philosophical explanations, with the key word being explanations.My favorite parts of the book are the thought experiments. One of which concerns the replacement plank by plank of a wooden boat. The question is asked at which point is the boat a different boat? This is a question of being/becoming. This same thought experiment can then be mapped on to a human being and its constant change in physical matter (i.e., cells replacing old cells, etc.)Robert Nozick is probably one of the most important American philosophers of the latter half of the 20th Century.I highly recommend this book if you are interested in philosophy or thinking in general."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very unique bracelet!","review":"It is a very unique bracelet except it is very small.

I like to bake and cook a lot with my fiancé which means we use these a lot. While there are much better graters, they also cost several times as much and as a grad. student, these are more than good enough. My biggest gripe with the grater is the zesting plate which most of the zest gets stuck between the wholes and you have to scrape them out ( I make a lot of key lime pies and spend a long time doing this).

It's quite sharp, which is what you want for this device.The grips on the bottom of the box held the grater well while I was working, and I prefer to just quickly wash it by hand when I'm done, so I haven't tried it in the dishwasher. Love that all the pieces fit neatly into the box.Sure, a little of the cheese or grated veggies get on the counter, but no more so than with any other type grater. Cooking is messy, anyway, and cleanup is just part of it!Considering the features and the price of this set, this is a good buy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good grater, slightly annoying to store","review":"I like this grater. As a grater, it is nearly perfect. The bottom is rubberized to reduce slipping on the countertop, the blades are sharp and work well. The only difficulty is storing it - it's not a compact item. I like to have minimal clutter in the kitchen, so it sometimes bugs me. But, really, that's just a nitpicky detail. It's a really good grater.

Aren't you GRATEful? ...Sigh.)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Would Be a 5 If Only....","review":"This grater works! However, it needs a lid or cover should you want to save some for later use or make up ahead of time and have ready when needed. This way it saves repackaging effort and time.

The food reservoir could be larger but that would just add to the size of it's storage requirements. The grater panels are quite substantial and fit nicely onto the top indentation. Others will prefer the 'cube' grater since you always grab exactly the right grater but they are a hassle to use since you still have to provide a container for the grated food and holding the grater at an appropriate angle to grate a particular food is not always easy. Then there's the issue of cleaning 'all' surfaces of the cube even though you've used only one.I prefer this one; it's relatively compact, has a good selection of graters, provides it's own food reservoir, and the grating angle is always flat."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not in dishwasher!!!","review":"I gave this to my wife as a gift and she was skeptical at first, but loved it after a couple uses. The only problem that came up was when she put it in the dishwasher set to run with a heated dry cycle.

Some food wound up on the counter and not in the container when grating, but I could live with that. What I cannot live with is a product that is less than 2 months old and no longer useable. The grater blades will no longer fit into the holder -- not a single one of them. One of the graters plastic surround has cracked, creating a bacteria breeding ground. Evidently, there has been some dimensional changes in the plastic in less than two months of use, so it no longer fits together. I would send it back, but shipping cost vs price makes that a questionable option. I would not buy this item again nor can I recommend it. Although the product is rated dishwasher safe, I believe that it isn't and that is the reason it no longer fits together. And no, my hot water isn't too hot."},{"rating":"1","title":"Food everywhere","review":"Maybe I need to practice my grating skills, but whenever I grate anything some ends up in the attached cup, but some ends up on top of the grater and inevitably ends up all over the counter.The grater only allows you to grate horizontally. This feels more comfortable than vertical grating and allows you to grate more quickly.The plastic seems solid and the blades are sharp. The quality is good, but having food end up everywhere is annoying."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mostly happy, but a bit of a pain to clean","review":"I've used this product primarily for grating blocks of cheddar cheese, but I've also used it on a vegetable or two. (I usually use mySwissmar Borner V-1001 V-Slicer Plus Mandoline 6 Piece Setfor vegetables.)The modularity and compact nature of this grater setup is really nice. Unfortunately, it also makes it a bit of a pain to clean. After grating a block of cheddar, I have to scrub three separate pieces- the grater, the frame, and the bin.The finest grating surface is especially tough to clean; little bits of cheese can get stuck between the blades, and short of breaking out a toothpick or something, it's very hard to dislodge them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Small","review":"The mandoline blade is just too small to adequately handle most of what I want it to do.

I just kept waiting for her to deal with those aweful characters and then go home. I missed Cloud and Onua.However, the story was still very good. I did enjoy it, but not as much as the first.

It was also very interesting, how we get to see a new side of our favorite 15 year-old. In Wild Magic and Wolf Speaker (my two books which are so worn they probably shouldn't be called books anymore), Daine was always this sweet, forgiving, pretty little angel. She seems so much more REAL. It's like Ms. Pierce's way of saying: \\"Yes, ladies and gentlemen, Daine IS capable of feeling jealousy, embarrassement, and she IS capable of mass destruction when she hears of the death of one of her dearest friends!\\" That, I think was a very good touch."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very cool","review":"Ok, this was the second best book in the Immortals series (I like Realm of the Gods better), at least in my opinion. Daine finds herself in the infamous Carthak. The Tortallans are discussing peace delegations with the Carthakis. Anyway, I thought it would have been pretty cool if Daine and Kaddar, you know, hooked up or something but, of course, that is not to be. Anyway, the Graveyard Hag gives Daine a power that might make Carthak straighten up (or fall down). Personally, I think that the Hag is MEAN! Oh well. Of course, Tamora Pierce pulls of another GREAT book.

When I discovered Tamora Pierce and The Immortals Series I couldn't keep my hands off them! I just finished Emporer Mage. Daine and a few nobles of Tortall go to Carthak, the land that Tortall has less than the best relationship with. Here she meets Kaddar the surprisingly friendly heir to the Carthak throne and she suspicously kind Emporer Mage, also known as Ozorne. In Carthak she meets new friends including animal friends of course) and new immortal friends too. The Badger God warns her of the dark future to the Carthak throne, but only warns. She also meets the Graveyard Hag, a less than idealistic goddess who gives her a power only Gods have. The way she converses with animals makes me even want to become Daine and meet her and her lands. If you are an animal or fantasy reader I most definately reccommed this book as good light reading."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Workhorse","review":"I just finished my first job with this saw today and I loved the results. I was struggling between the Makita 10\\" slide and the 6497. My experience with Milwaukee quality & durability was the deciding factor & I believe you usually get what you pay for. This saw is easy to carry from the jobsite to the truck, mitre cuts were true to angle settings and the 15 amp motor eased through the material. This saw radiates quality construction and I like the fact there are no uneccesary bells and whistles, which usually end up broken down the road.I would like to see Milwaukee improve the accessability of the slide lock and the operation of the bevel lock handle. All in all, I am proud of my saw."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a Milwaukee Product","review":"I have to say that this is one Milwaukee product that truly disappoints. Rather than being built in-house in Wisconsin or at one of Milwaukee/Atlas Copco's global facilities in Germany or Sweden, this saw is contract-built for Milwaukee by a Taiwanese manufacturer, presumably Rexon. While Bosch, Craftsman, a handful of DeWalt miter saws are also made in Taiwan, they offer better value and more features for the money, particularly the Bosch products. This alleged \\"Milwaukee\\" doesn't offer dual-bevel, a laser guide, and appears relatively flimsy compared to the products of other manufacturers. The Milwaukee has also showed poorly in woodworking reviews of compound sliding miter saws.I would characterize this saw as of marginal quality, or in other words: \\"Anything But Heavy Duty.\\" Give Milwaukee a call at 1-800-SawDust and let them know they can do far better."},{"rating":"2","title":"A very good saw","review":"I don't know what's going on with the saws people are writing all the negative stuff about, but I've owned one of these for years, and it's been a rock solid performer. A \\"job site injury\\" finally cracked the case, causing it to fail to hold alignment, and I'm paying to have it repaired rather than buy another. But, if I did buy instead, I'd buy another of these. It's a solid saw."},{"rating":"2","title":"China's Son","review":"I think china's Son by Da Chen is a great book. It talks about what had happened during the Culture Revolution which the author Da Chen had lived between. Also since his family was a landlord, and Mao didn't like rich people. Their land were taken and their father was sent to labor camp.I think this book-China's Son would be great for people who are from 12~16 and who wants to learn about what had happened during the Culture Revolution."},{"rating":"2","title":"China's Son","review":"Da Chen's voice is so honest. If you need a push in life, you need to read this.I love Da Chen's Colors of The Mountain. That's what that made me want to explore his other titles. What I did not realise that China's Son was the same book in a different title. I read somewhere that it's a juvenile version of Colors of The Mountain. But since it's my all-time favourite book, I don't have any regrets having bought it in Kindle version."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Book","review":"This book was a required reading for my son's sumer reading entering 7th grade.

I just can't figure out why anyone would want to write an autobiography shamelessly asking for sympathy. Oh, I was the son of a rich family, and therefore I suffered. Woe was I.I think I wouldn't mind if the protagonist failed the test. He sounded selfish and too arrogant--bitchy even."},{"rating":"2","title":"graduate to shastro","review":"If you've dabbled in new age music and perhaps ventured into Enya, then this is the next cd for you. It is upbeat yet relaxing. As soon as it is finished I press play again. I listen to it when I'm writing, beading, zoning out on the stairmaster, in the bath. His combo of instruments and melodies is so relaxing, yet not hypnotic. If you have an aversion to monotone type new age,(with no melody) this is a wonderful cd for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great while it lasts","review":"You will love this for at most 6 months.

The latest one looks like it had a leaking battery. It seems a design flaw to place the battery compartment on the bottom of a product that is designed to be used around water. No matter how conscientious you are, you can't avoid some water dripping to the base of the unit."},{"rating":"2","title":"Automatic Soap & Lotion Dispenser","review":"I have been very pleased with this product.

Eventually I would like to order some more of them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works good","review":"I have had mine for over 2 years and still works good. It stopped pumping good after a year but I took it apart and found the belt was broken. The belt is basically a little oring you can purchase at the hardware store. You can get access to it from removing the 2 screws on the top of the unit under the cover."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money","review":"The product is over priced as most ShaperImage products are and the quality is poor.

She wants several more for soap dispensers around her home."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't Work for Long","review":"I bought this and the hands-free shower unit directly from Sharper Image. Within 2 months, neither one worked. I tried new batteries, different soap, then tried the special electronics batteries. Every once in a while, it would just turn on when noone was even close to it, but if you wanted to actually use it, no way. Sad."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is why I dislike Sharper Image","review":"They always have neat ideas or have nice clones of other's neat ideas. But they are always shy on delivering cos' they cheapen out in the manufacture process somehow somewhere. This Soap Genie does work, but the adjustment knob is a joke, it just squirts out whatever quantity it feels like. The fact that one can't clean the holding tank is another flaw, have they not foreseen soap scum accumulation at all? If you are lack of patience or don't want to experiment w/ various viscosity of liquid soaps, you will really hate this, like my sister does. She has stopped using hers. Look for other brands like Brookstone's & Simple Human's versions too & compare."},{"rating":"2","title":"Such an awesome lost treasure","review":"I remember when I first heard The Great Kat...I wondered why she wasn't big. I still wonder that, but I think she just markets herself poorly with her egotistical \\"I'm the best ever\\" bs. Regardless, her music is fun and awesome metal. She gives classical music a real heavy metal mosh touch, which I love. My only gripe is that she doesn't lengthen her songs, or make full albums as opposed to 4 or 5 song eps over and over.If you're into metal, check her out. If you're into classical music played metal...check her out."},{"rating":"2","title":"Couple of minor annoyances, but overall a solid phone","review":"This is a great phone if you are just looking for a basic cordless. I've been very pleased with the reception quality and I like the simple, clean design without tacky, futuristic buttons that more recent models tend to have. There are a couple of things I did find annoying, however.- If your call requires a series of numbers (e.g. long distance call that has an access number followed by an actual phone number), you cannot browse the phonebook for subsequent numbers. You can still use the speed-dial feature, but you'd have to know where the desired number is stored.- The battery life is *way* too short.- The phone has this rather annoying beep for whenever any of the buttons is pressed, and there is no option to turn in off."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice background music","review":"This cd would provide relaxing & entertaining background music for a get-together. Very unique and interesting music."},{"rating":"2","title":"excellent boost for flowers","review":"Carefree Bud-n-Flower Booster was recommended to me by a visitor who swears by it, after looking at my sad, lackluster flowers. It has really perked up everything, encouraged blooming, and made my whole garden stronger and healthier. It's not messy, requires no measuring, is easy to store, and quick to use. I had a difficult time figuring out how often to feed the plants, and had to search quite a bit on their website, so I would suggest that information accompany the product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Help For Me","review":"This book was a great help to my husband and I.It gave me a guide to what children should be doing in around each month.

I love this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"outdated","review":"Although there is much practical advice and interesting facts about child development, the overall result is a tired and dated manual. Some of the advice is downright dangerous! The book explored the conflict between putting infants to sleep on their back as opposed stomach. There is a clinically accepted link between Babies sleeping on their stomach and SIDS, Sudden Infant Death Syndrom. There isn't a pediatrition or health nurse on the planet who would recomend putiing an infant to sleep on their belly, let alone give an option between the two."},{"rating":"2","title":"The First Twelve Months of Life","review":"I first bought this book in 1977 when my first child was born and it became my Baby Bible.

I think this is a great piece of work that retains a very cool independent feel throughout the album.

I bought this CD because I like Joe Crane's music. Some of the tracks still sound fresh but most would sound way better if you had too much too drink (or smoke), were 22 years old and in a bar in San Francisco. I imagine under those conditions, this group really rocked. My favorites: \\"Greenlight\\", \\"You Gotta Get You Somebody New\\" and \\"Safecracker\\". Worth buying for those three tunes. Having the Pointer Sisters singing backup on \\"Sea of Love\\" is a very cool touch as well. The sound quality is very good ... in these days of highly engineered music, this CD sounds like you're right in the room with the band. Now where did I put my bellbottoms and my bong?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Just plain cool","review":"This was just a cool book.

I love the way Green can spin a yarn that is frightening, funny, gory and original in thought and plot. I also appreciate how short the books are, he gets right to the point and doesn't waste time being wordy just to produce a 500 page paperweight.You can find all manner of creatures in the Darkside, but one you will definitely meet is John Taylor, P.I. He has an uncanny knack for finding things, anything you might be looking for, and a few you aren't. His father is a human and his mother is....well, we don't know yet. Neither does John. This is one of the questions we get alittle closer to answering with each new book.This is a mixture of horror, sci-fi, mystery, comedy. Green has a way of blending it all together into a smooth concoction that is easy going down. Give it a chance, I'm sure you will enjoy it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Spotty Follow-Up","review":"Where the previous volume of this series felt like a great introduction, this book feels leaden. Half the time, the author feels like he's still setting up the setting, but nearly every character or setting he introduces is destroyed right away. In the end, only Jessica Sorrow remains of the new characters introduced to return in the future.Author Simon R. Green hopscotches from one encounter to another--a psychic boy band, a dancer who lives by stealing vitality from the undead, a gun that works by undoing God's creation--only to have the lead prove fruitless and the characters in question be destroyed. This feels less like a mission or a quest than a scavanger hunt at a spastic child's birthday party.Green has a wonderful setting in the Nightside, and compelling, sympathetic characters in John Taylor and Suzie Shooter. Here's hoping that, in future installments, he rambles less and narrates more."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good, a sequel to the Nightshade.","review":"Thank goodness, Mr. Green made a sequel for John Taylor.

It's short, fast reading that is an absolutely entertaining ride.The writing is pretty solid for the most part, and I really enjoy the world he is spinning.The Nightside is becoming one of my favorite fictional locales, and the idea of an \\"unholy grail\\" was just awesome.The ending did have a touch of Deus ex machina, which I'm generally opposed to, but it wasn't enough to spoil my enjoyment.This second installment built a little more depth into the main characters, and actually has you caring about what happens next.The first book in the series seemed to lean a little too heavily on standard noir detective tropes, but this book has kicked out those crutches and is standing just fine on its own.I'm afraid the Nightside has a hold of me, and I'm going to end up buying more in this series."},{"rating":"2","title":"The perfect doll","review":"My daughter recieved this doll for her birthday two years ago.

She loves her and she goes with her everywhere. The doll is not too big and I like that there is not \\"hair\\" on its head, making her easy to clean and manage. Her body is fabric with plastic legs and arms and head, which makes her soft and easy to grab. As long as her head stays tied on tight, I see this being a favorite toy for a long time. There isn't really a smell to her, now that she is out of the box, which I like. She is highly priced, and there are other dolls that are close, for less, but I feel this was a good choice for her.I bought a feeding set and diaper bag set for her doll too, so this new \\"mommy\\" can take care of her. Also, I made an extra set of pj's so she can be changed.

Why oh why would they produce a newborn baby with teeth? The vanilla scent was there but again not as yummy as other reviewers had found it to be. We have a Melissa & Doug 12\\" Jenna dolly and she is so much sweeter looking that this Calin doll.

Not that big of a deal. I noticed them when I first opened the box....they're TINY teeth, and not exactly white. But, I have since never noticed them nor has my 3 y.o. daughter. And yes people, babies do have teeth. This is NOT a newborn baby....at least my newborns never sat upright in a little chair! This is like a 6 month old or something, and they DO have teeth.

I looked at all the models and chose this one because I thought it had the prettiest face of all the Corolle dolls. The Corolle Nourisson and Suce Pouce are also very pretty, but the Calin Charming Pastel won out for its smaller size and reasonable price. I like that it has a bean-bag body and is small enough for a one-year-old to carry around. I gave this as a birthday gift for a one-year-old, but liked it so much that I plan to buy another for my own baby. The specs say 18 months and up, but there don't seem to be any chokeable parts that would present a hazard for younger children."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sensual not erotic","review":"Rent it first online!

Not really any erotic shots.. Even no upper chest massage for female. Rent!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Sleepy time","review":"I really did not find this sensual at all. It is the basic massage steps that i do now as a therapist just without draping. I really wished i would have saved my money this is not worth it for sensuality, if you want to learn how to massage then buy it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible DVD","review":"I am glad I only paid $2 to see it online first. Even then, it was not worth it. Maybe watched it for 3 minutes. No, I was not looking for sexual massage scenes. Very boring and if I may quote Jennifer, lady up in one of the reviews: \\"The narrator has the same scientific droning tone as Ben Stein (from the dry eyes commercials of the 90's).\\"I am sooooo glad I didn't buy it. They would have to pay Me to watch it. Can I give it ZERO stars?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Typical Massage except naked","review":"This demonstration is no different then a typical massage demonstration except the models are naked. The narrator has the same scientific droning tone as Ben Stein (from the dry eyes commercials of the 90's) I wish I did not buy this for our 9 year anniversary and just stuck with the same one we have at home instead, Joy of Erotic Massage which really brings out the differences between couples massage and just a typical massage. Also the entire Sensual Massage Made Simple film is accompanied by the same three chords of bass jazz over and over and over again which made us feel more like we were at a cheesy coffee shop than a relaxing massage setting.All in all, some what informative, but very boring."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good overview for amatuers and professionals","review":"This DVD illustrates some of the massage techniques discussed in Gordon Inkeles' books on the subject. It's easier to grasp (no pun intended) some of moves in a video than to try to visualize them from the photographs that accompany the text in a book.The couple demonstrating the techniques appear in the nude which doesn't usually happen in a professional setting hence, I guess, the title \\"Sensual Massage\\". All massage should be sensual, however in a professional relationship the experience isn't -or shouldn't be- sexual.The demonstrators are attractive and not porn movie types -i.e. no silicone parts, tattoos or body piercings. They also seem to be enjoying themselves. The video appears to be in a nice, sunlit residential setting.As someone who has had many massages by female and male LMTs and a student of the art, I recommend this DVD to anyone interested in being able to give as well as receive a full-body, therapeutic, sensual massage."},{"rating":"1","title":"Average massage, horrible DVD","review":"I am a professional Chiang Mai Style masseur, and I wanted to try something new with my partner, so I decided to buy this DVD because of the good reviews. Unfortunately, I found that the only reliable review was the one by Ms Jennifer Navolis.- Don't expect \\"sensual massage\\" techniques here. It is a very average massage, the only difference is that the (not particularly attractive) models are naked- The narrator voice is unbearable- The music is abominable. Really. And way too loud. No music at all would have been far betterAlso, some of these techniques, in particular the ones involving the knee and the lower back, can be pretty dangerous on your partner if you don't have some professional knowledge.So, kudos to Jennifer for the very honest review; but I would say that she has been too kind to give this DVD two stars. I would give zero if I could."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sensual Masage DVD is a Winner!","review":"Have long been a fan of Gordon Inkeles books on massage I had hoped for years that he would apply his talents to a video. My expectations were realized by the release of this video. I had heard that Mr. Inkeles was working on a video version of his last book and finally I got to see the finished product. Massage books are OK as far as they go but to actually see the strokes in action makes video a superior medium to use. The models I guess are married and convey a relaxed mood and ease with each other. They seemed to really enjoy each other and the techniques they used. The video is laid out much like the book with chapters on the head, the arms, the legs, etc, and are easily accessible through the DVD menu. The music is very low key and the moderator voice (Mr. Inkeles?) over on the strokes is informative. This video really sets the mood with the lighting and sets used. The color is warm without being saturated. It will definitely inspire you and your partner!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for Couples!","review":"My fiancé and I really enjoyed viewing this video to help us learn more massage techniques for each other. I would recommend this video for any couple that are beginners and looking for a romantic night together. We at first rented, but now we are looking at purchasing it now."},{"rating":"2","title":"sobering","review":"This documentary is a sobering expose on the use of mercury \\"silver\\" amalgam filings by the US dentistry.

It will make you want to find the nearest mercury-free, biological dentist to have your mercury amalgam fillings removed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for me","review":"This product, which says is good for rosacea skin types, is a really deep rust color, it actually makes rosacea skin look worse. Also, it contains nickel in the ingredients, which is a common allergen. I tried it once and am going to give it away, since it doesn't go well with my complexion. When purchasing this product, I was confused as to the color. I thought it would be a natural beige color, more like foundation, since it says all purpose makeup. I used the word \\"natural foundation\\" when searching and this product popped up - so I guess it was a little misleading."},{"rating":"1","title":"One Star For The MP3 Quality, Five Stars For The Music","review":"I just downloaded this much-beloved soundtrack, but I'm listening to a shriek of high-hat puke.

Contrary to what I thought, I learned so much more about myself and I feel I gave myself a gift by following what is suggested. Barbara Rose clearly has a gift in her writing because it reached me, and many of the previous tarnished views I had about myself have been turned around.This book is by far one of the best I have ever read, and her other books are just as great. The reason is they have the real stuff in them that actually do make a fantastic difference.If you're looking for answers about self esteem, Know Yourself definitely gives them!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Lacking Substance","review":"I bought this because it had a five star rating here on Amazon (at the time, anyway), but I wish I had paid closer attention to who the author was as I had just finished another Barbara Rose book that I was equally disappointed in. Her heart is in the right place... which is the only reason I give it two stars instead of one. The content lacks substance. It's filled with broad and simplistic phrases that did little to inspire me."},{"rating":"1","title":"A load of crap","review":"This was the worst purchase I have made. I can't believe this book was published. I clearly do not recommend this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"the first book I ever threw away (in my recycling)","review":"I'm sorry but I found this book extremely unhelpful. It was very disjointed. It wasn't even clear what you were supposed to be writing in the workbook pages. It just seemed like a stream of consciousness of trite phrases like \\"everything happens for a reason\\". Maybe it's helpful to people who have never thought beyond their nose for their entire life. I don't know. I couldn't find anything redeeming in the entire thing. I ended up just skimming the second half so maybe there was something redeeming in there."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book, just as described","review":"Nostalgia rules the day with this book. I loved Alexei Tolstoy's books growing up, even after finding out he was a jerk in real life didn't dampen my enthusiasm for his books.

For the $$$, buying a FLAT SCREEN TV with all of these features is well worth it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Poor Customer Service","review":"We purchased this combo TV and approximately 60 days later, the VCR slot began malfunctioning. We tried to call the customer service number, and was on-hold for 45 minutes (15 customers in queue waiting) before a service representative answered. She took some basic information and then put me on hold for another 20 minutes before disconnecting me with no repair/return information. I called again and there was 19 customers in queue. This is a great price for these features, but you may want to consider the lack of customer service when making your decison to buy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Big disappointment","review":"The price was right, great picture, however, I was able to use it only once. The DVD stopped working on me the very next day. I was lucky, that I could send it back at no charge. Now I am getting Sylvania TV/DVD/VCR, but now I am afraid, I may be dealing with the same problem - I was reading review on it. It looks like all this TV/VCR/DVD combinations have some bugs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fool me once...","review":"Unlike some other reviewers, my TV was delivered in good shape and worked fine. Then, after 4 months, the TV simply refused to turn on. I called Apex customer service, which was fairly responsive, but the TV was out of warranty by a few weeks. They wanted me to ship the TV to them at my cost and spend at least $80 to fix it.

It is heavy and I had to have help to get it in the house -then help to get it out for UPS return.Sure I did not lose any money Amazon is good that way.Still I had to ask for help from my friends and had to get it ready for UPS return -I lost time and this should never have happend.

Nine months of use and the DVD quits turning or reading the disc. Called APEX for a local service center location and they want me to return it to California at my expense and pay them an $80 service fee. By the time I do this I will have nearly the price of the unit paid again. I should have gotten the 3 year extended warranty. I'll get separate components next time from a name that is well known.I can get service here for $30 and most likely the DVD reader is only about $40."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another Hit !!!!","review":"Graham McNeill has done it again. First he brought us, \\"Nightbringer\\" and now he brings us \\"Warriors of Ultramar\\". This is the 2nd installment of the Ultramarines 4th company and its courageous captain, Uriel Ventris. This time they are sent to a industrial planet,Tarsis Ultra, to protect it from a Tyranid Invasion. This is the first Warhammer 40,000 book that includes the Tyranids and the horror that they bring to any planet they consume. Its like a heavyweight title fight with the lives of hundreds of thousands as the prize. In one corner there is the Ultramarines lead by Uriel Ventris, The space marine chapter the MORTIFACTORS, and some of most battle harden Imperial guardsmen anywhere. In the other couner there is the hundreds of thousands of the hive minded and mutated beasts and monsters known as the Tyranids. If you like big battles. This one is for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Kindle edition is hard to navigate and the maps hard to read","review":"It would nice if Amazon put kindle-specific reviews on the kindle-edition page for a book, rather than just the regular reviews for the book. Because sometimes there's a big difference. Such as for this book.I tossed my hardcopy of the Lonely Planet guide in favor of this kindle edition. I wish I hadn't. Using a guidebook requires lots of hopping to a specific page or pages, which is not the kindle's strong suit. It's very hard to find anything quickly in the kindle edition. So hard that I'm basically finding it almost useless.Also the maps show up so small that they are effectively impossible to read. The kindle only has one level of zoom, and it isn't enough to help.I found this purchase useless, and if Amazon would allow me to cancel it (I don't see a way to do so), I would.meh."},{"rating":"1","title":"poorly designed","review":"I was really disappointed with the newest Thailand edition to the Lonely Planet series. This is a huge volume and is more a history lesson then a guidebook. Learning the history of your destination is great but that information is not necessary when carrying around a guide to find a place to eat. Many of the authors' recommendations are already outdated. The price ranges for places to eat or sleep are not accurate or sometimes not given at all. My main problem is the way this guide links the map to the text. In order to find out where a place is located, you must refer to several different pages when reading the map. Why can't the description of a restaurant also tell the map page and grid point without having to look on a separate index? Poorly designed and not easy to use when on the go. Keep this one on your bookshelf and take a smaller guidebook when traveling. I recommend the Time Out series as my favorite."},{"rating":"2","title":"Don't plan your Thailand trip without this book","review":"For my first trip to Thailand 10 years ago, I purchased just about every guide book available. Only one book has stood the test of time - Lonely Planet Thailand. Over the years, I have picked up new editions as they have become available. From personal experience, I would argue that the quality of my trips has increased along with the quality each subsequent edition. As tourism, culture and economics in Thailand evolves, so too does Lonely Planet Thailand, keeping pace with changing social trends, places of interest, as well as places to avoid. All this, of course, in addition to the vast body of information critical to planning where to stay, what to eat and what to do while in-country. More than a strong recommendation, this book is a must-have for any traveller to Thailand."},{"rating":"1","title":"Type is ridiculously small - DO NOT BUY","review":"This book appears to contain the compendium of knowledge regarding Thailand. Too bad the font is so small that even my teenage daughter says it hurts her eyes. DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK unless you want to use a magnifying glass to read it. Very disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Look to another guidebook","review":"Poorly organized. Missing a lot of information on Koh Samui. It recommends taking a bus/ferry combo there and quotes a really low price and then does not say how to get that price. I had a lot of trouble using this guide and will be getting a different one for next time."},{"rating":"1","title":"A mistake to travel with Kindle edition.","review":"Don't try to travel with the Kindle version of this guidebook. It's unbelievably frustrating to navigate, plus the maps get blurry when you blow them up to try and capture the detail. I think I've given up on guidebooks anyway. They all seem to be outdated before they're even published. Better to carry a tablet and rely on up-to-the-minute user-generated review sites."},{"rating":"1","title":"Quantity but no quality","review":"What a vast book. But what lack of discernment.We were directed to a whorehouse insetad of a nightclub, a number of cockroach and mould infested dives instead of 'clean' (a ubiquitous adjective in this book) budget hotels.We also fell victimn to Joe Cummings's apparent hidden commercial agenda - he seems to want to appeal to all tourist tastes, dishing out very dubious information on the Thai sex industry, assuring us that it is no worse than the U.S or India whilst directing us to traditional massage places in Bangkok offering far more than massages. He also tries to make out that Pattaya is not merely a sex resort.Worst of all is the tone. Much of the information is communicated in a pompous style that says as much about the author's high opinion of himself as it does about Thailand.After a number of disappointments we have now switched to more considered guide book series from Cadogan or Footprint."},{"rating":"1","title":"not an easy reference","review":"We brought this book to Chiang Mai, and it usually left us confused or frustrated because it took AGES to find anything useful. I personally don't think it is well organized. The maps are hard to read and decipher. I have to go through tons of words before I get to what I want and then later find out that the map doesn't really show me clearly how to get there.I have used other LP guide books in the past with more success, and this one is very disappointing.You're better off getting another guide book that is more user friendly or buying a local map."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic source of information","review":"This is the first Lonely Planet guide I have purchased in 20 years and I am not disappointed - these guys really deliver! The travel guide is somewhat geared to lower end travellers such as backpackers and the like, but contains a wealth of useful information for travellers in any price range, including things to do, places to visit, ways to get from A to B, rough price guides and so on. I highly recommend this travel guide for anyone planning a trip to the Land of Smiles, especially those visiting Thailand for the first time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book... But minor rant.","review":"Great book. Only one criticism, the vegetarian section doesn't actually list the Thai words you need to order a vegan/vegetarian dish correctly. For vegans it's even harder. That's all my opinion anyways... Of course, you're ~supposed~ to buy the lonely planet phrasebook anyways, right? Other than that, great book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Surprisingly mediocre","review":"I really expected more from this book. It had basic info about lodging and food, but really quite basic and obvious stuff. I was frustrated many times looking for places to eat. The section on Koh Samui was almost totally useless. There was nothing here to make it worth the price."},{"rating":"1","title":"Moore needs to write for somebody else.","review":"I knew this book was going to turn out terrible when I found out that Vance Moore wrote it. One good habit this guy has when writing books is he mentions things at the beginning of the book (the Mirari in Chapter 1 which strikes Kamahl's fancy as final prize) and doesn't mention it hardly ever again until the last three or four chapters (when you finally figure out it's called the Mirari!). The only thing that's good about this book is the fact that it's the only one in the Odyssey cycle written by Moore. I'm in the middle of Chainer's Torment right now, and it is already looking 10 times better than this book ever could be.Ignore this author like the Phyrexian Plague!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Like walking through quicksand","review":"I've read all the other books in the Magic series, and up till this one they were extremely well written. From Rath and Storm till Apocalypse I couldn't put the books down. Till I hit this book. I just hit a brick wall it feels like. I can't force myself to read on and I have about 100 pages left in the book. It's so dry and unexciting to me. The whole thing is about Kamahl a barbarian chasing after this artifact (The Mirari) and Laquatus, a mer-ambassador also seeking the Mirari and that's about all there is to the book. The Gerrard storyline should have continued, even though I know what happened in Apocalypse and all, they could have continued with the crew.

In the end however Kamahl throws the final blow to the huge monstrosity. The monster falls on top of Kamahl and everyone believes that Kirtar, an order liutenant, destroyed the beast. As a prize kirtar recieves the mirari. Kirtar is then ordered to an Order encampment where Kamahl tries to follow him, but by the time he gets to the citadel, Kirtar is already dead. the Mir ambassador Laquatas takes the orb down underwater.

It uses the insights of Sartre, Heidegger and Hegel to reconsider those people generally called crazy, and shows that what is often called madness is better understood as meaningful gestures of communication from people who have been wrongly ignored. It is a great introduction to existentialism, it will help you understand yourself, it is a deep critique of the mental health profession, and it is a real pleasure to read. I often use it in courses in existentialism or intro to philosophy because of its clarity and because it shows the deep relevance of philosophy in general and existentialism in particular to everyday human life.

It helped her to understand many of the symptoms she was dealing with and gave her hope for the future. It was also helpful for her sister to read to gain insight into her sibling's illness. Brandon and the Bipolar Bear is written in a way that children can relate to, using language and descriptions of symptoms that they can easily identify with.

The effects are not bad, but one would expect better ideas.Mr. Yuzna, who is a talented director, keeps working with bad scripts and ruining his reputation. He should make less films and better ones.

Nothing leading up to the climax explained that the \\"chicken lady\\" was the murderer (if you can call what happened, a murder). Also, the description of how-to kill chickens and boil them for soup, is off-putting. The plot was a mish-mosh of different stories within a story.

A good number of the words seem to me out of date. (Interestingly, the fact that this book was written before the Genocide probably explains the strange referenes to the bravery of Turkish soldiers).

He doesn't know the difference between \\"rough sex\\" and rape? Those are only two examples of how ignorant the writer makes this character.

The tempi are too slow. The performances are not up to the level required to do justice to this music. What is especially missing is the sense of humour and wit which is necessary for this repertoire. This isn't the music of some University professor who's fishing for tenure....This is the music of a real musician who wrote for real performing musicians. The lackluster performances by this conductor and this ensemble are not what the composer had in mind....The Concertino for Flute and Piano is NOT the orchestration done by Germaine Tailleferre, but a reconstructed version which doesn't sound at all like what you hear on the original Radio France performance.Don't buy this recording.

The female end does not accept the standard tightening screws, which may explain why the screen image had hundreds of pixels replaced by bright green dots, especially in darker areas of the screen.

Why are they so persistent in suggesting a traumatic experience for a non-indicated surgery? No national or international medical society recommends the routine circumcision of infants. The circumcision rates for Britain, Sweden and Finland are less than 1% yet in the US we circumcise 62% of our baby boys. And on top of all this the routine circumcision of female infants is a Federal crime."},{"rating":"1","title":"Information is out of date","review":"If you are a parent-to-be researching the question of circumcision, I do not recommend this book. It does not include current health information or recent research studies. The AAP does not recommend circumcision for any medical reason, and newborns have been found to feel more pain than adults.This book's authors are also sadly misinformed about care of the intact penis. To care for the penis of your uncircumcised son, here's all you need to know: Leave it alone. You should never try to retract the foreskin as it is fused to the glans. He will retract it himself when it is ready, and then a swish in the tub or quick rinse in the shower is enough to stay clean.The best advice for an intact baby boy is to clean the penis as if it were a finger. Much easier than caring for the open wound of circumcision."},{"rating":"1","title":"Speaking on behalf of professional butchers","review":"...Disinformation about circumcision has been put out on the American public for at least a century.The author only contributes more of the same by using outdated studies.....Harter also fails to acknowledge that such a traumatising procedure(performed without anesthesia)may have long-term psychological consequences.All in all a terrible waste of a book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Untruthful and inaccurate","review":"I was amazed to read in Frankly Speaking the author's claim that the American Academy of Pediatrics \\"currently recommends circumcision of infants to prevent health problems.\\" As a member of the Academy and a contributor to the new circumcision policy statement which was released on March 1, 1999, I can state categorically that the above statement is completely false. The exact wording of the AAP's new policy is: \\"Existing scientific evidence demonstrates potential medical benefits of newborn male circumcision; however, these data are not sufficient to recommend routine neonatal circumcision.\\" In fact, the data has always been insufficient to recommend routine neonatal circumcision and the Academy has never recommended this unnecessary amputation of normal sexual tissue.Frankly Speaking, unfortunately, is rife with inaccurate, misleading and blatantly false assertions.

The physical sciences introduce common experiments, graphs, etc seen thru college coursework. Sadly, this won't be on the exam.

This is a tough story of a wealthy Louisiana family and the secrets they harbor inside their home. Reading about the abuse and the subsequent emotional problems all the children experience was at times painful and uncomfortable but I absolutely could not put it down.Marie Etienne has written an honest and unflinching account of her childhood and I imagine she made and lost some friends and/or family members in the process. But as she writes in the epilogue, it was a catharsis for her and I believe it is cathartic for the reader as well.

While that beauty and sonority is truly sublime, Grossman does well in capturing much of it in English. What fun this would be to include in a World Poetry class!

Adult improvers are warned that Ledbetter's method works best for tall long legged athletes for whom distance is not a problem. Faldo himself became a relatively short although devastatingly accurate hitter. There is far too much twisting of the body to make this method entirely safe for the average back. That said, the book is artfully done and has lovely pictures.

But, even more than that, subsequent national events have shown Jeffords's move not only to be trivial, but self-deceiving and self-defeating as well......Allegedly, Jeffords split the GOP to get more funding for special education, but the year passed without any special ed funding passing in the congress, even with Dem control of the Senate. More hilariously, the Dems were unable to even pass dairy price supports, which the GOP always had, to benefit Vermont's dairy farms!So Vermont, enjoy your increased farm layoffs!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A Declaration?","review":"Amazing story: after campaigning as a Republican, taking Republican campaign funds, and being elected as a Republican, Jim Jeffords \\"declared\\" he was no longer a Republican. Mind you, Jim had been a Republican for years before. His party's direction was clear--and he remained. Until six months after the election, that is.His book is generally just a re-hash of his \\"speech\\" where he betrayed all the Republicans who supported him.

It seems to be missing details and lacks continuity in certain places. Details don't seem to match. For what was a very short period, the author's seems unbeleivable. Based on the Jeffords seen on tv, it does not appear to be his voice. There was probably lots of editing to sell this book to slam the Republicans. The reality painted seems to be through rose colored glasses with Jeffords having no responsibility for anything - the Republicans were the bad guys always. Also unbelievable is the Democrats being so acomodating. Consequently, it is quite difficult to believe that this one-sided view of the events reflects anykind of reality. It is impossible to believe this perception of the story has any serious grounding inthe truth.

It also includes his \\"Declaration of Independence\\" speech which was the best of his political career. And some interesting historical information about the legacy of Vermont politics.

Afterwards he denies his gift of prophecy until his grandfather's death opens a doorway to another, parallel life, where his gift is needed to wage a battle of monumental proportions. This is a beautiful, haunting book, and a compelling read. --Lynne"},{"rating":"1","title":"Need a magnifying glass to see the cards","review":"Although this game is very inexpensive, you get what you pay for in this case. Even though it has a \\"password\\" feature, it doesn't save your \\"bank\\" and the cards are so small in the GMA version, you need a magnifying glass to see them in some of the games.

Instead, Hugh Hewitt offers a very idealistic roadmap for young Christians seeking political/influential positions. While I certainly agree Christians need to get out of the church and into the world to impact it, I don't think Hewitt way is the only way.The Hewitt way is not based on scripture -- there's not much in the book -- but his own views of the world. God can use you to advance His greater purposes even if you're not a Hewitt subscriber or a Harvard grad.If you're a high school young person, a Christian, and you have a great ambition to change the world, you might glean some perspective from this book. It makes valid points but it is not gospel. Think for yourself; lean on and seek God. God is big enough to use you if only you're open to it."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointing","review":"I was pretty disappointed with this book. It is pretty much a general \\"how to succeed in life\\" book ubiquitous in book stores everywhere with the pretext of apologizing for non-moral behavior( i.e.worship of status and reputation) in justifying the ends, a supposed more Christian nation. This book does not state anything new nor does it challenge or inspire. Let me save you some money and offer you alternative advice: Work ridiculously hard, put Christ the King above all, and success will come to you."},{"rating":"1","title":"hated it","review":"I was excited to read this book, but quickly grew tired of the author's elitist, one size fits all, attitude. His advice about moving to one of the 3 major cities was comical. As if experience is limited to those cities and you can't get by without living there. Overall, some useful tidbits but I grew tired of him braggin about himself."},{"rating":"1","title":"For rich, militarist Christians","review":"Hugh Hewitt spends his time on the nation's airwaves flattering WMD developers like Frank Gaffney and other members of our military industrial mafia. If your Christ is a rich militarist, this book and Hewitt's show are for you. There do exist many well-funded churches of imperial theology, like some of the megachurches in Colorado Springs that encourage the war makers of the Air Force Academy.But, for those of you who feel \\"blessed are the peacemakers,\\" I'd recommend the books of theology by Huston Smith, Karen Armstrong, Jim Wallis or Matthew Fox. All of whom have been featured guests on the leading program of progressive spirituality, New Dimensions Broadcasting."},{"rating":"2","title":"Buy one for a grad, and one for yourself","review":"I was not familiar with Hewitt's work and expected this title to be a philosophical analysis of the Christian dilemma: how to make one's way in a world awash in sin. In, But Not Of is a practical guide; and at the same time deeply philosophical and warmly spiritual.One can take issue with a few of Hewitt's points such as his rather silly recommendation that one move to NY, LA or DC but his principles are sound. We can be successful while staying true to the teachings of Christ; we are in fact solemnly obligated to do so.I wish I had had this book in my hands when I was younger but I have to acknowledge that it would have sat unread, gift card still tucked inside. Instead, I will make good use of the ample advice it offers people of all ages and share its many teaching points with the young people I have the great privilege to mentor today.Future generations will need leaders of principle."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for young people!!!","review":"I'm 23 year old young Christian and even though there were some things I disagreed about, the book was a fantastic read.

It lacked detail and neccessary information for EACH subtest was omitted. The information seemed old and sometimes was incorrect. For example how many questions were in each section, the format for each section and even the study guide didn't at all reflect the actual CSET itself. It gave tips on teaching more so than help you prepare for the test. This was suppposed to be a STUDY GUIDE and it felt short in its qualifications.

The book is organized by content standards rather than by the test structure and devotes most time to teaching ideas.

Do not get this workout if you have knee issues because the getting up and down off the floor was really hard on mine."},{"rating":"2","title":"THE MAGIC SWORD","review":"I enjoyed this moviw trwemendously when I was a child.

Is this NOT a new CD?","review":"Ordered what was billed as a \\"new\\" copy of the Chris Isaak CD \\"Chris Isaak\\" from 1987. It arrived seemingly packaged like a new CD but when the wrapping was torn off, the CD case itself was not sealed. When I tried to rip the CD to iTunes, gracenotes did not recognize it; there was NO metadata available. I tried Windows Media Player as well--same result--no metadata. The CD does play and I was ultimately able to rip it but had to manually enter all the relevant data. My conclusion is that this is not a new CD but rather a pirated copy which does not instill confidence in the seller.

There is no room under the sink to loosen the back part of the sink trap. This tool did not work. This tool did not grip and the tool slid. Plan B.

For real shop use get something else."},{"rating":"1","title":"Missing parts when delivered, not very versatile.","review":"When I opened the box and took this tool out, the strap fell off! One of the screws holding link between the handle and the strap was missing!Since I really wanted to get the bathtub faucet off without waiting for the whole Amazon return process, I got a bolt the same size and reattached the link. When I tried to take the faucet off, the wrench just spun around no matter how tightly I got the strap.Maybe this is fine for stuff that you could do by hand anyway (oil filters and the like) but on a chromed, tightly fit object, it's not useful at all."},{"rating":"2","title":"Effective strap wrench","review":"Works great.

A little thinner on plot than the 7 books that follow, but kudos to those who thought to bring this series to print."},{"rating":"1","title":"Feels very artificial","review":"When I was a young girl and read the Little House books for the first time I had found a treasure. As soon as my children were old enough, I read the whole series to them. When I started to read the MacBride books in order to draw out the joy of the Little House series, I was disappointed at how artificial and contrived the stories seemed to be. It felt like the author was trying hard to sound like Laura Wilder and failed. Even my kids noticed the difference."},{"rating":"2","title":"A spunky girl named Rose Wilder","review":"Rose Wilder and her parents, the now-legendary Laura Ingals and Almanzo Wilder are going to Missouri. The journey is very harsh. The American west is almost literally burning up, and dust storms are a constant threat. Rose remains constant friends with her fellow travellers, Paul and George Cooley, and their parents. They are travelling together. The ROSE books have the same warmth and feel as the original Little House books and are an amazing period piece. These are more historical FICTION than the originals because there were fewer sources and weren't written by Rose herself. However, they are a true picture of pre-1900 and the dawn of that century. Some people may find a slightly less pleasing charater in Rose because she is more impatient, frustrated with being poor, and more romantic-minded than the simple, dear Laura. But many girls will associate with Rose, and this is a wonderful series."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't let these books color your memories of Laura","review":"This series is a travesty. I understand the feeling of loss when you finish a beloved series, but let Laura, not MacBride, have the last word on her family's experience. So much in his books rings false: the clumsy historical allusions, the narrative voice, the potty humor . . . One of the greatest things about Laura Ingalls Wilder's work is the way her voice advances in maturity as she, the main character, grows: Big Woods is written for little girls and Happy Golden Years for young women. MacBride doesn't manage this and talks down to readers. There is a tiny thread of Laura in these books, but not enough to do more than frustrate her fans. Sampling is for rap, not fiction."},{"rating":"1","title":"Comprehensive Reference Lacking Deeper Perspective","review":"This book will give you a printed version of the manual pages that come with the db distribution, the whole manual pages, and nothing but the manual pages. This in itself is a useful service if you (like me) prefer printed documentation over online documentation.However, I was disappointed by the fact that the book does not go beyond the manual pages by providing more complete programming examples. Also, I would have appreciated seeing some of the excellent academic papers that exist about the algorithmic underpinnings included in the book.As a final complaint, the book employs an increasingly popular binding style of using some sort of unsealed paper for binding. While I'm all for ecological packaging, I found that this style of binding (especially with a predominantly white cover) tends to take fingerprints and other smudges very easily, and makes it hard to remove them. As a result, the book starts looking ugly quite soon."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dazed and confused","review":"I'm dazed and confused, because here was an review from some user, which reviews this book as an ordinary paperback issueof BDB online documentation which can anybody download and noneed to pay for it.This review was DELETED by you and YOU should explain this, because those user's review was really right.Thanks, Amazonas."},{"rating":"2","title":"BUY IT CHEAPER AT FYE","review":"I bought this cd at FYE for only $3.99 , Go there and get it cheaper than on here.

After adopting a better set of physical habits, for the first time my pool shots felt *natural*.Every lesson is clearly filmed and narrated. The total viewing time for the video isn't long, but this is actually a good thing -- you'll want to watch some of the lessons repeatedly to let the content sink in. I wish the transitions between lessons was faster; the DVD animations/transitions get a little tedious.If you are a beginner, combine this video with some practice and you will see satisfying gains in your ability.

I spent $130 getting all the things I need to keep this old camera working and I feel very foolish. Nothing about this product will ever enable me to get that money back. Put your Mavica in the attic. One day it will be a collector's item. Take the money you were planning to spend on this and buy a good smart phone. That will give you a better camera than your Mavica.

In contrast to traditional, chronological approaches, Bernstein breaks down the musical components of jazz such as rhythm, melody, and harmony, and discusses the way they are used differently in comparison with Western European musics. Bernstein has a knack for discussing complex material and stating it in a way that all can understand, which is very evident here. Armstrong and Brubeck work wonderfully with the New York Phil. This is a must have for those just getting into jazz, jazz enthusiasts, and music educators."},{"rating":"2","title":"a classic","review":"An excellent primer about what makes jazz tick by a master on the subject.

My husband had the record as a kid (long gone) so we were happy to find it reissued on CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Opens your eyes gently but firmly","review":"I couldn't get hold of this book in the UK (not even on Amazon.co.uk.) Based on its great reviews, I ordered it express from Amazon.com - postage cost me much more than the book itself, but it was worth it!! I wanted it urgently because I had just been abandoned by my boyfriend, whom I loved from the bottom of my heart. The book has been my reference guide through the darkest moments. It made me feel soothed, like a gentle friend was hugging me. She's not harsh, but she makes it clear that we cannot have a relationship with a person who is not respecting our needs, and it's best to walk away. I finally did that (mentally) and I'm over the worst. I really do recommend this book, although I have deducted one star for the weird, New Age-y final chapter which seems to have been written by another person. FANTASTIC BOOK."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Lifesaver!","review":"I've lived through a lot of pain for many, many years, and have been looking for answers not only to understand the emotional unavailability of a person, but what to do about it to make my life better.This book has provided me with life changing answers. It so vividly describes the \\"string along\\" signs, that I have been living with, and it then goes on to show you exactly what to do about it all, so that you can life a life, or create a life that is positive and empowering.If you want a book to turn your life around, to turn the pain around, and to understand what to do and how to literally reclaim yourself, this book is an absolute lifesaver, and a definite MUST READ!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I expected. . .","review":"I read all the reviews for this book, and thought it would be helpful. However, I think that this book was helpful for people who are beginning to explore a new relationship. I in no way think this book is helpful if you have been in a long term relationhip with someone, married, or especially when children are involved. I believe that she had some very valid points, however, to me it was \\"common sense\\". I think this would be ok for a teenager, but in a real complex realtionship, good luck."},{"rating":"1","title":"no","review":"this is a terrible book. not only is it written terribly bad, but the content seems to be nothing but the authors digestion of former failed relationships. you can read her anger through the lines. it is more like an extract of a diary, rather than a book written by experience and wisdom. a waste of time and money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst book I ever bought","review":"This was the absolute worst book I have ever purchased. First of all it is extremely small and poorly written. In order to fill up the small pages, many blank lines were inserted and the author repeats the same information numberous times where there is print. The information echos the rantings of a woman newly released from a bad relationship and discounts the feelings of all others. This is fit only for someone who really is \\"the One\\". That is, if they were the one and only person on the planet."},{"rating":"1","title":"your good enough, your smart enough, and people like you","review":"A very short read which is why i'm guessing there are so many 5 star reviews.

This is a no games book. It is as fair for a man as it is for a woman, and that is why it is so helpful. I can share this book with male and female friends, because every standard, example, and chapter is applicable with relationship solutions that have given me a new perspective in many, many areas. All I can say is that if you are looking for a relationship book that will help you move above and beyond the all-too-common difficulties, this book is a keeper."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Guidance, Excellent Book!","review":"This is one of the best books I've read this year, one of the few I feel merits a review, and a five star one.Barbara Rose brings mind opening changes in this book that bring extraordinary insight into relationships, that is, first having one with yourself so that you can know how to have one with another, and how to either walk, or create a successful relationship together.If you are looking for a book that will help you open your mind and heart to truth, so that you can be \\"the one\\" then this is the relationship book to read!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This Book is THE ONE to Read","review":"I've read my share of books looking for answers in the romantic relationship area. This book gave them to me in a unique style, funny, genuine, and gave me the solutions I can easily apply to my life to create the best relationship possible, first with myself, and then with a man. I learned a LOT about the \\"string along warning signs\\" that go from the first date, and even if I was with someone for decades. What I love most about this book is that it takes you through the different scenarios in romantic relationships, and gives solutions that are great for BOTH people. There aren't any manipulative \\"tricks\\" at all, which is a welcome relief to me. The writing style is unique, down to earth, and is an enjoyable read. I know a lot more after reading this book than before I read it, which is why I love it so much."},{"rating":"2","title":"This Book is a MUST READ Gift!","review":"I've done my share of crying over relationships and after reading this book, now I know why! The insight shared gave me a gift of new understanding, and inner healing. It brought me straight answers that are real and stick out in my mind in a way that pulls me back to center - that center that I used to not have before. One of the greatest messages in this book is how it shares how to be real with a man, how to drop the walls, how to be myself! I am sharing this book with everyone I know that has challenges in their romantic relationships, including male friends. As one reviewer wrote earlier, I have to completely agree: If you are looking for answers in your relationships, you will definitely find them here! This book IS a MUST READ!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring, repetative","review":"I've already read The Rules and The Bitch books. This book is more of the same but without the humor or writing skill of the previously mentioned books.It's boring and poorly written and I started skimming within 20 minutes. By the time 30 minutes had passed, I'd lost all interest and tossed it aside.While the ideas are good, they are not novel and the author shows no invoation in her treatment of the concepts or writing finesse.Also, way over priced @ $17. A waste of money."},{"rating":"2","title":"THE ONE Book you need to get out of a bad relationship","review":"This book is written in an extremely straightforward manner. It's message is that once you have love and respect for yourself, you will be respectful in your relationships and only allow in people who respect you back. It tells you the signs of being strung along too. This was very helpful for me because I was in one of those relationships, and unwittingly promoted being strung along myself.The only reason I am giving this book 4 stars is that I really object to the price. A 150 page book should be $12 at the most, not $17.95. I almost didn't buy the book, but I wanted the info. She does give good information, but geez, give me a break with the price. Barbara is no starving writer. She can let us have a market priced book if she wants. That being said, her message is right on target and I loved the divine message at the end too."},{"rating":"2","title":"She Walks Her Talk","review":"No, I'm not Barbara Rose, (LOL) I'm Gary Renard, the best selling author of \\"The Disappearance of the Universe\\", and I, like so many other sincere people who have written reviews of this fine book, would like to say that Barbara Rose doesn't just write about spiritual principles, she lives them. When I read \\"Stop Being the String Along\\" I enthusiastically endorsed it because it rings true and I knew it would help a lot of people. Having gotten to know Barbara well in the last year I must say she is a living example of love in action. I wholeheartedly support her work and would encourage anyone to take advantage of it. We need more people like Barbara, who give of themselves tirelessly to make the world a better place."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Fantastic Book for Relationships","review":"I found this book to be quite enlightening and enormously helpful. While reading it, the information hit home, showing me all of the areas where I was going wrong in my relationships, and helped me to know finally what to do to turn it all around. So much of the information about the \\"string along warning signs\\" I have lived through, and never knew how to handle them. The author, Barbara Rose, shares with humility, wit, candor, and brings fantastic answers. I feel renewed from this book. It is a jewel, and one to definitely share with friends!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Goldmine of Answers, A MUST READ","review":"I received a goldmine of answers about relationships from this book. The parts about \\"Being who you are and true to yourself\\" and \\"Taking the games out of relationships\\" helped me enormously! The chapter about \\"Sacred relationships\\" gave me an entirely new perspective about how to relate from a spiritual level. I have lived through so much described in \\"String Along Valley\\" and now I finally know what to do and what to watch out for! This book gave me so many answers and has helped me so much. Among my friends, we now look out for the \\"string along warning signs\\" and the new phrase \\"string along relationship\\" is becoming popular, even for the guys! I have recommended this book to all of my friends, and each one thanked me. The book is small in size, but like a diamond, it is rare and priceless with the advice given. My Aunt read my copy and she said \\"I wish I had this book when I was your age.\\"I think that says it all."},{"rating":"2","title":"A guy's opinion, this author hits it right on!","review":"The info in this book hits it right on for both sexes. I used to play a lot of the games shown in this book, and after reading it, I realize how much I was stringing myself along, along with the women in my life. That's a lot to admit, but the truth is that after reading this book, I now know better. The book reads really easily, and shows how to evolve spiritually in relationships in a way that is easy to apply and understand. It's a fast read, and more than anything, extremely insightful.I'll call it the \\"must have red book for relationships\\"!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This book saved me.","review":"I purchased this book because of the reviews it received. I have been trying to figure out the reason(s) for the bizarre behavior of the man I wasn't sure if I was dating (if that doesn't make sense, consider yourself lucky -- unfortunately, it makes perfect sense to The String Along). Was he passive-aggressive? Was he married? Living with someone? Playing the field? In the end, it didn't matter. What matters is that I read this book and was able to rationalize and even quantify his behavior. He received 8 scores on Reasons to Stay and 18 on Reasons to Leave with Skidmarks (when even 1 on the latter is enough to run fast!). The day after finishing this book, I left with skidmarks. It's still hurting, but this book helped me understand that, in spite of our strong chemistry, I was being strung along. Who knows how much longer I would have tolerated the hurtful behavior had I not read this book. I deserve better and so do you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Up close and personal","review":"There should be 5 stars above, not 2.

I am here for 6 months and wanted to read a book about Afghanistan and after hearing him speak on a Sunday night got his book from our camp Chaplain. I was coming back from a day out in the city and bumped in to him today and gave him a big hug! He is a great writer and loves to educate and fill in the gaps for people. By far the best part about him is his infectious love for Jesus."},{"rating":"2","title":"Inspiring","review":"This book told the of the accounts of a man dedicated to One. This is no ordinary account of a missionary in a foreign land. We read of his good days and bad days. We see John pouring out himself to the people of Norther Afghanistan.

Bonnie's worst by a mile."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stay Away From This One!","review":"As a long-time Bonnie Raitt fan, I have generally loved everything she's put out. However, this album marks the low point in her career. No direction, no focus, \\"just lookin' for a hit.\\" No sense of self, really. Ick. I remember buying the album (the record, that is) at the time because I felt that Bonnie was never going to get the recognition she deserved and I needed to keep supporting her music. What a disappointment, even starting with the silly cover art. I've heard her do Crime of Passion in concert, and it sounds lots more soulful than this album would have you believe. She used to do No Way to Treat A Lady, too, but seems to (wisely) have dropped that from her set lists.After this came Nick Of Time and everything changed!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Nine lives she's got","review":"Every 70's artist should be allowed one bad album in the 80's. Bonnie Raitt used it up here and moved on to much greater things, eg Nick Of Time & the Grammys.First time on CD though, so it's great for fans."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nine Lives","review":"I didn't pay close enough attention and didn't realize this was a remaster of Bonnie's 80's music. Was just excited to see anything new with the Raitt name on it, so I bought it immediately. Sadly, a mistake. It is a weak and lethargic recording, but you can get a sense of what she is building up to towards Luck of the Draw and Nick of Time. It is easy enough to listen to, but it just doesn't have the punch I expect from Bonnie. She spoiled me, probably, with her later work. Can't really recommend buying this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nine Lives - Love it","review":"I think there is a bit of a reggae influence in some of the songs on this CD. I had the vinyl album years ago and am so glad to have the CD. It's one of my favorite Bonnie Raitt albums. From the other reviews, it is apparent you either love it or hate it. I don't understand how anyone could hate it. Some of my favorite songs on this album are \\"Who But a Fool\\", \\"Runnin' Back to Me\\" and \\"Crime of Passion\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Thank God the 80's are over","review":"Seriously disappointing record, unless overproduced sterile 80's rock is your thing. This album might rock, but it lacks the soulful feel of all of her other recordings. This is the one Bonnie record that I just find icky. Can't stand it. Thank God she didn't stay in this funk (and I use funk here negatively). If you don't like bland 80's rock, you will not like this album. I hate to say it but a star would be too much for this one. I do like all of her other albums; I just can't stand this one.oops, I guess it won't let me give it no stars. I'll give it one star for her voice. Her voice alone is worth at least one star I suppose, but the band still gets no stars from me."},{"rating":"2","title":"singer","review":"For in home studio recording this cord is great.

It worked for about 4 months. Now we get no sound out of the mic. If you jiggle the connection at the keyboard, you can get a slight intermittent sound. I know it's the cable because I tried a different microphone and cable. I got both of our mics to work on a different cable. I am in the process of deciding on whether to send it back in under the warranty because I have to pay for shippping and the cable was only $9.68 to begin with. Be aware that it's possible to get a bad cable.Update: I did end up giving another cable a shot. It too stopped working after about 6 months. Again, the microphone is fine if I use another cable. I would stay clear of this microphone cable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Elliot Engel: POMPOSITY PERSONIFIED!","review":"Recently, I had the misfortune to hear \\"Dr\\" Engel's sleep-inducing Tent & Pony Show lecture on Margaret Mitchell & Gone With The Wind. The truth is, I have never heard or witnessed anyone who was so full of himself...and for so little reason! His condescending demeanor, both on and off the stage, was a genuine turn off. His \\"lecture\\", which was filled with half-truths and wild speculation, was followed by a shameless & tacky promotion to buy his VHS Tapes, books and DVD's. He actually set up a card table in the lobby and mercifully, after attempting to sell his wares, left without even a minimal \\"thank you\\" to his audience or hosts!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The greatness of The Greatness","review":"Professor Engel is a brilliant public speaker whose insight is hilarious and informative. Very similar to Bill Bryson in his ability to entertain and educate at the same time (think of Bryson's Mother Tongue or Made in America books).

I was hoping for something at least relating to the movie, and instead got a video with some guy lecturing to the audience about his perspectives on GWTW (for the ENTIRE video). It felt like a boring classroom lecture ..... definitely NOT worth the price nor the money spent!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Synthesized sterility","review":"Aside from a few distinct passages, this comes encased in 80's production so densely plastic it hard to appreciate seldom segments that do gel. Davis obviously sought Miller's direction for late-career relevance but with Tutu vibrancy ended up backfiring."},{"rating":"2","title":"An upbeat adventure in rock-jazz fusion.","review":"Miles Davis career spans a huge array of jazz music, and his creativity continued to inspire new avenues of exploration.

There's nothing of Miles genius in this. Boring."},{"rating":"1","title":"Without a doubt the nadir of the career of Miles Davis.","review":"Bland synthesizer sonic tempos shift in and out of Miles excellent playing. The trouble with this album (and most of what he released in the 1980's ) is that his lines are wasted playing with such insipid textures. I love the electric fusion of the late 70's, but unfortunately this album really tarnishes his output. I would of have given this album 1 star if anyone else were playing the trumpet. This should not be a priority even if you are a completist."},{"rating":"1","title":"Commercialized pap","review":"This album is beneath Miles' talents, a commercialized, cynical attempt to cash in on light pop trends. Miles does not play with a group of musicians here, in any sort of interaction. He solos, not as well as on most of his albums, over pop textures. One is forced to ask--is this really music, or is it manufactured sound, artificially concocted to cash in. This might be O.K. for a third rate talent to dabble in, but it is not O.K. for a great artist. With this album Miles abandoned any notion of trying to create art. It would be like Picasso deciding to add some mundane figures to a series of dull postcards--just too far beneath the talent of a real artist. Even this lapse of taste and artistic integrity might be excused in some sense if the result was a compelling pop album, but this is not a quality pop product either."},{"rating":"1","title":"An awful surprise","review":"After listening to the tracks Tutu and Full Nelson from the \\"Miles Davis: Live Around the World,\\" I decided to buy the original album.

His statments about the world view of scientists (e.g. nature is only for the benefit of man) are not just wrong, they are also arrogant and offensive to anybody working in the natural sciences.Worst of all is the section on \\"postcolonial studies of science\\", where he appears to be pushing his own little agenda, although it has no connection to Kuhn's work."},{"rating":"2","title":"terrific trio","review":"This Cd is an excellent combination of these three artists, who, individually are stars in their own right but when together the blends of their voices is magical."},{"rating":"2","title":"a joy","review":"this album (cd) was a complete joy to listen to. the harmonies of these three ladies is so well blended that it flows seamlessly. just the perfect selection of tunes to accentuate theses voices. kudos to whoever brought them together"},{"rating":"2","title":"Trio- Parton,Rondstat and Harris","review":"This album has been out for a long time.

The original is far superior in every aspect (other than the aforementioned animation itself). Yes, I know the OVA runs more true to the original manga, but crikey, they've *ruined* this.

The rough guide is very critical and is a great balance to these other guides.If you aren't interested in \\"roughing\\" it and staying in lower priced hotels.. the guides are still very useful in rating attractions, and areas in which to stay... but you will need another book to look at more moderate and luxury hotels.I would definitely read this book before going to Europe."},{"rating":"2","title":"pretty good","review":"This doesn't have as much practical how-to info. as Rick Steves' Backdoor book.

The fact that we can and do distinguish between waking (i.e. ordinary) consciousness and dream consciousness means that the two must be qualitatively different - and in fact they are. The discontinuity of dreams among other features distinguishes them as derivative conscious states, that is to say they are not primary - everyday waking consciousness is primary. We define dreams relative to waking states and not vice-versa for a variety of reasons, and Wallace does little to challenge these obvious differences. It's a bit like saying \\"everything's alive\\" or \\"everything's conscious\\" - statements like these tend to cheapen the meanings of these words, if everything is, then nothing is."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Quality Printing","review":"The book was obviously printed from a scanned image and not from an original text file.

I feel sorry for anyone listening to it for the first time its plain torture. I also feel sorry for people who werent around in the 1970's to hear Chicago when the wrote and performed their best music. This album is cheesy pointless ballad laden just like Chicago-17 and like the albums to follow. The only good song on here is Bill Champlin's song called All Right.

My driving instructor asked me why I was crying. He said that I was living during the happiest time of my life. For some teens that is true. It certainly wasn't for me. If you are such a teen or know one, Debbie Thurman's journal would be a good exercise for a girl with self-esteem problems. Half of each page is devoted to her commentary of typical teenage girl problems. The other half is left blank so that the teen can write in it.I think that every youth group leader or pastor should have this journal available for girls that are in their group. Writing is a powerful tool for healing. Parents, too, should consider giving this to a daughter who is having a tough time during the teen years.

I usually end up turning my system off because I can't save and don't want to waste the battery power.Second, you can't really tell which spaces are yours on the board. If you want to know what spaces you own prepare to spend more time going through the game manager tool to see what you own and do not own.The music is ok but after hours of playing the game it REALLY gets annoying! It overall has poor viewing of the board and other things such as title cards etc.Even if you are a huge monoploy fan you shouldn't buy this game.I bought and suggest the game \\"Monopoly Party\\" that is available for Gamecube, X box, and playstation 2. It is a lot better."},{"rating":"1","title":"new monopoly","review":"This is a great game except for one thing and it is a big one..................

When an opponent goes bankrupt, they simply quit the game and don't pay any of their debt to the player that bankrupted them. You get a message that the player simply \\"resigns\\" from the game. When this happens all of their property reverts back to being available for sale, all of their cash disappears and the player who bankrupted them gets NOTHING! And, just to clarify, all of the CPU players resign from the game in this manner without paying any of their debt, not just the last one left in the game.This bug means that you can spend most of your money building hotels and knock out 2 of the 3 CPU players without getting a single dollar back, only to then lose to the last player due to a relatively small rent owed. Considering the whole point of Monopoly, this is an unforgivable bug that completely ruins the game."},{"rating":"1","title":"Gameplay/Dice Rolling Is Too Slow","review":"I read all the reviews on Amazon and decided to get the game anyway because it was cheap. Overall, the slowness of the gameplay makes the game unplayable. Every time you roll the dice the screen animates to follow the dice rolling, moves back to your gamepiece, and then follows it as it moves to each spot (10-12 seconds). Playing the game in person or on other systems (Gameboy, PC), dice rolling takes around 5 seconds. That sounds pretty picky to break it down by the second but just imagine a normal game of Monopoly taking twice as long because of dice rolling. That's what you get with this game.If anyone disagrees, please post a review about how you enjoy watching dice roll and pieces moving for 45 minutes of a 90 minute game.

My favorite cuts though, are the ones where I feel she's not trying so hard to prove how bitchin' she is: The SLOW cuts. Christina, you are already bitchin' and mighty fine. Anyone as beautiful and gifted as you are doesn't need to have a whole horn section and half of the drummers of New York City behind you, babe. Just take that dynamite voice and don't forget it's already a miracle just in itself. And you know what, listeners, she does, too, but you almost have to wait for the very last cut, the most vulnerable, most moving, most achingly beautiful, and least funky song on this great album. What A Talent!"},{"rating":"2","title":"In one word: Incredible","review":"\\"Spiritually Wet\\"is incredible! What Christina does with her voice is amazing. Her music is upbeat and energizing, sensual and soulful, fun and funky! She wraps this all up into such a beautiful package and delivers it with such awesome emotion, you just know it's coming from deep within. Did I mention her sexy growl?.....you have to hear it to believe it, too cool. This CD will definitly get you moving, dancing, rocking and singing. Without a doubt, 2000 belongs to Christina Fasano!"},{"rating":"2","title":"very funky, Inviting to the ear,Deep,sensual, must hear live","review":"I hear some deep rooted funk coming from this petite funky little white girl, Impressive! Who wouldv'e thought? A true phenomenon for the music industry to taste. I was very moved by the lyrics also by the sultry funk grooves, hypnotic... I would love to see her perform live! This is a breath of fresh air to the everyday hum drum boring music I've been subjected to. She brings something different to the industry, Bound to make a hit in this crazy business of music. I wish Christina Fasana all the luck in the world, and I look forward to more stuff in the future.SincerilY Yours,D.

The book really doesn't have much to say about pilots, but is all about space craft flown in the Star Wars universe. While there are a few non-space vehicles described, e.g. podracers, most of the book is dedicated to famous Star Wars vehicles. X-Wings, TIE Fighters, the Millenium Falcon, the Executor, Slave 1, and the Invisible Hand are all mentioned as well as escape pods and Republican gunships. The book is filled with pictures from the movies, which makes it attractive for young readers. Though this is a level 3 book, many of the words seem more difficult than that too me. However, the books chronological order makes it easier to make sense of it all. Overall, this is a great book for young Star Wars fans."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved by a little Star Wars fan!","review":"My 4 year old is a new Star Wars fan and LOVES this book!

You can get more and better letters and instruction for FREE just by going to Bencivenga Bullets or Clayton Makepeace on the web, or saving your junk mail. I'm a direct response writer and have made $100k+ a year freelancing for over a decade, and I think it's morally reprehensible to try and get this much money from beginning writers. Author doesn't seem to have even one original idea -- the book's name isn't even original -- Abbie Hoffman famously wrote \\"Steal this Book\\" more than 30 years ago.

I can do better with wikitravel -- print it out at a readable font size.Then there's Lonely Planet's penchant for describing everything in glowing terms -- when everything is awesome, you wonder if you can trust the source, and it defeats the point of buying a guidebook.Consider wikitravel first -- print out the Singapore page, and ones for specific areas in Singapore, like Riverside or Orchid."},{"rating":"2","title":"Always a good travel guide brand","review":"It was Lonely Planet Vietnam that got me hooked on their series, and after traveling throughout Southeast Asia, I maintain Lonely Planet are the best travel advisor books, with the Rough Guide series a close second.

This particular one is not quite as strong as their Vietnam one, but I think will improve in the next version."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a good Lonely Planet","review":"I love Lonely Planet, and have traveled to dozens of countries following their advice. This guidebook, however, was pretty worthless (at least for peninsular Malaysia and Singapore, where we were). The food recommendations were very hit-or-miss (so after a while we ditched their advice and followed wikitravel/tripadvisor (luckily we had internet everywhere we were)), and the maps were AWFUL. Kuala Lumpur's was completely unusable. For planning, the book was OK--descriptions of sites were good, but not so much for logistics, which may reflect Malaysia's rapidly improving infrastructure more than the book itself. We were a bit frustrated by finding accommodation in Malaysia-- almost all of the LP reviews are somewhat tepid, and considering how inexpensive accommodation is in MY, we would have liked some more rave-worthy guesthouses. Not sure if that reflects on the book or the country, though. Still, until LP updates this book, I'd go with a different guidebook."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Few Info on KL","review":"This is not a recommended book if you have only some days in KL.

Even the lobsters don't seem to cooperate with this author. If the author were not a woman doing a traditional man's job the manuscript for this book would never have made it onto the mail boat.

She was a participant in the Perfecet StormB. I grew up in coastal Maine,C. I have built wooden boats and love the ocean.That said her portrayal of the lobstering life seems quite accurate.

I also read TONS, and many different types of books. No, the author is not a professional writer by trade; i still enjoyed what she had to say...i got laughs from the book, and learned alot about lobstering."},{"rating":"2","title":"Linda Greenlaw goes fishing","review":"I have not read \\"The Hungry Ocean\\" so without having another of Linda Greenlaw's books with which to compare \\"The Lobster Chronicles\\", I nonetheless thought this a worthy effort. Ms. Greenlaw writes with a breezy style, punctuated with anecdotes about her neighbors and family. Her language is often as colorful as the people around her. I was a little bothered by her predictable style of humor. It's funny in the beginning but wears a little thin by the end.A short promo appearing on the dustjacket written by Sebastian Junger describes Ms. Greenlaw's book (in part) as \\"the best book, period I've ever read on fishing\\". The author writes some about lobster fishing but her book is really about her family and friends....and, of course, about her. I would have liked to have heard more from her about lobstering but I'm happy with this good summer read."},{"rating":"2","title":"laughter among the lobsters","review":"Our discussion on Linda Greenlaw's second memoir-type book, was full of laughs. This is in contrast to her first, very serious effort about the death defying Hungry Ocean and being captain of a swordfish boat. Returning home to live on an island of only 70 year-round residents, with 30 being related to Linda, would require humor. She provides daily events which entertain and reveal true Maine island characters. Lobstering is not easy either, but her family and island friends make the long, cold winter an intimate affair. Who wants to attend those community meetings, anyway? Same problem in crowded cities on shore...I am looking forward to Greenlaw's third book, fiction next, I believe?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Entertaining Look @ NE sea community culture.","review":"If you are looking for an entertaining, easy read and enjoy reading about the ocean and/or the sociocultural aspect of nautical life, written by someone with a good nack for writing then this is your book. I read it and have loaned it out 2 or 3 times, and haven't heard any complaints....which these days is saying alot, considering some of the stuff that gets published out there, and slapped with a $25 price tag only to end up on a clearance rack for good reason."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what it should have been","review":"I was prepared to like this one. I did not read Greenlaw's previous work, but the idea of presenting life on a Maine island, delving into the trials and simple joys of this life, really appealed to me. I wish that was what Greenlaw had done here. Instead I found a series of dull complaints about inept handymen, the lackluster love life of the author, and character sketches that are so lacking in detail that I can't understand why they were included. Chapter after chapter of complaining about the poor season, her father, her poverty, become so tedious that you hope she gets a few lobsters just so she'll stop whining. Even the sections that were more enjoyable, when she's writing about the nuts and bolts of lobster fishing, are written in a style that just lies on the page. There was a great idea here, somewhere, buried under the bad prose."},{"rating":"1","title":"A big disappointment","review":"I enjoyed The Hungry Ocean and was intrigued by the articles I'd read about Greenlaw's newest book. This book was really boring and choppy though, and I confess that I was reduced to skimming the last half. If you want to read about Maine and the people who live there, read anything by Ruth Moore, notably The Weir. It is, however, out of print, but perhaps you can find a copy through your favorite online bookseller..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Barely a book","review":"I don't get it. There is no story, just a meandering. While I was hoping to be drawn in to a vivid life of ocean hardship and island comforts, it is just kind of drab.The pages are easy to turn, and she writes nicely. I realized half way through the book that it was going nowhere. I finished it anyway, hoping for some insight or revelation. There was none, except of course for the map that appears at the end, too lately revealed for it to serve it's function."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Lobster Chronicles is lost at sea","review":"Linda Greenlaw had a bad year lobstering and a worse year writing.

I've just had them sitting on the shelf trying to find the time to read one. I started with this book and I will have to read more. Given the time this book was written (1987 I think)it still has a good edge on it. If you saw the movie don't expect the book to be close. The story line is completly different.

If you want a good \\"killer virus\\" thriller, try The Andromeda Strain by Michael Crichton. What really annoyed me about this book was the ending. Oh, of course, Marissa just FALLs for what was supposed to be the evil boss. It's as if she totally forgets about Tad who has gone through all sorts of trouble for her.All in all, it's not the worst book I've read by far.

After I read the book, I looked at the cover and first pages to see what the review excerpts said. All of them said, \\"Robin Cook is a suspense master.\\" None of the quotes referred to OUTBREAK itself, I think because the publisher couldn't find any good reviews about the book. And I was appalled at how Cook didn't think the reader could figure out who the bad guy is. It is so transparent, as to be laughable! And last but not least, the book is horribly dated, in that doctors are the bad guys and HMO's are the good guys in it. As everyone knows now, HMO's are revealing themselves as more heartless than the mafia. Robin Cook has tried to rectify what he did in OUTBREAK by writing books since that show HMO's for the truly evil organizations they usually turn out to be. And I bought this book at a Robin Cook book signing, and had him sign it personally, so I was predisposed to like this book. But I sure didn't."},{"rating":"1","title":"a disapointing book","review":"I chose to read this book because I like suspense novels about deadly viruses and diseases.

I wouldn't be able to put it down until I'd look at the clock and force myself to stop reading.The author really makes you feel and understand her emotions and experiences.

The book was almost unbearably sad to read, but it rang absolutely true to the way I remember this crisis and its effect on my father and our family, especially the overwhelming sense of shame we all lived with. Mr. Cottle lists his research and statistics in the first chapter, and then he simply tells stories of trauma experienced by the various men he interviewed. The stories haunt you long after you've put the book back on the shelf. They make you wonder how to really help these men and their families. And you're also left with a more compassionate view of the long-term unemployed. They aren't lazy, useless folks to be disposed of, but human beings with souls who have experienced what amounts to a life tragedy.

I applied this cream all over her back (where her rash was) \\"liberally\\" as per instruction and tried to massage it into her skin. I was a bit concern that it seems to just make the area greasy and the skin is not absorbing the cream. From past history with my own eczema, creams that leaves on greasy often doesn't help and usually makes the condition worse. Sure enough, it didn't help and seems to make it worse. After using it for 2 days and seeing the rash growing and getting bumpier and redder, I switched over to the Aveeno Baby Eczema cream and you can see vast improvement in a day. By the start of day 3 using the Aveeno product, the rash is all gone from her back.

I've used a few laptops over the years, and this one appears quite nice. Just three additions for anyone wanting a critical review:1. Although the screen is quite nice on the whole, the screen on my 5500 has slight vignetting (darker shading) at the lower corners. It's not significant, but it is noticeable.2. The built-in wireless sensitivity does not match that of my Motorola, AT&T; or SMC PCMCIA cards. This is disappointing when trying to catch an 802.11b/g signal across the house.3. The touch pad is not as easy to use as others (e.g., Dell, HP).

In Antarctica she saw many animals like penguins, ice fish, whales, and elephant seals. Ice fish have special blood that won't freeze because they live in very cold water. She lived at Palmer Station on Anvers Island. While she was there she drew a lot of pictures of the animals and landscape. I learned many interesting things about Antarctica. For example; there are one hundred million penguins. No humans live there. It is five and a quarter million square miles. It's bigger than Europe. In Antarctica the sun is always shining.

It was with much anticipation that I picked up his latest to read. This was was a departure from his earlier efforts that were more horror and gothic than crime thriller.The book was definately readable however I have to agree with the prior reviews. There were too many charactors and it was hard at times to keep them straight ( no pun intended as most were gay! ) I would have liked some background on Adam besides the minor details we were given.I have several friends in recovery and no one can make a recovery from alcohol dependancy as quickly as Adam.I look forward to his next book and hope he returns to his roots in gothic horror and leaves this type of mystery to writers who can better handle the genre ( Micheael Connelly, Jonathan Kellerman)"},{"rating":"1","title":"A departure from something good...","review":"Rice's third book to me was as disappointing as finding out his mother was no longer continuing her Vampire Chronicles. Another Rice letdown after being such a huge fan. Christopher's departure from a more dark, gothic type of mystery has left me bored and disappointed. Alone, Light Before Day may be a decent novel but in comparison to his previous work is lacking something special. Rice has taken me to a world that is as shallow and unfortuantely as incapable of drawing me in as West Hollywood itself. A suggestion for Rice would be to move back to New Orleans and recapture the mystique and darkness missing in this novel that was all too present in his first two novels."},{"rating":"1","title":"so bad it's bizarre it was written or published.......","review":"Christopher Rice is a good writer, with an occassional sly wit, and a gift for spinning involved interesting tales. But he tends toward the end of his books to get a bit overwrought with improbable turns of events. This book however reads like a bizarre parody of his writing style. Too many characters, characters with nonsensical motives. This starts crisply, with nice scene setting background, but then a cascade of characters starts and it all falls apart. This is a clunker if there ever was one. Mr Rice ought to get new editors."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible","review":"I quit reading on page 214. (The book has 322 pages.)

Like his two previous works he draws us in and shocks us with everchanging plot curves. Yeah, he can go a bit over-the-top, but you accept it as part of the whole work.Again, Chris has a knack for interesting and well crafted characters.

The plot was all over the place; too many characters; and at times too confusing. The plot twists that were jaw-dropping in his first 2 books are completely gone here. Hope he does better on his next one."},{"rating":"1","title":"A disappointing offering","review":"I was a big fan of Christopher Rice's first two novels and anxiously awaited his third. I don't know what happened between novel two and three, but this offering is bitterly disappointing. Rice seems to be trying to do just too much in this novel. The story lines are multiple and confounding; half the time I had to go back and reread sections to remember who the characters were. Layer upon layer of story lines were just too much: Internet mogul disappearance, West Hollywood serial killer, closeted marine suicide, kiddie porn ring, central valley meth trade, etc. What does it all add up to? A tiring mess.I hung in there 'til the end just to finish the book, but it was not easy. Much of the phrasing and dialogue was just plain stilted and I found myself cringing over and over again and reaching for a red pencil. Where was Rice's editor on this one? For that matter, where was Rice? I will not be looking so forward to his next novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"An awful book","review":"I was going to write a long awful review of this book, but after reading some of those before me I will just echo their thoughts. Rice's first book was depressing but great. You cared about the characters and the book. His second book was less good but still an enjoyment. This book-Simply awful, too many characters, awful plot, confusing as hell. I just finished it today and thanked god it was over. This makes me hesitate to buy another one of his books."},{"rating":"2","title":"Quick read","review":"Rice's new book is a quick but gripping read. As a fellow Los Angeles resident and frequent guest at some West Hollywood establishments listed in the book, I think Rice has captured the essence of the gay scene in that city. It's shallow, drug-addicted, and constantly filled with wannabes that will do anything to get ahead in the \\"business.\\" One of the other customer reviews said that it didn't make them care about West Hollywood--it's not supposed to! This book marks an increasing maturity in Rice's writing, and, no, it may not be as gothic as his other ones, but those writers that don't mature and evolve become pigeonholed. Like usual, he has a lot of subplots going on in this book, but he manages to tie them all together much more skillfully. Overall, it's a good read as long as you don't go in looking for a classic novel."},{"rating":"2","title":"His best yet...","review":"There is almost nothing quite as endearing to me as a young, flawed protagonist. The hero of Christopher Rice's most recent novel is a down at heel young reporter at the end of his emotional rope who is trying to keep all of his problems under control long enough to catch villains, prove his own innocence and salvage his career and private life, all at the same time.Add to the above villains of the sort who deal in nasty stuff like crystal methamphetamine and illicit porn, you have a fast easy, enjoyable read. But that's not all. Light Before Day seems written in a style that reminds me of some of my favourite authors of the past...Jonathan Kellerman, P.D. James, Donna Tartt; I'm even reminded of the gothic of the Bronte Sisters. Rice's writing and style has matured with this third book and while there are admittedly a great many turns and twists in his latest, he seems able to clear up most of them by the end.I'm really looking forward to his fourth!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Major disapointment after previous efforts.","review":"While reading this book, my interest in it became \\"so light it could be blown over in a strong wind,\\" in spite of the flashy \\"sodium lights\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"simply amazing","review":"This book is my new favorite book. At first, I was just reading it for something to do, but soon after starting it I was enthralled by what I was reading. The complexity and depth of this novel is what is truly astounding. Almost everything you think you know about what is happening is unraveled by the end, when Rice pulls out all the stops. This book is one of the best I have ever read, and I would recommend it to anyone and everyone. I haven't read the other two books by Christopher Rice, but if this book is anything to go by, I'm getting them tomorrow. By the end of the book, every minor plot line and every intricate detail are revealed to have grave importance, and nothing is as it seems. It's thrilling and suspenseful, and all around a great read. Everyone should read it."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Density of Souls & The Snow Garden Part Two: Lost in LA","review":"I was extremely disappointed in this novel, especially after reading his first two. It was far too redundant. It was the exact same thing I had read twice before. Except this time they were in LA and everyone was attractive. I live in Palm Beach, I don't need more hotties in my life. I need realistic gay porn. Dammit. Heh, ok, kidding. But, it was just too cliche'. I couldn't bring myself to finish it, despite my best attempts. I was bored out of my mind. AND ... for back up ... my dear friend who turned me on to Rice in the first place couldn't stand the novel either and refused to finish it. So, I don't think I'm alone on this one. It's not bad ... but it's not worth reading either ... especially if you've read his other two novels. The whole time I was reading going \\"been there, done that, give me NEW!!\\"Don't waste your time. Just re-read one of his others instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Rice's best work","review":"After reading Density and Snow, I too was eager to get my hands on Light, and even paid the full retail price at the store.... I must say though, I wish I'd waited and checked it out of the local library and saved $25. Like another reviewer, two-thirds of the way through the book, I wondered if it was written by some half-asleep rookie who had no solid concept of fiction writing. But unfortunately, the man who's work I had grown to love and appreciate really did write this utterly confusing and boring bunch of rubbish. Chris Rice really let me down with this one. I am keeping the faith that his next attempt at a novel won't be as aggravatingly dull and poorly constructed. If I can say something positive about this book, it would be.... Ahhh, who am I kidding? I can't! Don't bother with this book unless you're just curious to see what crappy writing looks like."},{"rating":"2","title":"Stoner Rock at it's Finest....","review":"This is (dare i say) possibly the best Clutch album to date...

This is not a new Clutch album that was released in 2004. It was recorded on the band's own funds and production skills in 1992 and then sold out of the back of their tour truck until they got a record deal in 1995. If listened to with this retrospective in mind, it is astonishing to hear the roots and direction of the even greater band that was yet to come. The sound quality may not be top-notch, but it only adds to the charm of this infectious and talented group. Hearing will make you feel, understand, and appreciate their more recent music better. A must for any long-time fan."},{"rating":"1","title":"Huge disappointment","review":"I have been a big clutch fan for years now and absolutely loved the \\"clutch\\" album. I also have been fond of the elephant riders and the recent blast tyrant albums. Any of these albums are good purchases. Did not enjoy Pure Rock Fury that much and absolutely hate this album.

Shame on you Clutch."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's Clutch...what more do you need?","review":"This is Clutch's most experimental record top date, and it truly is awesome. It may not be a \\"refined\\" as their other releases, but it has a unique feel that the others definitely do not have. In my opinion, though, Clutch is one of the few bands where each release is significantly different from the ones before. It is a short CD at c. 35 minutes, but still worth it by far."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great Clutch album","review":"First of all, this was released after \\"The Elephant Riders\\" after Clutch left columbia records due to low sales from the record labels lack of promoting the band. So Clutch released this originaly on River Road Records, which may have been their own label. I have yet to get the re-release but I will soon. But anyone who likes later Clutch from Elephant to Blast should like this. It is different and kind of strange at first but it is Clutch at their best just jamming and having fun. I agree with the other reviewers about track 2 being the best. I have been a fan since the first time I saw the video of A shogun Named Marcus on MTVs headbangers ball back in 1993. Bottom line is, yes this is a solid album, yes it is different, but listen to it a couple of times and I'm sure you will like it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretty much crap","review":"I got this book thinking it would help with animation principles and some technical aspects, but it gleans over everything so quickly that the whole thing is useless. For example the chapter on Web Animation is about 4 pages long and covers Animated Gifs- Yeah, because what I really wanted to learn was how to make a looping picture of a clown on a ball. It also touches upon Flash, but its only given a 2 page spread and the only info it gives is \\"Flash is good for web animation!\\" This book has nice coulor photographs, but the only information it gives is stuff you probably already know like you need a camera for stop motion and that you should figure out what your cartoon will be about before making it. Oh, and apparently Angelina Anaconda is the end-all be-all of animation."},{"rating":"2","title":"Overview of all things animated","review":"This was a required text for my Animation 101 course. I knew nothing about animation, but I do now! This book is great for beginners as it starts with the history of animation from cave drawings to the first animated short and moves to cel animation before ending at computer animation. It thoroughly goes through all the different types of animation; cel, stop motion, go motion, cut out, claymation, computer, etc. It's also nice because it shows the benefits of storyboards and having the right equipment for doing certains types of animation."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very general, not any real information for a class.","review":"I thought that it will give any information that any class would need.

It is a very pretty book and the illustrations are really eye-catching but there isn't much substance beyond that. The topics are handled in such a light overview that they aren't helpful to anyone who may be looking into creating their own animations. The useful material in the entire book would have only filled 2 to 2 1/2 pages. It certainly isn't a \\"complete course\\" nor does it pass along anything more than the most generic information."},{"rating":"2","title":"Manager","review":"A remarkable book in getting anyone up to speed in the world of Accounts Payable.

I took it upon myself to take a peek before the manager returned. In all of years in a/p, I can write the book. Carefully flipping the worn pages I heard myself saying \\"oh I didn't know that.\\" The manager said he purchased it to get a better understand of the a/p process. However, it has a few loose pages because his staff also refers to it. He recommend this and another a/p reference book, which I will get soon."},{"rating":"2","title":"Such a touching book","review":"I read this book in 2 days. I never wanted to put it down. It is so very touching and I wanted there to be a squeal; I wanted to see how Leah and her family made it through. I needed a Kleenex for this one. I'm not one who gets emotionally attached to a book but this one just caught me. She had a burning passion for soccer. She almost gave it up because her father became ill with cancer. People who loved and cared for her (like Clay) were completely pushed away. At one point she says she is done with soccer, Clay, and college. Her father is in so much pain and towards the end he just wants to give up and enter God's Kingdom. This book made me think, cry, laugh, and smile. This is a great book I would recommend and read again. I checked it out from the library and I defiantly will be purchasing it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Going for the Record","review":"Going for the Record is a book about a really driven high school girl to become an amazing soccer player.

I think this is a really good book and recommend it to any young adult reader."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not just another book about marriage - a must have","review":"As a fellow author, I read many books by people who have great marriages who try to speak to those who are struggling with a difficult marriage. My friend was going through a tough time and I picked up this book to read it before giving it to her. I knew within a few pages that this was no ordinary book. It was the journey of a woman who had been there -- is still there in some aspects -- and who counseled with the wisdom that only comes through experience. She offers hope through her own journey, but also offers practical counsel and applicable steps. I will recommend this book to any of my friends who are going through a tough patch in their marriage and who are trying to reclaim the joy they once experienced. This is a must-have book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Keeps terrible time - maybe I got a lemon!","review":"This clock looks really cool. Unfortunately the second hand tick is loud enough that it was banished to the guest bedroom (I like ticking, but he doesn't). So since I never have to actually use it as an alarm clock, it doesn't matter much that the clock runs nearly an hour fast every few weeks. This is ridiculous for a modern clock, IMO. Sure looks cool though! Did I mention that? I have two other Big Ben clocks.

A planet so remote that at night the sky is only black. No other planets, no moon, no stars. And the star of the system itself flares up every now and then with lethal radiation, thus forming a society in which those who can predict these Ordeals are powerfull, especially since they can grand and deny access to the Keeps where it is save during these periods. A few nice finds like the use of transporters as means of transport on the planet: no roads, no role for \\"distance\\" in their fysics. But the plot is a bit predictable, and the society with three groups gets a lot of attention in the book, but is perhaps a bit to well known nowadays.

Not much more to say really.My only complaint is that the thumb adjuster on the handle for the 3rd pin has virtually no tension on it, so you have to keep pressure on it as you operate the tool.

It is a poorly constructed tool for one purpose only. It will scratch up the back of any watch you use it on. It's clumsy, its difficult to adjust, and poorly designed. The bits are not magnetized, so they fall out of the wrench when you try to use them. There are no instructions or hints for which type of bit you use on each watch style. Once you figure it out, they still don't fit well. Just skip this one if you can."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good","review":"It works. Quality of the product is okay, cant complain for the price.

The product had mixed reviews but was reasonably priced so I took a chance on it. The quality of the tool is very poor. It's not surprising that it is made in China. The wooden box that it comes in is very thin and flimsy. I thought my finger might go through it when I was opening it. None of the pins that come with it fit my Seiko watch properly. The wrench kept slipping off the back of the watch. I didn't want to scratch it so I stopped after several attempts to get the back off. One of the pins didn't even fit into the wrench! Very poor quality and design."},{"rating":"1","title":"Total Failure","review":"First of all, the case came broken and all the small adapters and tools were loose inside the package. Then you could feel the cheap materials it was made of. One of the clamps (jaw), the center one wouldn't move to change size. Another one wouldn't fit none of the adapters so it was a total failure.

This is NOT worth the $."},{"rating":"1","title":"Gets the job done, but barely","review":"The only reason I'm not complaining more, is the thing was only $7.95. So I guess you get what you pay for. But what you get is a wrench which for me the top sockets don't allow the bits to fit properly, and they constantly fall out. If you just need a wrench desperately and can't afford better, this is good enough. But if you have some more to spend, find another product. Knowing what I know now, I certainly wouldn't buy it again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Useless for me","review":"Didnt work for me. The bits are loose enough to move in their socket. Ended up leaving a few scratches on the case back and still could not get it to open.Also seemed as though the manufacturer was in a hurry to get it off its hands. It was not even clean.

I ran across this item and it seemed like it would be easy to use. Wrong! It's cheaply made and difficult to use. Trying to find the \\"bits\\" to fit the back of my watch was a chore and they are not precisely made to be exactly the same size and shape. The first time I tried to get the back off the watch I gave up after about 15 minutes. It was several weeks later I tried again and was finally successful. Using the tool was like trying to take the back off with a pipe wrench. It's awkward and quite clumsy and I consider myself lucky to get a good enough grip that actually loosened the back of the watch. Bottom line; you get what you pay for. This item is cheaply made, difficult to use and therefore not worth buying."},{"rating":"1","title":"not perfect","review":"i bought this a few weeks ago in order to open the back case of my casio watch. the little pins don't fit right in the hole of the wrench, so, that you don't have a secured grip.I can not recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very poor quality","review":"This is one of the poorest quality tools I've ever purchased. Two of the three pins fall out of the sockets as soon as the tool is flipped over, which makes it somewhat difficult to align the pins with the watch case.

However, a cursory examination of the various parts that came with the tool gives me an idea why this tool cost me $6: its components are/look cheap.The watch case wrench comes with 15 bits, 3 bits forming a triad. Two of those triads are round 1 mm bits, one is round 2 mm, and the remaining 2 triads are straight 5 mm. The round bits are fine. The 5mm bits however as completely inconsistent. Some aren't even straight, which makes me wonder how they are supposed to grip a watch back properly.The tool will likely work on a watch. However, if you are in the least bit persnickety about your watch back, this is not the tool for you.On a side note: given the number of Jaxa-type tools on Amazon, it is really frustrating that one cannot tell if a $15 tool is better than a $5 tool.

The pins that engage the depressions in the watch back are not held rigid due to the poor construction and sloppy fit of the wrench components. So first it is difficult to get the tool to hold its adjustment. Then when you apply torque the pins tilt and lose their purchase, slipping out of the watch slots and scratching the back. It looks like a Jaxa wrench, but that's all you get, looks. No performance. The wooden box is OK; might be good for storing watch band accessories or other related tools. You'll have plenty of room in the box since the wrench itself will soon be in the garbage, or tossed out the back door. Take a look at an L-G brand for around $50.

This is one of Breyers newest molds, produced in response to collector demand for more modern models that better reflected the change in breed types since the dates of the first Breyer molds in the 50's & 60's. Zippo Pine Bar was a famous American Quarter Horse who changed the face of Western riding.Eductional value of this model & other Breyer collectibles is endless, because the model horse showing hobby is based on reproducing the real horse world in miniature.

Still the graphics were pretty good and the storyline entertaining (played as the female). I also liked how the swords and armor looked different depending on what was equiped and which type. There were a few frustrating moments when the character got stuck on the side of a wall or boulder while fighting, but these were all momentary glitches. I bought this game used for a fraction of the price after reading all the poor reviews, but overall I found it a great game and a decent first try/quick release for the PS3."},{"rating":"1","title":"How dare they?","review":"This game is bad. Really bad. Whoever tested this game either was ignored or didn't actually play it. Many holes. Many bugs. Okay to look at. And you have lots of time to look at things while your character is stuck in mid air after trying to jump up nearly anything in the game. Really lackluster launch title for the PS3. I was looking for something along the lines of 'Baldur's Gate', this doesn't stand up even to those standards."},{"rating":"1","title":"Needs patch work & updates","review":"This could'e been a really good game if it had some support from the publishers.

If you want the 2 players on a screen co-op from the PS2, you will find it and better graphics and monsters here. If you were addicted before, it will probably follow you here."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dark Kingdom","review":"This game is pretty decent, if you don't mind the old school graphics. The storyline in itself is interesting and you have to figure out things on your own in the game as well as fight while doing so. However, if you're looking for top notch graphics you're not going to get them in this game. But, if you're like me and grew up playing atari, then you won't mind the graphics.The storyline is kind of slow, but it's still interesting. You will see blood in this game, and you will have to fight a lot. You can't run from some battles in this game.Also, if you're a fan of the sixaxis controller, you're not going to be able to use it except for normal fighting. If you are wanting games where you can use the sixaxis controller for all it has to offer, then I suggest Heavenly Sword, Lair, or Harry Potter. I'm sure there are other games that will allow the use of the sixaxis, but I haven't purchased many games."},{"rating":"1","title":"A launch title that fails again","review":"This game is no fun, not even remotely. I tried to get into it, but its just not that great. The camera freaks out when you get close to a tree, because its always on auto-focus.

I haven't had one since I plugged the power supply and monitor into the Tripp Lite. Previously i was using a regular power strip. The Tripp Lite has an electric conditioning feature that evens out power sags as well as surges.

I also considered 17\\" NEC 1740CX that looks even crisper because smaller pixel pitch and more appropriate resolution for the screen size, but 19\\" is good choice if looked at from normal distance of some 1.5-2 feet away (or even more).In my opinion this monitor is a great choice, unless you have money to burn and can afford top of the line models (with finer pixel pitch, better response time and higher resolution) but which cost hundreds of dollars more."},{"rating":"2","title":"be prepared...","review":"Let me warn you upfront; you will not like all the songs on this album, no matter how die-hard a fan you may be. It is a plethora of musical curve balls, that is unsettling, confusing, amusing, and addicting. It may also be one of their most important albums, in the sense that they try so many different things instead of sticking to a safe, poppy formula, it set a precedent for them to continue to experiment in their later works. I like the fact that one gets the sense that they do not care what you think of the contents of the album; you get what they give you, and they continuously play with your mind throughout. The record scratch at the end is no less alarming when one listen's to it on CD. You will hear something that you did not before every time you listen to it, and you may never forget 'All Day Long'."},{"rating":"2","title":"Still Kick Ass","review":"Yeah, you saw right.

I'll agree with the dude who said \\"Paradise\\" was the greatest song on this record- it's dark, kind of creepy, and, well, you'd know if you heard it. I'm freaking obsessed with this song. It's really sad that the 80's get overlooked in modern times (unless it's become an adult contempoary hit; think Sting). You can really hear their influence on anything from Motion City Soundtrack to No Doubt to The Killers (who have totaly ripped off New Order- right down to their name, stolen from the music video for \\"Crystal.\\" Don't get me wrong- I like them a lot), and tons of other music, especially dance.

I was determined to see the story through. Unfortunately, the end did not bring the story to a satisfactory end. There were too many story lines left hanging that didn't seem to add to the story.I was also disappointed in the main character.

In addition, I \\"read\\" this book as an abridged CD, which, I'm sure, made things worse. I kept back-trakcing to try to figure out, \\"Wait, how did we get here again? How did he come to this realization? Why are they doing that?\\" Most of the time I didn't get any more clarity from a second time around.

I purchased \\"The Third Translation\\" after reading TWCITW and had high expectations. \\"The Third Translation\\" moved so slowly and seemingly without purpose that I gave up.

I wondered, why is the author going into such trivial details as to how the fish tasted and the bowel movements after that. After page 70, I put it down, but opted to give it another shot. After page 100, I put it down again, but thought, \\"maybe I need to get past the first couple parts.\\" I am on page 114, and wondering still where the story is going, and this is the time I decided to write this review.Chances of me ever picking it up will be nil.

I anticipated the arrival of this book and expected to be engrossed in an Egyptian quest adventure. Au contraire...I never did totally understand why the third translation was important or what it meant. Way too much time and way too many words were spent on directions and locations within the city of London and elsewhere. Not to mention the time spent on the \\"hero's\\" boring background. The primary character was about as boring and lackluster as they come and his relationships basically made no sense. The quest made no sense and engendered no interest whatsoever. I think the author is a capable writer and I am sad to be so negative. But he needs to develop more interesting and gripping style and plot devices.

It was that bad, i couldn't even resort to my usual technique of using the audio copy and listening to the book while i drive around, its just that bad of a book. The writing is jumpy and quite honestly tries much too hard.I'm aware that Mr. Bondurant was trying to write a parody/commentary novel about noir novels of the time, but he failed miserably. The main character is incredibly unlikable, and I'm not even sure where he fit into the plot of the book. I tried, i really really tried to read finish this book, but it the end it was a lost cause and my brain couldn't take it any more.

I could not finish this book fast enough so I could put it away and never have to think about it again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ditto C Springs","review":"I am seldom moved to comment on a book as my taste is eclectic and seldom mainstream. I prefer my books well-written, but in the case of Bondurant's effort, I was suckered by the jacket blurbs. Perhaps some quid pro quo was at issue here - I have my suspicions about the ethics of the publishing world - but, good grief, am I meant to take this seriously? I confess that after the mad hash-inspired dash through the backs of Cambridge into the presumably \\"sausage shaped fingers\\" (does Bondurant know of any other kind?)of American pro wrestlers (I kid you not), I pitched the book across the room, so I will never know if our hero managed to win the day, the girl, the Stela - but who cares?

The characters are caricatures rather than truly fleshed out and I found myself wanting to slap the main character about the head until he came to some sense. Rather than advance the plot there is too much focus on the rather disgusting toileting habits of the main character's flatmates. I wanted Egyptology with secrecy and suspense, instead I got lurid accounts of London's nightlife with cartoonish characters and actions. I couldn't even finish the book. Pass on this one!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The Third Translation","review":"Granted I didn't make it past page 50, but this is a stinker. The writing is awful - repetitive and trite.

However this book was truely dreadful and I think prospective purchasers should hear my comments before spending their money. I found the book tedious, self-centered and focused more on an adolescent romp through the drug and alcohol fueled night life of London. Unfortunately I was hoping for something closer to a \\"Rule of Four\\" intellectual puzzler.Not a mystery, not a suspense, not even a reasonable ending. Buyer beware."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shallow","review":"Don't trust what you read on the dust cover. This book isn't very good. The author, I'm sure, has a real interest in Egyptian history, and the history of heiroglyphic translation, but that doesn't make for a good story. The characters aren't engaging, the plot plods, and the lame ending wraps up the story line in a few cheesy pages.This is not a \\"deep\\" book. The discussion of translation is superficial and repetetive, and other areas of study, such as physics and relativity, are mentioned only in passing. There is no real detail here. We never go beyond the simplest disussion of translation, and I finished the book knowing very little about heiroglyphics. It gives the novel a \\"Cliff's Notes\\" feeling - we're just skimming the top of a more profound body of knowledge."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Third Translation","review":"AWFUL! Don't waste your time or money. Disjointed thoroughout and never comes to a conclusion. Characters are balmy and dirty--it reads like a Keystone Cops movie. I was so disappointed because the write-ups were great--but very misleading."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lacking in Development on all Fronts","review":"One cannot say that the author lacks in writing skills. He has all the basics there for plot development, character development, and timing. Unfortunately, he never moves beyond the basics. His hodgepodge of characters are interesting as abstracts, but are never fleshed out. In fact, some of them (like Oldcastle) are downright unbelievable. His main character's personal history of childhood, marriage, and divorce are superfluous to the plot and can easily be skipped over because they don't add depth to the story's main line. Then, to top it all off, the story's conclusion is wholly unsatisfying. Mick's word \\"bollocks\\" while he hovers near death in the hospital pretty much sums up the whole point of this look at the Stela Paser. Again, there's no question the writer has the potential to put together a basic story, but he shows no real talent at or proclivity to flesh it out in a way that would satisfy a reader."},{"rating":"1","title":"Missed Opportunity","review":"This is a very disagreeable book, which is a shame since the notion of an acrostic in hieroglyphics is intriguing and deserves better treatment.

This book is only useful as a cure for anglophilia!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Forget about it!","review":"I had read about half the book and just couldn't take it any more. Some novels have story lines that are just so tedious and aggravating. After losing interest, I recently decided to pick it up again and try to finish it.

I ended up skimming the final couple of chapters."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'll look forward to Bondurant's next work.","review":"As an Egyptophile, I looked forward to reading Matt Bondurant's novel after seeing a positive review of it in the Washington Post. And indeed, the premise sounds promising: a down and out translator working in the British museum attempting to translate a mysterious stele. There is no doubt that Bondurant's writing shows promise, I found some of his passages frankly stunningly beautiful. These are in contrast to some of his scatological details about his protagonist's flatmate that became tedious. But it is the plot that needs some work and lacks umph. Nevertheless, I will look forward to Bondurant's next work because of his skill as a writer."},{"rating":"1","title":"A book that goes nowhere.","review":"Abyssmal. It is missing all the qualities of both literary fiction and pop fiction. The main character does nothing, the stories go no place. There is no conclusion, no real plot, the characters aren't even remotly human. Most are nearly cartoons. The most human in the whole thing are the two female grad students whose main activity seems to be making bad coffee. The egyptology parts are pointless. The main excitement is a row-boat chase scene. There was such potential here, particularly with their secret society, which disappeared after a single moment in time.This book gives hope to all authors; if someone will publish this, pretty much anything else has a chance."},{"rating":"1","title":"Simply a bad book","review":"I really wanted to enjoy this book based one the subject matter, but the book is poorly written.

If you want to read a beautifully written character study of a truly pathetic individual, knock yourself out.

The book is loosley held together, and quickly becomes a muddied mess. I completed it only out of a sense of obligation to the money I'd spent. Bondurant has potential, but he needs to develop his main ideas more effectively."},{"rating":"1","title":"I wish I could give it \\"0\\" stars.","review":"I am kicking myself for being suckered into reading this book by all of its comparisons to \\"The Da Vinci Code.\\" It was painful, but the only thing that made me finish it was the fact that I wasted perfectly good money on the thing. Egyptology, history and mystery (the three foremost things touted by the advances for this book) take a far second seat to the drab \\"hero\\" who we are apparently suppsed to pity because he consciously makes poor choices throughout his life. Finally, I have never seen a book--even one that clearly contemplated a sequel--leave so many loose ends flapping about. Honestly, there was no sense of story closure at the end and that only compounded the frustration I felt from reading the thing in the first place."},{"rating":"1","title":"weak novel","review":"I wish I had read Colorado Spring reader's review before purchasing this book. I have to agree 100% with the review. Weak writing, weak plotting and boring.The repetitions on pages 3 and 14 - I really couldn't believe it as I was reading it."},{"rating":"2","title":"wicked genius anti-thriller","review":"What a pie in the face to the thriller crowd. If you think DVC or Ladies Detective Agency are a good read, stay away from this. Some reviewers here don't get it (though the real critics do, if that means anything to you). No handsome, witty narrator, no absurd plotlines (those same ideas are ridiculed in fact), no fairy tale romance. Gritty comedy and slapstick with big ideas in the vein of Pynchon. The writing is serious and real, and the emotional content hit me like a brick. A fantastic first novel and I look forward to the next."},{"rating":"1","title":"HORRIBLE","review":"Nothing left to say. Horrible. NEVER develops. Wanders aimlessly into topics that add nothing to the story. No clue what the plot was. After being tempted 2 or 3 times to just give up, I finally did. Worst book I have read in years....I guess there was something left to say..."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a waste of time!!","review":"I too was excited to read this book, but it was a giant disappointment. It is nothing like the Da Vinci Code! In the end, nothing ever really gets solved and you really don't care by then - in fact you are just very happy that it is over."},{"rating":"1","title":"What was that?","review":"This has to be worse work of fiction I have ever read, I picked it up from a bookstore shelf after reading back cover, I wish I had read reviews before wasting my 25 dollars. There is no story line, it seems more like a rumblings of a drunken person who keeps drifting between reality and ancient Egypt."},{"rating":"1","title":"Couldn't Hold My Attention","review":"It is quite rare for me not to finish a book once I begin reading it. However, this book just couldn't hold my attention. I am a history major, and I taught history, but I couldn't get past all the historical ramblings and the blah, blah, blah about ancient Egypt. I didn't, or couldn't, relate to any of the characters and the situations they found themselves. Definitely not worth reading.Finally, I agree with other reviewers who say they were disappointed with the \\"advertising\\" on the book jacket. This book does not belong in the same league as DaVinci Code or any other thriller of that genre."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst book I have ever read","review":"This book is from cover to cover awful. I am actually ashamed to admit that I finished this book, I just kept thinking 'It has to get better and have a great ending, has too.' But no I was wrong, the ending as with the whole book is horrible. This book has a plot (and I use that term very losely) that jumps all over the place and in the end makes no sense. There are references to Egyptian history and mythology scattered throughout the book that add nothing to the story and only serve to confuse the reader. This book leaves so many threads at the end of novel that it seems imcomplete. The characters are poorly described and you feel no connection to them, and hence do not care what happens at the end of them. I realize this was the author's first novel and frankly it should be his only work."},{"rating":"1","title":"The worst book I ever read.","review":"This is my first review. Usually, if I don't like a book, I'll just keep it to myself. However, this book is so awful I had to let other people know.

Unfortunately that's an hour and a half that I'll never get back !Thankfully I didn't waste my money.....Thank God for libraries !!!!

I found it very hard to follow even the flow of his \\"conversations\\" between characters.Please do not waste your time or your money on this one !"},{"rating":"1","title":"Third Translation not worth it.","review":"I \\"read\\" this book on CD while driving. The premise (egyptologist trying to \\"solve\\" meaning of ancient artifact gets caught up in international intrigue) is interesting, but the plot development and writing are terrible! Very amateurish writing. All the characters' words and actions are chaotic and inexplicable. The story lurches from scene to scene with no sensible order. Let's put it this way, the author want's us to believe the plot, situations, and characters are plausible, yet none of them are. No one would respond to the events in this story the way the protagonist and other characters do. While there are a few \\"moments\\" of the story that are interesting in themselves, the story as a whole is extremely flawed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Literate, Not Fun","review":"This book disappoints again and again. One after another the reader's expectations are set and then abandoned. To the extent that characters are developed they prove annoyingly unsympathetic. And what is most irritating, the promised intellectual puzzle is left unresolved. One wonders who the author's intended audience really is. Mystery lovers will be put off by the lack of plot resolution. Readers looking for good literature will be disappointed by the incoherence and poor editing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shame on the publisher and editor","review":"I don't blame the author, Matt Bondurant, entirely for this pathetic attempt at writing fiction; I blame the publisher and editor, if one did indeed exist. This publisher was in such a hurry to capitalize on a popular genre it forgot to help mold the author with such guidance as- insure that the protagonist is interesting if not sympathetic, make sure that the plot is well developed and not loose, and make sure the conclusion satisfies the reader's need to feel completed. None of this was done, and the reader is left baffled and confused. Bondurant took a great idea, and he did nothing with it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Only one word for this book--PAINFUL","review":"I picked this up at a local bookstore, intrigued by the concept, inside flap and author background. However, when you find yourself skipping chapters just to see if something interesting actually happens, you know you're in the midst of a painfully slow and boring book. The prose is long-winded, overly forced and for the most part has no content. Leave the popular fiction and historically-based thriller genre to those can write a decent sentence and have a clue as to what \\"thriller\\" means."},{"rating":"1","title":"Seriously weird","review":"Very disappointing; nothing whatsoever what I was expecting...WHY was it linked as a Da Vinci type. Protagonist Walter not well developed and frankly by half-way thru the book I really didn't care what happened to him. At least in the last chapter the author sort of tied together the plot. And, is it really likely that a middle-aged Egyptologist, an ivory tower type, would just keep on going after his awful face injury, spit lip, broken glasses, blood-soaked clothes..???? Any normal person would go to the hospital and then the optometrist. And where in the story does Zenobia belong??? Don't buy it; if you want to read it check it out at the library."},{"rating":"1","title":"A WASTE OF TIME AND MONEY","review":"If you've ever wondered what type of book could be produced by a brilliant mind on acid this book is for you.The plot is a total mottled mess and has an ending that leaves the reader scratching his head wondering what the author was trying to accomplish. If Mr. Bondurant has intended to produce a story that will capture the reader's interest it's a flop and if his intention is to develope interesting character studies he's a total failure. I felt no more compassion or amity with the story characters at the end of the book than I did at the beginning. Mr. Bondurant obviously has a brilliant mind but it is wasted on this effort. Like an intellect on acid, if he talks long enough some pearls of wisdom will eventually spring forth. Mr. Bondurant talks for 377 pages and the few pearls of wisdom that fall on to the pages are not worth the gibberish that has to be endured to find them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Judge This Book By It's Cover - The Cover is Wonderful","review":"Normally, I only write a review when I don't like the book to try to warn other readers before they waste their moneyWhen I first I ordered this book I had not seen it. When I first got the book the cover was visually stunning. Absolutely wonderful. Too bad the same cannot be said of the content of the book. The main charactor is pathetic at best. the dialog is something only a padantic drone would like. The story jumps from scene to sceen with no logical progression. The characters are two dimensional. The main characters are so lifeless I couldn'r care less whether or not they suceeded or not (or even survived). When the book finally ended, there was \\"no end\\", no resolution to \\"The Third Translation\\" or if there even was a \\"The Third Translation\\".

In the 1st story Blade and friends travel into the San Diego \\"Dead Zone\\" a ground zero bomb crater from the 3rd world war. As the story progresses sadistic carnage and sly wittisims accompany a easily read storyline. Not overly complex but fun none the less. In the second story a madman is set out to destroy the alaskan pipeline and, you guessed it, Blade is there to stop him. Snowmobiles, Automatic weapons and the spilt contents of human dominate this slaughter on ice. Another murderous rampage a la Blade.

However, this series is back on track with The King Betrayed. Dain is always an enjoyable character, but I find Alexeika to be in many ways even more fascinating. Here is a heroine who is extraordinarily human, so strong that she is unable to be weak or to accept weakness in others. She insists on seeing Dain in a heroic light, and cannot accept him as being flawed. I find her always to be just about unlikable, and yet I do end up liking her. Like so many of us,her greatest strength is her greatest weakness. She is an original, so well created that she seems very real to me.For me, the strongest aspect of this series are the well-drawn characters and their affect on each other. Once again, I am excited by this series and am awaiting the next book impatiently."},{"rating":"1","title":"Smartdigital USB Repeater not 2.0","review":"I just bought two of these. They do work but the throughput is slow. USB 2.0 is supposed to allow for up to 480 Mbs, while USB 1.1 allows for between 1.5 Mbs to 12 Mbs. These cables clearly state on the back of the package that they support 1.5 Mbs to 12 Mbs max. Thus they don't perform as 2.0. What this means is whatever you have hitched through this thing will be slowed down; example, I tried to put my webcamera on it (which does 24 Mbs) and my movements are slowed down noticeably.If you look at the cable connector box, they have stuck on a little sticker that says \\"USB 2.0\\" in red. The sticker tries to make it look like that was printed on the connector along with the rest of the labeling. Basically, everything points to this being mislabeled, previous generation product.

We kept it as a ball pit throughout the cold months and in the summer time we used it as a pool. The only downside to using it as a pool is that the bottom is a thin sheet of plastic and so you will have to place it in the grass for comfort, as a concrete driveway would be too hard underneath your little one's bottom.The only other downside is that the one I received in the mail was a different pattern than the one advertised. I'm sure all of the patterns are appropriate for a girl, but I questioned whether or not the pattern that I received was appropriate for a boy. It was so close to his birthday party that I didn't bother to return or exchange it.We like this little pool. It doesn't loose air quickly either. I've only filled it with air once and 5 months later, it's still doing fine.

Eventually, I was able to hear the songs on \\"Dear Sir\\" and it was exactly what I was attracted to in the first place. The music has more sparse, heavier distorted guitar work, slightly reminscent of early Sonic Youth. The resulting music is like hearing a ghost wail over the grindings of machinery.If you've heard of Cat Power vicariously from interviews of other artists or other plugs in print, I highly recommend this album to be your first excursion."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of Burts Best,.......I wish he'd made a sequel","review":"One of Burt's Best, I wish He'd made a sequel.This movie is equal to his great Movie called Deliverence, Malone is wonderful to add to my collection"},{"rating":"1","title":"Malone","review":"Do not buy this product.

And the sometimes musicians have to move on to other things. I understand. I do, however, miss their trombone player a great deal, as he had a style and intensity unlike many others. Some tracks just scream for one of \\"showtime\\"'s raging, strident slide rides. It's a shame. The album, however, wicked. MMMUCH better than their last effort: \\"Evolution\\". No doubt many will give it 5 stars, yet, when it comes to MY OWN enjoyability of the album, I give it 4 due to large void throughout the album in which trombone should be giving bottom and cajones to the horns."},{"rating":"2","title":"so lost and mesmerizing","review":"for about four or five years after this record came out, it was in my DJ bag almost every time. Nine years later, I'm still turning people onto it, and they still come up and ask what is this beautiful darkness. Some tracks are just stunning monolithic noise (an excellent homeopathic remedy for a crushing headache), while others are graceful wistful songs. No disrespect to the bass player, but I kind of wish he had never joined the band, or at least generally taken a more minimal role; after this record they generally fell into structures built on his slow arpeggios, and something was lost. Here it's just a duo, and it is absolutely perfect chemistry. Listen in Depth will always be a masterpiece, and C of People will always take me away. Do yourself a huge favor and get to know this record.

But why isn't it? i can't put my finger on it. Maybe it's the way the instruments sound? the way they create their own melodies from a single drone. I can't figure it out. All i know is, the song \\"Disremember\\" is one of the most original pieces of music on the planet. 8 years after it's release this record still sounds fresh.

However, if you liked Pee-Wee Herman the first collection under Playhouse#1 is excellent. It was fresh and innovative. My 3 year old loves the first 6 discs.

It is a shame that shows these days all look dark, gritty, and borderline evil and that's just the setting. You will notice first thing that the picture looks \\"brighter\\" and more \\"clear\\" despite being made in the 70's. Space Academy was also made then and has been copied by modern day shows as well. They clearly displayed a more \\"California\\" feel to this show. It was not all about violence although there was some. This was more about the lighter side of police work. Everything looks \\"warmer\\" and \\"sunnier\\", including the people, an overall attitude that just seems to be long gone.

I love Season 1, but the plots and music in Season 2 are even better. Ponch was just a novice in Season 1, but his character has matured a lot by Season 2. The supporting characters are also stronger this season. Finally, I really enjoy the many important messages embedded in this series, particularly those aimed at kids and youth (e.g. Family Crisis, Disaster Squad, Neighborhood Watch, High Explosive, and CHP BMX). This makes CHiPs a great family show while also appealing to audiences who love motorcycles, California, or who simply want to re-live the late 1970s."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic!!!","review":"CHiPs was my favorite show when I was a kid (loved Jon and Ponch!!!). My siblings and I would be mesmerized for an hour. I continued to watch it on cable when it was on. I was so thrilled to finally see it on DVD. I bought both seasons and am anxiously awaiting for the remaining seasons. I started watching the dvds as soon as they arrived with my 7 year old twins. They (and I) couldn't get enough. What a treat to watch this show with my children and not have to worry about violence, sex or profanity. Great clean family entertainment. Highly recommended. I am addicted all over again.

If you can't bang your head to this album, I don't know what you bang your head to. and trust me, i've read your listmania whoever-the-f-you-are and i know how fing metal you are. They break down well, and each song tends to get heavier as it progresses. As some have pointed out, the guitar work is not very technical.

Enjoying heavy music IS NOT a problem for me. But all of these bands have something that JfaC lacks: Finesse.This band writes songs that don't really seem to have any direction or focus; while it would take a million monkeys a million years to write the Gettysburg, it would take 4 monkeys a day to pound out one of these awful grindfests. Job for a Cowboy's biggest problem (that they've had since nearly the beginning) is that the vocalist doesn't shut up. Can't enjoy the guitar work--there IS some good stuff in there when the drums and vocalist quits--the guy's rehashed take on Cannibal Corpse has to find its way into nearly every beat. I realize that its the band's style, but you can take and leave styles, and I leave it.

Had I known this before purchasing this dvd I probably wouldn't have."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Buy This","review":"I bought this game for my 9 year old daughter. She has many of the other Barbie games. She loves this movie and loves to dance so I got this game for her birthday with much anticipation but when she put it on the computer she was greatly disappointed. The scenery moves with the character which caused her confusion. She became very frustrated and started crying because she couldn't do the game. I even tried to play the game for awhile and was very disappointed. Luckily I also gave her Barbie Diaries and that game was much better. Barbie 12 dancing princess would have so much fun if they would have just followed the same programming style as they did in Rapunzel, Princess and the Pauper and Swan Lake."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Barbie game yet","review":"I purchased this game for my 7-year old. We have every Barbie PC game ever created. Unlike the earlier games created by Vivendi, which had lush backgrounds, life-like characters, bright colors, and a storyline with some imagination, Twelve Dancing Princesses was apparently developed by a hack company called Blue Monkey Studios in order to save Mattel money. The game takes no thought, has no imagination in its renderings, and is just about the worst (and most incredibly boring) PC game I've ever seen (we probably own around 300 different games). If you feel compelled to buy this game, buy it used for a penny somewhere. Anything more is wasted money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Frustrating and froze my computer","review":"Not only are all the reviews correct, this game froze my very capable computer. I had to shut it down and eventually uninstall this game to avoid future freeze ups...scared me to death. (my computer is new and is for my work). My daughter (9) was also reduced to a fit of tears....I had to force her to get away from the game because of her frustration. I wish I had seen these reviews before Christmas. I am writing a letter to Mattel."},{"rating":"1","title":"don't bother","review":"My daughter received this along with the Barbie Princess and Pauper game for her fifth birthday. The other game she is able to do all by herself and completed the game all by herself. This one I tried playing with her and we both end up angry and frustrated with it. Since I have trouble with it, I can't imagine what the programmers were thinking when they thought this would be a good game for a small child. I would give it zero stars if I could."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not that bad...","review":"I've seen mixed reviews about Barbie and the 12 Dancing Princesses game. The bottom line is...yes, it does challenge the mind and my daughter has gotten frustrated with it but she enjoys playing it.

You have to get eight flowers to find a gem. My dad usually gets it. I especially like the little ones which are Lacy, Genessa, and Kathleen. They have a part that none of the others have.I like to play it over again. Derek, the boy that helps Barbie, doesn't do that much stuff. I especially like when you find the elixir, because you get to open a fun path of crystals.I love the fountain path best.Here is the computer I play the game on:Windows XP, 1.99Ghz processor, 384MB RAM"},{"rating":"2","title":"Granddaughtered loved it","review":"My 4 year old granddaughter wanted to get this from the library so that was an easy yes. Is the game challenging? Most certainly even for a 60 yr old grandma. Takes awhile to get the hang of using the arrows and space bar, but 4 and half hours later we saved the king. Even though grandma did most of the \\"work\\" , Chloe loved every minute of it. She understood the concepts of each part of the game even though using the arrows was a bit too much for her. At the end she was jumping up and down yelling \\"we did it\\" ! So I'll definitely will be purchasing this for her and until the time when she can work the mechanics of the keyboard herself, mommy and grandma will be helping her play , watching her smile and laugh while spending quality time with our little princess."},{"rating":"1","title":"A total waste of money","review":"I bought this game for my 4-year old daughter, who has become very adept at other age appropriate video games, and have seen her reduced to tears and hitting the computer in frustration. As others have pointed out, the Twyla flower catch game is extremely poorly designed, and I haven't been able to overcome this \\"task\\" in almost 2 hours of trying myself. I plan to throw this disc away rather than subject my daughter to the feelings of anger, frustration and disappointment that she's found with this game. I can't believe that the makers of Barbie, a former icon who's popularity is rapidly declining, would further damage their reputation and standing by putting out this mess."},{"rating":"1","title":"Huge Disappointment!","review":"When we purchased this game for our daughter, we had hoped that it would be similar in design to The Princess and the Pauper computer game. However, we were soon disappointed. The Princess and the Pauper requires mouse work and problem solving. This game does not use the mouse and requires that the child use the arrow keys on the keyboard to control the Barbie. It doesn't seem that the child has to think nearly as much with this game. Instructions are scant, and if the wrong direction is pressed, the whole view on the screen is changed and it is difficult for a child to get this corrected. Our 6 year old used her birthday money to purchase this game and was extremely frustrated and disappointed by it. She played it for about 10 minutes before giving up and going back to a mouse controlled game that she could actually enjoy. I would not recommend this game to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"too hard for a 6 year old, disappointing!","review":"This is the worst Barbie game we have seen. My six year old was very frustrated (and I was too after several attempts at helping her). She usually plays games similar to this on her own, but there was no part of this game she could play alone. The instructions are poor and the kitty catching the flower game is impossible and extremely frustrating! I wish I would have read the other reviews before purchasing this game. We are very disappointed and after several hours, I'm sure it will never be finished. I think my daughter has given up and is sorry that Santa would bring her such a hard game. Do not purchase this for a young Barbie fan, or you will be the one playing it and getting frustrated too!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not waste your money","review":"My daughter loves Barbie and was so excited to receive this game. It was very sad to see how quickly she became frustrated with it's poor,poor design. The movement is difficult to control, the games are sometimes impossible and the graphics orient themselves in such a strange way that it is almost impossible to complete the games without falling off of something and having to start over.Please save your money and do not buy this product. It isn't worth one dollar let alone the nearly thirty that they have set as a price."},{"rating":"1","title":"TOTAL JUNK! Kids are crying cuz they cannot complete the game","review":"O.K., we have many other Barbie games, and enjoy all of them (especially Prince & Pauper) with out grandchildren. This one is an exception, though. Poor (archaic) graphics, poor interface (cursor keys), poor action (cannot control movement).... and cannot complete the game. Trying to make a cat chase after flowers around a gazebo (with cursor & enter keys), only to lose the flowers as soon as you get one - is frustrating as hell.I'm a programmer, and tried it myself. Now I see why the kids are crying. How frustrating to play a game for hours/days, only to find out that it cannot be completed. Mattel/Activision should be ashamed.What is the recourse for customers that have paid for this game? Oh, yeah, I forgot. Once you open it, you cannot return it. No more Mattel or Activision games for us."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Buy This Game!!! Software Glitch with Twyla the Cat","review":"J.L. Topilow's review is correct! (see this person's review also in amazon.com below this review) When you get to where Twyla has to catch the flowers there is NO WAY to complete this part of the game. Myself and my husband tried to do this an hour and we gave up. My daughter also was in tears and frustrated. My husband and I are both computer software engineers and we are disgusted that we spent the money on this game and we can't believe this part was not tested before release to the public. Do not waste your money and buy this game. Up until this point where Twyla tries to catch the flowers, it was fine. There definitely is a problem in the Twlya/Flower section of the game."},{"rating":"1","title":"not worth the headache","review":"All of the reviews here are correct. We bought the game despite the reviews because my 5 year old loves all the Barbie games and can do them by herself. Well, 7 hours later, we have yet to solve the game. And that is with mom and dad trying to do it with her. You just continue to walk through the same areas over and over with no luck in finding the last princess. My daughter went to bed in tears. This was not worth the money, the time, the headache, or the tears. How can this Barbie game be so different from all the others. How can a 5 year old complete the game when a 35 year old can't?? If you are looking for a Barbie game the kids will enjoy look at the Rapuzel or Magic Pegasus. At least then the child will actually have fun."},{"rating":"1","title":"Extremly poor quality","review":"I bought this for my 7 year old daughter for Christmas.

Definitly not worth the money."},{"rating":"1","title":"poor design, poor service","review":"I bought this game for my daughters at Christmas and sent the company an email on Dec. 29. I have not received a reply a full month later. My daughters were both frustrated at the game and its \\"bugs\\" that Activision will not help me fix. At one point, if Genevieve fell off the crystal walkway, she would not stop falling from the sky! The only way to stop her was to back completely out of the game. I expected a patch to fix this error, but have not gotten a response. The Twyla game is a mess. After trying to help them through it, I gave up. For every flower Twyla catches, she loses it immediately. It is too frustrating for anyone at any age. I am inclined to never purchase a game from Activision again, and I hope you do not waste your money on this game."},{"rating":"2","title":"Replacing An Un-returned Copy","review":"I actually purchased this many years ago and I found it to be somewhat soothing....anyway...I allowed someone to borrow it and guess what....it was not returned so I was very happy to get it again!"},{"rating":"2","title":"What's not to love...","review":"Sweet sounds of music it is so beautiful and I like the transition from one song to the next.

Truly, why doesn't she do something different and write a romance story about a 35 year old woman with a 25 yr old man? At least that would be legal. I don't get it--considering Mrs. Palmer herself is no spring chicken. You'd think she could relate to the views of the \\"women of today\\" instead of the old time views of older men/younger women....and in this book, older man/jail bait.

I keep these discs in case I want to introduce someone to the sport, but I no longer use them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a good match for beginners","review":"If you are a beginning disc golfer, this set is not for you. The discs are too heavy! Golf discs, like any others, are weighed in grams. The Wham-O Frisbee brands are generally weigh more than 175 grams. This means they are hard to control, and for someone learning the game, they will not fly straight. Instead, they will \\"fade,\\" which means curve from right to left for a right handed thrower (left to right for a left handed thrower). While it is true that all discs generally fade, these could frustrate you. Instead, choose a set specifically designed for beginners from one of the major manufacturers specializing in disc golf, such as Innova or Discraft. The lighter weights, and the discs included, are designed to help a new disc golfer get better results."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I ordered.","review":"The frisbees work fine (not that i'd know otherwise since I'm a total beginner at frisbee golf) but these colors aren't what you'll get. This rating is for the seller: I ordered this product twice, on two separate occasions. My 3 favorite colors are in the picture. However, what I got were two packages with dark blue, yellow and white markered-up frisbees in packages that were re-sealed with clear packaging tape. Whomever used them and re-sealed them didn't even bother trying to fool you. Insulting, really. I wound up going to a sports store locally and buying discs that were much better looking. It's too bad. I would have been 100% satisfied if they gave me what's in the picture. If you can't trust you're getting what the picture shows, there's no reason to buy (anything) from the internet, especially when you wait for the time that it takes for the free shipping."},{"rating":"2","title":"Kitchen Counter Glad Trash Bags from Amazon","review":"My Wife is a cooking enthusiast.

The index takes me to exactly the right text where the author, seemingly telepathically, refers me to two chapters I should read first to get a full understanding of the information. This book not only has all the information I need, the information is structured so well that it makes an ideal at-hand reference as well as a progressive course if you want, and have the time, to read it straight through. And, the information is layered in terms of complexity so you (I anyway) can find the section I need and read until the benefit of continuing is outweighed by the difficulty of continuing. Just right. I wish I could write like this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Newton would roll over in his grave","review":"I got three or four chapters into this text and had to stop.

There is no derivation of the equations, and although the authorsometimes mentions where he found them, no adequate referencesto the sources are made; worse still, there is no bibliography whatsoever.

If you took shop instead of algebra in high school, you may want to buy a different book. It explains how a bullet and barrel function, from internal to extrernal ballistics. You will get a lengthy explanation of the effects of greavity, angle, and wind on a bullet once it leaves the muzzle, and you will learn about why a barrel has grooves and lands and what effect the rate of twist has on a bullet. The average shooter will learn some useful stuff from this book and it is by far the easiest explanation of ballistics I have seen. Yeah, there is some math, but you can skip those parts and still gain a deeper appreciation for accurate shooting, especially for long distance hunting or target shooting. Bottom line: for me, well worth the price."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nothing else compares in this field","review":"I don't know of another comparable text for laymen to advanced laymen to read on ballistics. It is marred by two things. Lots and lots of typo's. Most you see what was supposed to be printed, but you wonder during some explanations if there are typo's you aren't aware of being there. There are a few other errors.The other is Rinker has a chip on his shoulder for large portions of the book. Don't get me wrong, the info, explanation and understanding conveyed to the reader are priceless. But the attitude is a detraction.

It is particularly bad for someone new to finance because you may not have the perspective to see all the faults in the definitions.

It is quite effective any time of day, as SOTL have obvious talent and this music serves as an excellent companion for bedtime or mid afternoons. As long as work is far far away and it's time for some relaxation or introspection.Considered an EP in some places, Gravitational Pull is a solid 51 minutes, and there's not a minute wasted.

Using censorship as his underlying agenda, Grossman uses poorly researched statistics in order to blanket the reader with simplistic conclusions about warfare, killing, and the psychology behind it. Not what I would call a thinking man's book. I found it rather insulting to my intelligence. Lacking a solid foundation of his OWN research, Grossman uses misquoted and often irrelevant information to purposefully paint a rather warped vision of how America reacts to media. Although Grossman raises a few interesting points, none are supported by facts, and they are primarily the brainchild of the author himself, who is rather lacking in credentials required by the subject."},{"rating":"2","title":"On Killing","review":"A great study in the cost of learning to kill in war and society.

As a combat veteran of Vietnam and a person who daily struggles with the affects of PTSD, I can vouch for the calamity that is the military in war. There are no 'Rambo' or 'Die Hard' type characters in the real world. If there were, their impulsive machismo would find them dead in a matter of hours. The conditioning I received in Marine Boot Camp at PI helped prepare me for the structure necessary in engaging the enemy and surviving.

Perhpas most alarming of all, however, is Grossman's argument that our children are learning many of these same techniques from television and video games.This is not a diatribe against the television and gaming industries. It is a commentary on how people learn to kill, how those who have killed cope, and what the consequences of killing is to individuals and to society. (Grossman's conclusions may surprise you.)The book has much to say on the costs of killing,and about human nature. In light of high school tragedies like Paducah, Springfield and Columbine, the book shed a little light on what we are doing to ourselves - both in the military and civilian world."},{"rating":"2","title":"A courageous and insightful look at a difficult topic.","review":"As a police psychologist who has worked with many police officers and military veterans, I have seen first hand the price that many of them paid when faced with having to use deadly force as part of their job. As a society, we often forget what we are asking soldiers and police officers to do to keep the rest of us safe. Grossman eloquently and compassionately forces us to take a closer look at their sacrifices and perhaps take more responsibility for enabling them to do our dirty work for us. I found Grossman's book to be an accurate reflection of the experiences with violence and killing of the veterans, cops, and crime victims I have worked with. We all owe Grossman a debt of thanks for opening up this difficult topic to closer scrutiny.

Most of the book was about killing in the context of warfare and only briefly discussed the use of arms by civilians, both civilian police and normal citizens. He seemed to think that the type of training police and military get makes killing a reflex is a good thing. Whereas for civilians, guns are bad, they are getting all their training from video games and will kill without authority. In other words, he thinks civilians are not responsible enough to have guns. Too bad I had to read most of the book to get to this part. I think Grossman could have spent at least a chapter or two on civilian use of firearms for self defense, but he barely touched on it.

I'm a twenty-five year peace officer and have been in many critical incidents. I re-read Lt. Col. G's book again after my second officer-involved shooting to ensure that the coping mechanisms I chose and the things I was feeling were resolved and compensated for in a healthy manner.

On the contrary, the author normalises the act of killing to the point of mundanity and does little delving into the psyches of killers. The writing is not particularly scholarly and the author peppers the text with some pretty banal assumptions.

For those who need to get soldiers to do their duty to kill the enemy, this is the theory behind the practice. For those who are responsible for raising children, or caring for young people, this is a study in the aspects of our society that break down the walls in the mind that tell a person that killing is wrong.

It is that he makes the logical jump from that bogus research that the reason for it is that man has some inherent quality that makes him reticent to kill other men. A cursory reading of history will show that this is not the case. Massacres are as common in history as they could be. It is a much more logical position that xenophobia is a natural human survival mechanism and that by seeing our enemies as \\"The other\\" we not only insure the survival of our genes but inoculate ourselves from the horror of war.I would suggest to any potential reader of Grossman's books that they look at some of the research that has proven his theories on violence and video games to be wrong before they take anything he writes seriously.

His description of that process is truly enough to make this an interesting book. He also explicates the terrible psychological price that combat veterans must pay for doing their duty. And he is correct in stating that we must take proper care of those who fight for our freedom. However, Grossman's final thesis, that we are \\"taking off the safety\\" on our youth by virtue of the ubiquitous violent content in movies and computer/video games should strike the most ominous note, especially in view of the string of school shootings that stained the history of 1998.

Both the fan and the heating element are SCR controlled so you will hear the fan speed up or slow down as needed. This allows the unit to always blow warm air whether the fan is running slow or fast.

Spent $97 for it at a local vendor who had a 15 day return policy. So out of the money and stuck without heat.Would never recommend this product to anyone. Very disappointed. Wrote to Vornado but will probably do nothing to remedy except tell me toreturn for repair or replacement. I think if this new one couldn't last for a mere 30 days, why bother. Will probably get another lemon! Notimpressed with the heater or Vornado's customer service. There was 8 people in front of me on the phone line!

Back to the store for a replacement only to come home and find that on the second Vornado the fan didn't work. Once again back to the store, but this time I asked that we try it before I headed home -- only to find the Vornado didn't turn on at all! Before I could say a word the salesperson recomended I give up and buy something else. What a waste of time and for a lot of money!"},{"rating":"1","title":"This heater is terrible compared to 2 Vornados I bought 5 yrs ago","review":"The written description of this heater led me to believe that it would perform like the 2 5-yr-old Vornado models that are the best electric heaters I've ever had. The VH2 has major flaws. It's single fan speed is way too fast, causing heated air to be cool/cold within 10 ft of the heater. The fan cannot be slowed down. The thermostat causes the fan to stop and start in ridiculously short intervals; thereby wasting energy I believe. Finally, the thermostat is set so that when at the highest (hottest) setting it doesn't allow the heater to bring even the immediate area around it to more than 70 degrees F.I've had the heater <1 mo and will attempt to return it for a full refund in another wk or 2 as soon as I have an alternative brand in my home."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"OVER\\" HEATER","review":"The VH2 I purchased almost burned down my house. The fan quit working but the heating element did not. After smelling something burning, I found the smoking heater, the heating element was red hot. The saftey devices failed to shut it down. Warrenty does not cover shipping, which is about $40.00. For that much money, I will buy a name brand heater that I can trust and who's maker stands behing the product. Vornado does not."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money!!","review":"This is the WORST heater ever. The first one worked for about two weeks, then one day it just stopped working. We exchanged it for a replacement and that one worked for about four weeks, then it started sparking, along with turning on for five seconds and then shutting off. I kept it in our baby's room and got worried because it didn't seem safe. When it did work, it heated up the baby's room pretty well, but I am sure there are other brands that work just as well and aren't so poorly constructed. I would suggest looking at another brand if you are in need of a room heater- that is what I am doing now."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a bargain at any price!","review":"Since I don't have the means to measure output wattage, I can't say if this unit ever actually turned out the warmth it claims to produce. What I do know is that after less than a year, it began overheating and the fan quit running altogether. It's not like it was abused, since the average daily use was less than four hours, and it wasn't turned on more than four days a week during the colder season. Storage over the summer was in plastic ziploc-type bag, so there wasn't dirt, dust, or rust to cause failure. It just died. I had always thought that Vornado was a pretty reliable name in small heating and cooling items. This has convinced me that even if Vornado USED to be great, maybe it is not so great any more. Not only would I not recommend this to a friend, I wouldn't even recommend it to a non-friend, fearing that it might burn down their house."},{"rating":"1","title":"Vornado VH2 Vortex Heater","review":"This product can hardly be called a heater. It was nothing as described in the ads. I contacted the manufacturer and they reported it should blow 120 degrees on high. I did not measure it in the winter when the room was 66 degrees, but when I measured the temp after contacting the manufacturer, it blew 91 and 92 degrees in a 75 degree room (I measured it with laser thermostat). Basically, I bought a lemon and the manufacturer did not stand behind the product. I would recommend that if a space heater is needed, skip this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"would not recommend to anyone","review":"provided little to no heat, and I live in Mississippi. it wouldn't even take the December chill off. definitly not worth the price. i returned the Vornado and purchased a much less expensive Holmes heater which produces three times the heat."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bought a second heater and had the same issue.","review":"We purchased one of these same units and it only lasted a year of light use.

This item failed completely (both fan and heater) after only three weeks. Returned to Amazon for refund.

Look to something else for your small area heater/fan needs."},{"rating":"1","title":"rip-off","review":"I justified spending $100 on this space heater because of the Vornado name. I had heard many good things. I won't make that mistake again. The first one I bought the fan died after just a few weeks. I had be pay S&H to send it back and get it fixed, only after going round and round with customer service. They said the fans just wear out (after a few weeks!?!) The fan lasted longer this time but failed again. I bought our other space heater (Holmes) for $15 (floor model) and figured that one wouldn't last. The Holmes heater is still running like a champ 9 years later. I only used the Vornado to suppliment our furnace so it wasn't overworked.

Nevertheless, it's a great value."},{"rating":"1","title":"Potential fire hazard!!","review":"After 6 months use the fan motor seized. I took off the front grill and lubed the shaft with light silicone oil. The fan motor worked for a few days, then the motor quit again.

It would heat a whole room, if the room is very small. IMO JUNK."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheap, unreliable, frustrating","review":"I love what Vernado talks about, but the execution FAILS.

I used it (not constantly, just for a half hour in the morning and a couple of hours at night) for three months or so, and it worked OK, even though the heat was not as much as I had hoped for. Then, one day I flipped the switch, the light on the button went on, and ...nothing. The fan had just stopped working.

Sometimes you feel 'some' heat and seems to work better on Auto rather than full High setting but that could just be me. For a $100 you definitely do better. Holmes had a similar model that used the heat the whole room design of 'low' but 'constant' heat and there no longer available last time I looked so I bought this one. Unfortunately it was a Xmas gift and past the 30 day return so I'm stuck with it. I guess I'll have to buy a $15 unit to supplement it on these single digit days."},{"rating":"1","title":"would not recommend","review":"had it for three days in my office and while it was \\"okay\\" at heating the motor quickly broke and started rattling loudly. what steams me is that Vornados cost 2X comparable products and so would expect higher quality control -- pay a premium and still have to return to get one that works? no way.

I live in Southern Cal so this heater is used on occasion in a covered patio during late Fall and winter months. The other day the on/off switch went limp and died, the heater won't turn on. This heater has probably been used less than 300 times in the few years we've had it. It was sufficient when it worked but on/off switches should be the last thing to die.

Problem is, it just doesn't work.Only thing that works is the on/off button that lights up but no air, no heat, no nothing. And if it is as fragile as other reviewers attest, we sure wouldn't want to depend on it on a frosty night. Company may be in trouble. We called the warranty number(got the automated weekend message on a Monday afternoon) and the customer service number on the box (got another operator message to call a 10-10 number which would cost $3.00).

Pulled it out by tugging off the cord, the plug on the heater was melted and my wall socket was blackened and melted.My friend returned it and got another in exchange, as we assumed maybe it had been plugged in loosely or something to cause an issue.The new one melted a heavy duty extension cable (the kind you use when you need something you can slam a door on or take outside big fat orange thing with huge plugs) plug end, and another grounded plug and outlet.Two heaters, Two outlets, one extension cable, and grounded plug down.

Within a few days of operating the second one, we again experienced the same jarring noises. One night I went into my daughter's room and almost passed out. Without adjusting the controls, suddenly the heating element went haywire and jacked up the temperature in her room to over 90 degrees.
