It is difficult to chop through the hard chocolate with a chefs knife. I find the job unpredictable and somewhat dangerous. This sturdy tool has resolved the issue.I am a home cook, not a professional and I rarely have chunks of chocolate that weigh more than a couple of pounds. This tool permits chipping of the chocolate for melting in a manageable manner. I consider this method far safer than using the chef's knife. The chocolate flies around less, and to help capture the bits that leave the cutting board, I put a large piece of wax paper, or parchment paper under the cutting board.The tool does not produce perfectly consistently sized pieces, like those bags of pre-made chocolate chunks for cookies, but for breaking down bulk chocolate to prepare for melting, this tool does its job."},{"rating":"2","title":"Inelegant, but sturdy","review":"Though the metalwork will never appear in a museum of modern art, this chipper is a solid, sturdy tool that works perfectly.

At the end the book disintegrates into a bitter denunciation of President Bush and others who support the use of force to combat Islamic terrorism, even comparing \\"An End to Evil: How to Win the War on Terror\\" by David Frum and Richard Perle to \\"Malleus Malleficarum,\\" a book credited with inspiring Medieval witch hunts that \\"remains one of the most malign texts ever produced.\\" While not coherent or objective enough to stand up as history, \\"Infidels\\" might have propaganda value to some on the left."},{"rating":"1","title":"Anti-Western, Anti-Christian","review":"After the first chapter, this book goes downhill quickly. All the atrocities are western and Christian, and all the misunderstandings are Muslim.Just to take one example of the poor information in this book, on page 135 the author claim that reports of cannibalism by the caribs was a \\"calumny, not very different from the accusations that Jews crucified children and drank their blood.\\" This is incorrect. While the amount of cannibalism may have been exaggerated (or it may not have), cannibalism among the carib is widely documented.

I would rather have seen the facts for myself and drawn my own conclusions. I read history for the history, not to have my thoughts politically corrected.

It had potential for sure, but didnt cut it in the end.

The bad guys from the 50's where not scary at all and quite frankly stupid and embarrassing to the decade. The entire flim made no sense and the title screen gives most of the end away. I hope musician les Claypool did NT write the 'lights in the sky'(title screen/ending credits song) for is horrible horror movie.

It is still an engaging book, particularly once past the initial set-up of character introduction, politics, etc. The pace rockets along once on the fire scene itself. The difference in the books may also be due to the different time settings of the two books. 1949 was the beginnings of organized fire control and fighting and a much simpler time. With the enormous increase in population and the complexity of agencies available to fight the fires, John had many more facts, bueracracies and personalities to deal with. Perhaps his style of newspaper reportage suits more contemporary times; facts and speed of delivery being most important."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book about Firefighters","review":"I have been Fighting Fires in California since 1981.

To spend so much energy on the inability of politicos to get along when a fire is truly fought on the ground... And the truly amazing players, the local fire officers and firefighters who stepped up to the plate after the firestorm (prior to the arrival of the overhead team)and saved homes and each other -well, John you missed it, you missed most uplifting part of the story.

Getting the hole story not just what the immediate family wants you to know should have been his job."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gripping account of a needless tragedy","review":"Maclean has done a superb job telling the story of the South Canyon Fire. I heartily recommend this book. My only quibble is that he could have done a better job on the maps and pictures of the scene. Having hiked the actual location, I think Maclean's maps are too minimal compared to the detailed, minute-by-minute maps available on the internet version of the official report. Sometimes it's a little hard to follow Maclean's account due to the dearth of maps, but don't let that discourage you from reading this fine book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't last more than 2 months!","review":"Would not recommend this light for the money.

I suspect the made in China switch is not up to par with the specs and just burned out the contacts. Brinkmann needs an RMA number to send it back but their customer service is automated where if no one is available, you input your tel number and they will call back in the order the call was received.

It is very dim (approx half power) even with a full charge and it goes completely flat fairly quickly (10-12mins).I gave up on brinkman and went with Streamlight Litebox and Streamlight Ultra-Stinger.

At times the author wants to predict the future: What does the future hold for fusion? At times the author answers a question other than the one asked: Why do monkeys have tails?

The first two episodes in season 9 are also rather good but in pretty much the rest of them I felt like the show's writers were trying to extract laughs from the audience as if it was liposuction or something. Perhaps the saddest thing was seeing how fragile Peter Boyle looked at the end but it was great for him to stay until the last episode, I can't imagine how sad it would have been for ELR to have to deal with Frank's passing.For me it's very simple: 70's: Taxi, 80's Cheers, 90's Raymond. 00's: no idea yet."},{"rating":"1","title":"Everybody Loves Raymond","review":"I was very impressed by how quickly the item was shipped.

So please Amazon, take note."},{"rating":"1","title":"Raw deal","review":"So if I understand correctly from the reviews on this page, MoD products cost about twice as much as a standard DVD, aren't always available, suffer from quality issues, may arrive with some discs missing and may not last as long as a regular DVD. Sounds like a great deal for consumers. My seven year old loved season one and has been asking me when season two will be available. I'm not sure what to tell her; I can't say I'm too excited about plunging into the world of manufacture on demand. Would it have really been that difficult for MGM to issue a reasonably priced standard season two? They certainly got season one right.

I was taking 2 pills of Policosanol a day and my total cholesterol went from 243 to 267. My HDL (good cholesterol) went down a smidge, but my LDL (bad cholesterol) shot up. I don't think the Policosanol had anything to do with the increase, but it sure didn't lower it at all. The only thing that went down was the balance in my bank account.

It's like a lame version of Bubblegum Crisis. The things I don't like about this anime are:1: The animation is bad. It's an older series, but the technology for way bTetter quality existed at the time.2: The story had a good initial idea, but was not carried out in an interesting manner.3: The characters. There were several characters with potential, but they weren't developed well enough to make you care about them.4: Bad voice acting. The characters didn't have any emotions visible in their speech.Adding all these flaws together I was very disappointed by this series. If you're still curious try watching it on youtube. Definitely don't buy w/o watching first. I'll give it 2 stars because there was some effort put into the story line. It was just executed very poorly."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good to those who know about the series","review":"Silent Mobius is on of those anime series which not follows completely the manga version. I already have most of the volumes of the manga and is not like the anime series.But I saw the series first so it will be not problem to those who do the same thing.

There is a large lack of action in most of the episodes and some corny love stories that no one will enjoy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great read","review":"If you are interested in European history, this is an insightful easy read with loads of interesting information. I happened upon this book as I am researching my family history. Although the book mainly highlights the wars between Prussia, France, Austria and the ever changing national borders, and conquering armies, it gave me a great perspective of what life would have been like for those in the army or the peasants, and why there was mass immigration from Germany to the New World."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not for Travel on Airlines","review":"This is a nice flask and the cups are a nice touch.

However, it was not what I had thought. It does talk about strategies that work but does not go into detail how to implement these strategies and put them to use.

I had mine set up in about ten minutes. As for the draw-backs, the cabinet I got had some rough edges where the plastic was molded. It made one door difficult to open and close. It was a minor inconvenince, becasue after a little modification, I got it working just fine. The cabinet will accomodate a lock, but if you have valuable things you want secure, forget it. It would take someone about seven seconds to break into this thing. If you have little ones running around like me that you don't want in it, the cabinet will work great. You will probably have to pick up a specialty lock for it as well. The holes where they go won't accomodate what I consider a standard lock. I had to buy a \\"flexible\\" lock to make it work. Lastly, you don't have shelf adjustabilty. What you see in the picture is pretty much what you'll get. Overall, it's a decent product and it will suit me fine."},{"rating":"2","title":"So far so good...","review":"Just received this from UPS today and it looks great.

The back of the jacket has praise from people nobody's ever heard of, or certainly I haven't. Worse there is a picture of the author on the rear flap. Very smug, it seems to shout at the reader \\"Gotcha to pay money for this, didn't I?\\" The book is a mess, transitions absent, characters self-pitying, scenes wailing.

If you are looking at this book and considering purchasing it, save yourself from disappointment: buy a good book on yoga, read it and follow the advice.

For example, the \\"Heart of the Rose\\" exercise is meditation. There, simple and precise; no need to get a rose and stare at it, learn about meditation instead, not some mystical, over-specific prescription.Other concepts, like kaizen, were interesting, but didn't talk enough about the philosophy of the idea.All in all, the concepts expressed in the book seem to all come from some non-existant religious sect, rather than from the author's life. I know that the ideas are expressed in a story to make them more easily absorbed, but the effect seems to obscure the real potential of some of the concepts in the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Superficial","review":"The book is a mish-mash of meditation techniques (like \\"mindfullness\\"), cogitive self-help (\\"think positive thoughts\\"), time managment (make a list of things you have to do), and common sense (exercise and diet). Mostly a waste of time, though a few little aphorisms did stick in my mind. For example: most people on theoir death beds do not say \\"I wish I had spent more time at the office.\\" If you are interested in any of these self help techniques you would do better to buy a book specifically on that method.

Throughout the entire book I kept laughing to myself, shaking my head and thinking, \\"of course this guy found inner-peace, I would too if I had a few million dollars in the bank back home and went on a extended holiday to India.\\" Nice try Robin S.

What is this if not a childish construct of paradise?Its one of those instant things. Like instant coffee. It might perk up someone after a reading for a day or two. But it is no profound pool of wisdom. It dosen't come from an internal awakening that happened to an author.

You end up throwing up ... thats what this book is ... its a painful regurgitation.Im amazed he found a publisher!I suggest you steer clear of this book if you dont want to be sick ...

I'll admit that hearing this song repeatedly over the airwaves during this time period quickly became an annoyance, but with time, I got over it. Nelly is again tolerable, not preferred, but tolerable.That's more or less all I have to say for this review. Chingy's single \\"Right Thurr\\" is a blatant rehash of Nelly's \\"Hot in Herre\\" single, no matter which way you slice it. Same \\"catchy\\" southern slang accent, same lyrical subject matter, same beat construction. The only real difference lies in the vocal delivery and lyrical style, and sadly to say; Chingy loses to Nelly on both of these fronts.

Colombia alone boasts over a hundred species. This book documents the species found in Colombia, showing stunning pictures of each, flying along side the plants they normally feed on. These photographs represent years of work, including pictures of a hummingbird species thought lost to science, until Mazariegos re-discovered and photographed individuals in a small population in a remote valley in southern Colombia. The quality of the photography is extraordinary, particularly when one considers the extreme conditions the author was under when he photographed many of the birds.

These are written under notoriously tight deadlines and are usually an inferior experience to just reading the script online.The inital draft of the First Contact screenplay contained large sections that didn't make the final cut. Although some of the first draft was wildly incompatible with the final screenplay, much of it just required reshuffling the sequence of events. Picard originally had a whole subplot to himself, involving some romance with an original female character while also trying to conceal the wounded Cochrane from a military thug.Trek novelizations are always about 120 pages of material stretched to fit the required hardcover page count, so all these unused pages of script should have been a godsend, but someone (probably not the author) decided to limit the book to what wsa onscreen and nothing more. This book is no more than a padded version of the final script."},{"rating":"2","title":"Read It!!!","review":"Great books brings all the action, plus some, of the movie into your imagination. I like the book because their they explain how each character is feeling and especially Picard. This book is great. If you liked the movie you'll love the book cause they explain in more detail what everyone is feeling and what's going through their minds at the time that what ever situation arises. Especially that part where the Borg queen proposes an encounter of a different kind to Data, and in the book they mention the fact that he thought about Tasha and in the movie you just can't see that. I really did like this book and I also have the audio book which is pretty cool too.Gates McFadden is a good narrator, you all have to read the book and hear the book if you can.

The album, although promo'd on the sleeve of the single, was dropped and focus was put on the Madison Square Garden concert album. I really think this CD would have made more sense if it would have been marketed as a \\"lost\\" album, something even the liner notes don't even make mention of. It is really sort of a companion piece to THAT'S THE WAY IT WAS. In this context, the album makes PERFECT sense! The CD has four extra tracks not part of the original lineup.

As explained in the liner notes to this CD, RCA has opted not to rerelease that album, the movie songs are gone, but instead has put out what it thinks might have been the proper \\"Burning Love\\" album from 1972. What we get are performances from 1971/72: live cuts and studio tracks.

Not only same sentences are repeated several times throughout the book, even entire paragraphs. And it is not an edition mistake. Mr. Lewis uses cliches, and then explains the cliches. All that is said in 200 pages can be said in 10. Mr Lewis source appears to be the Fearless Flyer, which by the way it's 300 times better. Don't waste your time nor your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poorly Written Book on an Interesting Subject","review":"Being that I enjoy Trader Joe's and the unique concepts behind it that have made it so successful, I was excited to read this book. Unfortunately, I only made it about 100 pages into this book and then I had to just put it down. I was getting so sick of the same repetitive statements and sentences and kept waiting for the real information and \\"meat\\" to turn up. But it never did...only simple statements, with not much to back them up. It was like reading the back cover of the book over and over and over and over. Not worth your time, money, or energy. Go to a Trader Joe's in person and you'll gain far more info than you will reading this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"An exercise in hyperbole and repitition","review":"Len Lewis took on an exciting task by attempting to write about Trader Joe's, one of my favorite stores. However, probably due to his lack of material, the book has little substance. Lewis' writing is full of hyperbole, which doesn't belong in an inside look at a business. In addition, as other reviewers have stated, the same few facts are repeated over and over again. I appreciate the effort here, as those few facts happen to be interesting, but I'm not sure why the same material wasn't released as a single chapter in some other book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shopping at Trader Joe's and guessing is not research","review":"Luckily I borrowed this from the library and didn't buy it. Basically, the author is an expert on grocery stores, so he comments on how Trader Joe's is different and makes a lot of assumptions about how happy everyone that works there is. I think the quality of the book would have been doubled if he managed to score an interview with a former hourly employee. You will learn nothing about Trader Joe's from this book that you couldn't guess yourself by shopping there."},{"rating":"1","title":"Painful to read.","review":"I found the book tiring and at times painful to read. Each successive page felt like it had at least one section that I'd read somewhere in the preceding pages.

These stores, simply, are the only general gourmet stores around! Lewis keeps comparing Trader Joe's to supermarkets, when he should be comparing them to other gourmet stores. Basically, there are very few gourmet food stores around; almost all I've been in are much smaller and much more limited than Trader Joe's. That's why TJ's has been so successful! It's practically one-stop shopping for gourmets and gourmands!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautifully written practices for living a fully engaged life","review":"I have been inspired by Thich Naht Hanh's books for many years and while they are all priceless, I like to read this one and Peace is Every Step at night with my family (including my middle school and high school aged children).

The description tells you to check the label for the actual ingredients but doesn't tell you what the ingredients are so you have to buy it, get cheated and then you find out it is mostly fructose with a bad, chicory-like taste. Here is the list of ingredients in order on my bottle: fructose; lo han fruit; fructooligosaccharide (FOS) from chicory. Perhaps if you like the taste of chicory in your coffee, you will find this stuff somewhat acceptable but fructose is cheaper and probably tastes better. I tasted it so I guess I can't send it back but I am throwing it in the trash."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best SAFE sweetener on the market","review":"I've tried stevia and don't care for the after taste.

Written at a level for a broad, educated audience, they give you a good understanding of the various key points in supercomputing.Issues include how to cluster computers into a functional unit, that can run these all efficiently (load balance). Or, how to make novel arrangements of computers into a supercomputer. Plus, of course, the steady progress of vector supercomputers, which has been the traditional route since Cray pioneered these in the 1970s.The articles are not just about how to make better supercomputers.

The look nicer because of their heels, but of course bare feet don't have heels. This is teaching girls to look big from the top, small from the bottom.

I believed the book would offer some factual information about the lives of these complex women that perhaps was unknown to the reader. Information that would yield insight as to why the media has concluded or labeled, fairly or unfairly, that these particular women are \\"Bitches\\". After reading the book in its entirety, I came to the conclusion that the author used these names to sell a book about \\"nothing\\" in order to make money. The book is not, and has nothing to do with, any of the women mentioned or referenced in it."},{"rating":"1","title":"AA","review":"I haven't read the book yet but was skimming through and read about her visit to an AA meeting in LA.

You'll be doing us all a huge favor."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not as good as Prozac Nation....but","review":"okay, most think Wurtzel is a whinny little white girl who doesn't know half of what she's talking about. Obviously that's not true and she proves it with her latest book, Bitch. I didn't agree with everything she said but I respected her well backed up opionions. Well all except one. I think Elizabeth needs to remember that Amy Fisher who she praised in her book was also the same Amy who raised a gun and fired a bullet into a womans face."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bitching and Moaning","review":"I was eager to read Bitch after having read Prozac Nation years before. I was sorely disappointed. Wurtzel rants and expounds on various maligned women throughout history. Her rambling can be hard to follow and I soon lost interest. This book had a lot of potential but Wurtzel just wasn't able to deliver.I later read her memoir of drug addiction and recovery, More, Now, and Again which explained Bitch's dismal failure. It turns out that during the time Wurtzel was writing Bitch she was heavily using a myriad of drugs.I suggest reading Prozac Nation and More, Now and Again (which are fabulous)and skipping Bitch. Read Manifesta and Grassroots for a modern perspective on feminism."},{"rating":"1","title":"not a pretty picture","review":"This book should be called \\"Idiot\\", and Wurtzel should substitute her middle finger for the second \\"i\\". What a dissapointment after the brave, interesting \\"Prozac Nation.\\" She rambles, she bores, she has trite epiphanies...This is a poorly written piece of junk, especially her smug, self-congratulatory tone."},{"rating":"1","title":"a book of babble","review":"Icould babble on and on like Elizabeth Wurtzel did when she wrote this book, but instead i'll make it short. Wurtzel is a great writer and I enjoy her sarcasm and delightful bitchiness. I loved her first book, \\"Prozac Nation\\" and had higher expectations for this one. It was 414 pages of babble- too much for me. I wouldn't recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"A mind is a terrible thing to waste","review":"And what a waste it is. I had the feeling I was on crystal meth during this painfully meandering and meaningless read. I was on the mark as it turned out from her next disaster. I don't hold much truck with an author who keeps writing \\"I mean\\" and other phatic communication devices designed for verbal communication. The pen is truly mightier than the sword - a sword can't bore you to death."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poorly written, rambling self-absorbed tripe.","review":"The hype surrounding this book prompted me to finally read it, and I can say in truth that I wasted hours of my day reading this garbage. Wurtzel's writing is completely unrefined; it's as though nobody edited it. She shifts in tone quickly, from overly casual to scholarly. It just doesn't work.In addition, her ideas are just ridiculously anti-woman. She makes excuses for \\"bad girls,\\" but I think what she's trying to do is make excuses for herself. And that's basically what things are about in \\"B***h\\" - it's a me, me, me book. Yawn."},{"rating":"1","title":"An average Bitch","review":"I am a HUGE Elizabeth Wurtzel fan..but Bitch disappointed me.. It's poorly written and how can you not know that Elizabeth I signed Mary Queen of Scotts death warrant! Or at least get it fact checked.Read MORE, NOW, AGAIN...now theres a book."},{"rating":"2","title":"whats with all the bitchin' ?","review":"I'm not sure exactly what readers of this book were expecting when they picked it up from the bookshelf (is the reason that there is so many anit-views due to the fact that people were hoping there would be some kinky lines in it due to the cover?) But in my opinion this book is one which collaborates the past with the now,drawing in examples which many of us can recognize.Everyone knows something about the OJ story,everyone knows something about Hill and Bill.(or perhaps,the hillbillies). It is a book documented with evidence which is current.It brings up good points and not so good points about the general make up of society today. Read it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Oh, so that's why we do what we do....","review":"Can sex-pots and feminists get along?Elizabeth Wurtzell thinks so.Wurtzell is an amazingly acute author, making each painfully sharp point by point without even stopping to take a breath. No dull stuff here. Wurtzell is brilliant, observant, and essentially witty. She has taken the schizophrenic topic of what it means to be a sexually attractive woman and has laid out for us the sociological implications.While Wurtzell does indeed \\"Praise\\" these women, she also details lives ended in isolated tragedy, insatiable hunger, and unattainably beautiful disaster.In this era of post-Packwood America, Wurtzell makes a case for flaunting sexuality and using whatever God himself was irresponsible enough to give you for your own needs.All I can say is Wurtzell needs to go on more binges."},{"rating":"2","title":"Give her a break","review":"So what if it's written in a stream of consciousness style, so what if it's self-indulgent. It's interesting, it's intelligent. Wurtzel takes a topic many young women find to be dull or uncool and breathes life into it. She's very aware of the world around her, she pulls illustrations from such various sources as Dante, Greek mythology and tabloid headlines. And it works. Wurtzel sees the big picture, how it all fits together. Going to Harvard doesn't automatically make her a spoiled brat. She's intelligent, she's knowledgeable - these are adjectives we don't like to attach to gen-xers. She has something important to say and she says it in her own stylish, witty, and yes, sometimes verbose way. So this isn't your average book of essays. So the writing isn't as terse as it could be. So what. It's creative. It's colorful. It's different. And it's damn fun to read. Give her a little credit, and lighten up a bit."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Truth About Being A \\"Bitch\\"","review":"Everything that Elizabeth Wurtzel wrote in this book is true. The truth about how males can be so sexist, and how men are 'allowed' or supposed to do certian things, while women aren't. Elizabeth uses many examples of 'difficult women' in this book such as Dilea, Madonna, Amy Fisher and so on.I am pretty sure that everyone has heard of phrases like, \\"Men can sleep with 10 women and thats fine. But if a women would sleep with 10 men she is a whore or a slut.\\" And thats what many people believe to be true.When guys are difficult and speak there mind they are 'just being a guy' but when a woman is difficlut or speaks her mind she gets classified as a bitch. And those are some of the things that she points out in her book. This is a very good book, but I wouldn't recommend it to people that have the minds set to the old fashioned ways or people that believe 'women are better off seen than heard'."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lacks attitude","review":"Having read Wurtzel's witty and insightful memoir, Prozac Nation, I looked forward to reading another one of her books. I thought I'd get a kick out of reading a book about America's most notorious women, but it lacks Wurtzel's sardonic humor and clever insights that made the aforementioned memoir such a delightful read. This book is a disappointment, to say the least. I expected more from this talented writer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Miss Wurtzel explains why we men love bad girls","review":"In her second book, Elizabeth Wurtzel examines the role and plight of the bad girl through Western history. Feminism hasn't suceded, Miss Wurtzel argues, as long as women have to behave in order to get men.Miss Wurtzel celebrates the women, for whatever reason, who chose not to behave, to admit to having desires and feel no guilt about fulfilling them.I have the paperback edition, though I read hardback edition first. I don't understand what all the fuss about her appearing topless on the cover. I liked it. She's very beautiful and talented."},{"rating":"2","title":"Willing to bare her breasts for her beliefs","review":"When I first saw the cover of this book, I thought it sad that in today's world even as intelligent a woman as Elizabeth Wurtzel has to take off her shirt to sell her book. After reading the book, though, I have to admire Ms. Wurtzel for believing so strongly in her message that she will pose topless on the cover of her own book. The only way for a woman to express her personal power in today's world is through her sexuality, Ms. Wurtzel is saying, and to express her power she bares her breasts."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"Bitch\\" a real dog of a book","review":"I'm sure Elizabeth Wurtzel's friends find her coy \\"agonizing\\" about her character flaws, her relentless self-justification, and her brutal putdowns of others' lives and choices fascinating, if not charming. For the rest of us, however, \\"Bitch\\" is a four-hundred-page exercise in boredom and embarrassment.I expected very little from this book; even so, I was disappointed. If anyone wants to read about self-empowering women dealing with social preconceptions about corporeality and sexuality, I strongly suggest the brilliant \\"Carnal Acts\\" by Nancy Mairs."},{"rating":"1","title":"rambling manuscript in search of an editor","review":"I loved Prozac Nation and was more than willing to forgive a first author her foibles - lack of coherence and cohesiveness. But in this, a long and boring rant without focus, there is simply no excuse. It reminded me of those endless nights helping an otherwise bright woman friend come down off coke or speed. There are too many other well-written books out there. Spare yourself."},{"rating":"1","title":"self aggrandizing - utter gutter trash","review":"I guess this is the fad of the week. Another cool rant from a modern day social commentarian, one that only the juvenile mind could possibly appreciate. What a boring prattle from a spoilt brat of an \\"author\\". Shes obviously made a mess of her life, and is so self absorbed that she feels it is important enough to interest somebody. the only people who could gain from this drivel are other self pitying kindred spirits who want to damage their lives even more. Has humanity sunk so low?Heres a piece of advice for the author and any would be readers: Take responsibility for your actions in life, for you bare the consequences."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful.","review":"I got through the intro in the bathtub and I'm not impressed with it, she's really indecisive and doesn't seem to have a set thesis statement, also reads as dated, it was published in 1998 and a lot of what she's talking about has been resolved or at least better exemplified."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disjointed and definitely difficult","review":"As a radical feminist, I was pathetically amused and enraged by this book. It does not celebrate women's strength or struggle, instead finding glory in the consolation prizes of temptress roles and the like. As a reader, I was intrigued but confused. It's easy to lose your place - the author is very clever but harder to stay with than a mechanical bull. I don't think any book i've ever read has given my facial muscles such a workout: i'm sure someone watching my expressions as I read would have been the more entertained of the group. Now that i've learned it was written during a drug binge, I understand it better and can get some sleep. We can do better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring Rant","review":"I love feminist literature. This book, however, was boring, pretentious, poorly researched and poorly thought out. There is a significant lack of critical thinking happenning in this book-most of the book is based on assumptions which the author provides virtually no evidence for and which, upon an objective review of the evidence, are shaky at best. Frankly, the writers who submit their articles to the National Enquirer show more critical thinking skill than the author does in this book! If you are looking for feminist literature that makes you think, rather than irritating you with its poorly supported ideological rant, then this is not the book for you. Many of the arguments advanced by the author have been done much better by others."},{"rating":"1","title":"Avoid this book!","review":"Of all math books I've had, this one is the most poorly written. The style is erratic, some of the least important versions of formulas are boldened, while the ones you actually use may be buried within the text. The examples make non-obvious transformations or 'pull rabbits out of a hat'. The problems are often poorly worded or open to varying interpretation, and the 'solutions' in the back are often just a number like \\".30239\\" for a problem that might have 5 parts and take a whole page to compute. In fact, the solutions of every chapter in the book take merely 3 pages.Some reviewers say this is one of the best books for beginners in probability, and if that is true, then the world of mathematical instruction is in a sorry state."},{"rating":"1","title":"where the hell did that come from?!?!","review":"That just happened to be what I was usually thinking when I read the book. Several steps in examples are skipped, very little reason for each step is given. Also the formulas are hard to locate some are set off in grey boxes others are blended into the text."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible book, period.","review":"With so many wonderful books available on this subject, I wonder why Mr. Ross felt the need to write this one. It is basically an unintelligible tangle of botched text on what is actually a fairly straightforward and interesting subject. It is unfortunate that this bok is required reading for many undergraduate courses. I can only wonder how many potentially gifted practitioners never persue the subject further because of the bad impression this book leaves. Save your money and your frustration by seeking out any other book on the subject."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great and helpful book!","review":"A first course in probability is a great book for anyone starting an advanced probability course. The examples and explanations are very clear and really assist in learning the material from an engineering and mathematical point of view."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best books on the subject","review":"Although it's titled \\"a first course\\", the reader will find difficulty in using the book without a background in Cal II.This book is clear, concise, with lots of inspiring examples to expound the concepts & applications. It would be wonderful if a solution manual were written, however. The exercises are well written and some challenging, and if no sufficient practice has been done to comprehend the concepts in the chapter, the reader is likely to stumble on the exercises.If you enjoy exploring the mathematical reasoning behind the applications, have the necessary prerequisites (calculus) and are willing to pay the efforts, this book is a great choice."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad book","review":"This book just isn't any good. I have a degree in math, and I still couldn't make heads or tails of it (no pun intended). I had to look at and study other books in order to pass the class. Maybe people who excel at probability think this is great, but it's no way to learn the stuff initially. If you're forced to use this book as a text, get something else to support it. I really liked the Shaum's Easy Outline for Probability and Statistics and they also have one with worked problems. Both are by the same authors and very well done. After looking through their stuff, you just might have a chance of understanding this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"This was a HORRIBLE intro text","review":"After taking an introductory stats class that used this book, I am turned off statistics forever. Sheldon Ross made the simplest ideas of probablity 10 times more difficult to understand than needed.He did give lots of examples, but examples don't help if you don't understand fundamentally how and where to use the formulas he gives you.There are a million formulas in this text, and a million ways to combine them. He uses examples that are really similar to each other, but with minute differences. That minute difference requires you to use a totally different combination of formulas to solve than the other very similar example. Can you imagine how annoying that is whey he hasn't explained things well?Don' t use this as an INTRO text!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Fundamental theories ommited.","review":"My stats professor said that this book is a classic, so I decided to buy it but after reading it and using that book for the semester I find that I did not grasp the fundamentals of probability theory.

For most readers it will become clear that the writer is a complete and total loser."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bill Bonanno= Sorry Excuse For A Mobster","review":"This book isn't what I thought it would be. There's a part in this book where Bill Bonanno rags on Joe Valachi, saying that Valachi only knew \\"street stuff\\". Well whether thats true or not, Valachi was actually in the mafia and did mafia things. Bill Bonanno is nothing but a legend's son. Thats it. The great Joe Bonanno. And thats what this book is mostly about, \\"my father this\\", \\"my father that\\". Everytime Bill talks about something Mob related, its always from the 3rd person view, (AS in he was never there). The only reason he got made was cause he's the bosses son. So if your looking for a real mob book get The Five Families or The Valachi Papers. This book is mostly about how the mafia tied into politics, and about Bill Bonanno's personal life such as his marriage. If you want to read about real mafioso's, read about Lucky Luciano, Joeseph Massino, Vito Genovese, Gotti, or the DeCavalcante family."},{"rating":"1","title":"Are you crazy or what?","review":"I've been studying the mafia for 20 years. I have a calabrese (not sicilian) background, and this helps me understanding the guys. I really could not understand this book. The guy is crazy. He says Carlo Gambino is a coward, Salvatore Lucania knows nothing, Lepke and Lansky are not even mentioned! This is a tribute to his family. In his point of view his father is the real Godfather and only the Bonannos and the Profacis (his wife family) are cool, smart and traditional. I'll just tell you what, if this guy is right, everyone else is wrong! Lost of time and money! And just a tip, as far as I know, and all the world knows, the first cappo di tutti i capi was Lucky, and the next one Gambino."},{"rating":"2","title":"Some in the mafia do have nine lives","review":"This inside story of the mafia is not just another story about killing and breaking the law but of family ties and tradition. Mr. Bonanno's account of the Kennedy assasination is one that could shed light on what really happened but could also make you understand the reasons why the true findings never went public. Whether you like the Bonanno way of life or not, this book does give you a true feel for the mafia's inner workings. Growing up in San Francisco around my grandfather and all of his Italian friends, the one thing missing in today's world is the comfort of being part of a group of people that were held together through their heritage in a bond so tight that nothing could break it. It's this bond and show of power that fascinates people and attracts them to this world. All in all, I think that you'll enjoy Mr. Bonanno's eloquent portrayal of \\"his life\\" and also be thankful that you were never a part of it."},{"rating":"2","title":"This book reveals the truth about the Kennedy Assassinations","review":"This is a well written book that describes the fact that the Mafia was an alternative form of government fashioned to protect Italian imigrants from corrupt police and politicians.

Kennedy conspiracy buffs will find some interesting implications in here as well!"},{"rating":"1","title":"lousy excuse for a mobster!","review":"This is probably the second worst book about the mafia I have ever read, after \\"man of honor\\" by his father Joe Bonanno. As his father did, Bill Bonanno filled his book with so much worthless information about Sicilian tradition, honor, and customs that it's insulting to american born mobsters. First of all, he was born into a mafia family. If his dad wasn't boss, this guy wouldn't have lasted ten seconds in the mob. This whole book is very vague and superficial, never really going into detail about actual crimes or murders. If he would have wrote more about experiences and the inner workings of the families this book might have been readable. As it is, it's just some fake mobster trying to glorify himself. Do not waste money on this book, and if you already have it, burn it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Clearly not THAT bound by honor","review":"Despite Bound by Honor's title, it should serve as exhibit A that there is no honor among thieves. Frankly, this thief is really pathetic, too: from writing a tell-all about a group that considers it a matter of honor and pride that they don't tell all, to claiming the Mafia killed Kennedy, and worst of all because of the pride with which he relates how horribly he treated his wife and ignored his children. Don't waste your time on this one: at least in the Mob accounts labeled as \\"fictional,\\" the main characters aren't insecure and pathetic."},{"rating":"1","title":"bound by honor","review":"This book is on the low end of any of the mob book I have read.

If you're looking for up and coming pop-punk go with this! The only downfall is one or two songs sound alittle similar.

I thought that the music on this cd would be something that I could enjoy and, yes, the music did seem well written at first until I listened to the lyrics... but unfortunately, the mediocre melodies and angsty lyrics only made me throw up a little bit every second in my mouth. Before drowning in my own vomit, I had to turn it off. Thanks Mayday Parade for being another band that does not create anything new. At least I had some fun using it as a frisbee for a while."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best CDs ever made...","review":"Mayday Parade has been my favorite band for some time now. I've seen them in concert and met and spoken to a few of them and they're all nice guys who really know what they're doing when it comes to songwriting.Granted, one of the integral parts of their vocal delivery and lyric-writing, former member Jason Lancaster, is no longer with the band (which is very disappointing). However, Derek Sanders, Jake Bundrick, and Jeremy Lenzo all have amazing voices in their own rights and I don't see this band slowing at all despite the loss.From the very first song on this CD you will be drowned you in an assault of soaring vocals, infectious guitar melodies, and booming drum beats and bass lines that never lets up.I give every song on this CD five stars and I would give this album more than five stars if it was possible. I love this CD and this band and I can't wait for another release from Mayday Parade. It's sure to be yet another album worthy of wearing out in your stereo."},{"rating":"2","title":"This writer has my attention.","review":"Fun and serious. P.

To gain a five star from me, it would have to be laugh out loud funny too.)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Unique damsel in distress.","review":"Cyan accepts his quest, because he cannot do otherwise. The old bard who stops him with her eyes tells him that the new queen is no mortal but a horrible monster who has imprisoned the real queen in a tower. The real Gwynne of Skye is shut off from the world in a tower, where she must weave and never look upon the real world except through a mirror. Cyan travels to Skye and endures hardships and pain to help his king, little realizing that his actions will change history, and his very world. In the end, Cyan finds that he has rescued more than a mere young woman, and that he has accomplished more than a mere man. Patricia McKillip delivers a lovely tapestry of words and story in The Tower at Stony Wood, a clever and unique faerie tale told in eloquent prose and rich imagery."},{"rating":"2","title":"Intriguing, engaging fantasy","review":"This is a beautiful fantasy, weaving the stories of a woman in a tower, a knight searching for a way to free her, and another young man, attempting to free his country from outside domination.

I owned the debut album by the Pousette-Dart band on vinyl back in the mid 70s. I had first heard it playing at a local shop --- the legendary East-West Records in Orlando. I admit to having totally forgotten about this band during most of the 30 years since then, but listening to these wonderful songs again --- some of which are new to my ears --- brings back smiles galore. Jon Pousette-Dart was a very talented songwriter and singer and many of those tunes (\\"What Can I Say\\" ... \\"Dancer\\" ... \\"There's Been a Mistake\\" ... \\"Smile on Me\\") should have been monster hits. These are simply, just very melodic, addictive pop songs.

Bailey is playing well, which makes it doubly frustrating that many of the tracks are tedious in the extreme--try the opening track (programmed by Darryl Moore) for a good instance of the disparity between the guitarist's typically shrewd contributions & the feebleness of the underlying track. If you're looking for off-the-wall Bailey, try _Mirakle_, which has him with a jazz-funk rhythm section & turns out an unexpected success. This disc is only for the curious. Fans of John Oswald's plunderphonics will want to note that track 11 is an Oswald cut-up of a solo recording by Bailey; Bailey doesn't play on top of it."},{"rating":"1","title":"A mixed-up mess, I have never seen such all over the place","review":"This book did too much jumping around for me. I have never seen a book that covers twenty years time and you never knew the times were changing, it seemed to me in one paragraph they were children and in the next they were in college and going to exotic places. I give Ellis a break because this was her first novel, but she needs to work more on character development because hers is very poor. The characters were not plausible or believeable. There was too much focus on skin and hair color and texture, the parents and the children had very limited dialogue. Because of this we were not allowed to see and understand the dynamics of their relationship, the husband and wife had no dialogue about family, children, or their lives in general. I mean this book was simply the pits and I'm glad that I didn't spend any money on it because I would demand a refund."},{"rating":"1","title":"A very confusing book","review":"My book club read this book and we felt it was very confusing.

Don't beleive the line in the synopsis which reads \\"in the tradition of Terri McMillan.\\" Too many times African Amrican women writers are compared to Ms. McMillan! Read each author for yourself and decide.Good Fences is an interesting story which gives readers some food for thought. In the tradition of Benilde Little's \\"Good Hair\\", this book looks at the inside life of African Americans who have \\"arrived\\".

I believe the author was conveying some deep thoughts but, was unable to hold my attention well enough for me to really savor her message.

The author was insightful of the attitudes they had to overcome and that was interesting. However, the book was slow reading. It was difficult to stay focused and follow at times. I found that the book just ended. Kind of left one hanging. I felt the author should have told about what happened with the twins and Tommytwo."},{"rating":"2","title":"DIFFERENT BUT GOOD","review":"I appreciated Ms. Ellis' style from the moment I began to the book. The story unfolds not so much as story driven but as character driven, snippets into the lives of those she writes about.At points brave, bold, humorous and poignant I never knew what to expect from page to page and that is what made this read so good for me. It takes real talent to pull such a work off and Ms. Ellis has done that.Every book is not for everyone but if you're looking for food for the brain then this is the book for you and in my opinion that is the best kind of writing. Make us think, catch us off guard, surprise us, enlighten us.There's only one word for this debut novel --- YES!Erika Ellis is on my 'author's to watch' list and I will be keeping my eye out for any future works.

Filled with elegant words and compelling style, Krygier tells the novel and exotic story of an Israeli ex-paratropper who is transplated with his wife and daughter in southern California. He is spiritually lost, which is evident in his relationships with his wife and distant teenaged daughter, and eventually pierced by a chance meeting with an Orthodox rabbi who takes an interest in this unique man and peppers his newfound view of the world. The effect that these two men have on each other and how they change their perception of the world is rich and magical. Krygier, who lived in Israel, is able to capture the Israeli personality and lifestyle to a tee, from physical mannerisms to social reactions.A wonderful story and hopefully one of many yet to come from Leora Krygier."},{"rating":"2","title":"touching","review":"I loved this book.

The game seems to show the native Nali as being a very religious culture, and yet in the book this aspect is not even mentioned once.

Is there someplace within us all that is deep and dark and waiting to be discovered by chance? Or is there nothing left worth waiting for, nothing left worth fighting for, nothing left worth living for? These are the questions that Spiritual Literacy challenges us with. As I read on, taking a long, hard trip upriver towards my own Heart of Darkness, I thought often of a solitary tree, a tree that had once belonged to a vast, glorious forest but now stood alone. Trees can come and go but forests, like our spiritual essence, can only exist if we nurture them and let their beauty strenghten us. Read this book and save a tree: the tree that is growing within you. It may one day turn into a forest and bring with it the happiness and joy that life is supposed to be."},{"rating":"2","title":"Decent...","review":"I chuckled when I saw someone say that this felt like a school book, because this is the \\"textbook\\" that we use in my philosophy of religions class at my high school.

However, I'm not so pleased anymore. Its happened at least twice now that I power on my unit only to find that all my songs are gone. The unit won't recognize them. Its happened at the most inopportune times, too, right when I'm about to work out and need loud music to take my mind off the pain! The instruction manual was no help, the web site was no help, but more astoundingly, Philips customer service was no help!

My wife found that the panel used to properly size the right side had not been sewn into the left side. This produced a lopsided fit which just did not work with her motorcycle.

It was not obvious at the time (especially given that sailors had a lot of other health problems, especially on long voyages to the tropics) that it was simply a matter of dietary deficiency. It also shows how contemporary medical theory (still following the classical four humours theoretical framework) was a barrier to better understanding and a scientific approach. Finally, life was cheap where lemon juice was expensive and it took very definite proof of its relative efficacy to convince the Royal Navy to provide a ration of lemon juice to its sailors.

It's not so much that it's boring(Although it is boring!),because you run the risk of getting slightly boring tracks on such compilations but that's usually the result of an attempt to get a clean mellow sound. But these tracks are boring without the mellow vibes and worst of all their annoying. The only half decent track on this album is ruined by a guy who must have the most annoying voice in the world saying \\"Happy time, happy time..\\" Quite ironic really because this CD made me very unhappy.

While I think the band continued to achieve genius throughout its career, they never created anything else quite as beautiful as Trespass.

Similar to Nursery Cryme, but even more innocent and deeply moody."},{"rating":"2","title":"The dreaming point","review":"\\"trespass\\" is one of my all-time favourite Genesis album.all tracks have a dream-like atmosphere,\\"Looking for someone\\" is a real gem here - Peter Gabriel's vocals,great piano works and amazing bass line (Mike Rutheford shines on whole album) arew making \\"looking for someone\\" one of hteir best tracks from Gabriel era.the rest of the album is great too, especially \\"White mountain\\" and classic rocker \\"the knife\\".definitly it is one of the best genesis albums ever made!"},{"rating":"2","title":"trespass-(able to cross it w/o jail?)-(a play on word)","review":"or 3.5 stars. most mellow of early genesis lps. dont get the mca studio version-bassy, unclear, murkysound. all tracs are good. tracs 1,3,6 are heaviest; the rest are mellow. the best is 6 then 5, 2, 1, 3, 4 where the last 4 tracs are hard to prioritize. cd is long: apx 51mins, cuz they stretched the tracs too long. they could've made more songs instead. the best early lp of all genesis lps is NURSERY CRYME-only 38mins though."},{"rating":"1","title":"The roots of a band","review":"If you were farsighted enough to acquire this album when it was first released you are a visionary. If you are a true fan of Genesis, by all means check this out. I am a died in the wool progressive rock fan. Yes, Moody Blues, Jethro Tull, ELP, King Crimson, Genesis; I owned nearly every bit of vinyl they released. If you are a Genesis fan and already have Foxtrot, Lamb Lies Down, Trick of the Tail, Duke and you want to understand where the band came from and you don't have From Genesis To Revelation, buy it before this one. If you have almost the entire collection, and this is the last piece of the puzzle, it's not bad. If you're not steeped in Genesis, there are better places to spend your dime. I really enjoy Genesis but this is not the most interesting music they ever produced.

To hear Peter Gabriel's heart-wrenching, soulful sound is quite extraordinary. No Genesis library is complete without their early stuff and Trespass is NO exception. Only six songs on the CD, but each song is a treasure.You could hear even then, that they would be HUGE! The talented artists who put together this album may not have all made it into Genesis' later recordings, but this one in my opinion, is a classic!I still get shivers when I hear Peter opening on \\"Looking For Someone\\" and \\"Visions of Angels\\". In my opinion, two of the prettiest melodies ever produced by Genesis.I know this is the album that did it for me all those years ago... one listen and I was hooked. A fan for LIFE!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Essential Genesis work","review":"Trespass(1970) is Genesis' true debut. Even though Phil Collins and Steve Hackett have not joined the band yet, they still manage to piece together some good stuff. Anthony Phillips is a great guitarist and this is his last album for Genesis, sadly. John Mayhew, the second drummer, does a good job until the real drummer, Phil, comes in. The album starts with LOOKING FOR SOMEONE which really isn't a great start because it is mostly just dark and mysterious. WHITE MOUNTAIN is an excellent border between peaceful and fast. VISIONS OF ANGELS may be the most beautiful song on the album. STAGNATION is the best song on the cd as it is peaceful, mystical, dark, and mysterious. DUSK is the lightest song on the album that's sounds a bit like Gregorian chant. and last but definitely not least, THE KNIFE, a powerful song that wraps up the album beautifully. This Genesis album you should definitely own!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The best is yet to come","review":"Fresh off the heels of their 1969 debut \\"From Genesis To Revelation\\", the band felt they needed a fresh approach for their next album, 1970's \\"Trespass.\\" Genesis got themselves a new manager and recorded this sophmoric effort in the English countryside to give the album a \\"grass roots\\" British feel to it. The results appeared to work, but many Genesis fans felt the best was yet to surface from this quintet just out of the Charterhouse School in London. The polished tracks here are \\"Stagnation\\" and \\"The Knife.\\" Some personnel changes would develop after this album as well. Guitarist Anthony Phillips and drummer John Mayhew departed, with the former putting out an occasional solo album. Genesis fans would then be treated to the classic lineup, aka \\"the best yet to come.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Trespass","review":"Not bad considering this is really the 1st album of the Genesis we consider Genesis (try to catch their bio on the Biography Channel). The six songs are very listenable, reflect the intricate detail we expect from early Genesis, and you will not be disapointed in you already like Foxtrot thru Wind and Wuthering. I had it on vinyl and now on CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the two most creative Genesis recordings","review":"After the Lamb Lies Down on Broadway, this recording is Genesis's most creative. One word of warning: this recording isn't the best sound quality and the players are young musicians playing WAY beyond their experience (which is part of what makes it so exciting--these young musicians are really pushing the boundaries of contemporary rock). While the recording and performance is not perfect, it is inspired. Just put on the headphones and listen to the 12 string guitars in counterpoint to organ and piano--throw in a little flute, some electric guitar, melodic bass, and Peter Gabriel's poetic singing, and you can see everything that made this band and most of it's musicians, famous down the road.One problem on this CD compared to my old LP version: what happened to the big ending on \\"Stagnation\\"? For some reason, somebody decided to do an awkward fade-out on the end of this tune....Strange..."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is beautiful!","review":"I used to have this little gem on 8track, and haven't heard it in quite some time. I played the samples on this site, and it all came back to me. Although, I do own Archive,vol.I, which includes \\"Stagnation,\\" and \\"Dusk\\"(my personal \\"Trespass\\" favorite), the whole thing in context is a very under-rated piece of work. To me, it has sentimental value, and I would recommend this to any serious person who isn't sure whether or not to acquire it."},{"rating":"2","title":"They started out by composing a Masterpiece","review":"As soon as \\"they\\" gave these young guys REAL conditions to show the world their immense talent, they made up what I personally consider a masterpiece in the progressive area.Those who have songs like The Musical Box, Cinema Show or Firth of Fifth as favorite ones in the Genesis catalog will probably feel the same way as I do after discovering this album. I've enjoyed \\"Trespass\\" since the very first listening and the main reason is clear: no moments like More Fool of Me mixed up between great musical songs. Homogeneous, you can listen to it with the same feeling from start to finish.Therefore, I don't find it easy to point out highlights here. Ha well, maybe with 2 exceptions: \\"The Knife\\" (electrifying rhythm from the very first second, perfect miscellany of sounds in the middle part) and \\"Stagnation\\", a genuine classic from this band, as good for me as the 3 ones above mentioned."},{"rating":"1","title":"Artistic Techniques for Perfect Makeup","review":"I was greatly disappointed after viewing this video. Although the title promises a lot, you won't learn anything about the make up. This VHS lasts about 15 minutes, it shows an author of this tape applying make up ONLY on herself and advertising her own line of color cosmetics. There are no tips, tricks or techniques shown. This video is useless - if you really want to learn something about make up I'd suggest you buy Hollywood Make up Magic VHS"},{"rating":"1","title":"do not rent","review":"this movie is a total ripoff..they should remove it from amazon..another poorly remake..avoid like the plague! do not get conned..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mediocre Found-Footage Film","review":"Amityville Haunting is another basic found-footage horror film. A new family moves into the house and begin experiencing supernatural events; the events are capture by Luke, the son, and home security cameras. The acting ranges from terrible to mediocre; the scenes where Luke talks to himself are very bad and sound incredibly forced. There are only a few good scares, while most scares fell flat for me. The ending was simply okay. It claims to be real footage, but it obviously isn't. It really doesn't impress or try anything new at all, you've seen this movie before.By the way, there is some nudity and sex at the beginning of the film and only a little blood. Save your money, I caught it on Netflix Streaming (available as of 6/21/12) and definitely wouldn't recommend paying for it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Movie I've Seen in Years","review":"First off, I was able to watch this for free on another streaming site (similar to Prime), so I'm happy I didn't spend a time on watching this piece of garbage. I feel bad for those of you who spent your hard earned money on this film, it is truly dreadful.The acting is horrible. HORRIBLE. The son is possibly the most annoying character, all he does is carry around his camera and ask people to look at crap he's filmed. Then we have to listen to his nightly recap as to what happened during the day. Here's a hint...nothing happens...The plot is so thin it's almost non-existent. Why, if the Dad knew the history of the house, would he bring his family there? Why would he not pick up on the name that his daughter keeps saying, over and over? I could keep going, but the entire plot makes no sense, so I don't have the time to dissect every issue.Anyways, STAY FAR AWAY from this movie, it's truly that awful."},{"rating":"1","title":"Zero stars","review":"This is one of the worst movies ever made.Why can't I rate it zero stars?

Rips off Paranormal activity","review":"This was tolerable for a while. The kids were the better performers here, while the guy playing the husband is just plain bad. This is an unnecessary story of a house that is supposed to be the one in Amityville but isn't, and it's many years later. This movie tries very hard to rip off Paranormal activity but without the creepy factor necessary to sustain it."},{"rating":"1","title":"pro classic trek","review":"This book had a very interesting premise. I was looking forward to reading a mingling of the Classic Trek and TNG universes. I was very disappointed. I am an avid TNG fan who also likes Classic Trek. There's a subtle, but continual, pro-Classic Trek theme throughout the book. I was disappointed that the author felt he had to diminish TNG and its characters, to pay tribute to Classic Trek. If you are a Classic Trek fan, undoubtedly, you'll like this book and its implications. However, if you're a TNG fan, you'll be turned off by its slightly negative take on TNG."},{"rating":"2","title":"Adventurous and fun but lacking when it comes to McCoy.","review":"I really loved all the adventure and especially enjoyed Scotty's performance and I've always known McCoy to be stubborn, but not like this. It was dissapointing to not see the Enterprise's crew up to full force because of him. I was hoping from the beginning that he was going to be able to use his wit, experience, and intelligence to help Picard, not harm him. But except for that one flaw the overall storyline is really exciting and I reccomend it to anyone in the mood for a fun-filled adventure tale."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great reunion of Legends","review":"Good Story, I love seeing Scotty back in action.

I loved this book so much. It brought together 3 men from our past, and men from the future. Scotty, searching for his old commander, Dr. McCoy, old a frail preaching to Picard. Spock, the uniter, trying to bring more philosophy into the minds of the Romulan people. He gets caught and is sentenced to death. The story unfolds and a surprised Spock is reunited with the one he loves to hate.(Even though a Vulcan would never admit to hating.)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Crossover is the second best ST novel I have read","review":"Croosover is one of those books that you can't put down. (I finished it in two days.) It was a page turner that kept you the edge of your pants and you never wanted it to stop. The story revoles around spock. He is working on his mission for Unifiing (sp) the Vulcans and the Romulans. He gets captured by the romulans and he find out that it was because of a spy. (I'm not going to tell you who because it would ruin the book for you.) Starfleet finds this out and sends the Enterprise-D to negotiate the Unificationist's release. They send a rep to help. That rep is Admiral Leonard H. McCoy. Meanwhile Scotty (Who is flying around in his shuttle) overhears the messege from Starfleet and he divises his own rescue plan. It is the various plotlines and characters the keep you reading. I grade it *Burns a five on to the side of a cow* A FIVE! By the way, if you were wondering what the best ST novel I have read. It is \\"Fallen Heroes\\" (ST: DS9 book no. 5)"},{"rating":"2","title":"This was a very good novel.","review":"I believe that this is a very good novel. This is because that Friedman did a spetacular job at combing that characters from TNG and TOS, Even though some of the characterization and events were a little over the top and some event would not happen if Star Trek was real. These included the bridge of the Enterprise on the Yorktown and McCoy believing he can solve the situation by pulling rank."},{"rating":"2","title":"This book rocks! Read it immediately!!!","review":"Hi, everyone. I've recently read Crossover, and you better read it too. It's a Star Trek book, basically about thereunion of Spock, McCoy and Scotty in the 24th century.A lot of things happen in between, like Spock almost gets killed, Scotty steals a ship, and McCoy endangers a thousandlives. All in a day's work.WHY ARE YOU STILL READING THIS? GO BUY THIS BOOK THIS INSTANT!"},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"-I- AM SPOCK-TACUS!\\"","review":"You can bet that if Peter David had lifted a cliche as hoary as the \\"I am Spartacus\\" moment for one of his stories, he would have at least given a nod to his source! Spock as messiah became fairly tedious, as did the rehash of 'old codger from OST becoming a liability and then proving himself' plot line from RELICS. Dry, humorless, with action scenes that lead nowhere and a seemingly superficial grasp on what makes the characters tick. I just don't get why Mr. Friedman is so popular. I've been so pleased with the overall improvement in the ST fiction offerings in the last few years - Kevin Ryan, Peter David, Greg Cox and others have all been able to incorporate and expand the dimensions of the trek universe with wit, heart and intelligence. Like another reviewer here, I keep trying to like this author's books since he is so prolific, but damn it, Jim, Star Trek fiction should never be a chore!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book, perfect mix of Next Generation & Old Series","review":"Friedman mixes the two series in a great way, including the arguments between McCoy and Spock, the accent of Scotty, the caracter of Spock...

Holiday finances were a bit tight so I shopped around and the price was right so I pulled the trigger on this Sub. I was plesantly suprised by the sound quality. I'm sure that there are some limitations and I've not fully tested with music or cranked up the volume other than during our viewing of the new Bourne movie, but so far, this little guy is holding its own quite well.

The only drawback - doesn't have auto turn on/off."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing subwoofer","review":"Never mind the kids review. I just did that because I didn't want to give my email to Amazon.This is a natural sounding subwoofer with very deep bass. Just face the woofer at a 45 degree angle in a corner of the room with the woofer facing away from the corner. My room is 17ft by 14ft and it shakes the room like crazy! You really feel it in the chest. Sounds amazing with movies and good with music. But if you listen mainly to music, get a front firing sealed subwoofer and not a ported one. Sealed is better quality sound and range for music lovers. Ported subwoofers give the heart pounding lows needed for movie sound effects. I got this for $99 at Best Buy. It's an amazing deal. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Yes.","review":"I have owned a Yamaha CRX TS20 Bookshelf stereo for several years. It sounds great (for use in a smaller room...). I had no idea that it could sound so much better with this subwoofer.

For how much I was willing to spend I am very happy with this system and with this subwoofer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Product for the price","review":"I was looking for an inexpensive subwoofer to complete my home theater and this was one of the few subwoofers I could find under $100 - After reading all the reviews, I chose this one over the Sony and all I can say is, the reviews were justified. This is a great product and I'm enjoying my 5.1 movies so much more."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome Sub","review":"Believe me when I tell you, the picture doesn't do the sub. justice. This thing has depth with a commanding presence. at 100w, it's enough to feel an average living or media room with lows without disturbing your neighbors. Adjust the volume to satisfy your listening desire, or let your AV receiver control it for you. If you wanted to, you could use it as a stand alone surrounding system since it has connections for that on the rear. Yes, it isn't timed, but I have it connected to a outlet that shuts it off when the t.v. is turned off, and if your receiver has switched outlets on it, plug in to that...No biggy. For this price, it's a good investment."},{"rating":"2","title":"exceptional","review":"We checked for a Subwoofer at several local music, tv and audio outlets including Best Buy and could not find anything that was not over priced and really not what we were looking for.

I have it set up with 2 Klipsch SF1 tower speakers and a Klipsch c1 center. It blends nicely with the speakers and extends the bass to impressive levels. While there are definitely better subwoofers, the yamaha does great for its price. The only other choice to really consider might be a dayton basic subwoofer. No doubt the yamaha is competitive against those, though. It produces low bass that isn't muddy or boomy. It has a volume knob that can adjust levels as well as a high gain filter.

These musicians were all very big in the sixities, they were also influenced by the times. Black Nationalism played a large part in the lives of these musicians in the sixties and African drumming techniques are very evident in their playing. the music is heartfelt (definitely heard in the singing/chanting of Graves and Moye.) a great record for lovers of the drums, people interested in African influence on jazz, and a must for any fan of the drummers."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Must Have Classic New Orleans Jazz DVD","review":"I purchased this DVD unintentionally and was so impressed with the performance that I had to listen to it at lease once a week.

Her basic thesis here is that North Americans in particular tend to couch discourse in terms of win/lose dichotomies. The first half of the book deal is very apropos of the current political season where individuals aspiring to public office are unfairly put under a microscope - every utterance under all circumstances heavily weighed with the objective of testing to destruction. Who among us, she asks, would be willing to withstand such scrutiny?The 2nd half of the book deals more with the language of interpersonal relationships and was for me more satisfying. Again she explores win/lose zero sum styles. The style is anecdotal and enjoyably written rather than clinical and is written for the layperson. Try the first half only if your interest is politics."},{"rating":"2","title":"this book is dead on target","review":"although i haven't read the whole book yet, i believe the problem of discourse is one americans need to resolve if we are to survive as a nation. as a scientist, it appears to me that math is one of the few convincing arguments accepted in the public arena. we desperately need a cultural method for accurately evaluating and judging non-mathematical ideas."},{"rating":"1","title":"the book has a unbalanced feeling","review":"Dr.Tannen spends the bulk of the book supporting a general thesis that the confrontational debate/argument styles of speech and communications is not always appropiate, efficient, or constructive. Her many examples become somewhat tedious as the book reads on. Having read Dr. Tannen's other works and agreeing with Dr. Tannen thesis - I wanted the book to move the process from describing the problem to suggesting solutions and describing how these solutions might work. In the last pages, She does provide some guidelines for useful dialogue. However,I found the solution short. In this respect - I was disappointed because I felt that Dr. Tannon could have written a more constructive treatment of what constitutes useful public dialogue."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting... Worth reading","review":"I am a debate coach from Colorado. When I first started reading the book, my first impression was that her arguments were poorly supported. She seemed to use more senarios than actual facts. As I began to move on though, she started backing up what she was saying with more constructive arguements. I thought that her views where a bit misguided, as it gave the impression that debate is our problem. Debate is a very useful tool, and when it is used well, it can, and many times is, the best form of communication. It weeds out the the bad arguements and statements so only the the truth is left standing. She made debate sound too much like a negative thing. She did have some good points though, and it was a very interesting book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice clinical guide","review":"In my opinion, this manual is a really good clinical guide for therapists that are already acquainted with the kinesio taping method. It describes some techniques in step-by-step way and it also brings some associations of the kinesio taping method with other taping techniques. However, I must say that I've expected more about the book material and lay-out of the components, since it is black and white. Even though, I must say that these considerations do not make it difficult to read and understand it.

However, now after searching the web, I found that this exact same book is some for $32.95 EVERYWHERE else. I should not have bought this book the first place I saw it. I feel like I have been robbed. I feel so stupid for not checking the prices, I know the prices on amazon are pretty competitive so i didnt bother. This price is more than double ANYWHERE else.

Bizarre and intriguing situations got me hooked. This one is about a hungry witch who tried to conjure up a soft-boiled egg for her dinner but ended up with dinosaur eggs.

The tutorials do take a lot of practice and adjusting on your own to really figure out what they are offering. They dont go over things step by step by step like beginner books do so if you dont have the basics down dont bother. Once you get those basics down though, this should be the first book you get. It teaches you all the tricks of the trade that are necessary to be true masters of Illustrator."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth it's 'Wow'","review":"Funny, I recently got this book....the cover design is different than what I am looking at now on this Amazon screen...despite purchasing it from Amazon.I had the 9.0 Wow book and it helped me tremendously. This book has done the same thing. Despite some other books I have recently purchased targeting folks like me that have purchased the entire Adobe CS Suite, this book does a good job in highlighting the significant new features in Illy CS. Especially the 3D area. The supplemental CD-ROM is helpful also.

The author should stick to design and forget about teaching and writing books. It is difficult to find quality Illustrator CS books and this is definately not one of them. Stick to the Adobe Classroom in a Book series - even though their Illustrator CS books has some errors to it. I gave this book 2 stars only because it has great art in it.

This DVD is still selling new for around $25 and I don't think first edition DVD's are worth nearly as much as books. I would say, buy any other yoga DVD for a reasonable price (between $18 and $25 seems about average.) Tias Little is an okay instructor but there are boatloads of other ashtanga yoga teachers on DVD who are far more worth it.

I took a lot of notes, have typed up my notes and registered into his e-seminar: he has not only walked the talk, but also has done a lot of the homework for us, and shares where he got his skills from. He gives his sources so we can go read them for ourselves, he shares steps to take to generate our own results, and he is fun to read. Granted this book is a bit of a sales tool to enroll us into taking his seminars etc, but it offers a lot to anyone who is looking for a relaxed way to live the life of one's dreams. He gives us ways to clarify what it is that we want and how to get there. I highly recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not a \\"How to Book.\\" Great for those needing inspiration.","review":"Some readers who wrote reviews wrote \\"nothing new\\" etc. Let me give it to you straight up. This book is not a how to get rich book. Those that are are actually working towards their goals know that. This book is ensightful. It \\"does\\" have a lot of quotes in it from some of the greatest thinkers this world has ever seen. That is the real benefit. If you like Brian Tarcy, Steven Covey, John C. Maxwell, even Donald Trump you will like this book. It is for true thinkers that are able to read between the lines, not too much for the \\"get rich quick\\" crowd."},{"rating":"1","title":"Same stuff, different book....","review":"Nothing new here, folks. All this book does is give page after page of quotes from other writers of books on spirituality (James Allen, Lenedra Carroll, Eckhart Tolle,etc..) as well as other historical figures. The rest is just a bunch of his, hazy at best, personal experiences. The level of this book can best be pinpointed by relaying one of his \\"keys\\": \\"Work smarter, not harder\\"The constant advertisments to purchase the above mentioned author's books also became very tiresome."},{"rating":"1","title":"HaHa...I hope no one paid for this!","review":"I got the audio book free from the library and I still paid too much!

Hey, if you gained anything from this then more power to ya."},{"rating":"1","title":"No Original Thought","review":"This is a collection of saying from other people supported by text from the author. I felt cheated from page one. There is a lack of planning in this book and the author just trails off into never never land at times. The book needs a good editor. What is so disturning about the book is that it throws in your face how rich the author is without remorse. Over and over again you hear how great the writer is and he makes you feel like you are not worth much. I felt bad after reading this ego-trip of a book with its look-at-me message and its condesending tone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not What I Thought It Would Be","review":"There are very few insights here and what readers are left with only a New Age viewpoint that does not fit in the real business world. The book does go into some detail about how he made his money in the publishing business, but that was some 30 years ago. I don't see how this message is relevant today, especially in the high-tech world we live in today. Pass on this on."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Disappointment","review":"There is no information here that will teach you how to be a millionaire. All there is really are just stories and thoughts from Marc Allen. Mr. Allen says that he is not a Type A personality, but a Type Z. In other words he admits he is a lazy person and says that he has his employees do most, if not all of the work for his company. Show me a millionaire who thinks like this and I will show you a millionaire that will not be a millionaire for long. Most successful business people are actively involved in their businesses and know what the meaning of the word work is. Mr. Allen's message is one that says luck is okay and so is sloth, but in today's sluggish economy this message is for the birds!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The Joke Is On The Reader","review":"Some of the passages in this book are hard to believe. Marc Allen says that he never yells at anyone and for anyone to yell at his company is grounds to be dismissed. Gee what happen to the Bill Gates management style. Let the emotions roll baby and make money. Allen's view seems ridiculous to me and I am sorry I bought it! I did not learn a thing. Hope I am speaking softly--ha"},{"rating":"1","title":"Cool Idea But Bad Writing","review":"The idea of this book is rather good, but the writing was tuff to get through. There is really no rhyme or reason to the text and the reader is left wondering at times what exactly the author is talking about. Also, there is no proof given in the book for the author's success. He claims he is rich, but the reader would not know this just by reading the book. Because of this I had doubts about many of the author's claims in the book. There is a dark cloud of uncertainty surrounding the work that leads me to think that some sections of the book are pure make believe. This would be a better book for fiction or fantasy than non-fiction."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Good Paperweight","review":"After reading some of the reviews here on Amazon.com about this book, I bought it and I am sorry I did. What a load of nonsense. The positive reviewers are no doubt members of the author's family because I can think of no other explanation for their opinions. There is nothing new about the material that one could not find in a zillion other business books. The author seems like he is in a meditative haze for most of the book and clearly has proven that he is an empty and hollow writer that deserves only to be dismissed and quickly forgotten."},{"rating":"2","title":"Practical at a high level.","review":"I may have a slight different perspective on this book since I've only listened to the audio version of it. One thing you have to remember is that this book was written as a \\"Visionary Plan\\"; it is by no means an in depth, step-by-step process on how to become a millionaire. The ideas Marc discusses are intended to be practical approaches to disciplining your mind, setting goals, and realizing our full potential. Much of the book tends to focus on overcoming the negative obsticles of our own minds.I give it only 4 stars because although it's intended to be a high level approach, at times it can be a bit too abstract. I wish Marc would have given further details about how he started his company, along with more concrete examples of how his techniques helped him achieve financial success. Convincing yourself that you can fly is fine, but ultimately the dirt is in the details."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hitchcock Mystery -","review":"\\"Stage Fright\\" is about an English Drama student (Jane Wyman) and her father who decide to help a young man accused of killing the husband of a beautiful self-centered actress/singer (Marlene Dietrich). The actress flits from man to man and is really not that interested in any man for any length of time. Michael Wilding plays a detective. This is a movie directed by Alfred Hitchcock, who does his usual cameo role, and also has a bit part for his daughter, Patricia.Overall the plot is satisfying and it is wonderful to watch Marlene and all her costume changes as she emotes guilty looks and egotistic airs."},{"rating":"2","title":"....Poor Jane..!..4 stars..!","review":"...Jane tells a production story about how Marlene \\"mothered\\" over her during the making of this film..Jane did'nt know Marlene was a notorious bi-sexual, and was hitting on her..!..Jane is one of two stars buried in nuns habits..The other being phony Loretta Young who had Clark Gable's baby in 1935..Ah, Hollywood"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy this version.","review":"This is a wonderful Hitchcock movie, one of my favorites; but this is a bad transfer with strangely jerky motion.

It was perfect. In fact, it had only one flaw, and that no doubt was the government's doing, not Hitchcock's. A Porter tune and I think a signature tune of Dietrich's and sung by her in this flick (\\"The Laziest Gal In Town\\") goes \\"It's not cause I wouldn't. It's not cause I shouldn't. And lord knows it's not cause I couldn't. It's simply because I'm the laziest gal in town.\\" Well, the censors had their way and changed the line to \\"And you know I couldn't.\\" Bleah!

And the whole thing was fascinating and great!

We all know that Dietrich is not the best actress in the world(more an extraordinary personality)but here, she is cold as ever.

Stage Fright follows this trend, like The 39 Steps and The Lady Vanishes, and it is a great little movie. I saw it years ago and I cannot remember much about the plot, but I was definately frozen to the screen in delight. I remember the inimitable Marlene Dietrich launching into many ridiculous but entertaining songs. I remember another priceless performance from Alistair Sim. I remember a great romantic scene between Jane Wyman and Michael Wilding in a cab. I remember most of all the climactic scene, where Jane Wyman talks to her fiancee, with enormous brown eyes (notwithstanding the film's being shot in black and white) while shadows stripe accross her face.

However, we are also shown how valuable the original crew still is and how their tactics are more action-oriented than Picard's generation.I really expected Shatner to portray Kirk as being the man who single-handedly takes over the world as a weaker Picard looks on.

What came to my attention is that a 'Seldon Institute of Psychohistory' was mentioned and that's a quote from Asimov's Foundation Series. The book remain unfinished, which means Shatner wants sequel to seel good. Asimov never done that, never so openly.

I've read all of the other Shatner Trek novels and loved each one. He blends action, suspense and a great plot into a hell of a story. The little false ending before throwing in the cliffhanger was masterful. I'm just worried that William Shatner might write Kirk off in the next one. I mean, if anybody could kill James T.

It fills in the history of the parallel universe after the events of TOS \\"Mirror, Mirror\\" and describes how the mirror Spok influenced the history of the mirror universe and what happened to the mirror James T. Kirk. (Hint: Remember the \\"T\\" in James T. Kirk stands for \\"Tiberius\\"). It makes an interesting bridge between TOS episode and the resurrection of the mirror universe thirty or so years later on Deep Space 9. The only problem I have is the \\"Cliff Hanger\\" ending. It make you want the next book in the series to come out tomorrow. But then again, isn't that what good marketing is all about?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great read!! Don't miss this one!! Go James T. !!","review":"I was thoroughly engrossed from page one. The mirror universe characters were believable and you actually were made to care about their fate - a direct departure from the \\"Mirror, Mirror\\" TV episode or the \\"Dark Mirror\\" STNG book. I was a little disappointed that the events of \\"Dark Mirror\\" were not alluded to at all. In the scope of Star Trek continuity, that should have been addressed. Be that as it may, that does not detract from the quality of this book or lessen my anticipation for \\"Dark Victory\\". Move over Jean Luc - the master of the last minute save is still alive and kicking! God bless. The future is His."},{"rating":"2","title":"A real page-turner!","review":"While I agree with some of the other comments, that some of the characters are under-developed, this book is still a fascinating read. As for Kirk's ego-trip (not Shatner's), it seems perfectly in keeping with his character as we know it. I can't wait to read the sequel!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best Book I have ever read!!!","review":"Spectre by William Shatner is the best book I have ever read. It is a great book for any Star Trek fan. It ties Picard and Kirk in together very well. I even liked how the story involved Scotty, McCoy, and Spock. I also liked how it tied the mirror universe in. I highly recommend this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book!!!! ...Can't wait for the sequel!","review":"I must admit, when I saw Return on the shelf of my local Walden Books, I said: \\"Of course Shatner wouldn't let Kirk die,\\" but man am I glad he (Shatner) didn't. This latest of three in a series leaves you in a suspenseful cliffhanger. If you have not seen the original series, or have no idea about the Mirror Universe, watch the series. I personally love this book. My only question is: \\" What is the name of the sequel?\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Another bone of contention for continuity fans.","review":"Did the editors happen to read \\"Dark Mirror\\" by Diane Duane before approving this book? \\"Dark Mirror\\" was much more consistent with the history and predictions concerning the alternate universe. This is another Shatner ego fest (does he really think real life women find him as irresistible as his fictional alter ego?)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Too much continuity","review":"This is a continuity laden book, where we get at least fifteen episode references per page. Couple this with a wordy writing style, and you have a book that is really difficult to slog through. The further I got, the more I wanted to cringe. James T. Kirk riding to the rescue of the Federation yet again. Enough of the ego trip, Bill! Get over yourself! If you like a Trek-fest of nothing but name-dropping and recaps of your favorite episodes, you'll enjoy this, but I was actually hoping for a story.

She is a great match for Kirk and I hope to see them get married in the nex book. Now as all books there is one thing that is wrong. In this case it is the ending. . . or should I say no ending?!?!?!

I've also read,\\"Avenger\\" and now,\\"Spectre\\" and I've really enjoyed reading them. I like seeing Capt.Kirk back in action with his old friends and the TNG crew and the slick way the movies and old episodes are tied in to the books. I liked this book because of the old episode tie in where Capt. Kirk's good intentions didn't get good results and he has to see and deal with what has happened because of it.

Kirk alive and in action for a long time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Shatner continues to amaze and entertain!","review":"I have been a fan of Mr. Shatner's writing since he wrote the \\"Tek Wars\\" series.

I loved this book, and can't wait to get my hands on the next!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes! Shatner's Best Trek Novel!","review":"This is my absolute favorite in Shatner's Trek series. \\"Spectre\\" is the first book in what would become the \\"Mirror Universe\\" Trilogy. You see the return of Tiberius and Spock's mirror-self from the TOS episode \\"Mirror, Mirror\\".What makes this book so interesting is that you find out what has happened in the mirror universe after Kirk and his crew left. And let's just say that things have taken a turn for the worse. Tiberius has a partner, none other than Picard's mirror self. Kirk discovers again that his worst enemy is in fact himself.

Now that his name was on the books, it was passed to a not-so-good writer and a not-so-good artist. Accepting the slight drop in quality, I enjoyed Bindings, Reckonings, and Summonings... but THIS one was incredibly bad. The story takes random senseless turns, and while attempting to be incredibly deep it weaves a senseless truthless tale with no rhyme or reason to it. Such highlights include the English boy traveling to America where he finds these horrible American stereotypes speaking slang with every word, badly, and making dumb puns about rapping. Overall it's a stab at the depth of Gaiman that sees only the wild weirdness without understanding the rules of the game, and at times making mundane human wisdom seem smarter than that of all the worlds of fantasy.

The bride and groom come from a Romeo and Juliet-like background, as two feuding races come together only for the young couple. But Q has an agenda of his own, simultaneously romancing Lwaxanna - to her daughter Deanna's absolute horror - and stirring up doubts and fears between the bride and the groom. How can Picard take control of what is threatening to become complete chaos on his ship?Really a fun read. The author has great understanding of the crew of the Enterprise's characters.

That said, the performances by John DeLancie and Majel Barrett were very well done, earning back a star on my rating. I really recommend getting the book instead. You just miss too much here."},{"rating":"2","title":"A greatly satisfying book.","review":"Time and time again, Peter David proves himself to be the best of all Star Trek writers. This book is extremely well-handled in the hands of Peter David. The scenes are believeable and well executed, the dialouge is humourous and the plot is well-organized. Peter David is one of the few authours who is able to focus on the relationships between his characters rather than on bits of inane technobabble-- this is the mark of a very good writer.

Peter David is my favourite ST writer, and I love all his books, especially 'Imzadi'. I think that and Q-in-law should definately have been made into ST:TNG episodes. My favourite part of the book was when Lwaxana was chasing Q through the ship, because it's great to see him get what he deserves for once! There were also some good scenes with Riker and Troi. The other story, about the Tizarin wedding was also well written, and the two stories balanced each other well. Buy it if you like your Star Trek books with humour, Q, and lots of character interaction. Don't buy it if you hate Q, you like 'serious' Star Trek and if you like reading about the Enterprise getting blown up. I would recommend this book to anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"An experiment in controlled chaos.","review":"This book has a very deserved reputation for being one of the funniest pieces of Star Trek fiction ever written. Viewers and readers all know what Lwanana Troi is like, and they all know what Q is like, so just imagine the consequences if the two should meet. Star Trek writers have to be very careful when using Q, and Peter David is a master of it. I actually laughed out loud several times while reading this book, and the ending gives a whole new meaning to the saying \\"Hell hath no fury like a woman scorned.\\" Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best TNG novel EVER","review":"I fell in love with this book the day it came out...everyone that I know that likes TNG borrows it, I am surprised it still holds together, its so worn out. I have always liked the Q and Lwaxana characters, so pitting the two of them together, using the Enterprise as their playground was just priceless. I just could not put the book down, it was that good...the only novel I finished the same day I started on. And when the Audio version came out? I scooped that thing up. Having John DeLancie and Majel Barrett, the actors that portary the main characters was a smart move ... it made the audio book as good as the print version!Hey, Worf! Over here! I'll buy a ticket! (you must read/hear to figure out the joke)"},{"rating":"2","title":"One heck of a story...","review":"I do not consider myself a novel reader, but Q-In-Law was one that I couldn't put down for a moment. I always wondered what would happen if 'love' and Q was ever combined, and Peter David gave me the answer. Of course I couldn't expect Q to behave, as he never does anyway. So Q's position on love would be a hard topic to write about. But the genius (David) took the idea and ran. That is only one of the reasons why I give the book a 10. The end was absolutely hilarious, and I have never seen Lwaxana better. So not only is this book a combination of an impossible dream, a complete joke, and a Q spoof, it's a woman's ego booster!! 3 cheers for Lwaxana, that's showing Q!! Same to Peter David, who has outdone himself. Bravo!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Nice Read For Valentine's Day","review":"The entire time, this story felt like something I should have been reading on Valentine's Day. The whole book is about love and Q's \\"romance\\" with Deanna's mother. Overall, it is a good story but it gets silly when Lwaxana Troi takes revenge on Q for breaking her heart. I could picture it all in my head and it was pretty laughable more than threatening to read her beating Q up with Q powers of her own. A lot of the characters from TNG are missing or with little mention.

The book had a brief summarization of each topic (ex. shooting in snow) at the beginning of each chapter, and then was followed by his photographs to assumingly show examples of the topic. It seemed more like a collection of his photographs than anything for me. I didn't find that there was enough information in the book for helping to correct exposure issues. The photos were great, just really lacked instruction. I ordered several books of this type at one time, and highly recommend The Better Photo Guide to Digital Photography by Jim Miotke-loaded with helpful instruction and tips, including lessons. Also Bryan Peterson's Understanding Exposure. These two have helped tremendously vs.Perfect Exposure by Zuckerman."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very simple, instructive book.","review":"I own a couple of books from the Jim Series and this is the most simple to understand. The technique for metering the subjects and always take the control of the exposure is easy to follow.

Since I read this book when I metering the subject is very easy and I'm always in control of the exposure. Now I can understand the technique of the zone scale and always put the subject in the correct zone to have a Perfect Exposure."},{"rating":"2","title":"A book necessary for improving your mental state.","review":"This book allows you to determine your own ability to develope and utilize your mental capabilities.

But the story gets way out of hand as the plot skips across several alternate universes, leading to a completely overblown finale. A lowpoint is a particularly nasty, and more than a little misogynist, story about an alternate Beverly Crusher.It's also a bit long at over four hundred pages."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good","review":"Being a fan of the infamous Q, I picked up this book because it was obvious from the title that he was involved. The time track thing was a little hard to follow-but I was able to sort it out after the second time through. It was quite entertaining and the ending shows a-gasp-human side to Q. I thoroughly enjoy Peter David's writing and eagerly await more."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Well-Done Scientific Thriller!","review":"Q-Squared presents an old science-fiction premise of alternate universes and gives it new twists. It's a novel that every Star Trek fan must read, because every possibility the crew could have turned erupts upon itself. Watching the crew encountering their opposites was a realistically fabricated plot. And the climax with the chaos caused by all three (plus more) timelines overlapping into one is a well-written and intense event.Q-Squared is an excellent science-fiction story, with technical details that we love, mixed with a suspenseful storyline."},{"rating":"2","title":"Trelane returns!","review":"Greetings and felectations!

It has an incredibly imaginative plot, and does a good job building suspense. Each time line is handled well, and when they all \\"de-rail\\" Peter David must be given credit for seamlessly blending their qualities. This book is good even if you don't like Star Trek thanks to a somewhat universal plot, but it would help if you've seen The Next Generation because some elements relate to details of the character's pasts and things that happened in an episode. I reccomend it if you like Star Trek or science fiction in general."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Novel among books","review":"while at first confusing, this book quickly becomes engrossing and then addictive. I have read it countless times and it never grows old. The plotting develops in a way I can only describe as exquisite, with each minor subplot becoming more major as the book goes on and eventually coming together in a massive unravelling that just works. The mood and atmosphere and menace of the book is dead on and the muliple climaxes throughout it definitely make it a must-read. there's no going back to the other ST novels after this one; it's the ultimate."},{"rating":"2","title":"THE BEST STAR TREK TNG BOOK IN THE SERIES","review":"Man do I ever LOVE this book. I've read over 40 Star Trek TNG books and this one is my personal favorite.

Be Sure to get Imzadi by Peter David as well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Typical David: Trash","review":"Peter David is a master at making people love his books through extensive use of sex and soap opera gimmicks. He also screws up the characterizations of virtually all of the characters. If you're looking for good Sci-Fi, read Dune by Frank Herbert. If you're looking for good Trek, read Federation by Judith and Garfield Reeves-Stevens."},{"rating":"1","title":"Trek this is NOT","review":"Peter A David must be the most overrated ST:TNG novelist writing today. If you didn't know he made his living penning comic books, you could probably tell from his dialogue in this book: OTT, garish and full of EMPHASIS! in all the wrong places. Worse, he seems prepared to jettison characterisation, believability, and Trek history just to indulge in some smartarse humour. Halfway through reading this infuriating novel I wanted to seek out the author and tell him to STOP SMIRKING. I really can't imagine any true Trek fan reading this book without a growing sense of horror and disgust. Best to imagine it -- and David's own New Frontier series, which resembles nothing so much as McHale's Navy In Space -- never happened."},{"rating":"1","title":"Q-Squared...BAD","review":"Not a good book at all...It was a good story, but it was just too strung out. There were a couple of good parts in the book...and the part that we find out that Q is babysitting someone, please!Then all the cursing doesn't make it any better. I don't think that they needed curse words to amplify what they were saying. I say the cursing alone is a good reason not to read this book.Peter David wrote a good story...but not a good book for reading.I would not recommend this book to anyone!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Bob Sargent Shines","review":"I just met Bob at the Audobon Hummingbird Festival near Memphis.

This album was the last major release of Hall and Oates before they virtually dropped completely out of the American music scene, and it also was the best of the releases up to that date . This release finds H & O doing sounds like they had never toyed with before this album , and they did it quite well . The CD was definitely in tune with the timeframe, and it rocks ! The era of this CD was when the new wave invasion was at it's max, and diversity in sound was at an all time high , and Hall & Oates stayed with the styles of the period on this one, and did it better than most, I can only assume it is because this talented duo has the skills and talent they had already been sharpening with all the hits and releases that came before this masterpiece !

I was even more eager to order the CD after I saw that this was a \\"ReMastered\\" CD. However, the sound quality isn't exactly crisp and clear. Portions of the CD sound muffled. I only paid $7.97 so I should have expected this. This album is truly a H&O classic and the additional remixes of \\"Out of Touch\\", \\"Dance on Your Knees\\", and \\"Possession Obsession\\" add a nice touch to close out this disc. However, the sound quality, though not horrible, was not what I hoped for."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible transference from book to audiobook","review":"I bought this so that I could listen to the novel while driving in the car. I was horrified to find that I had paid almost ten dollars for only half a book! How could you leave out most of the novel? No wonder people find that the story is somehow \\"incomplete\\". It IS incomplete. You should not pass off a novel as the original book. It does injustice to the author and the reader.SHAME ON YOU!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Not Your Cookie-Cutter Trek","review":"I read this book years ago and remember it as my favorite. Why? Because it dares to challenge the monolithic personalities that most other books portray of our Starfleet heroes. In addition, the deceptive simplicity of the weird fuzzy aliens (who travel by moving space instead of themselves, but still hunt for food like so-called \\"lower\\" animals) is fabulously juxtaposed with the weird fuzzy circus troupe being ferried aboard the Enterprise. The McIntyre's plot appears juvenile on first inspection and initially evokes as much head-scratching as Kirk and crew upon their First Contact with the aliens. But ultimately, the alien encounter was masterful, as was the metaphoric circus aboard ship. It all results in a story striated with meanings deeper than the simple (and always obvious) parables that shallower Trek readers and viewers come to expect."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great service!","review":"I was very pleased by the the quickness in which I recieved my book.

I just wish that this kind of thing was rare in Star Trek books...it seems that everytime a (hate to sound sexist) female writes a Star Trek novel, it gets lost in stupid fantasies with stupid and overblown alien creatures...When you write for Star Trek you have to understand that we as humans can relate to aliens that have a basic human shape or idea...no stupid raptor doctors or flying horses...it is like a bad TOS episode...just silly.don't read this book it is really not as good as the back of it makes it sound."},{"rating":"1","title":"books like these kill the Star Trek legend bit by bit","review":"This might seem sexist, but why do so many female Star Trek authors create female lead characters that don't make sense in the Star Trek universe? What's wrong with career-minded female officers as female leads?I guess the circus characters are meant to be comic relief. However, they don't mesh very well with the Star Fleet characters. The main female character is something of a nitwit. Of course everything works out OK as we couldn't have any kind of tradegy so early in the careers of the classic Star Trek characters."},{"rating":"1","title":"BORING","review":"BORING, BORING, BORING! This book was just plain boring! The storyline made no sense! Besides, what was the point of the circus????? Over three-fourths of the book was about a dumb woman and an alien circus! That is just plain stupid, especially since it has nothing to do with circuses and since circuses abuse animals!

His Vulcan science officer, Mr Spock, considers Kirk imperetious; the ship chief engineer thinks him an inexprienced young hotshot; his chief medical officer hasn't bothered to show up yet; and the new helmsman would rather be somewhere else.

Buddhists are portrayed as hypocritical idol worshipers, and sadly this couldn't be farther from the truth. Buddhists do not *worship* anything, rather, we pay homage. If you come across a Buddhist with hands clasped together in front of a statue of Gotama, rest assured we are not worshiping him. We are remembering his loving-kindness (Metta) and paying homage to his great teachings, also known as the Dharma.Due to Ron's preconceived notions of other faiths and lack of truth within the book, I give this a 1 star. To those who are educated about the worlds faiths, this book only serves to make Ron look like a fool, but to those who are uneducated, this will only confuse."},{"rating":"2","title":"Informative, but a bit repetitive and lacked some details","review":"This book did touch on many religions, giving me much more insight than I previously had, but the authors should have given more details on Mormonism and Jehovah's Witness, like they did with eastern religions and Freemasonry. There are several instances where the exact same thing is written/quoted in multiple chapters, but I guess this was needed to get their points across, especially if you were not going to read the book from cover to cover.

The book is very informative, although you simply cannot say everything about all those religions in a book that size, so it is just an overview. It's written for the average joe and therefore is very easy to understand. One thing to note, however, is that the authors are debaters, and are sometimes prone to bashing once their arguments are made. For example, in the section about Roman Catholics it says: \\"If this is what the Catholic Church teaches, and it is, then let us be glad that in 1517...[the reformation happened]\\" (pg. 228, secion in []'s has been summarized).

Please....","review":"The only thing Ed Decker and his ilk are world-renowned for is distorting the facts and providing highly skewed information on any faith other than their own brand of fundamentalist/evangelical Christianity. Yes, of course, Mr. Decker is entitled to his very narrow opinion that the wisdom of the world faiths constitutes \\"false teachings\\", however, in the interests of both his own credibility and peaceful understanding between the peoples of the world, if he is going to write books like this he has an obligation to at least write respectfully and accurately. All too often, though, the goal is not the promotion of understanding but the desire to drive a wedge between the \\"right-us\\" and the \\"wrong-them\\". I suppose all this is amply demonstrated by the title of the book itself, which is hardly a shining beacon of tolerance and consideration. Oh well.

Its research is so sloppy that it should be titled \\"False Facts and Fast Teachings\\" because that's all this book does. If this kind of book reinforces your beliefs or tickles your fancy than it is a great book full of opinion and \\"Christian?\\" or more specifically Evangelical Christian teachings.

For example, they clam that \\"In the cathedral of Quito, the largest Catholic Church in Equador, you will see in the center of the alter a crucifix with Marry hanging on the cross, shedding her blood for your sins. Mary, not Jesus!\\"It's not mary who is being crucified there, lol, in place of christ. the statue is of a woman saint, who was crucified later for her faith in christ. ...This kind of error.

However, if truly interested in the actual neuroscience this book claims to teach, search for a more nonfictional and scientific work. Pithy factual information of such molecules of emotion is obstructed with unnecessary personal dramatics and stories loosely tied to the intended subject matter.

Candace Pert's other books are pretty good. This book came highly recommended, but I don't know why. The information in this book that has anything to do with the title could be coverd in 40 or 50 pages and that information is good. However, the other 250 pages of the book is a autobiography. I am not one that likes or wishes to read autobiographies nor do I like authors mislabeling the titles of their books to get me to purchase them just to read 300 pages of selfagrandizing material trying to find the information that is realted to the title.The information in this book has been covered in many other books and better.

I know other women PhD'ers so I was not put off by Dr. Pert's style of writing and confidence. My husband, on the other hand was and put it down after only a few pages. I was amazed and enthralled by her story and life. I think the book would appeal to women more than men. She was after all, at the forefront of the women's movement and what courage it must have taken to enter into the field of science research--the big boy domain!

I needed to find a way to release the trauma from the body/mind and energy healing was the key. Energy healing has been more effective than anything I have done. I am grateful to Dr. Pert and her studies and have now looked into energy healing because of her work and it is the most powerful healing that I have ever done in all the past 10 years. Reiki, Thought Field Therapy and SHEN are wonderful healers and ways to release the trauma from the body/mind. Even massage and other types of body work have been remarkable at releasing the stored trauma.

Unfortuately, she spends most of the book talking about her life and little about the science or even the theories of emotion. Her science appears very narrow and limited to her work and she misses in educating the reader about the role of simpler things such as steroids and the immune system.She does not address her own basic motivations for life, which appears to be to get recognition for her work (the recognition is much more important than the quality or nature of the work).

Never again will I watch the evening national news or Lockart on C-Span the same way."},{"rating":"1","title":"Interesting insider info, but lacking in coherent structure","review":"This is a history book. Do not kid yourself into thinking that it has value as political science. Kurtz presents an entire string of some interesting (plus some disturbing) anecdotes about modern relations between the press and the White House, but he culminates in no particular point. It just ends up being a timeline of the president and the press bickering . . . for 300+ pages! The lack of guiding thesis leaves the reader with an impression of sorts, but any point that Kurtz tried to make ends up being too elusive and intangible. The best use I can see for this book is to inform a hermit as to what went on in presidential politics from 92-98, other than that, its just more gossip."},{"rating":"1","title":"Flash: Press Gives Good Reviews to Book About Press!","review":"Poorly written.

It contained very little new information for anyone who watches C-Span. It is a mish mash of stories loosely organized without any analysis.

Definitely not worth a whole book but a 5 page analysis piece."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent book all-around","review":"Kurtz offers a meticuously-researched and well-written book that peers inside the filthy confines of the Clinton White House and convincingly documents what we knew was going on all the time. For wanna-be spin doctors, this is your book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Problems with sensationalism","review":"My main concern with this book is how it uses allegations and stories which emerged in the press and later proved untrue. Particularly with regards to the Lewinsky case, a lot of the remarks and speculations which Kurtz uses to draw a picture of how the story unfolded, have proved to be exactly that: speculations. I find it unsettling that someone apparantly so serious as Kurtz has not done some proper sourcechecking. Furthermore, I found the structure of the book to be very chaotic. Also, when I read a book about the development of spin, I don't want a book that reads \\"like a thriller\\", if I did, I would buy a thriller. For people with interest in the subject of the relationship between the press and the presidency, I strongly recommend Warp Speed by Tom Rosenstiel and Bill Kovach. It will give a nice counterweight to Spin Cycle, and furthermore put some of Kurtz's ideas into perspective."},{"rating":"2","title":"Spin Cycle shows the trivialisation of the presidency by the","review":"Spin Cycle is a must read for anyone interested in the White house \\"communications\\" office and the tailoring of political \\"news\\" for the press and those who follow politics. Although the book is ostensibly about the \\"spin\\" the White House puts on their own press releasses, statements, and news stories affecting the president perhaps its most valuable service is to show how the Clinton White House has trivialised the presidency by operating in thier campaign mode.

Regardless of language, they were easy to read, easy to follow, funny, witty and all the while exciting.I was more than pleasantly surprised to find this book on a shelf, then more than a little disappointed once I began to read it. I always thought that the Hergé estate was very careful about licencing the name and image of Tintin so as to protect and preserve the artist's creation; not in this case.

However, like many of you, I couldn't help but be curious as to how the author would represent him in a novel format (as he was reported to have been a good friend of Herge). The answer...in an extremely boring and uninteresting manner. The dialogue goes nowhere, the topics of discussion are plain dull and the characters are unlikable.

The point that Georges Remi (or Herge, Tintin's inventor) tried to make is that Tintin should never be put into the 'new world', or a world of sex and cultural realism. The reason people gave this book good reviews is quite simply because they are not familiar with Tintin's image.

As someone who has worked in pro audio for 17 years and taught it at the University level for about 12 years, I have examined every available textbook out there and keep coming back to this one. Yes, it's too in-depth for someone trying to learn on their own without the benefit of a teacher. Yes, it may be a little too oversimplified for someone who already knows the ins and outs of microphone theory, wave propagation, studio acoustics, etc. And yes, there are a few sections that don't really belong in this book. But for guided study of the science of audio recording, you will not find a more comprehensive text anywhere."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good beginners guide","review":"If you are new to recording then this book will help you.

The vast majority of the photos in the book seem to be poor scans of images found in decor magazines of the decade. These are environments that need to be \\"appreciated\\" and it doesn't really come through as something that can be done with these desaturated, grainy photos. The book seems to be more about the author's comments than the interior photos, corny \\"period\\" graphic design and text take up well over half the book.My biggest complaint is that this period of design is more than funny by itself, but James Lileks easily takes that away with his painfully obvious and rough commentary. Where wit and writing could have had a place, he replaces it with some a kind of slander that almost seems to stem from a personal agenda.

This is by far the worst I've read so far. It has numerous plot holes and it makes the characters like Captian Picard and Data appear inept and foolish. Coucelor Troy is portrayed as a quasi-visionary. To top it all off, the story appears to be contrived and obnoxiously politically motivated, (unlike some of its more subtle predecessors).It portrays an advanced civilization of humans that fled Earth and bases its beliefs on quote \\"the Christian Bible\\" to the exclusion of any other beliefs and that has banned all fiction. It's very 'un-Star Trek' to blatantly single out one religion and attack it so viciously."},{"rating":"1","title":"Seriously flawed.","review":"Which is a shame, because the basic idea had potential: Star Trek meets Ray Bradbury's \\"Fahrenheit 451\\". And the writing wasn't completely hopeless; as the story progressed, I did find myself caring what happened next, and moved by the fate of the characters. But there were too many flaws for a high rating; the entire subplot of Deanna Troi's visions/hallucinations was superfluous and pointless, and the concept that the planetary culture that the Enterprise was in conflict with could have provided as much of a challenge as they did required too much supension of disbelief for my taste.Not the worst Star Trek book I've ever read by a long shot, but definitely on the weak end of the scale."},{"rating":"2","title":"A brilliant anti-censorship tale in ST:TNG style.","review":"Some of the best Star Trek episodes were usually 20th century social commentary thinly disguised as 23rd/24th century science fiction.

When Jesus failed to return during the life time of his followers (as Mark said he would), Matthew and Luke had to rewrite the stories to make them fit their own troubled times. Helms also presents a strong and fascinating case that the author of Luke was a woman. \\"Who Wrote The Gospels\\" is readable, clear, and enlightening."},{"rating":"1","title":"Book intro's idea of even and odd numbers","review":"We loved Murphy's \\"Henry the Fourth\\", but we didn't particularly like this book. While the artwork is delightful, the rhymes are clumsy, and worse, the premise just is not very interesting. At least, finding out what happened to the cow's utter-mittens did not engage my kids (almost 3 and 5).On the plus side, the book did give my almost 5 y.o. and myself a place to start talking about even and odd. And the way that the artist showed the pairs of mittens and the missing mitten in outline made it easy to point out what the story was taking about.But I'd give this book a pass unless you are desparate to find an edutainment introduction to even/odd numbers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pilot Needle Point 0.5mm refills","review":"I love this 0.5mm refill for my Dr. Grip pen.

Lynn was fortunate enough to be at \\"the right place at the right time\\", when the family therapy pioneers started its development. Lynn was never totally in and neither totally out. This provides her with a unique lens to write about the development of the therapy with families. She entered through the backdoor and slowly established herself as one of the best poetic writers of the family therapy literature. It is a personal account, seasoned with the historical struggles of a new discipline."},{"rating":"2","title":"If you don't like Digimon, why are you reading the manga?","review":"I love Digimon.

While some of the ideas have merit, the book is overly prescriptive without enough regard for the nature of the underlying organization and its environment. Woe to the government executive who thinks he or she can manage a \\"centerless\\" agency, with its scary implications for accountability to Congress, the head of the agency, and citizens. Perhaps this review is more a reflection on how the book was used by BAH, but the lack of caution I saw in its application leads me to advise readers to be careful about applying its guidance. I would hazard a guess that similar dangers confront private sector consumers of this book's prescriptions."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing but Fluff","review":"This book was written solely as a money-maker, rather than a real information and strategy provider. As a consultant, I bought this book to provide background on corporate organizational issues. Much to my dismay, the book offered me nothing--and I mean NOTHING! The book is simply a recap of what any consultant should already know about corporate strategies, business models and organizational development. I believe that these writers began to think that they were in the wrong business, and therefore, tried to earn a little extra money by putting down what they already knew rather than researching, analyzing and providing something that is truly innovative and transforming.

The work is based on one new, yet fundamental insight--when Schrodinger developed the wave equation for the electron he made a broad assumption for the fourth boundary condition required to solve the problem. Randell Mills replaced this broad assumption with an exact boundary condition derived from Maxwell's Equations. As a result, the Mills solution is far more exact than the traditional quantum model. This new model enabled Mills to develop profound insights into the fundamental structure of matter, and ultimately enabled him to apply Einstein's field equations to the structure of the electron and derive its gravitational mass. In ten to twenty years, historians will look back at the 1990's as yet another example of how the established physics community was unable to recognize a brilliant, discontinuous innovation in understanding nature."},{"rating":"1","title":"Would be laughable","review":"This hodgepodge of pseudoscience would be laughable, were it not for the fact that the author is attempting to extract investment money from the gullible."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't work.","review":"I bought and read this book with great hope - I believe in magic, I believe in energy work, I believe in miracles.

Clinton successfully debunks the myth of the Old South, yet fails to put in its place a convincing and thorough discussion of the real lives of these women.Clinton, in refuting the popular myth of the \\"southern belle,\\" does put up her own model for the southern lady. But this model depends little on how these women actually lived and what they really though; rather she consistently insists on painting women in an overly noble and (still) idealized way.If you are looking for a good history and examination of women during the American Civil War, try \\"Mothers of Invention\\" by Drew Gilpin Faust. It is immensely more satisfying than Clinton's depiction."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I purchased this book at the Gettysburg NPS bookstore and was very anxious to begin reading it...however after only a few pages the author's bias and dislike of all things southern was glaring obvious to me. I am certainly not looking to have the past whitewashed, but I feel like the title is very misleading. After 97 pages of reading, I have gathered very little information about women and planation life.... The only recommendation I can give this book is that it is peppered with some great photographs."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Connecticut Yankee's views on Southern Life","review":"I picked up this book and a bookstore in Georgia, thinking it to be a historical book about the South. I was apalled by her insensitivity to the Southern plantation owner. Though there were cruel plantation owners, there were also the genuinly kind people, who cared for the slaves. My ancestors owned slaves, but the majority of them stayed with our family after the war. I wish that the author would pay more attention to the what the southerners had to go through after the war, with homes burned, and families starved, instead of calling it all \\"southern myth\\" which has be made into movies and books and over publicized with Scarlett O'Hara and Mammy to stir the hearts of America's people. For the \\"southern myth\\" is no myth at all; it is the true story of thousands of Americans who fought for what they believed in their hearts as right, the protection of their values and way of life."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing, one sided, laced with Author's own prejudice","review":"As a lover and avid reader of history I was VERY disappointed in this book. I found Ms. Clintons opinions and interpretations of the south and southern plantation era one sided, selective, and laced with her own prejudices. Yes, it was a horrible, horrible time for the blacks, whites and our country. Slavery will always be Americas greatest shame, a flaw that most of us struggle to understand and rectify in our human frailty each day, but if Ms. Clinton is to be believed, there was but a handful of humane, caring \\"white\\" people residing in the south during this time! Which is Not true! If Ms. Clinton considers herself a true historian (which I do not) and writer of history I feel it is her duty to tell All sides honestly, with equal amounts of pros and cons, and without her own bias slants. To my fellow history buffs I can not reccoment this book and I can honestly say that I will never read another of Ms. Clintons books in the future."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just what I was lookin for","review":"This thing is sturdy and clean looking.

It's an R&B CD first of all that breaks the mood you probably are trying to set. It is clear that Boney is abandoning the fans who appreciated him for his wonderful smooth jazz-sax talent. Instead, he appears to want to drop back to being a background instrumentalist for many no-name but perhaps up and coming R&B singers. That's noble I guess, but it's something I'm not interested in. For those mourning the loss of true Boney James music, try Marion Meadows instead, you'll love him."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice bass and excellent vocal contributions adds wonderful variety to Boney's sax'ing","review":"Got this CD after reading a review of how it was a bit daring for Boney and offered a nice variety of bass and vocal contributions.

This is still unmistakable Boney, but the funky bass play, wonderful vocals on 'Shine\\" and \\"Gonna Get It\\", along with some jazz bar-like piano, and even a bit of delightful harmonica does make for a great smooth collection.

The title alone is a good philosophy regarding those things in our lives that are best left alone. We need to move on from the negative. Anytime I find myself with something which will take up too much of my time and cause too much pain, I think back to this song.All in all, its a good CD: Not every song on it in fact is that good, but the two I just mentioned are soo good, that they compensate for all the rest."},{"rating":"2","title":"Vintage Dayne Revisited","review":"Arista is doing its best to squeeze more money out of Taylor Dayne. Through this album, they re-release all of her hits from the 1980's, although a Greatest Hits album is already in stores. The songs are gems. Such hits as Tell It To MY heart and I'll Be Your Shelter help remind the public of Dayne's intense range and ability to sing. However, one can observe Dayne's equally strong ability to created new and innovative material that she penned in her 1998 release, Naked WIthout You. This album is good, yes, but her Greatest Hits album is much better due to the fact that it contains ALL her hits during her ARista years.

So far, nearly every Gardner book I've read contains these words over and over again. The Killing Hour, for example, contains the phrase(s) 11 times (I searched on my Kindle) and Gone repeats the phrase(s) 17 times. In fact, the words are used with such frequency as to almost spoil my reading experience. I will be knee-deep in the swamps with Kimberly and Mac, only to be yanked back to the here and now by those five words. The moment is lost.

The relationship between Kimberly and Mac is much more fulfilling, although I still would have liked to see some more depth and growth there. The suspense, however, was pretty intense and interesting and kept me wrapped in the story, even if the romances were rather weak. I also hated all the power-plays between the FBI, Marines, etc. which just detracted from the story and were without purpose, and the killer became pretty obvious near the end.

Not to mention unreal.I personally don't give a hoot about the wealthy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another excellent thriller by Linda Fairstein","review":"Once again Linda Fairstein has produced an exciting thriller. The story kept me guessing until the end and this book was hard to put down."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good who dunnit","review":"I try to avoid women authors, I don't give a damn what they are wearing or where they are eating. Having said that, I enjoy the O'Shaughnessey books and books by J. Jance.Cold Hit was recommended to me and I enjoyed it so much that I had to read the other two novels, Final Jeopardy and Likely to Die. I enjoyed them too.She didn't need to mention the Clintons in Cold Hit."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very poor audio book","review":"I listened to Cold Hit from the abridged commercial audiobook, so I won't comment on the writing style, as what I heard may not be representative of the original written prose. I strongly suggest, though, that if you want to learn this story you read the book rather than listening to the tape. Without a doubt, this is the most poorly produced/edited commercial audio book I've listened to. The reader is bad enough, starting out on the first tape at such a rapid pace that I repeatedly had to rewind and replay portions to make out what she had said. The editing makes things even worse. Throughout the story there is background noise discernable, very noticeable session breaks, and there are multiple instances when the reader flubbed a sentence, stopped, and started reading again back at the beginning of the sentence, and the entire error is left on the tape with no effort made to edit it out."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too complex to be entertaining.","review":"Too many characters. It soon becomes more of a chore than a pleasure. Left it half way."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't like it.","review":"Didn't like this too much. A lot of the book was filler -- conversations that weren't really related to the plot at all, or interesting in and of themselves, but clearly intended to fill up space so she could turn the book in to her publisher. I had a hard time finishing it because what action there was in the book ended about halfway through. These are things that her editor should have made her correct because they are very obvious. So to that extent I blame the editor.Also, I found the author's description on the dust cover as \\"America's foremost prosecutor of crimes of sexual assault and domestic violence\\" to be objectionable -- she runs the sexual assault bureau for a single city, which should be credentials enough. Mr. Fairstein, sometimes you are allowed to tell the publicity department, 'No.' This excessive tooting of your own horn makes you look bad.I don't think I will buy this author's books again in hardcover."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fall Of Terrok Nor...What A Book!","review":"I have been a Star Trek fan for a very long time. When I read this book I was taken right away with the story. The Authors of the book captured each character's personalities and mannerism's very well in my opinion. I liked that there were several different mysteries happening at once and that they they were somehow all connected to one big puzzle. This would be for any fan of Star Trek who enjoys reading the novels. I would recommend this book to all! I Hope that Books Two and Three are just as excellent as this one was!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent","review":"Well, a great story, with some minor faults. The whole things about 'red' orbs and the second celestial temple is cool, but when I read through the other books I find that yet again, an alternate timeline story involving the destruction of the Federation and most of the known galaxy, just like Spectre. Personally, I am sick of this type of things, and I am sick of these multi-book stories, which is all that I have been seeing lately. Does anybody else feel like this? But, the story is really good, accurate, detailed, thrilling. If you enjoy DS9, buy this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Outstanding!","review":"I, normally don't read any DS9 books but I read this and was pleasently surprised.

I've read worse, but not many. Scott O'Dell has wrote many really good books, but this is not one of them. It is really hard to be interested in Sing Down the Moon.

I thought it was sad because my ancestors were the one that had to suffer the hard times through the Long walk. The Soldiers were the one that had no repect for the Navajos. They were the one that would shoot any one that would stop, just because an eldery person had to stop to take a break or a Navajo lady was about to have a baby.I think if some of the Soldiers ever regret what they did to the Navajo's. Even thought they may have just rode the horses along side of the Navajo's that were walking for more then 300 miles. To different places and showing them to they people at Santa Fe. Kit Carson was a mean and hateful guy to the Navajo'sthat is all i have to say about the Long Walk.I hope that it never happen agian, and that the Navajo's fought for us to keep this wonderful and beautful place full of adventure."},{"rating":"2","title":"A review for Sing down the Moon","review":"Sing down the moon was not such a bad book.I mean Sing down the Moon is like a rollercoastersome times it's good and some times it's not.but it does take a good Auther to write a rollercoasterbook.

Ok back to the book.The good parts are when theres alot of action. the bad parts arewhen it's dull.I would want to tell you the bad parts and the good partsbut i don't want to spoil a really good book.

So until i see you by by."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sing Down the Moon literature group review","review":"We would give this book a two star because it had some exciting parts but too much description on the not as important parts, which made it a little boring.This book tells us about a 14 year-old navaho girl.

I have never heard of mesquite growing around here or aspen in Canyon de Chelly or of the pueblo people eating dog meat and...... the owl a GOOD OMEN? I don't think so!!!! Any one from this area that has any knowledge of the Navajo culture knows that OWLS ARE NOT GOOD OMENS!!! I am reading this book with my class and am so frustrated by the fact that such a good author would be so negligent. The other students don't seem to notice the problems that I have with the book, except of course the Navajo students. I was happy to see the reviews from children who agree with what I was thinking. I am an adult student."},{"rating":"1","title":"Loosely tied together plot","review":"I read this book in about 1 hour and found that it was just a series of events loosely tied together in attempt to form a decent story.Don't get me wrong Scott o'Dell worked marvels in Island of the Blue Dolphins,but he seriously failed with this one.If you love Scott O' Dell books and have a hour or two just to kill,check it out,if not leave this book on the shelf."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tina's Reveiw...enjoy!************~~~~","review":"I didn't like this book because the characters name were funny.

No creativity involved at all on this disc, the guy that orchestrates this effort is part its record company, so its has the ability to get a lot of music from different resources and mix it in different songs.

The \\"singer\\" (who also plays bass) has no range and hiccups way too much (like every single song). Basic three chord stuff, great guitar playing - very much like cliff gallop (gene vincents blue caps). Prety good songs, nothing mind blowing but pretty solid. This band should take their own advice and \\"ride that rocket\\"....back to the studio and try again...With a little more effort the next one could be a great record."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best biography of Kerouac out there","review":"Memory Babe is probably the most complete Jack Kerouac biography published. Filled to the brim with information about Kerouac and his writing, it also gives the sense that the author had an affinity for Kerouac. This book also differs in that it does not consist of blind hero worship of Kerouac, but reports Kerouac's faults, failures, and in sad fashion, his alcoholism. Even more satisfying is the fact that Nicosia concedes that even Kerouac wrote bad novels once in a while. The only faults in this book are a lack of photos, and occasional continuity screwups, while not severe are annoying. Overall, I repeat my asertion that Memory Babe is the best Jack Kerouac biography published, even better than Ann Charter's biography, Kerouac."},{"rating":"2","title":"Unbelievable!","review":"I have read alot of biographies on Kerouac, but this one doesnt even compare to the rest.

That Disney World had the first operating 911 emergency system? That a vast network of self-operating gates and levees keep the water table intact? The infrastructure of this massive community is a testament to the most forward-thinking engineering in - no pun intended - the world.

The idea being that when you are in this trance, you pass out and escape any pain the body may receive. Oh how I wished for this ability while the work was inflicted on me. The hapless stringing together of sections of the video game with a narration attempts to make this into a fluid work. It fails in amazing fashion. The video game roots are so obvious it is painful to listen too. The main charter dies over and over (much like you must during the game) and is set back on a boring path that makes no sense whatsoever. Even poor Q seems bored by the whole thing. Avoid."},{"rating":"2","title":"wonderful training pants, eco-friendly, and organic","review":"I bought six pairs of these when I started training my son at 18mths. Now at 26 months, he wants to still wear these over his character underpants. They are super soft and have no nasty chemicals in the material, just pure 100% egyptian cotton. They are not waterproof but do hold a fair amount. I thought that was a bonus as my son trained quicker because he knew when he was about to or started to pee. Super soft, and does nor shrink up in washer and dryer. Great for sensitive skined toddlers. Fair trade and made in Egypt."},{"rating":"1","title":"For a DVD, very mediocre","review":"Mediocre transfer. Have seen VHS tapes quality and broadcast tv that were much better.

Very disappointing since the sceneries were beautiful shots."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent book","review":"Good book all round, the story of how Picard took command of the Stargazer when the Captain was killed, and the first officer was incapacitated. This is not the standard TNG book, the only character we know is Picard, everyone else is fiction. The crew of the Stargazer were protrayed well, as were the crew on the Valiant. The plot is good, but, like another reviewer, the enemy troubled me slightly. They were not gone into in any detail, they were simply the Nuyyad, we never even saw a member of the species, only a slight physical description from one of the characters. Another thing is the planet Magnia. It is located outside the Galactic Barrier, I thought that was impossible? Wasn't there a great void between galaxies containing absolutely nothing, how can there be a planet? But, there's very little else to complain about. The story was solid, as were the characters. A good read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Picard's early adventures","review":"This latest book was one of the better Trek books to come out recently.

Another good job by Michael Jan Friedman!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good book, decent Kindle transfer","review":"This book should be labeled book zero of the Stargazer series. It tells the tale of how Picard came to be in command at such a young age, and what happened to set the stage for the continuing adventures in the rest of the Stargazer books. I enjoyed it immensely.

Unfortunately, this one was the worst. The main section of the novel (which dealt with Picard taking command of the Stargazer) was by far the worst section. Picard didn't ring true, not even as a young Picard.The first and last sections (which dealt with the original crew of the Valiant) were the most interesting.

The end of chapter questions are lame. The sample test is lame.The biggest problem however is that the Server+ exam objectives are listed only on the inside front cover and in appendix B. To find information on a single exam objectives, you might have to read up to 7 chapters. There is not even an electronic copy of the book on the CD-ROM which comes with the book. An electronic copy of the book would at least make finding information on a particular topic easier (search). In fact the CD-ROM only has a little over 2MB of information (sample test) on it.

I could not find any of the objectives listed in any of the chapters. So I had no idea what Exam area I was focusing on.I had to download the Server+ Objective PDF file and print it off so I could figure out where I was in this book.

I was told it was a medicine my mother took when she was pregnant. I've never been in a financial situation that allowed for cosmetic fixes of any kind, so every couple years I give these products a try, only to be disappointed. I suppose it would work on teeth that are stained, but for those of us with naturally off-colored teeth, they will not whiten. So short of winning the lottery or marrying the Donald I'll have to live with the teeth I was born with. Actually I'd rather live with these teeth than marry the Donald."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for touchups but....","review":"...thats about it. I have tried crest whitening strips which did work more effectively but if you dont have patience and/or perfectly straight teeth, its a pain to work with. With these whitening pens, its easy to apply but it does take longer (about 3x longer) to get the same results as you would get with strips. My suggestion is get professional whitening treatment, then use these pens for touchups. Remember teeth are like white shirts. Anything you throw at it, will stain it so having these pens handy help alot. I keep a pen in my car for when im out, or after lunch break at work, ill rinse my mouth and use this pen. If you decide to go this route, i suggest getting their toothpast or some sort of whitening pre-rinse mouthwash.

Of course, the question of which films to include is a personal one but the choices here are excellent, with films from every era and corner of the world represented. I particularly appreciate the lack of a rating system of stars (or bones, in this series) which can tend to be short-sighted and over-simplified. Instead the author delves as deeply as he can given the space with wonderful insight.I also liked the inclusion of films worth watching highlighted here rather than an exhaustive list of films to avoid. For the record,there were a few swipes at several films that have over-rated reputationshere in the States and these warnings are truly beneficial.This is a marvelous, intelligent book - a \\"must\\" for anyone who loves world cinema and takes film seriously.Curtis Stotlar"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great Introduction to World Cinema","review":"I've had this book since 1999 when it first came out and I love it. I knew nothing about world cinema when I first got it, and now I'm obsessed.I agree with the other reviewers which say it is not a thourough examination of World Cinema, but like the author says in the introduction \\"Videohound's World Cinema isn't meant to be a definitive list of foreign titles, but the movies described here are a good place to jump in if you're new to international cinema.\\"The thing that I love about this book is Wilhelm's reviews: Totally subjective.

Okay, lets say that you are not familiar to any of the directors in the book and you read a review and check out the film and you love what you see. You will probably want to check out other pieces of work by this same director. Unfortunately the Videohound World Cinema book does not list all of the works of cool foreign directors, even of films made outside the U.S. For example, David Cronenberg has a wimpy film list in the back of the book with a mere three films. The book has completely overlooked great campy Italian horror directors like Lucio Fulci. What I am saying is that the book is far from complete and needs a whole lot of additions. If I were you, find another source book and avoid this hound dog."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not very good","review":"Out of the sixty-five tricks listed in the book, I found about ten that were worth attempting. I like to do tricks on a spur of the moment with a borrowed deck, and this book added very little to my repetoire. There are too many tricks which need a setup or require you to mark cards beforehand. Also, alot of the tricks have too many steps (your audience will get bored, just as mine did). My final say is don't buy this book, it's not worth it; get a good sleight-of-hand video instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a disappointment!","review":"I really wanted to like this book and tried chapter after chapter to offer the benefit of the doubt. But, as pages turned, I found more contradictory statements and words of advice than anything else. For example, the authors teach that managers should not use the word \\"you\\" when confronting fellow workers. Then, on page 85, the authors suggest handling \\"snake\\" personalities by saying: \\"I know what YOU did.\\" Similarly, the authors state that managers should shift their verbage from \\"what do you want\\" to \\"why do you want it?\\" However, on page 84, the authors suggest asking difficult colleagues the question of \\"what is it you would like me to do?\\" To end positively, I will say that the book offers very good examples of well-recognized office behaviors. The text would be so much more effective if the authors had consisently reinforced their positions on subjects, which they suggest in chapter five as a professional behavior we all should practice religiously."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not quite what I was wanting","review":"I found that a lot about this book just missed the mark with me.

Who elso would be able to write so well about Quark than Mr. Shimmerman, and this book gives us insights into the relationships between Quark, Rom, and the other characters on Deep Space Nine.This is well written in that not only is it driven by plot, but also by character and moral values. Write on, Mr. Shimmerman, write on!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The best DS9 story (not just novel) ever told!","review":"In the 34TH RULE, Armin Shimermann and David George have crafted the finest DS9 story ever told in any medium, be it television or novels. This is the novel that, even if you hate DS9, you will love to read; it works at a frantic pace and deals with deep matters in a rational way. This is the ultimate Quark story; here Quark isn't the bumbling fool he's been portrayed as for so long on the series, instead we see him as a character with real dramatic potential who is put into the middle of an explosive situation and has to find a way to survive and overcome. Simultaneously, the novel returns us to the political maneuverings on Bajor which have fallen by the wayside on the series and deal with the political climate adroitly. If you haven't bought this book yet, you'd be well-served if you did, and you'll thank me for it later."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Star Trek novel I've read!","review":"This was a great Star Trek novel, besides Kira being pretty mean to Quark, and the few mispellings and grammer problems near the end of the book.

Each time I would get part way into it and still feel the same, and put it aside. I will read through just about ANYTHING, so I am suprised at myself for this attitude. Quark is seen as insufferable and weak, which maybe a reflection of his true inner self, but it made for tedious reading. I saw a lack of what makes the Frengi character so exciting, his internal and external debate between the \\"humane\\" and Frengi perspectives of the world. I found not only the Quark character insufferable, but the writing style wordy and insipid.

You can play this CD 24/7 and never get tired of it. It has a touch of praise, worship, and unrelenting down to the core heart and soul searching and delivery. This CD has definitely got my attention and has helped me in my journey.

I taught a couple of songs to my youth choir such as higher and their remake of Call him up but when I heard the struggle is over, they went to a new level. That song itself makes you want to buy the album but the album is filled with such anointing from the beginning until the end, you will not be dissappointed. Another good powerful ballad is have mercy. You will not be dissappointed so make this one of your purchases and proclaim that the struggle is over."},{"rating":"2","title":"Efficient and effective","review":"This is a good primer for the group's biggest and best hits.If you like airy, well crafted, mostly upbeat group singing this is the place to go.

Contacted Amazon on the 28th of April, was told to wait till the 1st of May, GUESS WHAT? YOU GUESSED IT NO CD. Put in a claim with Amazon on the 1st of MAY. GUESS WHAT-YOU GUESSED IT- NO RESPONSE.

It was written from a 15-year-old's perspective, but felt unreal (and I remember being a 15 year old girl pretty well). Her world seems to consist solely of one-dimensional, good/bad parents, step-parents, and neighbors. Her character contradicts herself and is pretty unlikeable. I just really couldn't really get behind the plot, which is full of improbable dramas. The issues of race and sex feel forced, (again) unrealistic, and simplistic.The book just wasn't written well and wasn't even mildly entertaining. Also, there's some silly graphic designing with upside-down text (don't turn the book around, it's just repetition) and a really, really, really bad choice of font."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lies, Lies, and more Lies","review":"Great book!

To say the authors are redundant would be an understatement. Yet somehow they manage to be repetitive but unclear all at the same time. You can read a chapter three times and still not know what something means or the point they're trying to make. It's written more like a review of literature than a text book. There are no case studies, just research and findings that other, more adequate, professionals have come up with. This is the most boring textbook I own. I hate that I bought it."},{"rating":"1","title":"One of the least helpful textbooks I have ever read.","review":"The author of this text obviously does not care about his readership and their cognitive ability to be able to glean any useful information from his text. I have had to re-read sentences up to eight times before I can guess at his meaning, and I still am not sure why the author chose to be as redundant and dull as possible. I imagine if you are buying this book, it is required. I suggest you borrow or buy it used for as cheap as possible, as I assume you will never want to touch it- much less READ it ever again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very convincing and enjoyable read","review":"Usually I wouldn't accept blatant wholesale slaughter of major characters under the blanket excuse of \\"it all happened in an alternate universe\\", however, Daffyd ab Hugh has carried this device through artfully and with care. The slaughter portrayed IS horrific and the invaders are thoroughly convincing. I enjoyed Daffyd ab Hugh's choice of Quark and Odo as the primary investigators of his mystery, he characterised their interaction well, adding to, and not detracting from what we have been shown on the television show. The plot itself was cleverly thought out and executed. Although I would hesitate to call it the best Star Trek novel I have ever read, it was certainly one of the best I have read lately."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is just one great book!","review":"LIke I said.

Although badly written, this book features a tight, creative plot that would have made a fine episode (albeit a very bloody one). I expect sloppy prose in a Trek novel, but it's important for the author to get the dialogue right, and Dafydd ab Hugh succeeds for the most part. The central characters are Quark and Odo; their interaction is handled well. At this point in the series, Odo's nature and backstory had not been developed very well, so ab Hugh has him doing some things that don't quite jibe with the way he would be developed later, but that's forgivable. In particular, the climax requires him to withstand some impossibly harsh environmental conditions. All in all, though, it's a good read if you like Trek."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved it","review":"I can't put this book down. Basically \\"K. Wyat\\" took the words right out of my mouth.

Atleast when he sang with Harris it made the songs better. Conner would have been better of just hiring and unknown to do the harmonies and dueting because Harris does not add anything to these songs and she has gotten boring all she does now is sing on other peoples songs. He does even know how to write decent melodies and the last song he stole from ode to joy because he cant write good music on his own.

I find it exceptionally sad that I am being restricted from listening to music that I have legally purchased as I see fit to listen to it. I believe it's absolutely necessary to review this cd poorly, because it is the physical cd that is purchased, not the music; if it were the music that were purchased, then I would not be restricted from listening to it as I wish.

I ordered it because I read about the song \\"I am nowhere, and it's now\\" and listened to it on youtube. Oberst's voice really struck me as raw and exposed and vulnerable, while the harmonies by the ethereal EmmyLou Harris weaved in and out of the song seemlessly...That, coupled with the review that I read on this site, sealed the deal for me and I had to order it. Since receiving this CD, it has not left my CD player...it's terrific and I'm loving it. The stories that Oberst tells lend themselves perfectly to the vulnerability in his voice and the music is clever and wonderful.

I chuckled to the sarcasm, nodded to the irony, frowned to the despair, made fist to the crushing percusion and finally grinned for I had walked the road to joy.The lyrical punch is evident on all the tracks, in fact, its the foundation of this album.

And to think of all the ignorant, immature, simple-minded, whiny little imbeciles who listen to this music! I mean I remember the days when music was good, like when guitarist Jimmy Hendrix, or guitarist Dimebag Darrel was still alive, but yet people who have bad taste in music don't want to listen to music that actually requires alittle bit of something called TALENT to play...I mean this type of music really makes you wonder...I was left with such an anger towards it....good gosh, good music has gone out the window."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing but Pretentious, Over Ambitious Nonsense","review":"Everywhere I turn I see Conor Oberst's face these days.

I've tried multiple times to listen to this guy drone on and on about how awful the government is, and how much life sucks, but I just can't get into it. He is completely untalented, completely uninteresting, and completely overrated. His music is nothing groundbreaking, nothing earth shattering, and he sure as anything ain't no \\"rock and roll genius.\\" He is a whiny little kid with an acoustic guitar and a big head. if you want to hear good songwriting listen to Yes, listen to Cash, listen to Coldplay even.

If you're thinking about buying this CD, please listed to the preview first. If I had, I wouldn't have bought it. I must say, this CD really blows, and Conor Oberst couldn't carry a tune in a bucket. It's really funny, too, how all the negative reviews on Amazon are deemed not helpful,even when they are right on the money. When people are determined to throw their money away, they don't want to hear any dissenting opinions.

If you're thinking of buying this disk DO NOT. The reviews are all hype. The music is downright maudlin and repetitive country and blues music. Nothing wrong with country or blues music per se.

The amount of praise is most shocking, for unlike most of his singing-songwriting peers, Bright Eyes has virtually no talent at singing nor songwriting. His lyrics generally consist of a lyrical content you would expect to find in a 3rd graders poetry book, and the singing is unimaginative and outright dull. I am still yet to hear anything by Bright Eyes that sounds remotely interesting. Not only should you not buy this album, you should also keep anyone you know from this garbage."},{"rating":"1","title":"No comparison to other great songwriters, ie Ryan Adams","review":"I bought both of these albums after all of the hype surrounding them and I am thoroughly disappointed with both efforts. He continuously sounds off key, his song structure is an unpleasant listening experience and he is overly hyped as a new Dylan when in fact, he doesn't even compare to Ryan Adams or other great, young musicians in this category.

The album's best moment is probably the single \\"Lua\\", but even that one's pretty lame. \\"We might die from medication but we sure killed all the pain\\"? Deep, man.Self-pity and self-absorption have rarely made for interesting art, and no musings about \\"What history gave modern man / A telephone to talk to strangers / Machine guns and a camera lens\\" will change that."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Album","review":"I don't know what that guy Sweet Cheeks \\"watty420\\" (The Seas O' Cheese) is talking about but i think this is a really good album. And no i didnt see it on MTV so i dont know WTF he is talking about, this guy has the nerve to rag on this band and discusses its ties to MTV yet praises MTV bands like Korn and AFI which in my opinion eats large chode.

Digital Ash is also Good."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sets the bar high for 2005 releases","review":"With lyrics more poetic you're accustomed to, this album is sure to put Bright Eyes on center stage.

Neither should they, necessarily.B) The CD is good, regardless of \\"talent.\\" In cases like these, where the artists' topics are so personal, no one has to have crazy talents.

And that, my friend, is a loss of some magnitude."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bright Eyes at their best","review":"Bright Eyes has been my favorite band for around a year now. I own all of their full-length albums and have heard most of their unreleased songs. Despite all that I've heard and own, though, I am absolutely infatuated with I'm Wide Awake, It's Morning.Conor Oberst's first full effort in the (dare I say it?) alternative country realm feels (and sounds) like home for him, and he is welcomed by two of the genre's most famous current performers. Jim James (My Morning Jacket) lends his voice on \\"At the Bottom of Everything,\\" while the incredibly talented Emmylou Harris harmonizes on three songs.From the beginning, a story of a plane crash, to the end, where Oberst finally gives the fans what they want and what the album's tension has built up to, it's a masterpiece.I'm going to avoid going into details about individual songs, as this album needs to be experienced in its entirety in order to really appreciate it. Five out of five stars, and perhaps the album of the year."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible!!","review":"Am I not the only person who finds this one of the absolute worst albums that I have ever heard.

It was all just hype."},{"rating":"1","title":"He sings like a sheep: BAAAAAAAAAAAAA!!!!! BAAAAAAAAAAA!!!!!","review":"My take: Well, for one thing I thought the track \\"When the president talks to god...\\" was cool, but it isn't found here. As for the rest? It's the kind of stuff you hear from an aspiring guy sitting on a stool at a coffeehouse at night, trying hard to command attention. I am not impressed with these tracks. You know you're in for a pretentious trip upon (taking sip) listening to the opening (take sip, make sure microphone picks it up clearly). He sings, or rather bleats, like a sheep on every song.

The back of the video states that it contains the \\"resources that will increase your chances of success\\".

Now, 23 years later, I'm out on my own. I was at my mom-in-law's house, and I noticed she had a copy of this new GH cookbook. She bought an extra copy for me.I absolutely love my All New Good Housekeeping Cook Book. The recipes are very diverse. I love the hints from the professionals, scattered throughout the book.

First, the pros: The large cutter is a nice size, makes pretty cookies, and has an easy release. However, I had problems with the inner cutters. Maybe mine is defective, but they don't cut all the way through the cookie. My inner cutouts end up looking raggedy. They are also difficult to use because the cookie dough gets stuck inside the cutters and I have to dig it out with a butter knife. Plus they're difficult to keep clean as the dough gets caught in the cracks.What I've been doing is cutting out the main cookie, then using the smaller cutters separately. It's tricky because I don't always get it lined up right and if I'm too close to the edge the cookie might break.I really do like the large cutter and the plunger works well. I've been using it to make homemade Oreos if nothing else.

Well, during my research, I learned that the Mekong is the runabout that was assigned to Deep Space 9 after the Ganges was destroyed.

Even on a low heat, the lining of one of mine separated from the bag, partially tore, and has come out.REVISION: Now having used these for nearly 5 months - they are falling apart! The PUL lining is virtually gone in both of my bags, despite line drying them.

I can recommend this DVD for all accordionplayers that need an extra push or are stucked with there accordionplaying"},{"rating":"1","title":"Flat Sequel","review":"As someone who loved \\"Imzadi\\" (and who even re-read it after reading this to confirm how good it is), I was quite disappointed with this almost lifeless novel. The character insights that PAD usually provides in even his lighter Trek books are missing, as is (for the first time ever!) his sense of humor. We get a bland Worf, a bland Deanna, and a rather bland Sela (Yar's Romulan child). Only the two Rikers - Will and his photocopy Tom - have nay personality at all. What's more, the plots behind the characters are dull, a letdown following the cosmic adventures PAD gave us in \\"Imzadi,\\" \\"Q-Squared\\" and even \\"The Captain's Daughter.\\"I don't what happened to Peter. I would say he's been edited to death in this novel. But regardless of why this is so bland, it is just not worth buying. Find it a library instead, and don't expect anything more than an average episode of Trek."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very enjoyable","review":"As all of David's works, this is a very enjoyable book. The characterization was very believable and the plot pays good homage the original Imzadi. I preferred the original because of its time travel element. But this sequel is certainly worth a read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Willing to forget it","review":"If Mr. David would re-read Imzadi and try again, I'd be quite willing to forget this mess. It's only redeeming point is ending the Worf-Troi relationship. Obviously, Star Trek is not great literature, but if you don't have a good story, you don't have much of anything. I suggest re-reading Imazadi and filling in the blanks for yourself."},{"rating":"1","title":"I agree with Marianne. . . .","review":"I have really enjoyed reading Peter David's books since I discovered him with the NG novel \\"Stike Zone\\". I was estatic when Imzadi came out, because it showed that someone was paying attention to past histories and believed that Star Trek should have romance - not just fleeting trysts evey week. Imzadi was magical, and left one feeling hopeful. Imzadi II fell far short in attempting to bring validity to a relationship between Worf and Troi. Just as the series did, however, the book failed to convince the reader that such a relationship was possible, much less believable. In light of revelations about Insurrection, the ending was abrupt, tackless, disappointing, and very unsatisfying. I had to read Imzadi right afterward, just to remind myself of the impact Troi and Riker's history together has on the characters and the readers, and now I am waiting very impatiently for the movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"What was he thinking?","review":"First of all, I LOVED Imzadi. I've read it several times. So, naturally I thought I would like Imzadi II. WRONG. You have to give the book some credit for being written by Peter David, but that's about as far as it will go. I had to throw the book across the room several times. All Imzadi fans need to read this book, but think of it as an obligatory commitment to finish the duo. And do NOT expect it to hold a candle to Imzadi."},{"rating":"1","title":"DISAPPOINTING","review":"I was very excited to read this book. Part one was great, and I love Peter David as an author. But, this book, I felt, was so boring. Only 20% of the book was good. It was one of the worst Star Trek - The Next Generation books I have ever read. I cannot reccommend it to anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worthy Read","review":"I enjoyed reading Imzadi 2. It was a typical Peter David book...he brings the series right into the book. It was different than the first Imzadi, but his purpose is different. In this book, he describes a missing chapter in the relationship between Troi and Worf. The only failing of the book is how it starts at a normal pace and then feels like toward the end Peter David decided to hurry up and finish it. Other than that, I enjoyed it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing like the first one","review":"I couldn't put \\"Imzadi\\" down and have read it again a few times. Imzadi is no doubt my favorite Star Trek TNG book. I picked up Imzadi II expecting to get more of the same good story line and character development as the first book. Unfortunately, it couldn't be farther from it. I didn't even bother reading it in whole. About half way I gave up thinking that this will get better, and I skipped to the ending, which was even worse. It's so bad, I even got angry at it. The character's were TRUE to their role on the TV series, but it was TOO much. For example, we know from the TV series that Picard says \\"Make it so.\\" and does a little action with his hand when he says it. Imagine a book where every MAIN plot for the character is the same phrase and movement. The story tries to build..then you end up with a \\"Make it so\\"..each time. And the story line seems like it was thought up of in a day or less. Simply..no imagination."},{"rating":"1","title":"Once wasn't enough?","review":"Peter David is an overrated writer at the best of times, but Imzadi II is so indigestible a read, with an absurdly complicated plot, that it's a complete waste of time -- particularly given the lashings of his usual smarmy humour. Any true lover of Star Trek will simply avoid it."},{"rating":"1","title":"The first Imzadi was by far better","review":"I read Imzadi in one day, loving every bit of it. It was by far the best ST:TNG book I've read. And while Imzadi II captures the characters perfectly to their TV series portrayals.. the plot is disapointing, and the ending even more so. I found myself saying \\"What the heck?\\" and \\"You gotta be kidding me\\" at the ending. It was ridiculous and made Riker and Troi seem impulsive, indecisive, immature, selfish, when their relationship aboard the Enterprise (during the TV series) was much more secure and understood between them both than in this book. The ONLY part of the book I found thoughtful of the author was the part about Picard trying to get Will's \\"twin\\" back on the moral track by using a Dicken's book (which was actually a shape shifter..bad plot there). So 2 stars for the effort of trying to follow an amzing book, I would still read an Imzadi III in hopes it would live up to the first Imzadi."},{"rating":"2","title":"My thoughts on Imzadi II","review":"What can I say...Peter David can write, and write well. He wrote Imzadi II with as much conviction and passion as he did with the first. The twists just keep coming in the book. Bringing in characters we know so well was wonderful. I suggest reading the first Imzadi to start, so you can get a feel of this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Surnames of Scotland : Their Origin, Meaning and History","review":"Very good book for surnames.

The logic is not so good for a new comer to this field, for instance, the first chapter put the quantum mechanics in a several pages, which will discourage from enjoying the full flavor the later chapters.

But it is definitely a good reference book for those who enjoy the exercise of deriving equations."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book really sucks!","review":"This book is the worst book on stat. thermodynamics I have read.

But other than that if you have have enough money to buy a ferrari or a 2 million dollar house, or every toy out there, designer things, THEN DO IT! Just do it within your means!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Lots of fluff","review":"I can't believe how many people are drooling over this book. It was full of fluff - spend wisely, hyper-consumption is not the route to take blahblahblah. It was the same basic idea reiterated over and over. As others have said, save yourself the $10 for this book and you're on your way to becoming a millionaire!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I was robbed!","review":"I was robbed! - and don't mean by Amazon. I bought this book in hopes of gaining some insight on how the wealthy became so. The book has one exhaustingly repetitive point. That point is that if you never buy anything nice for yourself, you could be \\"rich\\" [standard set by author] while only flipping burgers and dipping fries. This makes sense, but I disagree with the good doctor's contention of wealth. Furthermore, if you followed the preachings of the book, you wouldn't buy it anyway... It would be a $... luxury you simply couldn't afford if you wanted to stay on track to a wealthy life."},{"rating":"1","title":"Choose occupation wisely","review":"People really miss the main point of this book, that being the part about choosing one's occupation wisely. Without the right occupation, no matter how much frugality one institutes in their life, a person will never be rich. Case closed.Making enough money and not spending it are the keys to becoming rich for someone who is not wealthy and does not come from a rich famuly.Most people will never be rich because they do not have the \\"right\\" occupation."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beats a dead horse","review":"This book has a great start but slowly plateaus of useful information. Would I have bought it and read the book if I knew this? Yes. Just beware, the book gets very stale and repetitive in the final third portion. The book is written concerning conclusions after demographic study of today's wealthy. CAUTION! This book is ALL about earning and saving $MONEY$. The two Ph.D.'s who write the book only provide the data which they were paid to collect for the corporations they were tasked to research for. They present the material in a matter of fact manner where accumulating wealth whatever the cost. I would be concerned about the relational health of their families. The book demonstrates the authors' lack of concern to life, health and family in this publication. These issues have no implied value to these authors.However; there are some nice lessons to be learned."},{"rating":"2","title":"Being in the Mindset of Becoming Wealthy","review":"I enjoyed this book. I got it from my father in law who is a multi-millionaire and who has been dispensing advice to my husband. It inspired me to hear stories of people who became wealthy by hard work. It was revealing to read of their lifestyle choice. It was exactly what I was looking for.If you are looking to get strategies on how to make money overnight, this is NOT the book you're looking for. There are books out there on that topic. If you want to learn it the old way, the author will tell you it's the habits of the entrepreneurs that willl get you there."},{"rating":"1","title":"TOO LONG, good info","review":"This book had some good information on how to save money, but I felt that the concepts were somewhat stupid.

You're a millionaire, but one with an exceptionally dull life of excessive frugality."},{"rating":"1","title":"Preachy and wordy -- a waste of time","review":"This book is wordy and poorly written. It's really a short magazine article padded to make a book. The authors are preachy, and they say the same things over and over and over. Then, in case you didn't get their point the first 3 times, they give you an example or two. And, if that isn't bad enough, they give the impression that they don't really like the people they interviewed. The entire book is mean-spirited. I learned very little from this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the money or time to read it.","review":"This book is simply clever marketing of common sense money management. It could be reduced down to a couple of chapters. Basically all the advice and anecdotes boil down to is to live within or beneath your means, save a percentage of your income and invest it carefully. There are a few pearls of wisdom, but they are few and far between, and not worth the time it takes to read the book. There are much better books on money management that actually help you construct and realize a plan for your financial health."},{"rating":"1","title":"The most useless book I have ever read.","review":"The whole premise of this book is that if you don't spend any money you will be rich. Duh. You also won't enjoy life. The authors never really even say why you would want all this money that you can't spend. There is definitely one situation in which you should take the authors' suggestion: don't buy this book. If you want a good book on personal finance, get Eric Tyson's Personal Finance for Dummies."},{"rating":"1","title":"REPETITIVE and a terrible takeaway message","review":"This book takes what should be a New Yorker article and stretches it into an entire book.

Save yourself and pass this one up."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting stuff","review":"I have been listening to the version on CDs. I have found it quite interesting and I recommend it. The only drawback is that it seems a bit repetitious in some places--making the same points over again--but you can learn much from others mistakes if you take the recommendations to heart. Too many of us squander our resources just to impress others (or ourselves). If you are married, it is important to get your spouse to hear (or read) this book, as you must both be \\"on the same page\\" to make the principles it presents work."},{"rating":"1","title":"Logically flawed and banal.","review":"The basic premise of this book, that everyone wishes or shouldwish to accunulate wealth, is unexamined by the authors and ispatently false. The methodology is equally questionable. Surveys by questionaire,when the respondents are self-selected, are always suspect, although they do allow people so inclined to construct impressive tables for that quasi-statisical look. And don't I recall the impecunious Mr. Micawber teaching the young David Copperfield the same economic lesson as this book teaches: if you spend more than you make, you will go into debt, but if you spend less than you make, you will accunulate wealth? Of course Mr. Micawber didn't put an arbitrary figure on what wealth amounted to."},{"rating":"1","title":"Superficial, repetitive,simplistic","review":"There is no question that the book provides good advice to consumer oriented American society. But,it fails to deal with living choices, balancing the pleasure of luxury vs a large bank account. Life is short and self denial does not seem a satisfactory way to live it.The so called statistics are laughable. They remind me of numerous professional lectures in which the presenter thinks that a series of slides with a \\" laundry list \\" of data is effective education.Page after page of repitition does not make for good reading.The message here would have been easily delivered in one half the space.In short, the concept is laudable, but the research and the way it is delivered is a joke."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Millionaire Next Door should get a life.","review":"The book espouses a dull life of frugality and pinching pennies that is desirable only to those with no sense of enjoyment or fun. I am sick and tired of hearing a bunch of Scrooges pat themselves on the back as a result of this book. With a sound investment strategy, you can make money and still life the good life. The millionaire next door can keep driving his beat-up car and 12-year old clothes, the rest of us will enjoy life. After reading this book, ask yourself, would you wnat to live like the millionaire next door? Or would you like to enjoy life. The answer provides a new perspective on the Millionaire Next Door."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good info but too dry for me","review":"This book is just as advertised but very boring to me. I was amazed by many of the little factoids sprinkled throughout the book. However, I quickly lost interest and never could bring myself to finish it. I think the information is valuable but I had a hard time staying intterested once I decided that I did not accept the authors definition of wealth. I found \\"wealth\\" in the authors view, to be very stringent and constricting and it flew in the face of one truly enjoying life. But if you are interested in seeing into the mind of an owner of local pizza shops, who drives the same car he drove in 1972, then this is the book for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"BUY THE RICHEST MAN IN BABYLON INSTEAD","review":"If you want to become like the rich uncle of Donald Duck by the time you retire, then read this book. If you want some fun and balance into your life, read The Richest Man In Babylon instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"Common Sense to the Forefront!","review":"The basic premise after all the wash is done, is that those who are what the authors refer to as 'Prodigious Accumulators of Wealth (PAWs)' have figured out the difference between what they want and what they need; that they aren't sucked into the consumerism machine that the marketing hypnotists attempt to impose upon us; and that they understand that there's more than one way to get the things that they need, which often involves innovation, barter, and yes.... a little effort.A great read, one you should share with your children at the earliest opportunity."},{"rating":"1","title":"To sum up this book....","review":"This book is heavy with surveys and statistical information that all say the same thing...showing the world you have money does not mean you have money.

The Millionaire Next Door increases this great class divide with a contrived air of monetary principles. One is left to question the author's pomposity and sycophantic grandstanding for the affluent. To join the charmed circle one must; be tightfisted, avoid taxes, and possess a complete disregard for the less fortunate. These are among the many noble qualities recommended by our authors. Perhaps my interpretation was too literal, there may have been an underlying satire that I failed to interpret. Or, maybe I'm too sensitive to command such Machiavellian principles. Nevertheless, I found the book to be tacky and lacking in practicality. One should follow their dreams and stay true to their principles, and above all have compassion for the near-do-wells. Lest we all fall victim to the tsunami that results from greed and contempt."},{"rating":"2","title":"A pretty good, interesting read","review":"I enjoyed the book, but felt it dragged at times. It's true that some of the information imparted was well worth pondering; however,I would have liked to have gotten more in the way of \\"specifics\\".

What's the point if you cannot enjoy your wealth."},{"rating":"1","title":"Millionaire Next Door","review":"I had heard so much about this book that I read it with a lot of anticipation and I was really disappointed. The book is interesting and relatively informative about millionaires. However, it is more anecdotal than anything else. There are some statistics, charts and graphs, but there are no \\"real life examples\\". If you are looking for help, say, a \\"how to\\" or \\"guide to becoming a millionaire\\" this is not the book. The other thing that turned me off about the book is the author's writing style. At times I found it preachy and at other times condescending. There are much better books about money management, making money work for you and becoming financially secure."},{"rating":"1","title":"Every Chapter is the same","review":"You only have to read the 1st Chapter, because the rest of the book is the same. Don't spend any money and do not drive high priced cars"},{"rating":"1","title":"Useful advice, misleading conclusions","review":"The gist of this book is that you should spend less than you earn. If this is a lesson you need to learn, then you should read this book.However, the idea that this book may help you on the pathway to riches, probably not. It is a compilation of statistics on existing millionaires, but it does not mean that trying to fit their mold will lead you to becoming a millionaire.Most people would like the freedom provided by wealth. The prototypical millionaire from the book does not seem to reap many of the benefits from their wealth. They live like normal middle class Americans. They work hard. They are tightwads and proud of it. If that is your goal, then this is the book for you.For a dramatically different strategy I would consider The 4-Hour Workweek, by Timothy Ferriss. Work less, enjoy life more. Don't worry about becoming a millionaire."},{"rating":"2","title":"Your Neighbor with the Used Car is a Millionaire.

For instance, the automobile section makes no mention of hybrid vehicles, which I'm sure a lot of millionaires drive these days. This is because hybrids were not invented when this book first came out in 1996.This is still a great book though!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Enlightening book","review":"\\"The Millionaire Next Door\\" is a good book to read if you are trying to become more aware of your spending habits and trying to accumulate more wealth. I am a big fan of radio host, David Ramsey, and I decided to buy the book due to his recommendation. The especially interesting parts of the book were the sections on what your net worth should be and how self-made millionaires spend their money. Apparently, they live quite frugally and that's how they accumulate their wealth. I recommend the book. Some of the statistics got a bit boring, but overall, it's a helpful book.

They interviewed a bunch of millionaires to figure out how these people got rich. Visibly they came up with bunch of traits. You need a little bit of intelligence, a lot of hard work, and a lot of risk-taking. And they derived that, hey, taking risk is good for you if you want to become a millionaire. What these people forgot to do is to go take a look at the less visible cemetery -- in other words, bankrupt people, failures, people who went out of business -- and look at their traits. They would have discovered that some of the same traits are shared by these people, like hard work and risk taking. This tells me that the unique trait that the millionaires had in common was mostly luck.By Nassim Nicholas Taleb"},{"rating":"1","title":"I feel sorry for my dad who spent money on this book and the cost of shipping","review":"I seriously gave up on this book after 2 chapters and then skimmed the rest.

Although the studies are somewhat interesting the whole book seems to be a bunch of numbers that prove the same point in fifty thousand different ways. So, save your money. The authors do bring up a valid point when they say that most millionaires do not look and act the part of the \\"Hollywood millionaire,\\" but isn't that obvious? If you spend all of your income on expensive, frivolous, luxury items, of course you are not going to have enough left over to qualify as a millionaire. I guess the book is good to read if you are one of those people that are given everything from your parents. If you don't have a budget plan and are constantly buying the most expensive items, then maybe this book will \\"change your life.\\" However, I would hope that what is mentioned in the book is common sense to most people.

Which method do you think will make you rich? Basically, I live the way the authors suggest (frugal, but smart), but they tend to make you feel bad if you are not a business owner, laywer or accountant.I liked the book's language and the way it almost gives us hope we could all be millionaires one day.

It's simple premise \\"get rich by spending less than you make and then investing it wisely\\" may seem like common sense. But it's not nearly as common as it needs to be. It's NOT a book recommending being miserly. It is a book about not buying a bunch of junk that you don't really need, or even want, just because you think it's expected of someone \\"in your position\\". Don't let possessions own you.

For a chapter or two that might be an interesting theme, but this is almost the entirety of what the book has to say about \\"millionaires.\\" There's a few useful tidbits about how these millionaires actually manage to be thrifty, but nothing too groundbreaking.

After all, there is no need to spend hundreds of dollars in a watch or in shoes. However, there MUST be a balance in life. What is the point of having money if it is not to spend? Who needs lead a miserable life only to die with 5 million in net worth?I wish the authors would address this issue, or at least mention that there is a balance and this choice is beyond the scope of their book.

Of course, frugality is key. But whether or not you choose Timex over Rolex, or Buick over BMW is much less important than investing money wisely. And this book does not cover investment concepts like portfolio management and diversification. Furthermore, the reason many of the so-called wealthy are frugal, middle-of-the-road spenders is that their incomes are modest, five-figure salaries, and their net worth conists largely of stocks and other holdings. In other words, these individuals often don't have enough disposable income to be considered truly wealthy and spend voraciously.

Repetitive to the extreme, the authors go on and on and on and on...But I am glad I read this book.There is only one issue I wish was addressed. Being frugal and living below your means is good. After all, there is no need to spend hundreds of dollars in a watch or in shoes. However, there MUST be a balance in life. What is the point of having money if it is not to spend? Who needs lead a miserable life only to die with 5 million in net worth?I wish the authors would address this issue, or at least mention that there is a balance and this choice is beyond the scope of their book.

These are primarily living \\"below one's means,\\" developing thrifty savings habits, and instilling similar habits in one's children.Sadly, most people mistake high income for wealth -- the authors illustrate how frequently those making high incomes amass remarkably little wealth in savings and investments, while many making far less can be worth many times their annual salary (and therefore are less susceptible to financial hardship)! The difference is the way the two groups spend and save their money.Though short on actual steps to correcting poor financial habits, the book does a great job of illustrating the general path to wealth accumulation. Truly, this book should be recommended reading for everyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"save and save!!!!!","review":"it's a very good bbok about how to becoeme wealthy in a single lifetime by having a check on one's own needs and a lot of financial planning.must read for everybody who wants to become wealthy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your time on this one","review":"I bought this book because of its catchy title and it's track record as a long term bestseller. Unfortunately, it turned out to be one of the worse book I ever read! The only thing I find interesting in the book is the statistics on the financial state and the purchasing habits of the American public. Unfortunately, the authors' interpretation on the data are often, in my opinion, incorrect. If you look carefully, the text portion of the book often incorrectly interpretate data presented in the tables and different parts of the book often contradict. The main theme of the book is to never spend a dollar so you can save up a million dollars in your bank account. I personally don't see the appeal working hard all my life, never enjoy the money I earned, just to have 6 zeros in my bank account.

I would like to see a book that looks at wealthy people from every segment of society and every economic background. This book is written for middle to upper middle class white college educated people who perhaps have money problems. I strongly suspect the author has little use for any other kind of people hence the pejorative \\"economic dropout\\".

The part about weathly people driving junky old cars really was great fun.

Not that it is incredibly long, but the whole book could easily be summed up in less than 10 pages. It is very repetitive, and chalked full of filler, explaining the same thing over and over again.Here's my one sentence summary of the book:The typical millionaire owns their own business, is married, drives a used car, lives well below their means, and is very modest with their wealth.The whole point of the book is to explain that the typical millionaire does not live like Donald Trump.

What I found to be missing, and would have been farily easy to gather given all of the interviewing done, was some spending data. Granted, they talk about cars, clothes and watches, but what does the typical millionaire's budget look like. The book does indicate the majority of millionaires use a budget, so where are they spending what little money they spend. A couple of the wordy tables could have been replaced with some actual budgets and some budget statistics from the population of millionaires.

I hope that in Stanley's and Danko's next book they suggest how one should get started. Many people I know spend and borrow to support their lifestyles. They are stuck in the \\"Tradition Stall\\" of living life on the treadmill. They also suffer from the \\"Disbelief Stall\\" that they could ever be rich.

However, I really wanted to ask the tightwads in the examples \\"WHY?\\" they were so focused on net worth at the expense of everything else. Building security and/or wanting the option of retiring early are good goals, but what is the point of all the painful saving & thrift to accumulate money that these same traits will never allow them to enjoy? This is particularly interesting when the author later shows that leaving a big estate is self-defeating if your goal is to improve your descendants' lives.

But on the other it never really focuses on enjoyment of money. It seems that all these unlikely millionaires do is accumulate wealth to accumulate wealth. Is that the message being presented here? I'm all for wealth through practicality but the millionaires interviewed have worked all their lives and have millions to show for it but what else? Most disturbing quote in the entire book: \\"If your goal is to become financially secure, you'll likely attain it...But if your motive is to make money to spend money on the good life,...you're never going to make it.\\" What is their definition of the good life?

They basically repeated over and over to be frugal, save money, teach your kids how to be frugal and save money, and that was it. Plus they threw in many hard to read charts...."},{"rating":"2","title":"Insightful Information","review":"This book is must read for those who want to be a millionaire. I am 21 years old in college. I know this is a book generally for people who are over 30. But seriously if you're looking to read books to expand your financial literacy and get a better understanding how millionaires become millionaires. This is it. In the beginning it gets really slow because of all the research data they did.. But in the middle of the book, i laughed out loud reading this because this book was saying true stuff and i learned some of the important things of what it takes to become a millionaire.. Not only it talks about money.. It talks about the discipline, desire and what it takes to become a millionaire.. I give it a 4."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not much for the money.","review":"I thought the book would divulge some secrets that we normal people wouldn't know. The ideas expressed are mostly common sense things most of us already know. For example, don't buy new cars, only buy quality used vehicles since someone else has already suffered the depreciation. Some minor tips on how to save money, but they should have told us how to save $21.50 by not buying this book.

Only the extremes were emphasized. Like our society, are AAW's as numerous as the middle class?This book only tells us about PAW's and their friendless, miserly, unsociable, tunnel-visioned lives and their extravagant, wasteful, egomanic UAW counterparts! Surely there must be happy, reasonable, generous(to a fault), scrupulous, venturesome AAW's out there.For books like these, I imagine that we the AAW's, are too boring and are not good cannon fodder.Ironically, we are the ultimate supporters of any UAW's who end up on the dole or close to it, in their retirement years. After all, those PAW's won't help.

They don't question their black-and-white judgement. They don't ask: 'Isn't this person too maniacal about saving more and more and living like a bum?' They don't think, that the same behavior can be reasonable or unreasonable in different context. They criticize people, who make a lot of money, have large savings, but not as large as they \\"should\\". Almost nothing is said about different goals of different people and different ways to these goals. Authors seem to think that saving 20-40% of your income (no matter, large or small) is an end of itself.I recommend Gene Simmons' \\"Sex Money Kiss\\" instead of this book.

It is very interesting that according to the authors, most millionaires are actually very thrifty people, which is in part how they were able to accumulate their wealth. What better way is there to try to become wealthy than following the patterns of others who have already accomplished the same goal? I have this book all marked up and keep refering to it again and again over the years.

Yes this book does tell you about the lifestyles of those they studied. Yes, it is also presented in a statistical format (the authors are statisticians, not writers). Most of the millionaires interviewed had incomes around $100,000 per year. What I think the public wanted was a step by step book on how to get there earning $30,000 per year or less, like everyone else does. This book does not do it, all it does is give boring stats.

By the way, I am sure that Mr. Dell also follows the principles in this book. How else did he become the 9th richest person in the world? Certaintly not by spending everything he earned.

It is true that sound investing and saving is the key to success to become a millionaire. But many may aggre with me that what is the joy of being a millionaire if you life as a miser and doesn't spend a penny o it. As I read I somehow believed that sooner or later the authors would mention the rewards of one's frugality as they mention it. \\"Save the best for last\\" -- one may say, but how long should one wait, and save, to enjoy what they have accomplished with pain and sweat?

Both of these books are neigh timeless. These two books are the truest personal finance primers available.

Often after a point is made, scores and scores of charts, figures, and analysis will follow.

The total absence of any consideration of the role conventional forces would play makes it worse. The entire story is written as though the U.S. is a completely inept entity that has no experience in foreign matters whatsoever and that the only weapons ever used in the future will be nuclear, and done so without restraint and at the first provocation. The story reads like it was written by someone that not only has no personal knowledge of military tactics, but also by someone with very little understanding of current global events, recent history or cultures."},{"rating":"1","title":"I give up","review":"Sooner or later I will learn that bargain prices often coincide with sloppy work.

The creative team of Schönberg and Boublil suggested by these that they are not great dramaturgists. Instead they produce oversentimental ballads for the most inane places in a plot line.In this ballet, Schönberg has got rid of the words, and it sounds like he's written a two hour instrumental version of At The End Of The Day with some intervowen new themes.I can't really decide whether this is fine or not. I like some of Schönberg's style, but it could be that he's written the same score one too many times.

The completely unforseen twists and turns that Mr. Deaver takes the familiar characters Rhyme and Sachs on are well worth sticking around for. Another great read!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A big disappointment","review":"While this novel is a pretty good suspense thriller, it does not live up to the previous Lincoln Rhyme stories. Outside of the core, returning characters, the depictions were weak and somewhat one dimensional. The growing attachment between Starks & Rhyme was alluded to, but not sufficiently explored. While I am glad that Lincoln is back in a feature (as opposed to being relegated to the role of secondary character as he was in The Devil's Teardrop) I hope that future books acheive the high standard set by The Bone Collector and The Coffin Dancer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Deaver not at his best","review":"After having listened to my first Deaver Audio, The Devil's Teardrop, I expected the same quality, suspense and superb thrilling listening. Don't waste your money on this audio. The reader, Joe Mantegna did a miserable job of trying to create the character's Carolinian dialects. Simply awful. The story was hard to follow and I had to listen to the first two tapes three times to get the characters straight. The ending is the biggest disappointment of all - no real thrill here. This was an average, run of the mill book, with no new creativity in the mystery genre. Think twice before buying this audio book."},{"rating":"2","title":"More great Deaver and Rhyme","review":"This is one of the best Lincoln Rhyme novels yet. Deaver has done a great job creating a plausible reason for Rhyme to travel away from the safety of his own apartment.The action really gets going when Sachs starts to disagree with Rhyme on the guilt of the suspect. Then, when you think it is all over, Deaver throws in a heart stopping twist.If you have never read a Deaver book, you will probably be hooked after this one. If you like reading series books, you may want to read the other Lincoln Rhyme books as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great reading but not his best work","review":"Deaver hooks us in again with another Lincoln Rhyme Novel and keeps us guessing all the way to the end. I particularly enjoyed the way he used the \\"Insect Boy\\" and his reading material to instruct us forensics as well as life.The ending seems slightly contrived and using MCS to explain some of Garret's symptoms does not work for me because MCS is a highly controversial diagnosis of a \\"syndrome\\" that is considered to be more psychological than physical. Toxaphene is not proven to be a human carcinogen so to blame Lucy's cancer and the cancers and illnesses of others in the community on that one chemical also seem to be stretching it. Despite these flaws, I thoroughly enjoyed reading the latest adventures of Lincoln Rhyme and Amelia Sachs and hope that we will see more of them. I also hope that Deaver will remember to write the books for his readers--not for a potential movie audience."},{"rating":"2","title":"Convoluted and rather unbelievable plot","review":"Deaver is a terrific writer, and Rhyme and Sachs are an engaging pair, but this is far from his best work. I can almost excuse the Southern cliches, but as he piles one ridiculous plot twist on top of another, he buries any credibility he established in the beginning.One of the only things that works here is the character of Garrett Hanlon. I enjoyed his awkwardness and his obsession with insects. I also liked the way Deaver wove different aspects of entomology into the story.Lucy Kerr was another believable character. Her tenacity and courage were much appreciated amidst a cast of villains.Finally, the empty chair metaphor worked well within the context of the story, but by story's end, you knew that everything would be hunky dory. I would rather have seen some cliff-hanging threads that carried over to the next novel. All of it seemed much too neat to me."},{"rating":"2","title":"More than a Chair","review":"Lincoln Rhyme and Amelia Sachs are brilliant together possibly because of their respective defects. She is driven to succeed at all costs and he is cripled. They travel to North Carolina hoping to find some improvement for Lincoln in an experimental surgery and wind up in the middle of a murder/kidnapping. The setting is a small town with almost everyone there having an agenda of his/her own. The book is a great suspense read with characters that have surprising strengths and weaknesses. The ending prepares the way for a new Lincoln Rhyme book. I will look forward to it."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Empty Chair: A Lincoln Rhyme Novel","review":"I loved this book! This is the first Jeffery Deaver novel I ever read and can not believe I missed him. With all of the twists and turns of the characters and the story, I found myself not knowing what was true and was not which is the sign of a great mystery. Lincoln Rhyme is demanding and downright mean, yet introspective and cunning in his ability to solve this crime. He takes you step by step through the woods, analyzing thoroughly every piece of evidence, and into the true heart of the story, keeping you on the edge of your seat every step of the way."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good read","review":"Lincoln Rhyme travels to North Carolina for an experimental operation that might improve his almost total paralysis. Luckily his mind is more acute than ever. Lincoln, and travel companion Sachs, are sidetracked into helping the local sheriff solve a kidnapping and murder. But things aren't what they appear to be.This is a well paced novel that will keep you guessing with its twists and turns. It will give you a good idea what it feels like in the swamps of NC. The characters in the book seem to jump out at you, especially the 'Insect Boy' from whom you'll learn quite a bit about insects.Overall a very satisfying readRecommended"},{"rating":"1","title":"boneyard","review":"Sorry Jeffery , Hollywood and deadlines for mass producing novels have gotten to you too. This one starts with a good concept [getting Linc and Amelia out of the Apple] and even satisfies the good writing criteria , but fails miserably in its lack of Deaver's compelling villain chacterizations. The Insect Boy character had some real potential but failed miserably in the end, just as the entire novel did. This is truely one of the most unbelievable endings I've ever come across. The author would have us believe that the true villain tries to murder half the town in a tiny berg in North Carolina where almost nothing happens until Lincoln and Amelia show up. The entomology lessons were cute but if good ole Linc analyzes any more dirt like this he should wind up in the BONEYARD. Truely disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tedious","review":"I might have been able to enjoy this book more had it not been for the glaring errors pertaining to science.

Not on my top ten list."},{"rating":"1","title":"Daylight Saving Time","review":"I was not too impressed with this book, and part of it had to do with the timeline. Is it just me, or did it seem that there were just too many hours in the day for the characters? Let's see, they arrive in the city and meet with a surgeon, get talked into traveling to Tanners Corner to take on an investigation, requisition equipment, set up a lab, train an apprentice, interview local experts, collect and analyze evidence from town employees, Sachs goes to two different crime scenes to \\"walk the grid\\" and collect more evidence, evidence is analyzed, a manhunt on foot goes through miles of swamp and bush while being haltingly directed by cell phone, the target is captured, dragged back to town, interrogated, lawyers and psychologists arrive, more interrogation, another meeting with the surgeon, a jail break, another manhunt while an escape is made by boat and on foot, and it's finally starting to get dark. What's up with that?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Read","review":"Jeffrey Deaver brings back my two fav characters in Sachs and Rhyme (what's up with Donahe in the move?)

He's such an excellent mystery writer with true to life characters & a well conceived plot & ending.The main characters Lincoln Rhymes & Amanda keep the story fueled from beginning to end which he's done with his othermysteries. The story has a psychological spin to it with the character who's suspect and his teaching of the insect worldbrings another element into the reading & enjoyment of The Empty Chair. I highly recommend this read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sit Down and Enjoy!","review":"Jeffery Deaver does it again with Lincoln Rhyme and Amelia Sachs in his recent novel the Empty Chair. Rhyme travels to North Carolina for an experimental surgery which may provide him with more mobility. When he arrives local police ask him for assistance in finding the Insect Boy, Garrett Hanlon who has kidnapped two local young women and police feel may kill them.Garrett turns out to be an interesting criminal. A teenager whose family was killed in a car accident, Garrett turns to insects for solace. He observes insects to learn lifes important lessons. Sachs finds him a strangely sympathetic criminal and sets out to help him.The Empty Chair does not contain the gore and grisly detail that the previous Lincoln Rhyme novels contained. But it does have the wonderful excitement of a chase, that should not be missed. It also adds layers upon the Rhyme and Sachs characters and I look forward to their further development in the future ."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent","review":"I have read all of John Sanford/Robert Walker/Patricia Cornwell/ect.

Congratulations and this book - keep them coming!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A clunker","review":"I have read all the other Lincoln Rhyme books and enjoyed them thoroughly. This one should have been sent back for a new last 100 pages. The ending is contrived and appears to have been added to quickly finish an incomplete book. The rest of the book is slow and not as interesting as previous writings."},{"rating":"1","title":"Exciting Thriller? Rename this book Empty Promises!","review":"From its boring title to its cast of cliched southern rednecks, the Empty Chair disappoints from the very beginning. The storyline about a teen killer/kidnapper obsessed with insects is interesting, but the story quickly dissolves into a half-baked tale of southern intrigue that never offers any excitement. Deaver tried to save the book by pulling about a dozen rabbits out of a hat near the end of the novel, but many of these surprises and plot twists make no sense at all, and after the third or fourth one, the reader just gets tired of the whole thing. Deaver also tries to wrap up every plot conflict with a neat little bow at the end, but he leaves out most of the explanations which only leaves readers scratching their heads and wondering what happened. Try the earlier books in this series, both of which were far better reads."},{"rating":"1","title":"Running on empty","review":"Sorry folks, but there's less reason and too much Rhyme to Deaver's latest. The Carolina setting not only leaves Rhyme and Sachs adrift, but the author too. If Rhyme solves another mystery by analysing soil deposits, I'm going to ask for my cash back. Thin on plot throughout, it crams too much exposition into the final pages and, far from delivering a trademark Deaver double-whammy ending, it just peters out. Sorry, but it's time to put the forensic duo out to pasture for good (provided, of course, the soil will sustain them)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not this author's best effort","review":"What starts as an interesting story turns into an overly long and drawn out premise with an overly convenient ending. This was one of those books that just kept going and going for no real reason. It desperately needed to lose some weight and have the pacing tightened up. After dragging myself through this one, I just didn't feel like it was worth it, especially when I got through the silly trial scene where Amelia is facing murder charges. Rhyme and Co. should have stayed in the Big Apple."},{"rating":"2","title":"ANOTHER DELICIOUS ROMP FOR LINCOLN & AMELIA!","review":"He's done it again!

Rhyme and Sachs are compelling but the secondary characters in this one blow you away. Deaver makes you think one thing, you're thinking predictability but you get a shock at the end and find yourself thinking you weren't so smart after all.

Lincoln is his old charming and brilliant self, even in an area he knows little about, rural North Carolina. His instructions to his field agent, Amelia Sachs, while she tracks their quarry through swamp country, are impeccable yet believable and logical (elementary, my dear Watson). The bug thing really works and hardly ever made my skin crawl (a little itchiness is all).And then, pitting him against Amelia is a bold stroke. Who is the better forensics analyst? Who has the better take on the crime? It allowed Deaver to explore more fully their feelings for each other.Read this book.

He's been tested, but..\\" How outrageous is that! Just because a man is gay, you're supposed to automatically assume he might have AIDS?!

Too many events make Emma, the main character, seem a saint to the children. The awesome occurance of events gives the story a over-powering fictional side. And the sub-romantic plot wasn't needed in the least. All in all, read this book if your in the mood for a story set around the Orphan Trains, not for one ABOUT them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Burke lives up to the hype.","review":"Unlike the main characters of some series who seem to be without fault, Dave Robicheaux is anything but. If you want to get a feel for who some of these characters are (Dave, Alafair, Batist, etc.), check out the movie \\"Heaven's Prisoners\\" or just read the earlier books in the series. ... Burke's prose is masterful to put it simply and he gives you a real look into life in the bayou. Great book, fully recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best Yet","review":"Absolutely brilliant! I once believed that writers like Hemingway and Laurie Lee had no equals. I was wrong! In my opinion, Burke is probably the finest writer alive today; possibly one of the finest writers 'ever'."},{"rating":"2","title":"Almost, not quite, maybe soon...literature","review":"Burke is a master of the cavalier attitude of southern men, the hands off my business, I'll respect yours way of behaving. Of course this is made a little difficult by the fact that the main character is a police officer who is required to probe, inquire, rudely interrogate. The scenery descriptions are arresting and the characters are intriguing. The dialog, while it may reflect actual cultural and social types, is insufficient. The struggles that the character goes through as a dry alchoholic are authentic and touching yet the interaction between him and his wife is mystifying. I love to read Burke but I always wait for paperback. He is getting closer to something that feels bigger, riskier."},{"rating":"2","title":"Top Form","review":"I've never read a James Lee Burke novel that I didn't love. This one is full of all the reasons why. Dave's troubled character, always haunted by his flaws and tragic past. A complex social stew of crimes, race and passion. Hard hitting violence. Lyrical language used sparingly. Burke can describe a sunset with enough beauty to make me pause and reread it. A moment later he can describe a burst of action with graphic clarity.Yeah. He's good. If you're new to Burke this is a perfectly fine place to start."},{"rating":"2","title":"Robuster","review":"Streak gets to confront one of his pressing demons in this continuing saga.Published over ten years ago it is still a good read.A must if you enjoy this line of Burkes.For me, one of his better efforts."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book!","review":"This was my first encounter with Dave Robicheaux and I loved it. I am now working my way through the previous books and (so far) I have enjoyed them all. The only bad thing about reading them out of order is that you know some of the major events before the author reveals them.There were several un-explained references in this book that are now clear after reading some of the earlier works, but it really didn't detract from the reading.Burke does a great job or evoking the speech, attitudes, and atmosphere of Iberia and the Big Easy. Or so it seems to someline like me who has never been there....Highly recommended - but start with the earlier books to get the story in order."},{"rating":"2","title":"Homage To The Master","review":"I admit I am the consummate James Lee Burke fan. I can find little to fault in any of Burke's fiction, but I'm especially drawn to the Robicheaux novels. That said, this is simply the best in the series since \\"Black Cherry Blues\\". It is a meticulously plotted page turner full of the steamy ambience of the So. Louisiana Parishes. You can smell the bayou and feel the sticky heat in Burke's prose. There are enough fully realized, fleshed-out characters in this book to fill three novels. Burke has an amazing ability to create dibolical villains and sympathetic yet earthy protagonists. Dave Robicheaux and his compatriots have reached new dimensions in character developement. This is fiction (prose) at its best."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect read for a Gulf Coast vacay...","review":"I really enjoy James Lee Burke's Louisiana writings. I know they are considered mysteries, but the plot points are only the frame on which the humid, scent-laden atmosphere of bayou Louisiana is stretched. This one was more about Dave Robicheaux's family history...his parents and family background, and why he struggles so with his sobriety, relationships, and anger. Burke writes so cinematically, he practically puts you in the boat fishing with Dave and Clete on the Teche. [I have never understood why more of these have not made it to the big screen or TV.] Robicheaux's psyche is front and center as usual...and propels the story line with equal parts fury and regret...he's a tough man fighting his impulses all the way. Wonderful read..."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Literary Blues","review":"James Lee Burke's novels are the literary equivalent of the blues: somtimes lyrical, sometimes gritty and profane, sometimes pathetically comic or violent, but always moving. The story is always first-rate, but the reason to read Burke is the prose -- his glorious and somehow incredibly Southern voice. He's Eudora Welty crossed with Conan Doyle, Faulkner mixed with Elmore Leonard. All in all, he's not to be missed. Read them all. This one's as good a place to start as any."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best of a great series","review":"Burke has saved his best for last.

The group known as the Real McCoy along with La Bouche and Fun Factory sybomlize an era of dance music that cannot, for technical reasons or otherwise, be reproduced. And for great reason. Some collections are deemed appropriate due to the fact that they simply came about at the right time and right place, muscially, for those who listened at the right time and place. Those who are confused as to why concerning this greatest hits alblum, well, was told at the dance club door that the club was filled."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must have cd for the Dance addict...","review":"Real McCoy is one of my favorite dance artists, so this may be a little biased. But this cd has it going on. It has all of their best hits, including Another Night, Run Away, Sleeping With an Angel to name a few. I cant honestly think of a bad song on this cd, even the ones I dont listen alot on it, are still awesome and favorites of mine.For those of you who dont know who this great artist is, Real McCoy was a big dance group in the 90's. They hit it big with Another Night, a masterpeice of a song, and then followed up with another instant hit, Run Away. Automatic Lover was another big hit for them, and even the song Operator was big, even though it didnt make the charts. They have done remixes of such songs as Shania Twains \\"Im Outta Here\\". All in all, a fine group, with some great hits under their belt. Their music is still played today in alot of the big night clubs, and I am sure it will be that way for a time to come."},{"rating":"1","title":"2 excellent tracks forget the rest","review":"another night and runaway were two of the freshest dance floor fillers for rainbow coloured nellys in europe in the 1990's but that's it.you have toa dmire the nerve of some record companies marketing departments \\"platinum and gold collection\\" ? !! 2 decent tracks do not make a collection and the rest are boring album fillers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lesson Learned","review":"Although the item I recieved was nice it wasn't what I was expecting.

A team of doctors in the Amazon unknowingly bring home a mysterious new virus, spreading it everywhere from the docks of Miami to back home in Brandon, Mississippi. By the time Jordan and Delaney realize what it is that they are up against, a good friend has been murdered and Delaney has been infected. Can they find a cure in time?

It is very well made and has a TON of storage compartment options. It can hold so much stuff that I have to be careful not to put everything I own into it and make it weigh as much as an NFL lineman. I use zippered pistol rugs to hold my firearms instead of relying on the interior padded divider to do that job. It has so many storage nooks and crannys that sometimes it takes me a little while to remember where I put stuff in it while at the range. For the casual target-shooter/plinker, this bag can literally hold everything in one place that you don't want to put in your safe (cleaning, hearing/eye protection, rags, small bench rests, tools, paperwork, snap caps, magazines, range optics, etc, etc).

Norah Jones has been one of those who have shined on that trademak, with her Jazzy somber mellow songs. Thinking about You, the first single from her hyped third record, Not Too Late, keeps the signature flow from her music flowing swiftly, without losing the feeling of her songs. I like this song because it speaks from the heart, and it is very sophisticated. I really hope that the next single from the record is just as good as this one.

They are all top notch, though out of all three, his latest one is the best. If you want a book strictly on influence, then buy get anyone to do anything. However, if you are looking for how to read people and understand what they are thinking, when they are not telling you what they are thinking, then you want YOU CAN READ ANYONE. He seems to combine alot of the other tactics into this one super book. I've already begun to use some of the techniques, and if you know Lieberman's style, then you'll appreciate that this book too is very, very practical. Its got no fluff, very cool insights into human behavior, and tells you exactly what to say and do to find out what a person is really thinking. All good stuff! Happy reading."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Title helped it sell","review":"The book was boring to read. The examples were weak. The title was the best thing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buyer beware","review":"This book is so outdated. All the techniques listed in this book are from the 1980's and earlier, which means that most of the things you can learn from this book are already learned by you from the past. There are much more recent interesting researches and discoveries of human nature you can find in other books."},{"rating":"2","title":"A how-to book with great techniques that are EASY EASY EASY","review":"A how-to book with great techniques that are EASY EASY EASY to use. Really! This book is more then a book on influence. The title doesn't reflect what the book really is-the greatest insight into human behavior you will find. It is far more comprehensive and fascinating then a simple book on getting someone to do what you want. This is not a vicious book at all, which leads me to wonder why the author chose such an aggressive title. This is a book that HELPS relationships, not forces one person on another. You will read it cover to cover the minute you pick it up. Without reading it through it's easy to assume that this is a mean book, but trust me, if it were I would blast it to no end. It is positive, intriguing book that's highly readable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good book, somewhat misleading title","review":"I actually think this book is a little misleading. It kind of gives you the impression that you'll be able be in control of other people. To be fair, what this book teaches does help with that. However, what if people you deal with practice the same techniques on you? What you really get from this book is an understanding of what triggers people to react in certain ways. It's good knowledge to have, but it is not absolute. I recommend this book as and introduction to person-to-person psychology rather than a guide on how to \\"get anyone to do anything\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Content and useable information","review":"This book is filled with common sense advice and tactics you can put into action immedately - and they WORK!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A great title, but much too weak to accomplish it!","review":"Expected much more because of the title.

It will however assist you in a variety of social transactions.Very well done."},{"rating":"1","title":"Studies show this book blows","review":"I noticed this book at a bookstore, browsed through it, and was surprised to see some useful content. I bought it, then browsed in greater detail. Some of the information will be valuable in situations similar to the ones mentioned in the book. Some of the information will remain useless.I would rate this book with 3 stars; however, something irks me about this book. Every chapter -- and I'm not exaggerating -- every stinking chapter refers to mythical \\"studies\\" that are never referenced elsewhere. The phrases \\"Studies suggest...\\", \\"many studies say...\\" and \\"Studies have show that...\\" litter the book. Lieberman uses this ploy to make his opinions appear legitimize. This cheap trick does not go unnoticed.Because Lieberman uses the tricks of a con artist, I cannot bring myself to recommend this book to anyone.

Just make sure that you get the permission of your friend to tell her secret ot this other person.\\"For someone who is trying to establish trust, doing such a manipulative, underhanded thing is hardly trustworthy behavior that will enable one to build a sound and lasting friendship - permission or not. Being a true friend is about giving, not about testing and conspiring. Being vulnerable to someone is one of the risks of establishing a friendship - I'd rather find out the hard way that I misjudged someone than sink to the sneaky and contemptible nadir that Lieberman suggests.Incidentally, my teenaged children were equally horrified by Lieberman's \\"techniques.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting read","review":"I read this book a few years ago and was excited to see that a few of the techniques in this book actually worked. Of course, you cant really get anybody to do anything, but you can surprisingly get some people to do some things.This book is a collection of many ideas that I have found in various books since reading ths one. regardless, it is nice to find one place that has so many good ideas.My ex-girlfriend wasn't so pleased with me when she found out I was reading this book; she thought I was trying to manipulate her. She eventually read it herself and now I feel manipulated, just kidding, I saw her tactics a mile away.Anyway, this is a fun book, but don't think you're going to rule the world from reading it, however, if you are like me you will probably want to learn more on how people are easily influenced and manipulated, this was one of those books that will make want to investigate further."},{"rating":"1","title":"I felt like I was reading an outline","review":"He never went into great detail on anything.

Also, despite the fact that there is always new research being done in psychology the vast majority of the works cited in the bibliography 31 out of the 37 are from between the years 1946-1989.

It does however give you a framework to understand when you are being manipulated and tactics that can be effective in some situations in order to get what you want.Because the tactics can be effective in some social and business interactions I decided not to be too critical of the marketing hype.

Also the book is so short and his chapters so small that it leaves you hungry for more depth, more explanation and more examples on how to use his tips. Sometimes the situations he describes are just too limited. I would not buy this again...it's just not detailed enough and provides too few examples on how to use this in real life--not every situation is about a cheating boyfriend or a dishonest employee.

As the author cheerfully tells us, great liberties are taken with history (among other things). It's a wild blend of all the pirate stories the author devoured in his childhood, mixing historical figures and events with great dollops of deliberate anachronism.A real romp, and definitely not to be taken seriously.

The hair on pretty much every character set me into extreme fits of annoyance it was that bad.The characters are boring and live in a boring town etc etc.If your looking for a chilling psychological tale i would go with higurashi no naku koroni or ghost hound.If its gore your after then i recommend elfen lied or mnemosyne.I would pass on this one. if you do feel like you would still like to see it then download the first 5 or so episodes and then make up your mind before you decide to buy.Catch."},{"rating":"2","title":"Shiki:Part One","review":"Wow!!! Great series. Burned through both part one and two in four days. Might as well buy both parts at the same time because you WILL want part two. First episode had me concerned I might have bought a poor series but the story ramped up fast and I was hooked by episode three. Very nice art and a great storyline with no \\"weird\\" Japanese ending. Vampires are rather an unusual Anime subject but this was a refreshing change of pace and highly recommended. A big plus was no typical childish anime humor (and that irritating squeaky 11 year old was absent as well). As you approach the last few episodes scenes become some of the most intense I have seen in Anime and add greatly to the overall impact of the series."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great horror story","review":"This is really a great show. It starts out slow but by the 3rd or 4th episode you find yourself at the edge of your seat wondering what is going to happen next. By the time the last six episodes roll around I found my jaw just dropping.The soundtrack is quite good and it matches the moods quite well. The art does the trick and they don't pull any punches.This series has a lot of gore and violence. The emotional dilemmas are intense and the boundaries of right and wrong are definitely blurred. It's one of those shows that will leave you thinking for a while afterwards.Needless to say, it is an adult show. It's comforting to find an anime like this amidst all the fanservice anime. And best of all, unlike a lot of anime, it has a good ending. Definitely worth a watch!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good info but sketchy","review":"The book is OK but suffers a bit from being too short and rather scattered if considered to be an introduction to Islam. It might be best described as an introduction to the history of relations between Islam and the West.Bruce Bradshaw's review here is quite useful and accurate. The fact that the review discusses the tension between the Christian pacifist views of Yoder and those of Rheinhold Niebuhr, while the former is not even mentioned in the book, is illustrative of the spotty nature of the book. I'd really like to see an updated version, twice the length, with a lot of gaps filled. By now, seven years after the book was published, there must be better sources for reviewing the tensions between Muslim \\"fundamentalism\\" and Christianity."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor transfer","review":"Even though the box claims a digital transfer, the source elements must be poor.

It is not only touching and emotive, but a page turner. A book that can bring you to tears and yet make you smile at the same time. I highly recommend it and other books by Allende."},{"rating":"2","title":"A tantalizing read!","review":"I enjoyed this book thoroughly. I read it in just over one night and saved the last three pages for the next day because I didn't want it to end. I was first turned on to Ms. Allende about five years ago when a clerk at a video store recommended \\"House of Spirits\\". My family was very touched by this movie. Thank you for writing about your life and the other miraculous thoughts and stories that come into your head."},{"rating":"1","title":"Paula","review":"If an author wants to substantiate her family lineage she should do it through personal theopary rather than trying to impose her family's \\"importance\\" through a novel that unsuspecting readers will have to digest. Paula is a bad attempt at unmasking Allende's personal drama and is a real turn off. Allende is too self-absorbed and socially removed to represent the Latino world."},{"rating":"2","title":"really great, everyone should read it","review":"This is the first book I have read of Isabelle Allende and it was great. I wasn't sure if I wanted to read it at first because it seemed so emotional since I have a daughter and I could not imagine how difficult and painful this situation was for Isabelle. But, the book is so much more. She talks about her life and gives you so much insight. It was not depressing at all, it was almost spiritual. She's a wonderful writer and a great person. I wish more people knew about this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Exquisito!","review":"This book grabbed not only my time but also my whole being. Thank you Isabel.

I was however dissapointed with the House of the Spirits."},{"rating":"2","title":"Allende's best.","review":"I am an avid Allende fan and I think this is her absolute best. It is very poignant and soul-stirring. I read this book while commuting in my home of Belize. People on the bus must have thought I was going quite mad. This book makes you laugh out loud one moment and has you sobbing uncontrollably the next. A wonderful read for the soul."},{"rating":"2","title":"a beautiful book.......","review":"In general, I adore Allende's work, and once again she came through. The book is touching and very well-written. Although she changes style toward the end of the book, the reasoning behind the change is obvious and she executes it well. I read it from cover to cover without putting it down, and it was a real tear-jerker!"},{"rating":"2","title":"An incredible work of courage.","review":"An incredible work of courage. Whilst reading Ms. Allende's lines, it was difficult to fathom that these words were being addressed to her dying Paula and to the reader as well. An intimate connection is made with the reader. Ms. Allende's hope and pain became my hope and pain. A strong and sad force created this story."},{"rating":"2","title":"A gorgeous book","review":"Isabelle Allende is one of the great writers of our time. Although she writes in Spanish, the English version of this book is excellent - the translator must also be a gifted writer to have accomplished this.I ran to the store and bought this book after hearing Allende interviewed about it on the radio. My life curiously has touched hers - having gone to school with her daughter but never meeting her - and having a simliar tragedy in my family.Allende's story is intriguing, especially if you have already read the House of Spirits. It tells a similar story but with a different ending. Its exploration of her life with her family, husbands and children is intertwined with the historical events that gripped Chile in the last few decades. Her reasons for originally writing the book are sweet and we grieve with her when she can't fulfill them.A truly excellent book"},{"rating":"2","title":"this autobiography reads like a novel","review":"I found this book deeply moving, witty, and beautifully eloquent -- being, like Isabel Allende, also a Chilean living in the Bay Area, I was able to identify with so much in this exquisitely written autobiography... The narrative never lost me for one moment. I think it's her best book to date - in spite of how much I liked 'The House of the Spirits'"},{"rating":"2","title":"A feast for the soul","review":"Isabel Allende writes in such a way that you find yourself swimming inside her words. The passion with which she writes makes you become as passionate as her. You find yourself living along with her characters. In this particular memoir, the devastating loss of her daughter becomes something more. It becomes a testament to all the wonder life holds. I have read almost all of Isabel Allende's work and fell in love with every single one. She never fails to educate and amuse at the same time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful memoir","review":"The author wrote this to her daughter as her daughter lay dying.

In this compelling story, the characters are not created or do they developed as the story goes along. The characters are real and Isabel gives us a clear picture of how she sees them. Isabel images and emotions are so clear that the reader is absorbed into her persona.The novel skillfully combines the story of her daughter sickness with her life story. Although, some episodes of her daughter sickness become repetitive, it only shows how sincere her feelings were lain down in the book.At the end, you have read more than a story...you had lived an experience."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what we expected","review":"We ordered the book in spanish and the book came in english. the pages were really yellow and some were tore.

Never have I experienced such emotion within myself while reading a novel, actually sobbing outloud! There is so much of Allende's heart and soul in writing her own life story. Her life is so incredibly fascinating and her love for her daughter so moving, the combination of these two elements makes for an incredible book! By far my very favorite author!"},{"rating":"1","title":"tedious","review":"I was all set to LOVE this book based on the reviews and recommendation of friend.

The way Paula dies is just terrible, and Isabel Allende suffered so much!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"deeply moving","review":"A beautifully written (and translated)book. I was deeply moved.

Unfortunately, I was very disappointed.Although there are some wonderful passages looking into Isabel's past, too much of the book deals with her socialist and new age perspectives of life. Her writing depicts a very self-centered life. Unfortunately, she is never able to come to grips with her daughter's coma and eventual death. Her writing has been sadly affected by events and her personal outlook."},{"rating":"1","title":"Starts out great","review":"This book started out really well. Like Allende's otherbooksthe readers become involved with characters immediately. By theend, however, the story has bogged down and is only Allende rambling on about herself.

My favorite part was when Oscar went to the Henson's (the elderly couple he was trying to dump Robert on) and said \\"Can Mr. Henson come out and play?\\". The part where Robert dumped the spiders in Oscar's bedroom was funny, too. This book gives me an idea of what it would have been like to have a younger sibling."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Blakeney Family Continues...","review":"Pimpernel and Rosemary may be a disappointment to Baroness Orczy's fans. The plot does not revolve around Sir Percy. Rather, it is about his great-great grandson. Sadly, Peter Blakeney lacks the style and mannerisms of his famous ancestor. The work also lacks luster in terms of plot development. On the positive side, the piece does have a few interesting romantic moments between Peter and Rosemary."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love & Highly Recommend This DVD For Bonanza Fans!!","review":"I just got my dvd today, and I am loving it already.

Yes, it's inexpensive, light, packable, keeps rain out, surprisingly breathable, and even U.S.-made. The fuzzy liner keeps the jacket from sticking to your arms. However, for regular, rainy-day commuting (as in Seattle), this jacket is just way too fragile and barely lasted me a couple months. The outer, pored layer is extremely thin and fragile. Unlike ripstop nylon, once it starts ripping, it's hard to stop, and it's easy to rip this stuff. Let's just say you should make sure to have your fingernails filed before handling it, and I recommend against tossing it in your pannier without the protection of a plastic bag. Given its short useful life, I'm not really sure if this jacket is good for anybody's needs...definitely not for commuters. I bit the bullet and went for a Burley jacket and couldn't be happier...well worth it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cheap and very functional but not sturdy","review":"This is a great jacket to stuff in your bag to have on hand. Extremely lightweight and VERY waterproof, but also breatheable, so you don't get horribly hot when you wear it while biking. At the same time, it keeps you warm on a chilly morning. The only (and rather serious) trade off for this deal is that the jacket rips pretty easily. The material is not terribly sturdy so if you wear this jacket a lot, you are likely to shred it within a season as I did. At the price, it isn't hard to replace each season, but I wish I didn't have to replace it all the time."},{"rating":"2","title":"perfect for hot climates","review":"We have taken this rainjacket into the Amazon jungle for a few years now and it's the best type of rainjacket for that climate! It's lightweight so it's not hot and stuffy but waterproof and sturdy enough that it last for years compared to ponchos and plastic jackets. My only suggestion would be to make it in other colors besides yellow!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Crappy Material.","review":"I would not recommend this product.

Revelation is not something that should be exploited and treated on the same plane as UFO abductions. This book was obviously produced simply to milk off of Christians' interest in God's words. It doesn't help to understand God any better, only to tempt with endless speculation.If you're interested in an author who uses Revelation to truly come closer to God, I would suggest trying Brian Caldwell's novel, We All Fall Down. Rather than use Revelation as a titilating disastor, he explores what makes such a judgement necessary and what it is that keeps us away from God."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent","review":"Firstly, much of this music has been released in other formats, and on other recordings. However, these sellections were recorded earlier in Horne's career, and one of them was recorded only this one time, \\"Noble Seigneur\\" from Les Hugenots. As with all Horne's recordings, the musicianship is exact and incredible, the colorature is sparkling and vibrant, and well, the diction is wonderful. There is very little to say about this recording. It is simply wonderful, and it is a perfect reflection of what we are used to hearing from this great artist.

I cannot rank this as a great performance because in my opinion the forms lack intensity and power.

It was funny, exciting, and even mostly believable...until Casey pretends to join up with JFT (Jacob Funeral Trust). Then it just becomes...well, plain hokey. JFT strongman Starks reminded me of the Queen of Hearts in 'Alice in Wonderland' running around shouting, 'Off with their heads!' Who does that? Apart from that, though, it was really entertaining and hard to put down. I even stayed up last night until 2:30am to finish it...and I had to work today!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Big Laughs, Twisted Plot","review":"Not only is Miles Keaton Andrew a great comic writer, he also tends toward the bittersweet. Mr. Andrew's strong points are character and plotting. The plot turns at 90-degree angles, which pull the reader through the book so quickly, you're sad to see it end. The characters are marvelous. Casey Kight, an orphan who has found his home, or funeral home in this case, blesses us with sympathy at his hilarious misadventures in embalming. Natalie, Casey's love of his life, is a bratty, sarcastic foil to Casey's naiivete.

I will agree that it portrayed Ellen well, as well as some of the other characters, but I just did not like it. I thought some attempts at humor completely ruined the mood of a scene in an otherwise somber place in the novel.After reading this book, I will say that it offered a new perspective on Ellen's and other Foster children's situations, but again, I return to the fact that some bad elements caused me to get an overall negative feeling about the book. I suppose that I may be a bit harsh in such a low grade, but this is truly how it felt to me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rainy Weekend Book","review":"You'll read this book in one weekend because you won't be able to put it down. Very few stories actually make me cry, and I read a lot! But rereading the last line of this book over and over, I found myself with tears in my eyes. Not because the story is a particularly sad one - it really isn't - but because this little girl seems to see the world so clearly and in her young way, is able to open our eyes to look at the world the way she sees it - simply and logically. Ellen is hope in a hopeless world."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ellen is fabulous!","review":"The voice of this little girl is amazingly clear. How often do you laugh out loud? For a book that is not so funny... but oh, what a voice she has. Brilliantly written. Depressing- no. Sad- yes, orphanstories tend to be sad. Uplifting - very much so. Beautiful- without a doubt. I tend to shy away from Oprah because of the glitz, but I may take another look at her lists.

My first thought was, \\"Oh no, not another book about an 11-year old girl.\\" But I enjoyed the character, Ellen, thoroughly and felt for her through her trials with a dead mother and abusive father.I also very much enjoyed the author's writing style in this book. At first I thought the lack of punctuation would be confusing, but it only added to the charm of the book.I would highly recommend this book, especially for book club discussions."},{"rating":"2","title":"deeply moving, creatively written","review":"I read this book starting out as an assignment, but ended up adding it to the list of my favorites. The amount of levels Gibbons writes on is amazing; she can make you laugh and cry in one sentence. The book is made even better, in my opinion, by the fact that it is written from Ellen's point of view; this creates a certain innocent charm that adds to the emotional depth. She also makes light on topics such as racial equality and poor vs. rich. Overall, I would avidly recommend this book to anybody who loves a deeply moving read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book.","review":"This book is wonderful book. A little short but it does get the story across in a great way. Ellen Foster is young girl who has to go through more struggle and pain in her life then anyone her age should have to.The author made Ellen seem so real like it was someone you had know for a while and was just telling there life story.

We has also read Gibbon's On The Occasion of My Last Afternoon. Gibbons has a way with the South and bring it to life in her novels.

Very easy read but packed with a great story."},{"rating":"2","title":"Shockingly honest voice . . .","review":"Ellen Foster is a slim volume, Gibbon's first novel. It's told from the searingly honest perspective of eleven-year-old Ellen, whose mother passes away. After her mother's death, Ellen manages to escape her abusive, alcoholic father. She moves in with a controlling, vindictive grandmother. After the grandmother, too, dies (by which time her father is also deceased), Ellen stays for a short time with her aunt (also a difficult situation) before joining a foster family that finally provides her with a real home.Ellen is a fascinating character. Her voice is simple, but clearly intelligent and bent on self-preservation. Her eventual epiphany and acceptance of her \\"colored friend\\" Starletta is also a strong theme. The book reads quickly, and though Ellen endures considerable hardship, she does not wallow in self-pity. I recommend this novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Short story?","review":"This book is just strange. It's a diary of a young girl that is hard to figure out.

The author makes a pathetic attempt to write in the voice of a child, to no avail. I couldn't tell how old Ellen was, and I didn't know what the hell she was talking about most of the time. I spent two weeks reading this book. That's two weeks of my life I am never going to get back. What a waste. Don't make the same mistake I did."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ellen Shmellen","review":"On behalf of Mrs. Dymond's ninth grade English class at GHS, I would like to say that Ellen Foster is the worst book ever.

Kaye Gibbons, please do not make any books like Ellen Foster!7. DO NOT READ THIS BOOK! WASTE OF TIME!"},{"rating":"1","title":"WORST BOOK I HAVE EVER READ","review":"I have had to read some strange books in high school English Classes but this book takes the cake! This book does nothin but describe a little girls horrible life. This book is poorly written and is confusing. I wouldnt recommend this book to anyone in a million years!"},{"rating":"1","title":"unless your really sappy over cheesy books dont read this","review":"First off, whoever compared Ellen with Holden Caulfield should be shot. That is defacing a great nove. Second, does Ellen ever stop being a pain. I don't feel simpathy for her at all. It almost aggrivates me that this book was written. I give it one plus for the way it is written since I do find this very creative how the author uses past and present tense in telling one story. But thats as good as it gets. TRust me. Don't read it. Its just dull and annoying.Some might say it made them cry...it made me cry too...out of pain"},{"rating":"1","title":"One of the worst books I've ever read.","review":"It was so excrutiatingly boring I fell asleep many times while reading this book. It is FAR from an interesting read!! Seriously, it is not a book I would reccomend to anyone but insomniacs who want to be able to fall asleep. It's all whining, complaining and I guarantee you that Ellen will annoy the [stuff] out of you by the time you finish the book!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"One of the first books I have read...","review":"by Kaye Gibbons and if this is the line along which her books follow, it will be the last! I was so bored with this book.. bored and DISGUSTED! Isn't there enough crap in this world without having to read about it like that.. Hard enough to know it really does happen, but to dwell on it and actually applaud someone for writing about sick things such as this book. Very disturbing society we live in."},{"rating":"2","title":"A wonderful novel.","review":"I recommend reading this novel, if you like reading about families living in a dysfunctional home. Ellen Foster is a short novel about a little girl Ellen living in a dysfunctional family. She is living with her drunken abusive father, since her mother lies peacefully in gods hands. She has her friend (Starletta) who really cares for her and so does Starletta's family. Ellen realizes that the friendship she has with Starletta helped her get on with her life. The best part of this book is that it describes everything that might happen in a broken home and I could just feel what she is going through. The worst was how she talks about killing her own father, but I would not blame her."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ellen Foster... A great book with good morals","review":"In reading Ellen Foster, I feel that I have become a stronger person, because after reading it, I felt in a way ashmaned that I sometimes feel that I have a hard life. One of the main things I learned is never to give up. If you keep a goal in mind and keep searching for the answer you will without a doubt find the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow. Just like in the book, Ellen kept moving from home-to-home and one day, she walked all the way to the Foster gome, and now she has a better life than ever. I think this is a great book and everyone should read it at sometime in their life!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing special","review":"I heard a lot of hype about this book about how moving it was, but generally I found that this book was extremely boring and slow-moving. If your teacher assigns this for school, try to pick another book because even though it's a short book I had to struggle to stay awake."},{"rating":"1","title":"yuck","review":"I've read other books by Kaye Gibbons and this one can not be counted as one of her best. The sort of stream of concious writing made me want to just get through the book instead of enjoying this highly recommended book. Each page made me cringe as I made myself read paragraph after paragraph. I can't believe that Oprah has such bad taste in books."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ellen Foster by Kaye Gibbons","review":"\\"Ellen Foster\\" was my first introduction to the work of Kaye Gibbons. Her writing is provocative and sensitive. I would read anything and everything written by Kaye Gibbons including an encyclopedia. Her mastery of her leading character and her intuitive knowledge of Ellen's thoughts is just right on the money. I love this writer and am constantly looking for more of her works.All of Kaye Gibbons books are on my bookshelf that is dedicated \\"never give away or throw away\\". I reread any of Gibbons books and cherish each one for its uniqueness and character development. Each of her characters are so real they walk right off the page and you will never forget them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Right - who is this girl ???","review":"There were just too many inconsistencies in this girl to have the story be believable. She supposedly had a mother (for most of her life) who had a wealthy (at least middle class) family. She is totally illiterate and totally a racist even though there doesn't appear to be any racism from her parents (where did she get this). I mean she wouldn't even eat food at her black friend's house. The setting appears to change from the early 70s to the late 80s. She is supposed to be so saavy but we are supposed to believe that she wasn't familiar with the term \\"foster family\\" and that no social worker explained it to her. I found the poor grammar to be annoying and not even believable. ( I guess we are supposed to believe this girl didn't go to school even though we are also supposed to believe she is pretty smart). I can't recommend this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"Having read numerous Oprah selections and having heard all the hype about this novel, I opened Ellen Foster with great expectations. But to my disappointment, these expectations were far from reached. Rarely do I have to push myself to finish a novel, but was forced to do so with this one. Slow, monotone, and emotionless, I found it difficult to sympathize with Ellen's tragic story. The underdeveloped and almost expressionless characters, the underemphasized setting, the lack of dialogue and insight to Ellen's pain--all were severe drawbacks to the potential of this heartbreaking story. And although this is a matter of personal taste, I must also comment on the fact that the continuous use of poor grammar and language throughout the book were a pain. Sorry. I don't recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not bad, but not great","review":"This book is written in the perspective of a young girl. The grammar is intentionally incorrect throughout the book, and this is why I had a hard time staying interested. I bought this book because it had the Oprah's Book Club symbol on the cover and I thought it might be a good read. I really didn't care for it."},{"rating":"1","title":"a waste of time","review":"when i received this book from a friend telling me that this book would be great and would be interesting to read. But once i saw the cover telling me that it was part of the oprah book club, i was like, \\"oy! this book will stink\\" I never had high expectations of this novel. I was disturbed hearing ellen's insensitive feelings toward her parents and family. Also, the way kaye gibbons wrote the book was different from other books that i have read, but i hated the fact that there were no commas or quotation marks. It was tough to concentrate while reading because the novel was so anti-climatic and uninteresting. The only aspect of the book that i enjoyed was the fact that it consisted of only 126 pages so i could start a new book as soon as possible."},{"rating":"1","title":"I was quite unimpressed with this novel.","review":"The main character, Ellen, came across as a ungrateful little girl who had some problems in here life. When the parents of her blck friend are so hospitable and nice to her she can't even bring herself to drink from the same cup as them. Also the style of writing in the book resembled that of a fourth grader and was tedious to read. I would not recomend this book to anyone and would not hesitate to discourage people from reading this novel."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful and touching personal account of finding love","review":"Ellen Foster: a small child that any mature adult can relate to - cry with, yell with, and ultimetly love with. Ellen Foster tells the sad story of a torn child from a nightmarish family, and how she struggles to free herself from it's haunting binds. A must read!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Makes you think...","review":"I just finished reading this book. At first I was very stand-offis about reading this book because it was featured on Oprah and Oprah is all for self help etc so when it was on summer reading I almost decided on something else, but I decided to get it since it was at the store when I went. i'm glad I read it because it made me realize how lucky I am for the life I live. If I had to live with an emotionally abusive father, or an overbareing spiteful grandmother I'd would never have been able to live with myself as well as she did. She got through it with poise and she held her own, because there was no other road except defeat. She's a strong character and I would recommend this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is a cool book!","review":"I really enjoyed this book. As a 9th grade student at The Atlanta Girls' School, I read this book for a class and I really liked it. The book was about a girl who has a hard life and makes it through her whole life trying to make it better, and eventually does but with a hard struggle. I think that the book is very well written and is very smooth reading material. The book is not choppy! I would recommend it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Old Ellen","review":"I started this book with great expectations, and Mrs. Gibbons delivered quite well. Some parts were confusing, but soon I grew accustomed to the unique voice of the tough child-woman, Ellen. She had a beautiful name, but an ugly life. Her father killed her mother emotionally. Ellen cleverly avoided him, but was inevitably bounced from uncaring relative to uncaring relative. In some ways, these family members were crueler than her dad. Despite her trials, the brave girl(really more of an old woman than a child) never gave up the search for love. She found it in unconventional but kind people like a black friend named Starletta, a hippie couple, and finally a foster family. She kept her grit and was more concerned about others than herself. Many of the events are disturbing, but you survive them as Ellen did: through hope and black humor. Overall, the book is uplifting. I reccomend it to almost anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"This little girl is a survivor","review":"There is so much written in this short novel. It's a story of a young 5th grade girl that experiences absolutly too much abuse and ridicule in her life. The book, Ellen Foster, portrays a girl that is a survivor of neglect, alcoholism, and poverty. Ellen is a very strong child that witnesses racism and is inadvertantly a victim of the same. She doesn't succomb to selfpity, she is a tough cookie that focuses on her \\"new mama\\" and \\"foster\\" family.I really enjoyed reading this book. It's a story told by Ellen using the language of an 11 year old telling her sad life story as she understands it.I do recommend this book to all of my friends, it actually reminds me a lot of \\"White Oleander\\", another book that I thoroughly enjoyed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Review For Ellen Foster","review":"I didn't think that this book was so great, it was mediocre and I had really high expectations for it and came off disappointed. I didn't see Ellen as a female Holden, this book just wasn't as good as Catcher in the Rye and it shouldn't be compared to it. It seems like every time a book comes out with a young character they have to compare it with Catcher in the Rye.Kaye Gibbons doesn't go into much deph or complexity with most of her characters, especially Ellens relatives. Also, I couldn't really figure out when the story was set. I just don't like Kaye Gibbons writing style and I really should have known better since I've never liked any of Oprahs picks."},{"rating":"1","title":"Less Than I Expected","review":"After hearing all the praise regarding this book from the other reviewers, I thought I'd add a few warnings to those of you thinking of devoting your valuable time to it.--Not much as far as plot goes, and although I liked some of the supporting characters I didn't particularly find Ellen very interesting or well-delveloped. She thinks like a 40 year old and talks like a 4 year old--not what I find realistic for someone who is supposed to be about 11. No, I did not grow up poor or abused or with bad language skills (which is something you must also suffer through during most of this book, since the book is written from the main character's point of view), so maybe I can't identify. Overall, I guess it doen't really take that long to read, but I kind of wish that I hadn't taken the time."},{"rating":"1","title":"confusing and boring","review":"I bought this book because it was part of Oprah's book club. I tried to get into it but it was extremely boring and difficult to follow. I felt like I was inside the mind of a dumb slow hick. Perhaps this was what the author intended, but I had to put the book down.Borrow this book for the library and save your money for writers who put more effort into their books."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible book","review":"My English teacher assigned me to read this book... for some reason he must like the Oprah's Book Club, because we have read numerous other books from it this year. I found this to be a very gloomy and depressing book, and the style of writing makes it very difficult to understand. The writing must be \\"interpreted\\" because the author does such a poor job of describing it.Overall I would have to give this book a big thumbs down. I would never have read it unless I had to.Whoops, better use an anonymous username in case my English teacher happens to see this! I hate that teacher!"},{"rating":"1","title":"another Oprah miss","review":"This could have been a great story but miss s by a mile.The story jumps from time frame to time frame with no warning,many times I had to go back thinking I missed a page or 2,but no it just was the way this whole book went.It left you wondering what the heck is going on.You would just get into a story line and JUMP you in a totally new story,this book was just bad.A case of great idea bad writing."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"This book is so boring, I couldn't even read the Spark Notes\\"","review":"We had to read this book in English class last semester. This is actually the worst book I have ever read. I am not exaggerating one bit. A kid in my class said one day \\"This book is so boring, I couldn't even read the spark notes\\". This book would make sense if everyone in the South was an insestious alchoholic. When its not talking about some depraved act, Ellen is rambling on and on about her \\"new mama\\" in such a way; its like the author was trying to be excrutiatingly boring. The idea that anyone could say anything possitive about this book is astoudning; if i had a 16 hour plane flight, and all I had was this book to read, I would still not read it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ellen Foster","review":"I really enjoyed this book. Ellen Foster is a character you want to get to know and author Kaye Gibbons makes that possible."},{"rating":"1","title":"Choppy to read","review":"I know it was supposed to be choppy as it is written from a child's perspective but I had a hard time following her train of thought at times. I much preferred the end to the beginning."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good for a quick read","review":"I liked this book enough but seemed like something was lacking. Author did a good job of writing from a child point of view. Id recommend overall."},{"rating":"2","title":"Elen Foster","review":"Ellen Foster is a realistic fiction book written by Kaye Gibbons. Kay Gibbons wrote this book about this girl, Ellen Foster, and is thaat she hates her dad. Her dad is always drinking and he never lisens to what she has to say. One of the reasons why she hated her father so much is because he did not do anything to stop her mom from killing herself. She took a lot of pills in front of him and he did not do anything to stop her. He also dies in this story. So she goes to live with another family, but now she is way better off living there. This book was very difficult to read for me. I had to keep going back to the dictionary because there were some hard words that i didnt understand. I would put this book in a medium level, leaning more to the hard side.This book wwas very difficult and long."},{"rating":"2","title":"A story of a resilient girl who is able to find a family.","review":"I enjoyed reading Ellen Foster because Ellen possesses resilience- a characteristic that can take a person far in life. The book pertains to life in America because there are so many children who do not have families. The story is hope for all those children."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ellen Foster, strong, couragous, loveable, liveable.","review":"Ellen Foster is indeed a short novel, yet \\"old Ellen's\\" life is forever lingering in my mind. Kaye Gibbons wrote an incredibily lovable novel, one that is sure to steel your heart and give you strength. We all have troubles in our lives, and most of the time we wished we could change ourselves or our situation. I do not recall Ellen Foster ever wishing to be a different person, yet she strives to better her life and condition after her mother passes away. Ellen has given me comfort and strength to look into my own past and gain strength and knowledge from it. Ellen Foster is a book I encourage all who can absorb the love of one's true life of independence and courage."},{"rating":"2","title":"A book to hang on to","review":"Ms. Gibbons has the kind of raw and unfettered talentthat can make a writer/reader feel intimidated. Her peopleare real, her stories are important and her deliveryis dead on. This is my favorite of all her masterpieces.Ellen cracked me in two and at the same time threwme a splint and said \\"Get over it.\\" It's a flare inthe dark sky that illuminates the soul of a truesurvivor. This is the kind of story you'll thinkabout and draw upon forever."},{"rating":"2","title":"Refreshing, entertaining, touching. A quick, easy read.","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed my first introduction to Kaye Gibbons and promptly visited the library for her other titles after finishing \\"Ellen Foster.\\" It reminded me of \\"Catcher in the Rye\\" and other coming-of-age tales. Ellen is a fiesty child with a wonderfully wry sense of humor. I was totally surprised when my eyes welled up with tears at the ending. It's a rare book that makes me cry. I have suggested this book to several others and think it should be on school reading lists. I am new to the South and really enjoyed this slice of life by a Southern author."},{"rating":"1","title":"mediocre","review":"This was a quick, easy read, but I can't say that I enjoyed it particularly. I found the writing style to be distracting. It was a good story that needed to be developed a lot more than it was. Had I have known that it was a movie, I would have watched it and probably would have enjoyed it more. Not a horrible book, but I would recommend it only with caution."},{"rating":"2","title":"Listen to the Audio","review":"Just finished listening to Kaye Gibbons read her first novel, Ellen Foster. There is no substitute for hearing the author with her soft, warm sugar North Carolina drawl tell the story of Ellen. I heard words pronounced like I never had before. This is story telling at its very best, and it works so well because the book is written in the first person. If you enjoyed this, read Charms for the Easy Life which also has a happy ending."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bone meets Holden Caulfield","review":"Ellen Foster is a character in the tradition of Dorothy Allison's \\"Bastard Out of Carolina\\" and Salinger's \\"Catcher in the Rye.\\" Kaye Gibbons' approach, to write entirely in the voice of her main character, serves the book's purpose well. Although Ellen's voice sometimes makes her storytelling confusing and vague, especially early in the novel, the book is often beautifully wrought and subtle. It is sometimes humorous, often heartbreaking, and simply written. A nice compliment to Salinger's overwrought prose and Allison's brutal forthrightness. This book ranks right up there with those other two works and in fact is probably better suited for high-school age readers than either. Not perfect, but well worth the read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Quick but Detailed Read","review":"At a little over 100 pages, I didn't think this book would have much plot or character development. I was wrong. This is a really good book. It took me a bit to understand Ellen's verbal syntax, but once I got into her rhythm of speech, I understood her more fully, too.Kaye Gibbons created a narrator in Ellen who left me wishing Ellen the best. What will happen to her?! Hopefully, only good things."},{"rating":"2","title":"spunky orphan finds home","review":"Ellen Foster is an orphan cursed with perhaps one of the most dysfunctional families in literature. Her mother has passed away, according to Ellen in part to get away from her drunken, abusive father. When her father, too, passes away, Ellen is passed from relative to relative, including her pathologically selfish grandmother, who can't forgive her daughter for marrying the man she did; and her insufferable aunt and spoiled cousin Dora; before finally finding a decent home. Through all of this, her friend Starletta, who is black, stands by her. Ellen who at first superior and dismissive of Starletta because of her skin color matures and comes to a more mature understanding of friendship. She also realizes that blood is not always thicker than water, a stinging realization the author does not shy away from expressing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good, but read A Virtuous Woman first","review":"If you have never read anything by Kaye Gibbons, start with A Virtuous Woman. It is a great introduction. Ellen Foster was a little hard to follow at times since it jumped between past and present, plus there isn't a quotation mark to be found. However, I enjoyed this sad, bittersweet story and the ending is wonderfully redeeming. Ellen is quite mature for her 10 years, but I guess that's what happens when you grow up in her world. Recommended to the busy body who doesn't have time to read a book."},{"rating":"1","title":"I can't understand what the hype is all about.","review":"Getting to the end of a good book is always a little sad to me because I want the experience and the characters to keep going. But when I was reading this book, I kept checking to see how many pages were left for me to struggle through. It was only 126 pages, but it took me over two weeks to force myself to read all the way to the disappointing ending. I found her style of writing to be extremely confusing. A single sentence seemed to ramble on and on and the book would keep switching time and location without giving the reader a clue that it had. The author's choice not to use quotation marks around any direct quotes just added to the confusion. On top of all of this, I was never moved enough to even slightly care what happened to any of the characters. Sorry, Ms. Gibbons, but I found your book a laborious and disappointing read."},{"rating":"2","title":"a child with charm and character","review":"I really enjoyed this book. The authors style of writing is a bit strange in the way it flows in a thought-like pattern, but the content of the book was wonderful. As I read the book it brought back memories of being a child, both good and bad. I enjoyed the courage and strength of little Ellen and her wisdom about the world. She went through heartache and pain but learned valuable lessons instead of living in fear and remorse."},{"rating":"1","title":"Either I'm a lazy reader, or this book is misty and tiresome","review":"This is the kind of book they make you read in high school to help you learn about growing up. It's tiresome, repetitive, has a dreamy quality to it that makes the whole thing feel undefined. Sure, our heroine has a few cute quips and has a whimsical resourcefulness. But it doesn't sustain the book as a \\"good read\\" as far as I'm concerned. Or maybe I'm a lazy reader, considering how acclaimed the book seems to be. In any event, I can't recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I expected","review":"I would not recommend this book. I truly do not like to give a negative review, but this book was a huge disappointment for me. I feel sure it was probably just me; I understand that people's tastes and reading topics differ greatly. It was very depressing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ellen Foster was dissappointing.....to say the least...","review":"Ellen Foster wasn't well written, in my opinion. Not only were Kaye Gibbons' thoughts abstract and random as they were written, but they were disorganized and confusing to read. The subject material and the focus of the story with its many themes was not original (however fine). As another reviewer mentioned, \\"there is not a quotation mark to be found\\". This I agree with completely. This makes the dialouge hard to follow. Without at least a slight sense of order, the story loses its power, influence, and impact."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yawn","review":"This might be a great book if I could have gotten into it but it just bored me to sleep. I tried SEVERAL times to get into the book but it was completely forced, and I couldn't do it. If the book description on the back sounds interesting to you, then give it a try, but if someone gives it to you saying you just have to read it, make sure you really want to do it, cause it may be just a big waste of time."},{"rating":"1","title":"GOOD PLOT; POORLY WRITTEN","review":"I don't like to have to wade through a book, but I surely had to wade through Ellen Foster. Does lack of punctuation throughout (especially quotation marks) establish one as an author? Very confusing story. Incidentally, not by any stretch of the imagination can this be referred to as a \\"novel.\\" It is barely 145 pages in length; I believe that constitutes a \\"novella.\\" I read so many upbeat reviews about \\"Ellen Foster,\\" I hurried to my local library to check it out. I have very gifted grandchildren, any one of who could have written this \\"booklet\\" so that it flowed for the reader. If this is the author's established style of writing, I do hope she isn't planning to afflict us with a second story. This was a good plot gone to waste."},{"rating":"1","title":"SLOW GOING","review":"I STARTED READING 'ELLEN FOSTER' A FEW DAYS AGO..I THINK IT IS VERY SLOW AND HARD TO KEEP UP WITH...I THOUGHT THAT AS I GOT INTO THE BOOK IT WOULD EVENTUALLY SPEED UP, BUT IT DID NOT..I MAY TRY AGAIN LATER.

I just loved it!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A book that leads to nowhere","review":"This book follows the life of Ellen. Growing up in the south, her life is filled with racism, abuse and neglect. It seems that all Ellen wants is a place to belong.I found Ellen Foster to be a very depressing book rather than the uplifting book that it was rumored to be. The writting is hard to follow espesially during Ellen's narrations of her conversations. The book is deeply soaked with symbolism, making even more confusing.Overall, I guess that this just has to be a genre that you enjoy, for you to like the book. If you like Scifi/Fantasy like I do, this is not the book for you! Instead try the Golden Compass or The Once and Future King."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shudder","review":"This book made me feel icky when I first read it for a seventh grade class (I went to a very progressive middle school). I remember saying that it felt like the author just got severely depressed halfway through. My teacher then told me that I was very perceptive because the author was actually manic depressive. No surprise there. Basically just a novel that gives me an ominous feeling. Would never recommend this book because of the very strange feeling it gives me. Why do books like this always end up on Oprah's Book List?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Surprised","review":"I was so pleasantly surprised by this book. I had an 11th grade boy who was suppose to read the book but didn't want to (not really an 11th grade boy book) so I ordered on the kindle for him to listen to. I read the book along with him to help him through it. I couldn't help myself and read the entire book over the weekend. I think my passion for the book helped him get through it. It was so touching. While I wouldn't recommend it for a 11th grade boy, I told him to stick it out as the ending is great and he did. I would recommend it to any female. As a mom this was especially touching and culturally relevant for teaching values."},{"rating":"2","title":"intrigue","review":"I found that it was an easy read and held my interest throughout the entire book. Fun characters, not too graphic and a good ending. I would recommend this to my friends."},{"rating":"1","title":"Insulting","review":"I would just like the Amazon website to know that it is verypainful for me to see Peter David being given credit fora Harlequin romance novel he didn't write. I did a search under Peter David and this book is listed under Peter David's name, but Peter David did not write this novel. This is a production of someone named Kay David, not Peter. If you would correct that it'd be great, thanks."},{"rating":"2","title":"What you don't know about your kids...","review":"In Not Much Just Chillin', Linda Perlstein illustrates some of the important themes of the critical 11-13 age group through five frustrating, endearing and ultimately fascinating kids at Wilde Lake Middle School. Everybody can relate to the complex feelings and relationships revealed through Jackie, Eric, Elizabeth, Jimmy and Lily, but what parents will find most fascinating is what is going on in the lives of their middle-schoolers that the kids believe is \\"too much\\" for their parents to deal with. Perlstein effectively weaves in advice for parents and other adult figures in kids' lives and includes interesting notes from psychologists, teachers, sociologists, and other experts on \\"tweens\\". Written with humor and compassion, \\"Not Much Just Chillin'\\" is a must-read for anybody who deals with this age group."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a typical middle school","review":"This author fails to accurately identify the environment of the school where she did her research. It is more reflective of an urban environment than a suburban one. The school consists of a population with many more students who are what would be considered at a low socioeconomic level than students who are middle class. She does a poor job of reflecting a true picture of schools which are typical suburban schools in the area. Hmmm...would I want my child attending a school where some reporter goes into a school and is allowed to do this? Also, reporting inaccurate information on classroom situations is just one of her many errors. Sensationalism is what sells books and she sure uses that in her attempt to portray middle schoolers. DO NOT BELIEVE what you read! She is a reporter for a newspaper."},{"rating":"2","title":"What an accomplishment!","review":"Perlstein's book is a journalistic triumph. The author succeeds where most of the teachers and parents in her book have failed: she gets a group of conflicted, self-absorbed, perfectly normal middle school students to tell her the truth about their lives. It's a damning portrait of the mediocre education these kids are receiving, and a caring celebration of who her young subjects are on the road to becoming. The book is sensitive where it should be, and highly critical at times as well. Perlstein occasionally offers direct advice to her readers, but the most useful guidance she provides is by her example. She has found a way to listen, and we should all be grateful."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not Much Just Chillin, a great read...","review":"I picked up Perlstein's book, intrigued after reading a story about her experience in the Washington Post Magazine. I was enthralled and read it cover to cover. It's a book for everyone interested in today's middle schoolers, whether they have their own children or not. I was intrigued by each character she got so close to. I'm grateful to writers like Perlstein. This book is a must-read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as I was expecting","review":"I suppose I was looking for a \\"how to deal with it\\" from an someone educated in the field. This was more like a \\"here's what happened in this school\\" book. I was left saying to myself, \\"That's what happened in that school then. What about what is happening in schools in other regions of the country (which makes a huge difference), and how does a parent successfully respond to the changes and conflicts that my kid is going through?\\" Some of the story lines were interesting, but did not help me at all. I regret buying the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Hidden Lives of Jewish Children only","review":"This book is not beneficial to any teacher who teaches school in the USA. This book just makes middle schools who are not raised as Jewish appear as if they struggle, meanwhile the Jewish students are illustrated as good, wholesome, regular students, with regular adolescent problems. This book was extremely bias and unbelievable. I would never recommend this book to anybody working on becoming a more effective teacher."},{"rating":"1","title":"Choose another book","review":"This book reads as if she has personal attacks to make on people involved in education, not as if she spent a year in a school. The book says she spend a year \\"immersed\\" in a school, but then in an interview she say she spent days here and there in the school. That's a lot different, and it's important to read the book from such a perspective, because if you are replying on the information to learn something about middle schoolers, you should know how much research did and did not go into this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"what was the author thinking...","review":"the author seems to think following these kids around and writing about their issues in what she describes as a rough school, suggesting it gives herinsight on how middle schoolers act. Hmmm...maybe middle schoolers in Columbia,Maryland...but, consider there are many areas of the United States where kids have different middle school experiences. What was she thinking in writing a book about middle schoolers? What gives her expertise in the area? Has she parented a middle schooler? Is there really anything different in this book that hasn't been written before? Not worth the time!"},{"rating":"1","title":"same old stuff!","review":"If you have experienced being a parent of a child in middle school, you realize this book is just one of many on the subject. However, this one appears to include some really poor information in that it cannot be applied to all kids this age. The author has no idea how stupid this book sounds. Not worth the money!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good paleographical primer","review":"This is truly a 'pocket-sized' book, but well-made. It's a good introduction to paleography, and I've found it very useful. I use this in conjunction with online resources, which I appreciate but just aren't the same to me as an actual book. I purchased this one to aid in genealogical research."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Classic Work on Werewolves","review":"100 years ago, Montague Summers, a Catholic priest in England, penned a five-volume history on the occult that covered vampires, witches, and, here, werewolves. Summers takes both his theology and his historical accounts very seriously. Make no mistake; he absolutely believes that black magic is real, and he is out to convince you. What makes his work so refreshing today is that it is unabashedly erudite and boldly, almost defiantly, orthodox. You don't have to agree with him to learn deeply from his research. People love him or hate him; personally, I can't get enough of the man. Get all five volumes!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Werewolf Dissertation","review":"This book is written like a thesis paper. It's littered with so many quotes (and all are in the original language) and personal anecdotes by the author that you are left frustrated and utterly lost.I picked up this book because I enjoy the lore and legends behind things that go bump in the night, but this written well above the average readers comprehension level.This book is definitely for those who enjoyed De Litanea Minore.Didn't get that? My point exactly."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overratted","review":"I cannot understand all the positive reviews for this product. Not only is this product a bit tedious to use and an extra step to diapering - you have to spray dirty diapers before depositing in the diaper pail, but I don't sense much difference than not using anything at all, after using this for several months.At the price, it makes more sense to just spray diapers with Lysol before depositing. Don't waste your money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic Christmas Gift!!","review":"My daughter was THRILLED with this Bible for Christmas!!!

You will be much better off."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth owning, so add it to your library. Just wish it had the ESV.","review":"For the serious Bible student on a budget, this is a good buy. It combines four purchases into one, but in a unique format that allows you to compare them side by side. This is what is known as 'value.'Buy this, and use it. You will be glad you did.I applaud the choices of four unique translations, each with its own purpose and bent.I only wish one of the translations was the ESV. I think I would give up the KJV to get the ESV, and keep the other three translations.You can make up for the missing ESV by purchasing one in the Classic Reference Edition for your daily devotional and study use, then use this parallel bible to supplement your study."},{"rating":"2","title":"Big, Beautiful Bible","review":"I purchased the leather covered version of Today's Parallel Bible based on the reviews of the hardcover version being a glued binding. I purchased it from a Amazon seller and saved $30 off the $90 price. I would pay $10-15 more for the leather cover over the hardcover price of $50. The layout is great and the mix of the 4 versions that I really wanted to study from is fantastic. It is just so cool to read along in your favorite version, but be able to check out how the others read as well. It is really helping me get understanding of the KJV as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Outstanding","review":"Another outstanding production from Ely. The lyrics evoke images and feelings fully supported by the melodies.

I think the zoom is good as well. The only problem that I have found is that when recording on the slower setting(which gives you more time on a disk), it is not recognized by the computer or the dvd player. You have to play it thru the recorder. But overall, I am happy with the purchase. It fits in my jacket pocket and is perfect for kids ball games and other activities!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth your money","review":"My old Sony Hi8 is getting a bit ancient and it is time to replace it. After researching dozens of digital camcorders, I decided to obtain one with records on DVD so that we can easily play our recordings on DVD players. I settled on the DC100 as it seemed to be a vert good middle-of-the-road model that should have been good enough for my family and casual use. I also had very good experiences with Canon digital cameras.The end result is that this was a disaster. While the DC100 is cute and small, the bottom line is that:- the picture is very grainy- colors are washed out- video playback is choppyBased on this, I am returning the DC100 and moving to a MiniDV-formatted camcorder, probably one of the Sony model."},{"rating":"1","title":"Be Very Cautious About Buying a Canon DC100","review":"1st, I bought the camera and then all the accessories so I had well over $500 invested. It doesn't even come with a blank disk or an extra battery.I spent thousands of dollars on a trip to Germany, Austria and Venice Italy. Purchased the camera because of its high rating, superior lense and image stabilizer that my last digital camera didn't have. I carefully read the entire users guide because I like to use all the features. Camera operated fine for the length of one DVD RW, then it wouldn't read any of the other disks of the same brand. Spent money and tried other disks to no avail. Then downloaded contents of the disk to a laptop, and reused the disk - that worked fine - one time. Ended up having to borrow someone elses camera.The movie and pictures I did get to take were grainy and the stablizer didn't help a whole lot. This camera is a major disappointment so beware.JVB Michigan"},{"rating":"1","title":"DVD Camcorder","review":"The features of the camcorder are user friendly.

To me, CANON stands for CANNOT."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is jumk","review":"I bought this camera and got very little use from it. Now the power adaptor is not registered by the camera and will not charge the battery. I bought an external charger and the charged battery runs the camera but will not finalize the disks to be used by another device. Another adaptor that I bought does no better.

The work is thrilling, exciting and \\"can't put down-don't want it to end\\" reading."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good book","review":"I started reading the Skye O'Malley series back in early series. I have all her O'Malley books up but excluding her newest book that was just published. All her Skye books were great up to her book Wild Jasmine,after that I only bought the books to keep up with the series. When I read Darling Jasmine I could not believe her to be the same woman that she portrayed in a Love for all Time. She forgot all of her own children,grandchildren and focused on one Jasmine. I wanted to here about her other grandchildren,but I guessed that if she had done that the series would never have been completed. This book and her earlier ones are my favorites in this series. I hope that in her next book that she writes about Fortune and her family and how Skye's family did in the new colonies. But I'm rambling now, but I just wanted to say that I have had this book since it came out in the eighties and I still have the book ,creased but in good shape and I still read it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Love for All Time","review":"I absolutely loved this book, especially as I had read the two previous books in the Skye O'Malley series. Even though this story can stand alone it has so much more meaning if you have read the Skye O'Malley Saga from the first book. I love the way Bertrice Small interweaves her fictional characters with the real historical people of the time. Just when you think everything in the adventure is over and you are now at \\"Happily Ever After\\" time, the plot thickens and your are on to more wonderful adventure. It is hard to lay the book down. I am now reading the fourth book in the saga."},{"rating":"2","title":"This book ROCKS!!...","review":"This is the first Bertrice Small book i've ever read and I must say that I was satisfied. The characters were well developed (though I did not particularly care for Conn - I prefered Jarvid Khan).I feel that Conn should have been a bit more active in the book. I really felt the book, and was rather disappointed that it had to end. I liked the love scenes. They were really intense and well written. I also liked the fact that the historical background was well written and accurate.Aidan had me laughing and rooting for her, I especially liked when she tried to kill the sultan.Ms. Small I think you did a great job, and I can't wait to read more of your work."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bummed....","review":"This review is for people who have already read the first books in this series. This book and it's characters started out very enjoyable; Conn was a very likeable gentleman & Aiden was a sweetheart. They seemed a good match & their romance was true.Unfortunately, as the plot got underway, the book followed the original \\"Skye O'Malley\\" so closely it became predictable. It was almost boring to read b/c Aiden had endured almost the same journey as Skye. Reading this the second time around wasn't as thrilling or nerve-racking. I know loyal fans are blinded by their love for the author, but this is a skippable story in the series, IMHO."},{"rating":"2","title":"CONN! WOW- WHAT A MAN","review":"The Skye O'Malley series just keeps going and going. Another excellent story from Bertrice Small. I think I have read enough about Harems though. This book was a little more graphic than the previous books but I'm not faint at heart so I enjoyed the story. There will never be another Skye but I liked the fact the Aidan finally showed some spunk. Conn was a dream come true I think for most women. I wouldn't mind a man like him around. This book has ALOT of sex. I would recommend this book if you like a plot that keeps on turning and I can't wait to read the next in the series."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Definitive Oswalt","review":"Of the 3 solo CDs Oswalt has released so far, this is the best.

It's just not that funny. There's a few good moments, but nothing to support all the five star reviews.

There isn't a bad routine. For me, the gems are \\"Death Bed\\" and \\"Physics for Poets\\". However, I can say I honestly laughed with every track.I like the inclusion of the DVD as it allows you to watch the genesis of the material. Patton is a distinct physical presence and that adds to the humor.My husband rarely finds any stand-up comedy funny.

Buy it.Immediately."},{"rating":"2","title":"You know a comic is good when he can take on hecklers this well.","review":"Patton's stand up line is always a unique experience that takes the pop-culture of today, and bends it over with his nerd perspective on life and his way on surviving it. Even when a (probobly drunken) heckler opposes his act, he retaliates to make the joke even greater then before, which is the true sign of a comedian that can take any situation and end it with laughs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Way too abstract for me","review":"I didn't finish reading it. It was too abstract for me to follow the plot. And the tone is so angry that it's not even really believable. Maybe it would've been believable in the 1960s, perhaps as sort of a companion to The Yellow Wallpaper."},{"rating":"2","title":"Princess Kaguya's Lover & Casablanca Memory","review":"I got this manga for the \\"Casablanca Memory\\" story, but it also has a 2nd story, \\"Princess Kaguya's Lover,\\" which is the longer story to this manga. \\"Casablanca Memory\\" is a love story between Rei and her father's aide, Mr. Kaido. I like this one, I prefer the non-man-hating Rei, who is one of my favorite characters in the Sailor Moon series.The 2nd story, \\"Princess Kaguya's Lover,\\" is a love story between Luna and a human astronomer.

Joe Sigma 6 a worthy heir to the classic series. Sure, it contains action from the start to the end, but the character of the figures was all but neglected...Afterall I don't think Sigma 6 has much in common with the originals since only the names and the history... so it could well be name in a completly different way and is just an other Anime among others!"},{"rating":"2","title":"sigma 6","review":"one thing comes to mind this dvd is terrible it could have been better only five or 6 episodes on one disc dissapointing its a shame that there isnt a box set out for this series i enjoyed the new series and the classic series to it sucks it has been taken off the air i would have like the complete set of thise seires and series 2 as well to completer the collection of this set."},{"rating":"2","title":"GI JOE ROCKS","review":"This is a great revamped version of GI joe,its got some of the best original characters as well as some new members.

The animation is excellent and appropriate for the time in which it was made. Most of the characters are familiar but updated.

What a fascinating look into travelling the countries of Europe (and some in Canada and the US)! As we were introduced to the people met and made friends with along the way, the writer made one reading feel as they, too, had meet the acquaintances! I chuckled with them, I travelled along with them and I cried with Joei at the end of the book.This is well worth the adventure into reading and exploring other lands (not in the least textbook dry).

The behavior might be foolish but it is not nice to call someone a fool. My kids are young enough that these lessons are still a big deal and they aren't old enough to filter that kind of thing out.

The event of a fictional golf game is watched and recorded by a young boy who years later retells the story of the game to another young man. After the author takes us on a stroll through a southern golf course we come to the realization, God is every where, even on the links. The story is a metaphoric tale that puts the work of God into a human perspective. We also realize that we all possess inate abilities that often are lost by our earthly desire to conform with our environment. After reading the Legend of Bagger Vance you will want to begin working on \\"your\\" game and never again will you look at inane activities without considering the past. Great book should be read by anyone who loves the south, golf, history, and God."},{"rating":"1","title":"bagger should be bagged and dumped","review":"What a mistake it was to buy this book.

Buy a good biography instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very thought provoking","review":"On the whole I throroughly enjoyed this book. It's not the strongest writing and I thought the ending was too unresolved, but it does get you thinking. The idea that we don't \\"learn\\" golf, but we \\"remember\\" it was very intriguing.

Golfers, like Tiger Woods, are judged on who they are, what they become, not their skin color. So it is with Bagger, who is the Lord of our lives, who loves us unconditionally, and who helps Rannulph Junah discover the secret of golf and the secret of life all at the same time. Soon to become a movie, this tale, that will star Robert Redford, is truly golf's \\"Natural.\\" Golfers (like myself) and non golfers (like my wife)will be moved by the eternal teachings and truths taught by Bagger and Steven Pressfield's story. We should all be thankful to Steven Pressfield for his vision and caring."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lessons of a lifetime","review":"This story helps me deal with the frustrations of golf, and in life.

I had never heard of the book and was not really interested in reading another golf fiction book when I picked it up, even though I was a serious golfer.

First, the golf scenes are long and extremely detailed. You need to have some basic understanding and appreciation for golf in able to digest much of the story. Second, I found the author's use of metaphors extremely heavy handed.

There are a number of positive reviews, so I may be missing something ... but I doubt it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretentious and Boring","review":"I bought this book with great anticipation, based on customer reviews and the fact that a major film was being made of it. While part of the novel was entertaining (bringing Hagen and Jones to life in a fictionalized way) the main premise was absurd and not entertaining. This book tries to portray golf as a metaphysical/religious activity instead of the wonderful game that it is. I revere \\"Golf in the Kingdom\\", with which this novel has been compared, as a classic study of why golf is an intellectually stimulating game. I threw \\"Legend of Bagger Vance\\" away when I finished it. It's not even worth passing on to a friend."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what was promised - and no reply to complaint","review":"The book.... is a great read!

And there's a good reason - the style is witty and transfixing. You won't find a capital letter, the word \\"and\\" written out, or many completed sentences. What reads is something like a confessional poem constricted into paragraphs, creating real intimacy around Mara. Which we barely need considering the vivid specificity of her life. Witness the scene in which she outtalks a sleazebag on a train in six languages - it shows Mara's prickly independent streak while reading like a mournful memoir. Still, it's hard to deny the book loses steam as it goes along. Luckily, its first half is so enticing, you barely notice - there's enough steam left over."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pirated copy?","review":"While the information in this video is pretty good, it's a pirated copy or at least the quality is terrible.

I used this in conjuction with a Frommer's guide on my first trip to NYC this past fall and I hardly opened it once I was there. It gives nice histories and interesting information but next to nothing in the way of practical, useful information, especially for a first trip. If this wasn't listed as a \\"travel guide\\" I would have rated it higher, but that is not the case. It gives almost no recommendations on what to see, where to stay, where to eat, etc. Once you find yourself somewhere this guide is useful in reading about that particular spot. I think this is more fun to read if you're not actually going there just dreaming about going there. I plan to sell my copy and never use another Eyewitness Guide for a trip, though I might buy one for a place I'd like to \\"see\\" but never plan to travel to."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Old Book","review":"This was a book from my past that I wanted to share.

Also, the running time of the video is a disappointment, it is incompatible with the asking price.Very poor product. NOT RECOMMENDED!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Voigt tries something new","review":"Fans of Cynthia Voigt will still be engaged by this book, but it's something new. While her Tillerman stories were propelled by wonderful characters who faced real life dilemmas in ways that were true to life and themselves, and the Jackaroo series took those same skills and blended them with 'fantasy' elements, here Voigt's focus is less with the characters than with artistry of style and retelling an ancient myth believably in a modern setting. She certainly succeeds, and the reversal of the Orpheus and Eurydice male/female parts was a nice touch. That said, this book falls a little short of what Voigt can do with story lines she dreams up herself. I recommend A Solitary Blue or Dicey's Song (both in the Tillerman series)--if you liked this, you should like those as well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Couldn't finish it.","review":"I got to page 35 of this book before putting it down.

Donovan's come-ons were far from subtle and the teasing went way beyond humorous - it was pushy almost to the extent of stalking or forcing himself on Liz. And the painful secret that has Liz scared to death of any sexual intimacy is so obvious to the reader, and it should have been to Donovan too. The first 100-125 pages were a struggle to get through. However, the story did improve by leaps and bounds once Liz revealed her secret to Donovan, and he became patient, tender and understanding. He changed his approach to expressing his love for Liz and getting her to accept that she is worthy/capable of being loved, and to admit that she loves him in return. The ending was redeeming and heartwarming."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not that great","review":"Barbara Delinski is a great author, but this book was one of her worst. I could barely get through it.

No help. Also the manual says to click on ez audio converter.installer.pkg but it isn't on the disc. I only have a file called install.exe that opens adobe image reader but then tells me that parts of files are missing so I can't open it.

When I'm done I can't hear any hiss and very little of clicks and pops common to records. It is a great way to preserve old music and clean up the noise generated from dirty records.The only drawback is the physical size, I think it could have been designed on a smaller footprint. It takes up a lot of shelf space. I would rate it 5 stars if it were a bit more compact."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth it!","review":"This is a piece of crap. If you really love music and the way it sounds, this will horrify you.First of all, you can't use it without exporting the songs to iTunes -- which, if you know anything about iTunes, means it's impossible to get out of the program unless you burn it to CD first. I planned to record and then clean up my vinyl. To do that I will have to first convert each track from an MP3 to a wav file, burn it to a re-recordable CD, then pull it into a clean-up program, then reburn it.But the worst problem is that the LPs don't lie flat on the turntable because it's too small, causing the LPs to wobble and create an \\"off-center\\" sound -- in other words, \\"sour.\\"If you love music as I do, you will be sorely disappointed in this joke of a turntable.

I ended up using Audacity (which if I remember correctly came with my system but I had used different software to record before) and Audacity, once I got it working worked ok except that it only exports in WAV and not MP3.

Once I found this is was easy to repair and the unit now works as intended.Construction seems pretty delicate and I wonder how long this thing will last. But perhaps you get what you pay for. The audio seems adequate but I'm not a sophisticated judge of these things.

Information is better retained when logically delivered. This has become a favorite on my bookshelf and now I am purchasing it as gifts for friends. My thanks to the authors."},{"rating":"1","title":"Riddled with mistakes","review":"Although this is an enjoyable read the book is absolutely riddled with unacceptable mistakes. Carbon dioxide once dissolved in the sea forms the carbonate ion which combines with calcium (not carbonate) to form calcium carbonate (p.12). P.67- the cape of good hope is at the tip of AFrica not South AMerica. And lastly (I have only read to page 80!) the positive charge of the water molecule is on the hydrogen not oxygen (negative on oxygen), and the hydrogens in water don't bind to one another-like charges repel each other , not attract. The hydrogens (+) bind to the oxygens (-) to adjacent molecules!!!!!!!!!! Ugh!!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Oceans","review":"I bought about 5 books at the same time and this is the 3rd book that I have read. It is full of lots of information but I am finding it a little slow to read. Kind of text book reading. None the less full of useful information regarding the Ocean from the beginning of time! I think it is a good building block for someone like myself trying to delve into the Science of the Ocean."},{"rating":"2","title":"Finally, a good answer to the problem of evil","review":"This book requires the reader to think deeply. Not only does it require deep thought, but it also requires the reader's willingness to rethink long-held ideas about evil and the source of evil. What this book gives in return for the reader's effort and willingness is an answer to the problem of evil that is biblically sound. Dr. Little has done an amazing job of making a difficult topic comprehensible, much as C.S. Lewis did in many of his books. Read this book. Think. Search God's Word. You will find your effort and willingness greatly rewarded."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Real Treasure","review":"This CD was truly an unexpected surprise. The sax playing and compositions were wonderful and the musicianship was just great throughout the CD. It's one of those records you can listen to over and over again.I have been around music most my life and I can really appreciate a terrific production, great care was obviously put into the recording and arrangements.This was the first CD I have heard from Amedeo, but it won't be the last. I would strongly recomended this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect compact keyboard","review":"I don't have room on my desk for additional clutter. This is a perfect keyboard for small spaces. Be aware that it is very similar to a typical laptop keyboard, so if one has difficulty using this size, then would not work for you. I have an average hand size, which should also be a consideration. Also like a laptop keyboard, it may not be comfortable if you will be doing hours of typing.Additionally, I love the sleek appearance and the crisp response. I have several keyboards for my collection of PCs...this one is my favorite."},{"rating":"2","title":"An excellent effort!","review":"Paul Cain has written a wonderful book, profiling 39 of the outstanding figures in the struggle towards gay acceptance and rights that went on from 1940 to 1990. All of these chapters were the result of his drive and desire to get to know these people. Along with his personal interviews, he did an enormous amount of research which makes each chapter a thorough study of each individual. The book includes chapters on such lights as Rita Mae Brown, Frank Kameny, Troy Perry, Miriam Ben Shalom, Dorr Legg, Urvashi Vaid, and many more. It's well worth the money! Just in time for gay pride, too!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Quick game","review":"Compared to the other Guildwars games, this one has the shortest campaign, and the story was kinda dull.

With an expansion announced for this winter and a whole new game, Guildwars 2, announced, the only reason to buy this one is if you find $40 on the street and can't hold on to it until Eye of the North comes out. Longtime players will want it simply to round out skills and for the sake of completeness, but there is no reason the guildwars universe can't be fully enjoyed without ever setting foot in Cantha."},{"rating":"1","title":"MediasToday Ripped Me Off","review":"Well, I ordered \\"Guild Wars: Factions\\" and it came the same day as my new laptop.

It takes place in a stunning area called Cantha. This is a fast paced game meaning that you should be able to get to the max level 20 asap. Unlike the original the tutorial is very weak taking you all the way up to level 14 monsters in the beginning. Two new classes are added,assasin and ritualist. The assasin uses daggers as a main choice. They come from the shadows and strike with attacks that can cause crippling, bleeding and dazed. Ritualist on the other hand controls spirits and can give a variety of buffs. There are approximately 14 missions. Their is alliance battles where you can choose to be a Luxon or a Kurzick. To sum it all up this one is more for experienced players."},{"rating":"2","title":"Guildwars will always be Guildwars","review":"This game is great but not as good as the orignal.

I got my game from Wowhead and I don't understand why they even sell the game used if it's not playable and non transferable. Isn't that illegal to sell it?Just a warning.I'm sure the game itself is great but now I have to keep the game and repurchase another key from online (a whole new game) because my returning this would cost me more than what I paid for the game itself. So, I'll just keep the physical copy of it and reorder a new copy from online. But it did NOT save me money.DO NOT BUY THIS GAME USED FROM ANYONE!!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Jambo's trust worthy reviews!","review":"This game is absoulutly awsome!!!There are hundreds of different skills to choose from and 8 different proffesions.You can choose another proffesion to learn, aswell as your first.Say if your a ranger you can make a pet and set traps for enemys to fall in, and all the other proffessions have their own trick like curses and fire, water, ressurecting the dead and some others.Get it, it's so cool."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pffft - No Thanks!","review":"I gave this a one because the graphics are good, but the game itself fell extremely short of my expectations.

It just isn't any fun. It's too hard for lower level characters, and the real people in Factions you get in PUGs are for the most part worse than the PUGS in Prophecies. I particularly hate the fact that you can't start a quest then come back to it, but have to start all over. I also dislike the \\"stacked\\" quests where you have to run around the countryside forever to get one quest done. Overall, I am fed up with Factions and am going back to Tyria and work on getting some titles."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ritualists ruined pvp Random Arena","review":"The ritualist is one of the new professions that comes with factions. It is the only profession that allows you to create multiple spirits that do damage, blind, interrupt, heal, evade melee, steal health, knock downs and other things. Its an army all it self. So instead of 4v4 in random arena you and up with 4v5 or even 4v6."},{"rating":"2","title":"Guild Wars Review (Factions)","review":"This supplier provided timely shipping and the product came as expected. I am a big fan of Prophecies so I knew that I would enjoy Factions just as much. One huge perk to Guild Wars is that you don't have to pay for your online play like you do for other online role playing games such as WOW."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good addition to Guild Wars","review":"Adding any campaign to your guild wars account will always open new doors. Offering more skills, professions, items, and content in general, factions expands the guild wars world for your characters in a large way. In terms of PvP, alliance battles are still around as of the usable faction you get. Although I don't really like the whole megatropolis, overpopulated, plague mutated Asian theme, its a very fun and occupying game. and hey, at $[...], why not? you'll be hooked for hours. and since Guild Wars 2 got pushed back until 2010/2011, there will definitely be enough time to play this campaign."},{"rating":"2","title":"Decent addon to the Guild Wars franchise","review":"This is a good expansion to the Guild Wars experience. Along with a whole new continent to explore, you also get 2 new character types to use...the ritualist and the assassin. They key gameplay difference between this a the original Guild Wars is that you level MUCH quicker in this game. You can max out in several hours of playing time. This is because all of the missions and quests are much more difficult that in Prophecies and you will encounter many more high-level enemies in the beginning of the game. Another cool feature is that you can carry Prophecies characters into the world and Factions characters into Prophecies once you reach a certain point in the game.This is also a standalone game. It works well in conjunction with Prophecies or totally on it's own. If you liked the original Guild Wars game, you will love this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Addition to the Saga","review":"Guild Wars Factions is a great immersive online game that is just as entertaining as the first Guild Wars. What's nice about Factions is that you don't need the original game to play, it's a stand alone game. The plus benefit to the Guild Wars series is NO MONTHLY FEES! Which is great for people who can't really play very often."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as Good as the Original","review":"Movie sequels always have trouble living up to the original. Factions is the same way. Prophecies was so wonderful that I guess a good expansion was too much to ask. The game is bugged, bugged, bugged. Truly an aweful disappointment. I have trouble thinking of any good things about it. Most people start characters in the origanal game and go to Factions to goof off. Maybe someday they will fix the bugs, but I doubt it."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the most interesting technical finance books availabl","review":"This book is very thought provoking and in my opinion is right-on. Interesting reading for an often dry subject. If only most accounting courses could be this interesting.However, with the amount of bookeeping that is illustrated and the advance of household computers over the past 15 years, I think many a reader would be better served to get an updated version that has some computer programs to supplement the reading material."},{"rating":"2","title":"You must read this book!","review":"I thought I knew everything about personal finanace, because all the other books I'd read said the same things: pay off your debt, save 10% each month, and use willpower when you budget. WRONG! This is the best approach to managing money I've ever seen. It helps you to actually use your money effectively and develop plans based on what you need and WANT. This book does not recycle the same stale, predictable, unrealistic rhetoric of finances - it questions everything we've been told by \\"Dad and Uncle Ralph\\" over the years and looks instead at what makes sense right now, today, this minute. The advice in this book is practical and immediately useful. Suddenly, it all makes sense!"},{"rating":"2","title":"An invaluable source on how to handle your finances.","review":"After reading this book I'm no longer out-of-control or in debt. I've learned the fine art of budgeting, investing and most importantly, how to fund (not save) for the future. This book is a must-read. I've given away every other book I purchased on personal finance because I don't need any other. The funding concept is so simple I can't believe I never heard of it before. It's changed my way of thinking about managing money and living BELOW my means.

I really enjoyed him as the exterminator in this film. He has a certain over-the-top knack for performance that makes him an indespensible character actor in any role that must be played with intensity.He has made many important screen appearances in the X-Files, Alien 4, \\"Exorcist III\\" as the Gemini Killer (1990), and Gríma Wormtongue in Peter Jackson's The Lord of the Rings trilogy (and many others). His unique acting style made all these films special for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lasts forever","review":"I have had my solidtek keyboard for about eight years. It's still works great - even as I write this now. The size is perfect for my purposes. It sits on a tray partially under my desk at work, and my mouse has a perfect 4.5 inch square space right next to the keyboard, replacing the space that would otherwise be taken up by the numeric keypad on a standard keyboard. It's very comfortable for typing. I spend a lot of time writing and this keyboard is very comfortable to use. There's no fading either; the writing on each key still looks new. It is, however, kind of gross after eight years of use and so I am replacing it. But it still works just as well as when I purchased it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awsome Read!!!!!","review":"Awsome book! It is a great read. It includes a boy who runs away from home.

It is funny, intresting, and overall a fast paced book."},{"rating":"2","title":"This book was wonderful","review":"It was cute, romantic, extremely creative, funny... in a cheesy way of course, contained very likeable characters, and was vivid in detail.Where else can you find glowing crystal caves, castles with walls made of teeth, a forgetful tooth fairy, a silly troll who mixes up modern sayings, and a princess who picks her nose?This is definitely one of my all time favorite books, and although essentially it's for mid-to older teens and females, I truly believe everyone can and will enjoy at least one aspect of the book, if not the entire book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Predictable and mediocre...","review":"As someone who enjoys original fairy tales, I had some pretty high hopes for this book.

Christian grows and soon tires of his non-existent social life. He yearns to go to the castle across the river, partly because of the excitement, partly because he has a crush on the young Princess Marigold, who he has been spying on with his telescope. Ed reluctantly agrees to let him go, and before he knows it, he befriends Marigold and finds out her secret.

It began promising enough but it became an annoyance quickly. The author flits from idea to idea and never really follows a cohesive story through. Also, readers beware -- the author has filled the book with a lot of words that most adults never come accross in a book. I found myself reaching for a dictionary quite a bit trying to define the \\"oh-so-smart-and-look-how-clever-I-am\\" vocabulary. To compare this to Princess Bride does that book a disservice. Bride is cleverly plotted, fresh, intelligent, witty and satirical. This strives desperately to be all of those things and falls flat.

He falls in love with the princess after spying her through his telescope and exchanging anonymous p(igeon)-mail, eventually being hired to work at the castle, where he learns of Queen Olympia's plan to marry off Marigold and claim the throne for herself.

Christian writes a letter to her and gives it to one of his pigeons to take to Marigold. They wrote to each other like this for a year. Then, he decides to work at the castle.Working at the castle had a lot of dangerous things happening. First, a housemaid kissed him. Then he found himself talking to the princess.

It is an old-fashioned kind of sotrytelling--deliberate, quiet, subtle. Maybe that's what some of the other reviewers are reacting to.The characters are sincere and believable. The exchanges between the Chris and the princess by p-mail (carrier pigeons) is absolutley lovely in this age of grown-up authors trying to replicate teenagers' instant messaging lingo (ugh!).

Shortly after Christian arrives at the castle, he finds out that Marigold's mother plans on killing her and her father the king so she can rule the kingdom herself. Christian and Marigold try to put a stop to her, and in the end they finally do and the two of them have a very happy ending. Towards the end, Christian discovers a secret he never knew about himself that could effect his life.

Because of the shape of my truck bed an the position of the wheel wells, the rack only functions in the higher position. IE, I cannot position the rack into its lower position (which was one of the selling points and why I purchased the rack in the first place).Thule has a great concept in this rack but I give them poor marks for not fully researching its capabilities/usefulness on different truckbeds.

It takes you to such a deep, rich place that you even forget about Mesut Ozgen's amazing technique, your daily busy-ness, and which century you are in.I am not good at commenting the details of piece by piece, but most of pieces are only by single instrument of his guitar, and that is perfect.I particularly love the first one \\"Anatolian Folk Song\\" and \\"Shenandoah\\"--so beautiful! Each of sounds from strings are so clean and so expressive, showing his genius and his technique.Highly recommended. Very lovable to different groups of people with varieties of tastes in music."},{"rating":"2","title":"If you like it sad and tender","review":"If you like to invest in 45 minutes of tender and sad music, this is one you should try. The use of strings is pervasive and carries the melancholy and sadness very well. The piano's role is minimalistic, almost monodic; very appropriate. There are hardly any long, memorable melodies, but rather phrases that are treated in different ways and linger (something most gfilm composers do, as a matter of fact). Forty five minutes for a CD might seem short value nowadays, but with this music, it is just about perfect.I have heard this only once, but suspect it might grow with repeated hearings. Even if the subject matter is tragic, this is not tragic music, rather, it is full of sadness, tenderness, poetry and no self-pity; as it should be.Ah, Sylvia Plath; what a tragic figure she was, but how current and compelling."},{"rating":"1","title":"Missing a lot","review":"I am using this book to bring myself up to speed on a project that combines Velocity with Struts.

Most of the velocity commands I am able to figure out pretty quickly without the book, which is good because every time I try to find something ($link.setAction for example, which is needed to obtain the URL for forwarding) it's not there.

In addition it was a pretty complex story, but then all of PD James' stories are pretty complex with the guilty party barely noticed. I got to the point, where I could usually figure out the guilty party from the very first few scenes. It was always the one you least suspected, and s/he generally came on at the beginning of the story.I generally enjoy all of the TV James mysteries except the fast spoken language is very hard for an American to catch on to, especially those with a dialect.

They even tack on an introduction to The Maidwith the Flaccid Air to make you think you're about to hear some rare aircheck; it isn't.And finally, there is NO discography provided whatsoever-- for obvious reasons Collectors Choice Musicdoesn't want you to know ahead of time that this V disc presentation on CD is just so much smoke & mirrors."},{"rating":"1","title":"I fell asleep for 20 minutes...","review":"I don't know what I was hoping for when I started this movie, but all I got was disappointment.Horrible acting coupled with treacherous dubbing really did it for me.

Character development had limiting ceilings. Personalities were oil drenched cardboard. The bikers' unrelenting death wishes were devoid of spice and reality, which distracted from the plot.

I bought it in hardcover and I wish I had held out for paperback. This story has great potential but is so bogged down with medical jargon it's hard to concentrate on the story. I felt like I was back in science class.I think all the french and english mixed together is getting old to. It's hard to tell because I was so distracted trying to learn my degree in anthropology the story became secondary. I think based on her other 2 books she has great potential but Kathy Reichs needs to remember we're just everyday folk not scientists or anthropologists.I think the best advice she could get would be KEEP IT SIMPLE."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another excellent Tempe Brennan novel","review":"Once again, Reichs delivers a fantastic Brennan novel. I like the way the characters age and develop as the series progresses. So many characters seem to be stuck in a time warp where they have one adventure after another but never seem to move in time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Eh, all right","review":"There's nothing particularly wrong with Kathy Reichs' DEADLY DECISIONS, but there's nothing particularly right about it either. The plot, centered around a number of biker gang-related deaths, is serviceable, but I never found myself engrossed in it. I just wasn't that interested in who-done-it. I kept plodding through hoping to get hooked somewhere along the way, but closed the book after the last page thinking \\"so what\\".Reichs is a decent writer and her descriptions of the types of icky things a forensic pathologist does were interesting enough, I suppose. I won't say I'd never read another of her books, but I surely won't be rushing out to buy a first edition."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good....but....","review":"I almost enjoyed this. I felt the plot was thin, the characterizations shallow. I think Ms. Reich compensated for the lack of depth in her story by filling the book with long passages involving very detailed descriptions of highly technical subjects.

I would have preferred more life in the characters and the plot."},{"rating":"1","title":"Uninteresting, unconvincing and unsubstantial","review":"Being a bright forensic anthropologist does not mean a succesful crime fiction writerIn light of the author background and loving hard boiling crime fiction I picked this book with great expectation looking for its \\"added value\\", that is elaborated scientific explanations through the analysis of forensic evidence discovered in circumstances that encircle a well crafted crime fiction plot. Unfortunately I was utterly dissapointed, that was not what I have found, and many times along the chapters was uncertain whether or not to put this book downIn exchange for my \\"deadly decision\\", I have come upon a bunch of dull cardboard characters, careless writing syle, useless and fluffy house chore details and unevolved portraits of places and situations in a unclear attempt to run an inside story of the underworld of outlaw biker gangs"},{"rating":"1","title":"What a disappointment!","review":"Kathy Reichs' first book was excellent, her second a good follow-up, but alas not her third. If you are looking for information - on forensics, anthropology, cranial implants and heaven-knows what else - then you'll probably enjoy it. Personally I prefer a good story, and characters I care about. Deadly Décisions has neither. Ms Reich seems to lack the ability to weave information into the plot without the reader feeling he/she is being lectured. Wading through this morass of facts, I convinced myself the book was a slow starter. It wasn't: it was a non-starter, predictable, guessable and utterly putdownable. So if you're thinking of reading Kathy Reichs for the first time, go for Déja Dead or Death du Jour - and give Deadly Decisions a wide berth."},{"rating":"1","title":"Deadly Dull!!!!!!!","review":"Liked the first one am so sorry I spent money on this book.

Never wrote a bad review before, but couldn't resist on this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Action Packed","review":"This is the third in the series, and it was still brought down by too many coincidents. Another mystery involving the Montreal and North Carolina. Perhaps Ms. Reichs needs to travel a little bit, spend some time in other cities to give her fresh (and less coincidental) plot lines. Her forensic writing stays fresh, though. And this one has more perilous action than number two int the series. A good read!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Who Cares?","review":"I kept hearing about how great Kathy Reichs was -- \\"better than Cornwell\\" they told me. Hooey! If this is an example of her exciting books, I'll pass.

Having read her other books the thorough descriptions of the places she works and lives get a little tedious, but for the uninitiated it's a necessity. I like her 'human' experience within a bizarre occupation, 'living amongst the dead'. Kathy own outlook on her occupation make it a very 'real' read."},{"rating":"1","title":"A FORENSIC TEXTBOOK","review":"An I the only one who found that this book read more like a forensic textbook that a novel?

Sorry."},{"rating":"1","title":"Deadly waste of time","review":"This is without doubt one of the worst books I have had the misfortune to come across. Reichs' command of the English language is nothing short of appalling . The smattering of French with its groansomely obvious English explanations left me smacking my head with disbelief that this pulp was published, let alone allowed to progress beyond the initial bad idea stage. I truly hope that the author is much, much better at her day job than she is at stringing sentences together.

It drags slowly for the first half, and never reaches anything approaching fast pace. Scribner needs to do better proofreading also, spelling \\"Shallotte\\" two different ways, using \\"television\\" in one paragraph, followed by \\"TV\\" in the next paragraph. And Reichs using French phrases detracts from the readability of the book - using the English equivalent would not have broken my concentration.Reichs book would be better if she dropped the French, dropped useless Ryan from the plot, and sped up the pace."},{"rating":"1","title":"A plot driven by long-distance coincidences","review":"Here's the formula: As Montreal's forensic anthropologist, the narrator encounters a series of grizzly murders - so far, so good. An old friend in the Carolinas just happens to have key information that allows a breakthrough - what luck! A dysfunctional relative from Texas visits as a houseguest, and just happens to have Texas-based ties to the culprits in Montreal. Inevitably, people associated with the perpetrators will physically attack the narrator, but through a lucky break she survives and cracks the case. This is the formula that Reichs uses in both her second and third novels, but it's a very tired and flawed plot structure. She needs to find some way to advance the plot without relying so heavily on a series of cross-national coincidences. This novel, which introduces us to Montreal's cycle-gang subculture, is better than her second, 'Death du Jour,' but still no match for her first novel, 'Deja Dead.'"},{"rating":"2","title":"Choosing this book is NOT a Deadly Decision","review":"This is the best Kath Reichs to date. She has written another highly readable, perfectly timed, and well-plotted book. The characters are real, the story is believable, and the plot if rapid. The story starts with a a bit of work dissonance for tempe; two bikers would be murderes are murdered and a 9-year old little girl gets killed in the cross fire of the revenge follow-up. Careful research, intense plot turns, high-tech gizmos --- it all adds up to a wondrful page turner. This is absolutely a book not to miss., The only deadly decision you could make would be to miss this book. Buy it, read it."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointing descision","review":"I was very disappointed with this book. I thorougly enjoyed Reich's earlier works and was eager to read Deadly Decisions.

After reaching the halfway mark I realized that this writer has very little story telling skills and a whole lot of a trendy topic, forensics. Long detailed descriptions of old bones and blood spatter patterns are given in a dry lecture style. I fear Ms. Reichs will lose her fans very quickly if she does not improve on the one main thing all writers of suspense fiction require, the ability to sustain suspense without piling on the details.

However, I must admit that I was very disappointed when I purchased the unit online (EFA6835), the way they advertised it, I thought for the price, it came with the support bracket. That was considered an accessory and cost as much as the Column.

However, this was a very uninteresting read to be quite honest. The way the lyrics are described are at many times based on personal opinion and their meanings are no more in depth than you would get on a Metallica site with song meanings such as Encycmet. I'll admit, I learned a handful of cool Metallica facts from this book, but it certaintly does not make up for it's many poor aspects. If you want a good Metallica book, I suggest Metallica Unbound.

I figured that would be the end of the detective books I have come to love. If you are a member of Alcoholics Anonymous, do not read these books. Gratuitous imbibing was part and parcel of Sander's genre and thankfully Vincent Lardo has tempered down all the boozing a little! Even Archy is trying to cut down on his English Ovals!

Lardo has done an amazingly good job in picking up the threads. The plot was obvious, I had it figured out almost from the beginning. You need to work on that Vince.

I never thought that the McNally books were Sanders best work, but now that he's gone, and someone's taken over the series, I realize that Sanders did a better job with this series than I had thought.This book really needed an editor. There are missing transitions, strange references to events we had not read about, and a general lack of attention to detail.Also, I figured the entire story out very early in the game, and that's something I usually don't do. It makes Archy seem stupid, instead of just amusingly casual, in his detecting."},{"rating":"1","title":"Close, but no cigar.","review":"I will probably continue to purchase and read the McNally series, even though Vincent Lardo is no Lawrence Sanders.

They cannot think for themselves. They cannot see reality, so they need their proof demonstrated to them by torturing defenseless creatures(p.206).\\" The entire book consists of this type of emotionally charged but scientifically unsound propaganda.It's a shame, because I really believe that eating a raw food diet is one of the most healing things you can do for your body.

While Kurt and Joe are off investigating the death of an entire pod of whales, Paul and Gamay Trout find themselves in the midst of another mystery in the wilds of Venezuelan Rain Forest. The plots weave together and an insidious plan to take over the world's supply of water is eventually uncovered.This, of course, leads to Cussler's trademark derring do from his heroes and some nicely unique villians that are as sadistic as they are smart. When all of these elements are combined, what you get is a satisfying adventure thriller that turns the pages until you are finished and a thrist for even more Cussler tales!"},{"rating":"1","title":"not up to expectations.","review":"i have read a few of clive cussler's other books, dirk pitt adventures, and this is really a let down. it has a couple of funny lines, but that is about all. i would suggest \\"inca gold\\" instead. much better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not his best but still readable!","review":"The beginning was great I was hooked. the ending let me down though."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pass on this one","review":"I have read all of Clive Cussler's books and loved every one of them. Very entertaining light action adventure that is perfect for long boring airplane rides. I was looking forward to going on a new adventure with Dirk Pitt in Blue Gold, but what I got instead was [weak]imitation of the real thing. You may think I'm being too cynical, but some how I can't help thinking that collaborations like this are just a publishers way of pushing sub par writing by riding on the coattails of a well known and respected author. I can't blame Clive Cussler for trying to find ways to increase the income stream, after all, it's the American way. Maybe he even enjoys doing a collaboration. Whatever his motivations, I am not appreciative and feel cheated."},{"rating":"1","title":"Blue Gold","review":"Ok guys this one is worse than bad. The writing is sophmoric choppy short sentences with a failure to develop the story line fully. I have read all but three of Cussler's Dirk Pitt books plus Serpent and thoroughly enjoyed them all. Blue Gold does not even come close to an exceptable Cussler standard. I have to ask what Clive Cussler is doing putting his name on such poor quality work."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a let down!","review":"I have read the entire Cussler series and always wait in great expectation for the next book. This was a major fumble! The story line was typical, predictable and unimaginable. The villians and locations were put together as is they were a \\"made for TV movie\\" script. The only interesting part involved the discovery of the \\"flying wing\\" and even that led no where. I think Clive Cussler had little imput in the writing of this novel, and Paul Kemprecos pushed out a book with Cussler's name. Save the time reading this novel and find something a bit more riveting and original."},{"rating":"2","title":"Blue Gold","review":"This is a book by one of my favroite authors.

I was so riveted by the plots and subplots I couldn't put it down. The characters are so realistic that at times I thought I was watching a movie, I could visualize everything going on, and holding my breath every other minute.

I finished it way, way too quickly. I liked the way Cussler describes the importance of water and who controls it. I liked how the diverse elements of the story finally wove together to solve the mystery. WOW! I read Serpent earlier this year and suggest that if you like Cussler, be sure to read it, too."},{"rating":"1","title":"Blue Gold","review":"This book is a real let-down in the Clive Cussler series of novels from the NUMA files. The book has a contributing co-author(Paul Kemprecos), and it appears if he wrote the whole book. The main character, Kurt Austin, couldn't lick the boots of Dirk Pitt,Cussler's usual main character..The book is filled with unrealistic escapes from dangerous spots, and there are far too many coincedences to get the characters out of tight spots. The book gets maybe 1 star."},{"rating":"1","title":"His Worst Yet!","review":"The saddest part, after being a loyal Dirk Pitt fan for the last 15 years, is each book is now getting prorgressively worse. The plots are not only completely implausible and just downright stupid, but they are carried out by protagonists that could only exist in ancient Greek mythology. The simple-minded plot 'twists' are written for my nine-year-old to understand, but the problem is my nine-year-old is a smart kid, and he laughed out loud at the silliness when he read this. Cussler has entertained for years, but apparently used an Excel spreadsheet to do a side by side comparison when trying to come up with a new 'hero' for the new millenium. Take some time off, Clive, and go find some sunken ships instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good read, but dissapointing...","review":"This second installment of the novels with Kemprecos is readable but certainly not memorable. I don't particularly think that Cussler was much involved with this novel and it shows, the story line is just too tired. However, I read it and enjoyed it. A quick read, not much in depth and not much in the true 'Cussler tradition'. I would recommend the book, but just don't expect much from it. It is entertaining, but not very detailed. Hopefully, the next DirkPitt adventure will measure up to the other excellent works by Cussler..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Blue Gold","review":"Excellent story line, made it hard to put down!

I found the premise interesting and enjoyed many parts of the book but there were just too many coincidences and last second escapes to maintain believability. There was also too much of the villain having to spell out her scheme. Blue Gold is not horrible but definitely not up to Cussler's standards. Since later Kurt Austin novels get better I guess Cussler and Paul Kemprecos needed time to get the collaboration fine tuned."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not one of his Better Efforts","review":"Blue Gold is a really subpar effort by Clive Cussler and his co-writer (or maybe the co-writer is the real author, and Cussler just approved it). At any rate, the story is a confusing jumble of three or four different plot lines stumbling over each other. Let's see, just mix up lost Amazon tribes, white goddesses, evil pharmaceutical company henchmen out to destroy the rain forest, secret flying wing aircraft, and top it off with a plot to control all the world's freshwater. The sum is definitely less than the parts.Very weak writing all the way through. His other NUMA books are better, especially The Plague Ship."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT UP TO EXPECTATIONS","review":"Blue Gold was far below average for Clive Cussler's typical standard.

Austin and Zavala are a great team, although no one will replace Dirk and Al. I find only a few flaws in this book. Austin and Zavala seem to \\"win\\" a little to easily in this book. While I don't hope that they get hurt, it seemed as though they really didn't have to work at anything in this book.I do have to disagree with the Amazon.com's reviewer where it says that Zavala and Austin went into the jungle to find the \\"White Goddess.\\" This is completely incorrect, as Austin only sends a helicopter to get them out and doesn't meet the \\"White Goddess\\" until they are in NUMA headquarters.All in all this is a good book that ended too fast.

His new heroes Austin and Zavala, were only involved in about 10% of the story. The first couple of chapters were o.k. After that it was a very predictable story line. I miss Pitt and Giardino. Although I must say the last couple of Cussler novels have not impressed me that much. I hope Clive Cussler has more to give in the future. Regarding Austin and Zavala. Dump them.

It's obvious she doesn't want him anymore than he wants her. Yet marry they must. Honor and loyalty demands it. Slowly, the marriage that a King decrees turns into a love decreed by destiny.

I think not.The tediously flat characters are mere coat hangers on which to hang slim apercus. But they are works of genius compared to the plot -- a nothing of an idea. There was, however, a truly disturbing element to the book: the author's unwitting cruelty about Mirabelle and his general lack of perception and insight made me wonder what kind of sadistic impulses and inner blankness Mr. Martin could possibly be suffering from.I have nothing against Steve Martin as a comic. His middlebrow brand of humor harkens back to an older, simpler time. It's Ovaltine for the masses. But I do resent paying good money for this extremely pretentious, meritless novella.Anyone who praised this book should try reading more frequently."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ridiculous","review":"This book lives up to the saying \\"You can't judge a book by it's cover.\\" By all outward appearances this book seems charming and appealing. Upon closer examination however, you will find a book about the kind of people about whom no one wants to know. The storyline had great potential, and it could have been a wonderful work. Unfortunately, Mr. Martin felt he had to make his story more appealing by adding countless instances of sexual encounters. This was the only way to keep anyone remotely interested in the novella. It really could have been a wonderful, heartwarming story, but there was so much sex in it, it was impossible to see the storyline. Mr. Martin should not try again, unless he can add something more substansial to his stories in future."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shopgirl","review":"\\"Shopgirl\\" is written by the very well-known comedian Steve Martin. It is a small story about a wallflower-of-a-girl who sells gloves at Nieman Marcus in LA.Shopgirl is only 130 pages long. I finished it on one leg of a long plane ride - and I read pretty slowly. So it's definitely a quick read, which is a plus.However, the writing itself is not impressive. Steve Martin does not have a good flow to his sentences. Also, the story is also very \\"blah\\" and uninspiring.The complete 180-degree transformation of Jeremy seems highly unrealistic. This guy goes from 26-year-old slob to GQ-gent nearly overnight.If this book did not have \\"by Steve Martin\\" on it, it would not have been published. I think people are over-praising it because it's written by a famous comedian, not because it's a great book.So while I applaud Steve Martin for trying new things, he really should stick to what he's best at - making movies."},{"rating":"2","title":"Poetic","review":"In a million years I wouldn't have expected something like this from the comedian that I have enjoyed for so long. I knew he was talented as a comedian and actor but I never knew that his talent stretched to this avenue. This book is so beautifully written it reads like poetry. It isn't a long book but that doesn't cause a lack of depth in his characters. There are books out there 700 pages that don't give the depth that Shopgirl's 130 pages give you. I felt like I was watching Mirabelle live her life in 3-D as I read this. Read this book simply so that you can see this other side of one of the funniest men alive. You won't be able to help but enjoy it. I am adding this to my mental list of favorite reads."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Different Side of Martin","review":"I first stumbled upon the writings of Steve Martin when I began subscribing to the New Yorker. His skill with the pen is incredible! When I learned he had written a novel(la) I couldn't wait to read it. I was surprised to find that his writing style for fiction is different from his shorter pieces. His story of Mirabelle is dark and a bit depressing. There are glimpses of classic Martin here and there. One of my favorite parts was when Ray and Mirabelle have the \\"no commitment\\" talk. It depicts perfectly the different ways men and women perceive the same speech. There were no problems per se with this book. It is just a bit odd to read such a dark piece written by the same man that brought us THE THREE AMIGOS! However, give it a shot. It is the summer, after all, and time for a little light reading."},{"rating":"2","title":"a short and sweet study of society","review":"The most amazing thing about this novella, which is full of meaning for a materialistic society, is that it is the realistic account of girl with girl problems and girl thoughts, being told by a male author. It's brilliant, truly.I would honestly recommend this book to someone looking for a compelling AND intellectually stimulating read. It'll only take you a couple hours to read, but when you finish you'll find yourself thinking for hours more about the commentary contained in this wonderfully short, emotional story. I doubt it will be what you expect, but it will surely NOT disappoint."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pleased, very pleased","review":"Steve Martin is an American gift to all of us. An enduring talent in comedy, drama....and literature. I was delighted with this little book. Ever since choking on Afternoons With Morrie, I have have been a little hesitatnt to pick up these short little \\"quick money\\" books. This one came well recommended. Mr. Martin's insights into the modern American culture and the kind of personalities formed by it are profound. I identified with the character Ray. Fortunately, I became sensitive to the complex subtleties of the female psyche long before 50, but I found myself reflecting with some sadness upon the hurtful mistakes I made in past relationships. Mr. Martin is able to capture the essense of both the male and female condition in a light, airy style. This is a book that you will think about when you are done with it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well...You Wouldn't Know Unless You've Been There","review":"The picture on the cover is a little misleading...Mirabelle doesn't, as described in the book, seem as well put together as the woman on the cover depicts, but all in all a very thoughtfully written book about the grandiose concept of good relationships. I have been in Mirabelle's shoes, hence the review being a little jaded, but I thought Steve Martin has eloquence and wit as he writes about the frailty of a woman in her late 20's in a world of pain and discomfort. Anyone who's experienced loss, depression, and the sheer trauma of losing themselves in others, should thoroughly enjoy this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"&#65533;As vacuous as an Easter Island of Barbie Dolls.&#65533;","review":"Couldn't have said it better myself, Steve. This is a disappointing book from the man who brought us The Man with Two Brains, Dead Men don't Wear Plaid, The Jerk, etc. The characters have no point of view of their own, the narrator's - voiced like the wise-guy from My Blue Heaven - is relentlessly snide and smug.The quality of the writing is further marred by a so-so third person, present tense which would have been better presented as simple third person, past tense. And the dreaded \`which' was used to the point of tedium in place of some rephrasing to avoid the problem.There is plenty of good humour in Shopgirl, but at the expense of some in-depth writing to have the book be more than a novelty exercise. I would suggest that Steve Martin go read some Nicholson Baker before he attempts another book of this type."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice Job, Mr. Martin","review":"I just wanted to say I really loved this book.

Shop Girl recently became my all time favorite book, moving Go Ask Alice by Annonymus to a close second. Why was shop girl so good you ask? Martin writes with a style that is intriguing and makes you want to read more. The book possesses an overwhelming amount of truth about relationships, sex, love, emotion, life, work, depression, etc. that makes it unique. It was a relief to find an author that was not afraid to tell the story how it would happen in REAL life . . . with all the details and vulgar language. But in doing so, Martin explores the most sensitive of topics and then proceeds to say all the things people think but are afraid to share. Shop Girl is simply brillant and a book that everyone needs to read . . . it make a great gift and is a quick read. Steve Martin gets my vote as an author and I give Shop Girl 5 stars!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Very Warm and Charming Read","review":"Steve Martin has once agian proved his talent in his latest, Shopgirl:A Novella.

But, when a man old enough to be her father named Ray Porter enters her life, her tasks are soon put to an end, fore he like so many others is strangly attracted to her, and can't put his finger on why.

It suffers from LA hipness (the plunking down of the \\"f\\" word often enough to remind those of us who are not from Hollywood that we must read this word and read it often in order to be cool) and it never rises above a one-dimensional treatment of any of its dull, flat characters.

He's just using her for sex while he looks for somebody better (because he is immature for his age...wtf?), and he lets her know that he's banging other women and he keeps buying her gifts and doesn't realize or care that he is hurting her. GROSS. Finally she realizes she's being used and somehow still remains friends with him, and he starts thinking of her as more of a daughter.Ya, right! This is very offensive."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love this book- love Steve Martin!","review":"Loved this book! I had seen the movie first so the characters easily played out in my head as I read. This is the first I've read anything written by Steven Martin and anxious to read more.He doesn't have to be 25+ years older and a millionaire to feel as he did towards her, wanting to love and care for her yet get too close and give too much of himself. I've been there in Mirabelle's shoes giving everything only to be held at a distance but we learn and grow from that taking the next step of what lies ahead.This is one of those books knowing I was nearing the end, I didn't want it to stop but continue on knowing where Ray ends up, the future of Mirabelle and Jeremy. Fantastic book!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Love Steve Martin, Indifferent towards this book","review":"I'm glad that I listened to this book on cassette because only Steve Martin's voice reminded me that this was his \\"novella\\". I love most of Steve Martin's work, but I couldn't figure out what led him to write this piece. The sex is fairly explicit in a way that serves to interpret the experience from the girl's point of view, and I guess that makes it justified. The author does an admirable job of creating a character, but not one worthy of her own brief novel.The story is nothing particularly original: a girl in LA finds herself in relationships with \\"the older professional philanderer\\" and \\"the immature slacker coming-of-age\\".I've followed Steve Martin's work from banjo and stand-up, through The Jerk, to Pure Drivel, and if the name wasn't his, I wouldn't know this book was his either."},{"rating":"2","title":"A fantastic Read","review":"Shopgirl is a delicate, thoughtful, perceptive novella. Steve Martin's writing is truly beautiful. Mirabelle, his protaginist, is so detailed and familliar that I wondered if I knew her or if I am her!! There are sentences and observations that jump off the page and deserve to be read either out loud or over and over. My only disappointment is that it isn't a novel. I wanted to keep reading."},{"rating":"2","title":"a nice read by someone unexpected","review":"I shouldn't really say unexpected. Anyone who's seen LA Story and Bowfinger knows this man is really talented at capturing his characters, and the character of L.A. In fact, those stories, and this novel, essentially capture life in LA in all it's shallow brilliance, the way Sex and the City does the same thing for New York. If you like stuff like that, you'll enjoy this read.This short book (just 130 easy-reading pages) is specifically about a relationship between a older man and a younger woman, but in capturing this specific relationship, Martin manages to right a little about all relationships. Martin narrates the story with a kind of sweet detachment, yet dead seriousness that just kinda warms your heart. It's definitely a pleasant read, and a nice chance to see what else this man is capable of besides always being funny.Recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not that great","review":"I picked up this book because I like Steve Martin. I think he is smart and funny. This book is neither. I caught myself praying that Mirabelle's doctor would abandon her and cut off her mood-altering drugs which would lead to her grabbing a gun....--but not before she offed Mr. Ray Porter. I wasn't expecting this to be a wild and crazy book. But I was expecting something interesting."},{"rating":"1","title":"slashmywristsgirl","review":"I'm writing this several years after I attempted to read Shopgirl. I put it down about 2/3s into the book. I couldn't drudge through it anymore.Well tonight I went out with a group of friends who all wanted to see it, so I said, \\"OK.\\" Can I just say, it's a much better movie than book. Yes, it is still sad to watch the characters desperately try to connect, but I must say, I can wade through that for a couple of hours in a theatre easily vs. spending several evenings living through the tragedies of Ray, Jeremy, and of course the Shopgirl. There are some beautiful things to take from this story and some points that I think most men and women should ponder; I would just recommend catching the flick with a few friends and then talking it over at your local espresso bar."},{"rating":"1","title":"There's no \\"there\\" there","review":"I could hardly get through this long short story. The dry, impersonal narrative didn't engage me at all and made me not give a hoot about the cartoonish characters or the story. There was no build-up, no moving forward. It was clinical, sterile writing. I found no humor in the story. If Martin was trying for any kind of pathos, it eluded me. There seems to be the makings of a beginning of a novel here, one that was aborted and published without being finished. An outline or start of a character study for a better novel, maybe. But in and of itself, a weak and uninteresting try. In my humble opinion, this book would not have received any attention if it weren't written by a well-liked celebrity."},{"rating":"2","title":"Unusually Good","review":"This book is way out of what I normally read, but on someone's advice I picked up a copy to read. This book reads like a Steve Martin monologue, which is great. It is witty, funny, charming, and a great reminder of why I do not live in L.A. Thanks to Steve Martin for a book that is funny, alluring, and smart. Too many books out there try to be romantic and funny, but never come close, Steve Martin does both, and does it well. Good Reading! B+Joseph Dworak"},{"rating":"2","title":"Shop Girl","review":"This story was touching, poignant and uterally delightful. Steve Martin completely described this young woman's fragility and her determination to have better life. His role was captivating as he wanted it all with no commitment yet he was drawn into a real relationship. Kudos, Kudos, Kudos!"},{"rating":"2","title":"transporting","review":"Just finished listening to Mr. Martin read \\"Shopgirl.\\" I am so sorry not to have his company transporting me out of the mundane traffic of suburbia-the story was such a mental treat."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bland Shopgirl in a Bland Novella","review":"I bought \\"Shopgirl\\" because I really really like Martin's other Novella \\"The Pleasure of My Company\\". I found Shopgirl to be mediocre compared to the other book, and it just kind of left me feeling \\"eh!\\" I like Martin's style, his witty humor, and his observations about daily life, but the ending left a lot to be desired. There was such a build-up to what would ultimately come of Ray and Mirabelle's relationship, and the resolution is thrown into 5 or 6 pages. I would have liked to know more.If you're thinking about getting \\"Shopgirl\\", opt for \\"The Pleasure of My Company\\" instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"I wish it was better!","review":"I am a big fan of Steve Martin, the actor, though found this book very disappointing. I expected something clever and somewhat interesting, but it was neither. I found the story to be extremely generic with very little to offer. The characters were so simple that I pictured cartoon characters in my mind's eye. If your looking for strong character development or even a good story, go elsewhere. I wish it was better."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good first step into the literary world","review":"Sad and sometimes funny, this semi-autobiographical novella by Steve Martin (yes, THAT Steve Martin) is actually very good. The book focuses more on the female protagonist, and not the older man (Martin). The older man comes off a bit pushy, a bit needy, a bit mean, which is surprising, but he comes off very, very real because of it.A very interesting book of (somewhat) fiction from a comedian - a good first step into the literary world."},{"rating":"2","title":"A pleasant surprise.","review":"I had this book for a long time just sitting on a shelf. I read it when I was out of books to read. I was surprised and really enjoyed it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Still waiting","review":"Let me start by saying that I am a huge fan of Steve Martin, as an actor, and as a writer. I am also a teacher of writing, a novelist, and an avid reader. I loved Cruel Shoes. :-) But I think somebody should have told Steve to write his second novella before publishing this first one. The authorial distance is so far on this I feel as if I am looking at his characters (especially Mirabelle) through binoculars. I can find no reason to give a hoot what happens to these characters.I'm not sure why Mr. Martin chose to tell this story from Mirabelle's point of view, but it would have been nice to give her a personality, at least. I'm having a hard time getting through this very thin book, and the extremely self-conscious tone, unfortunately, reminds me of that totally crappy bestseller of several years back, \\"The Bridges of Madison County.\\" Blech.I believe in you, Steve Martin, write in your OWN VOICE! I'm dying to hear it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just Don't Get It.............","review":"all the hoopla over this story, that is. It is short but I pushed myself to finish. On every page I was telling myself that certainly this would pick up in the very next paragraph. For me it never clicked. I just don't think it is all that great a story and I'm sorry I wasted my money on it. If you want to read it wait until it is available in the library. A much wiser decision than I made."},{"rating":"1","title":"Weak, weak, weak","review":"I'm not saying that if Steve Martin were not Steve Martin, this book would not have been published. It's not THAT bad. But if Steve Martin were not Steve Martin, I am quite sure that nobody would ever, ever have heard of it. It's a middling and pleasant book but still, there is nothing remotely special about it. Too bad."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for me","review":"The story itself was okay, but I didn't like how it was written. I'm one of those readers who would prefer to read an actual exchange of words between characters instead of a narrator telling me what they were talking about. This was what had made the book dull to read."},{"rating":"1","title":"An old man's fantasy","review":"Similar to his play, Picasso at the Lapine Agile, Steve Martin believes he knows more about people and their inner psyches than he really does. The heroine is only \\"beautiful\\" because she is non threatening and submissive. It seemed as if Martin was implicitly describing his dreamgirl and himself as the oh so complicated Ray Porter. Their relationship is labeled as the older man/younger woman scenario, but age has nothing to do with it. Were the characters more real and three dimensional, this would be a story about two people from separate classes, not age groups. Add the one dimensional characters Lisa, Jeremy, and Mirabelle's parents, the story is wanting and leaves a bad taste in the mouth of anyone hoping to gain some useful insight into the complicated relationships we all sometimes share."},{"rating":"2","title":"This book would have been great even if you didn't know who wrote it","review":"The fact that it is by Steve Martin is a distraction. In fact, the fact that it is written by a man is a distraction. This is a beautifully written portrait of a young woman, written with a lot of sympathy and wit. Some of the sentences are so well written it would send pangs of professional envy through the heart of any writer. The only thing I dislike about this book is that I know it is written by an older man who is quite rich, and the book is about a young woman falling for an older man who is quite rich, and that bit is really annoying as you wonder who Martin is fantasizing about. Take that bit out, though, it really is a very beautifully scripted tale and worth purchasing and reading."},{"rating":"1","title":"I Like Steve Martin But I Didn't Like This Book","review":"Older rich guy is attracted to young beautiful depressed girl. Treats her to his lifestyle. She thinks he cares about her, falls in love. He is just using her, she gets hurt. What a depressing story. And what is with Mirabelle's jealous co-worker shaving her pubic hair by rinsing her razor in the toilet? Is this just to point out how gross and unattractive she is on the inside, and undeserving of the attentions of the very selective Ray Porter? Basically an empty, heartless, meandering story. Can't recommend."},{"rating":"2","title":"Eloquent, Sensitive, Beautiful","review":"I never knew Martin could write so beautifully! As others have noted, in this work he flaunts his extensive vocabulary and brilliant use of the English language in a way that completely shocked me. His sensitivity and tenderness are very impressive. Throughout the book I thought, \\"how can a man possibly write with such feminine insight?\\". But it really works for him.It was refreshing to examine characters in such raw depth... to explore their inner motivations and fears. And best of all, while the tone is primarily melancholy, the ending is sweet and touching, but still realistic. The characters are able to grow as individuals and take their relationships to a higher level."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth reading","review":"I was surprised with the tone of Shopgirl- but wound up loving every second. I didn't want to put it down. It is insightful in its own special way- and that aspect is not alone in the positive attribute list of Shopgirl. I have to just say that it is amazingly entertaining. I think you'll enjoy it, but even it if wind up not caring for the style and tone, you will have been so entertained that you will not regret your choice to spend some time exploring Martin's work."},{"rating":"2","title":"delightful read","review":"This light hearted book introduced me to Steve Martin's writing. I knew he was a great actor, but he is also a wonderful writer! Despite the book's flaw (namely the lack of development on several supporting characters), we watch our heroine grow with tremendous anticipation and excitement. You couldn't put down the book because you want to know who is the secret admirer, what will the jealous co-worker do, etc."},{"rating":"2","title":"Of course it was great!","review":"Steve is a consumate pro. Shopgirl's great, and if you really want a treat, you should get ahold of the audio version of \\"Pure Drivel,\\" which Steve narrates. His discription of joining Mensa was sublime and deeply funny. His chapter about the sledghammer was outrageous (one man tried to bundle a web browswer with his)."},{"rating":"2","title":"And I thought he was just a \\"wild and crazy guy\\"","review":"Bravo Steve Martin. Once he shows another side of his many talents by writing a wonderul book for light reading. This could have been written as a memoir if I was the fact that it was written in third person. The main character Mirabelle tries desperate to hold to her wits. She's trying to become a sucessful artist. Working in Neiman Marcus in the most slowest buying area in the store. She must deal with immature \\"maybe\\" boyfriends and deal with handsome, dashing men who aren't sure what they want out of life. I was really that Mirabelle didn't end it all. Instead like true independent woman of today; she survives and moves on. Hey Steve, have you started writing the screenplay to this yet."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not satisfying","review":"Normally, I would never write a review of a book (especially one I didn't like), but I felt an obligation to the future customers who would see the (former) four-star review and be led to the conclusion that this is a good book. I didn't find it funny, I found it depressing and weird. Ray/Mirabelle's relationship didn't interest me whatsoever, and the closing of the book portrayed Mirabelle as a very shallow person. Who knows, maybe I'll like the upcoming movie (I do like Claire Danes..). Steve Martin is one of my favorite actors, but in my opinion (maybe yours too?), he should stick to that."},{"rating":"1","title":"I couldn't wait to put it down.","review":"While Martin's use of descriptions and scenary were surprisingly good, his characters (with the exception of the heroine, but only occasionally) are one-dimensional and their motivations are rather ordinary, and sometimes unbelieveable. I would recommend this book to persons seeking well-worn, sentimental, saccharine story-lines. Pessimists, such as myself, should save their money."},{"rating":"1","title":"was hoping for more","review":"I had a hard time making it through this book.

Do not waste your time."},{"rating":"1","title":"A total waste of time","review":"If this book had been written by a no-name average joe or jane, it wouldn't have seen the light of day. The writing is choppy & pretentious, and the story, if you can call it a story, leads nowhere. Immediately after reading this book, I read The Da Vinci Code. Now that book deserves all the accolades it has received!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Absolutely a boring chick-lit!","review":"This is definately classified as untalented chick-lit. I dont mind reading any chick-lit if it actually is meaningful and interesting. This book by the famous actor Steve Martin was terrible. This shows how poor his writing style could be.This Novella is about a woman named Mirabelle she works at a glove-compartment store in New York City and she has dreams of becoming an artist. All this book revolves around is her love triangle between the wealthy-businessman Ray Porter-who is a classified as a player and the junkie Jeremy. All it centers around is her love-life and how she gets over it-how original. I read this in one day on a plane ride to Detroit and I got so bored with it. Its amazing to see how stupid this book is.I dont really know how Steve Martin got away with writing this book, just because he's famous he can get a writing deal, its not worthing even borrowing from a library, there's nothing to it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A little weird, a little beautiful...","review":"This little book captured me and never let me go until the end. Steve Martin entertains us with the story of a young girl's odd relationship with an older man, while making us painfully aware of all the psychological inner workings and thought patterns experienced by the characters in the book..not a single one is without real problems. The language in this little gem is very harsh, and I tired of the four letter word, \\"f**k\\". Steven seems to enjoy that word. An interesting book, especially for those of us that are a little weird ourselves!"},{"rating":"2","title":"sweet and tender","review":"I was skeptical but could not resist to pick up this book, and I am really glad i did. it was an easy read but not without substance. intelligent writing mixed with tender insights and forgiveness. a great read."},{"rating":"2","title":"fun read","review":"I enjoyed this book. I read it this past weekend and I was very impressed. I have always liked Steve Martin in movies, but I never knew he was such a good writer! I especially enjoyed the way he wrote the different perspectives on the same conversation between a man and a woman discussing their relationship. He really seemed to understand the root of many common misunderstandings between men and women!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I'm a Steve Martin fan","review":"I am a steve martin fan so i am a little biased, but i really enjoyed this book. It was an extremely short and quick read, but i felt that Martin does a good job with the writing. It was quirky and oddly written at times, but i could definitely hear martin speaking it while i read. I like the idea that steve martin wrote from a young woman's perspective"},{"rating":"2","title":"Not what you would expect!","review":"Steve Martin's writing is simply intoxicating. He pulls you into the story with characters that you could believe and understand. This story focuses on almost a late coming of age story of a young woman named Mirabelle who searches for acceptance and love, yet within that process finds herself. It is beautifully written and not what you expect from comedian Martin."},{"rating":"2","title":"Shopgirl finds love and herself","review":"Steve Martin's first foray into fiction is an ever so slight little gem called Shopgirl. Mirabelle is the novella's protagonist, a full-time Shopgirl at Nieman's glove counter and part-time artist. Her two relationships in the story involve young, broke, and dumb Jeremy (who considers their running into each other at a laundromat their second date) and millionaire Ray Porter who is relationally immature in his own ways.In only 130 pages, Martin shows quite an evolution in all major characters and a fabulous stagnation in sex-starved supporting character Lisa. Martin has carefully woven wonderfully humorous insights into each of the characters, making them interesting and likeable, even when they sometimes aren't.I hope this is the first of more fine fiction from a clearly talented man."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect!","review":"What a beautiful charecter study this is! I loved every word of it. As I was reading it, I found myself stopping every once in awhile just to let it all sink in and smile at Steve Martin's words. This book is a treasure and I look forward to reading more works of this kind by him."},{"rating":"2","title":"ebb and flow","review":"I just finished Steve Martin's \\"Shopgirl.\\" What a great book. The only way I could really describe it was that it flowed so well. Truly, the reader can relate to the characters (either being one or knowing one like them.) With each page you really wanted to know what Mirabelle was going to do or how she was going to react. I certainly hope Mr. Martin continues writing fiction. I look forward to reading more from him."},{"rating":"2","title":"charming, intelligent, short & sweet","review":"I found Shopgirl to be a lovely little book, quietly surprising. I don't understand those who expect it to be hilarious, because Steve Martin is a funny guy -- or others who expect deep revelations. It is a well-written novella with some quiet but witty humor and some good insight and on that level it deserves five stars. The characters are well-rounded and the relationships propel the story."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money","review":"This book is so horrible there are no words. It's the first time I had to force myself to finish a book. It's crass to say the least. Don't waste your money on this book. I love Steve Martins films but his writing leaves much to be desired."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a Disapointment","review":"I found this book to be extremely depressing, and competely misrepresented as a romance. The pros drones on and on and on ... There is no emotional connection to the characters, and no drive to the plot. My advice ... pass this one up."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where have you gone, LA Story?","review":"I usually adore Steve Martin's work, such as with Picasso at the Lapin Agile and LA Story. He left me deeply disappointed with Shopgirl. The plot is very simplistic, the characters' motivations sketchy, and it just seemed he did not put the usual amount of thought into this novella as he has done in other writings. It also seemed to me that Martin focused more on describing sex scenes and making references to genitalia than any other aspect of the book. Then again, perhaps this is why it was a best seller."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where's MY book deal?","review":"All those reviewers giving Shop Girl five stars should get off their knees and read a real book. This isn't a novel, it's a synopsis of a novel. If I changed the title and names of the \\"characters\\" in this book, and submitted it to Hyperion, do you think they'd publish it? Not a chance."},{"rating":"1","title":"Slow","review":"This one reads more like a screen play than a novel (the film is actually being released soon). The story is a boy meets girl tale where Mirabelle, a young artist and clerk at Neiman Marcus in Los Angeles is courted by an older wealthy professional (Ray Porter) and a young slacker (Jeremy). The narrator recounts Mirabelle's meeting and early dating rituals with both guys by alternating female and male perspectives; highlighting the differences in perception between the sexes as it relates to dating. Although Jeremy is closer in age to Mirabelle he is the opposite of Ray in most every aspect. Ultimately Mirabelle must reconcile her love for the two men with what needs they satisfy. \\"Shopgirl\\" reminds me of the movie \\"Translation\\" with Bill Murray. I thought that film was boring and this written version of the same concept is not much better."},{"rating":"1","title":"If you ever get to talk with Steve Martin...","review":"...and you're at all attractive...don't think he's smiling at your witty conversation. This twadry trifle reveals what's really on Martin's mind. This book would come across differently if written by a young woman; but when \\"Mr. Happy Family Father\\" of several recent family films is writing - and thinking - like this, the best word to describe it is \\"gross\\". (The oh-so-verbal Mr. Martin would have used a more descriptive term, but this time, the lesser word fits.)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring, Boring, Boring!!","review":"I read this book back in 2003 and I did not write a review about it. Only recently I was reminded of how much I hated it and I was compelled to write one now. The character is boring and the plot is non existent. Spare yourself the misery and don't read this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Surprisingly Good..","review":"Steve Martin's \\"novella\\" about an otherwise annoymous shopgirl at Neiman-Marcus in Beverly Hills is a very well-written,unexpectingly touching story. The romance that she has with an older gentleman is realistic and the observations about the \\"rich & vapid\\" people that populate that particuliar area of real estate are well-drawn as well. The ending might catch you by surprize,but it makes the story more interesting and actually makes sense in a true-to-life kind of way. Yes,not only can Mr. Martin act,he can write as well..!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A fable with a dark side","review":"Mr. Martin has a real way with words - he's articulate, subtle and uses language like a layered paint brush. I appreciate the way he portrays his characters, giving them enough substance and individuality for us to 'know' them, but also permitting us the opportunity to fill in the blanks, to arrive at our own interpretations of just who they are in depth. It is a modern day fable. Mr. Martin realizes that fables are rarely truthful and he presents the dark side of the 'knight in shining armor' story. His presentation of depression as an aspect of Mirabelle's persona is very accurate. He appears to have a real understanding of the disease. So.....a lovely read, poignant, tragic and understated."},{"rating":"2","title":"Steve Martin In My Bed","review":"I picked up this book after reading a review. Quick and easy, I read it one night in bed. It was easy to get sucked in with what will happen with \\"the shopgirl\\" and I couldn't put it down till I found out.

I read it and passed it on."},{"rating":"1","title":"boring..","review":"Maybe it's the lack of much dialogue, but I'm having a hard time getting into this book. I started over a month ago, and am about half way through."},{"rating":"2","title":"Could not put it down","review":"This book is a wonderful read, I lost myself in Mirebelle she so needed a hero in her life and the surpriseing ending lets you know sometimes you dont really have to look too far for love because it was right there all along"},{"rating":"2","title":"In-depth Portrait","review":"I found Shopgirl remarkable for it's in-depth portrait of relationships. Steve Martin does an admirable job offering valuable insight into male-female, female-female and family relationships in the short form of the novella. Plus, Shopgirl is an entertaining and engaging read. The reader is immediately captured by the terrific character portrayals. The author manages to develop the characters with a brevity of words and without relying on caricatures. All in all, I was very impressed with Shopgirl and it's portrayal of relationships (in that regard I would rank Shopgirl favorably with \\"Fried Calamari\\" which offered a very insightful look into relationships)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not too bad","review":"I find the explicit language a bit offensive, but the story line was good enough to keep going to the end. I liked the insight into the male/female relationship, but somehow, I knew what was coming. I borrowed it from the library, definitely not a keeper for my bookshelves."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"...that's life...\\"","review":"I became engrossed in this book from the moment I picked it up. While it is set in Los Angeles, I think that anyone living anywhere can relate to some part of Mirabelles's situation. I almost always find what Steve Martin does funny, but not always moving or interesting. This book took me through laughter and sadness. I compared it to my own life and I could relate on many levels. I have read reviews of this book criticizing its length, I think had it been any longer I would have lost interest. Overall, I would recommend this to anyone who is looking to read a book about finding ones self."},{"rating":"2","title":"I shouldn't have liked this book....","review":"but I did. I usually don't go for the slice of life books about people and their psychological problems. But this one had such depth of insight (go figure) that I ended up caring a great deal about the characters.Martin somehow has figured out what goes through a needy girl's mind when venturing into the world of adult relationships. He also figured out how embarking (by chance, in this case) on the path of self-discovery, the explicit knowledge that _ideas matter_, can change a life. And he has figured out that a 50 year old man can be no more developed than a 25 year old - and the result of that.To those that think relationships are a great mystery, this book will give an insight. Not answers, but an insight."},{"rating":"2","title":"A pleasant way to spend a couple of hours...","review":"If you liked Steve Martin's movie, A Simple Twist of Fate, (he adapted the screenplay) then you will probably like this book. It was a fast easy read. I blew through it in a couple of hours on a plane. An interesting story about being alone in a world full of beautiful people, when you don't feel so beautiful yourself. The emotional rollercoaster of day to day life, when you wonder if the anti-depressants are still working and a coming of age story for all three of the main characters. It's a different side of Steve Martin, his intellegence and wit shines. It's a curl up on the sofa and waste a rainy afternoon kind of book."},{"rating":"1","title":"A sad commentary on a sad culture","review":"Martin, who has written humorous pieces in the past, writes a droll script of a girl's sad existence. As we would expect, Martin's keen wit leads to a sharp writing style that is well suited for this short book. However, this girl is not a heroine, she is to be pitied. She obsesses over sex and possessions, an indictment of the world around us. However, Martin doesn't write of her existence as empty -- but we can see it as such. She pines for a longing touch of a caring man, but engages in casual sex as if this will fill her empty life.How many will read this book, feel sorry for Mirabella, then ignore the sad visage in their own mirror?This is not a funny book, despite Martin's humorous ability. This is a crass, even crude (language) book that I would not recommend except for those studying the reasons for our eventual soceital downfall."},{"rating":"2","title":"decent, quick read","review":"This was a decent, quick read book. Since it was short, the characters weren't fully developed, but for a quick read I recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Seriously?","review":"I bought this book because I like Steve Martin movies and the reviews raved about this. When I got the book, I thought it was going to be a quick read. I was wrong. It took me about a week to get through it. The writing was elementary and, well, blah - much like the characters. I was a bit confused about Mirabelle's personalty and unclear about the Dad's friend role. Also, Ray Porter was sleeping with someone who he came to think of as a daughter...?? A bit disturbing.... I never laughed, not even cracked a smile. Maybe I just don't get the dark comedy.I liked the ending because it was finally over. Sorry Steve Martin!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Dragged myself through this yawn","review":"I love Steve Martin. But not this book. I found that there was so much distance in the voice of the narrator, very above it all, knowing, and very little warmth. Stiff. Forced myself through it and found myself angry toward the end because the entire experience felt like Steve Martin was memorializing some affair that he'd had in his life. The man seemed very much like how I imagine Steve Martin to be when not \\"on\\"--depressed, childlike in his inability to understand others. Then I started wondering if this book ever would have been published if Steve Martin weren't a celebrity. He's got a platform! Let's publish his book! Hey! He will make sure that a movie is made of it! There are far, far better ways to spend your time than reading this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Surprising!","review":"I'm very surprised that Mr. Martin wrote a book with a theme on the natural attraction between older men and younger women! Only Mr. Hefner and the Frenchseems to be honest about displaying this. However, I found the protagonist's insistence on being brutally honest about not wanting to be serious in the relationship extremely annoying and unrealistic. SHOPGIRL was a very interesting quick read.Katie"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing, Fell Flat","review":"The Short:It wasn't anything spectacular, or even all that great. If Steve Martin wasn't Steve Martin, I don't think this story would have seen the light of a publishing house.The Long:The writing was...stiff throughout the whole book and came across incredibly dry. There was no real 'voice' but more like something written for a textbook. There was also a distractingly constant feeling that Mr. Martin had received a Word-Of-The-Day calendar and was really excited to put it to use. As far as the story, I found the whole of it underwhelming and even boring. It didn't touch me in any real way, I didn't feel much for the characters, and it didn't make me think about anything in particular. It fell disappointingly flat."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Surpising Novel","review":"I, as many other reviewers, simply picked up this book as a fan of Martin's work. This bridge to being a novelist for Martin has been significantly set with this novel.Mirabelle is a character that many people can relate to on so many different levels. The way she approaches life is both astonishing, yet alarmingly familiar. Her relationships with both Ray and Jeremy are indeed as different as night and day...Ray is the man she longs to be with and she wishes for him to succome to his feelings for her, and Jeremy is the underdog who pops back into her life just when you think the ending is clear cut.Even is the story is not a cliffhanger of any sort, Martin's meer descriptions and phrases are outstanding. That alone will keep you hooked."},{"rating":"2","title":"A lesson in love, a lesson for life","review":"again, Shopgirl was a reluctant read for me at first because it was a required book for my retail merchandising class. Why? More like a modern literature class. Obviously, the store Mirabelle works at is Neiman Marcus, one of the best places to start in merchandising, probably why I had to read Shopgirl. After about the second chapter, I started understanding why Shopgirl is a book for girls wanting to work in merchandising: a cautionary tale. Then I started getting into Shopgirl, getting engrossed in Mirabelle's emotions. In the end, I'm a bit sad, because of the heartbreak Mirabelle had to go through to come to her lesson and appreciation of what she has. Wow. Overall, Shopgirl is a complete story packaged in a short and readable novella."},{"rating":"2","title":"Quick, few hour enjoyable read.","review":"This was an interesting look into a shopgirl's \\"normal\\" life. Neatly written, following along the lines he describes in the story of Ray's obsession with neatness and order. I liked this story I could not put it down without thinking, I need to see what happens next...I like the book size, nice, neat and comfortable to hold."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bob Can Do It!","review":"As always Bob has won us over with his newest DVD. First off, I must say I love the new CGI Animation that is used because it really makes the episodes bright, colorful, and more like regular animation. Bob and his team work together to start and finish projects and there are some wonderful themes within the episodes. I love how Bob is wholesome and yet not cheesy. My sons love the trucks and how each one has its own talent. This DVD also features Scratch who is a new character! This is definitely a great DVD whether your child loves Bob the Builder or just loves trucks in general!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Kid loves it.","review":"My son loves the Bob the Builder TV show, and he loves this movie, too. He often requests to watch it, even though he's seen it a million times.

The stunts on the 3 story building were phenomenal.

If I could select 3.5 stars, I would've. If you want to look for a story, you get a paper thin one but better than let's say a ong bak 2. The amounts of fights are bursting from the seams of this bd if bds had seams. The visual quality has since improved as the Ong Bak producers have been so successful and it can easily be seen. It's no watchman slickness or depth but tight nonetheless more on par with other asian released titles. But lets get to the action. Her image is best described as the Korean movie \\"fighter in the Wind\\" and Makoto in street fighter 3. She has the moves but she doesnt always have the impact. Fortunately It picks up later on. Giving a handful of surprises and crinches while emotionally being more engaging than all of Tony Jaa's works.

Not only are the action scenes remarkable and remarkably executed, the acting is believable and authentic.

Thats it. If you like Action. you will love this movie.Yeah the story is basic, Acting is worse..Unlike some, i enjoyed the first thirty minutes or so. Visually, i think it told the story well enough and conveyed the emotion. Maybe not perfectly, There are definite flaws, but it gets the point across. The child i thought did a good enough job showing expression. The first scene is kind of awkward, almost as if it belongs in a different movie, but that ends quickly enough, and sets up the finale.Action wise, if you like Ong Bak, or The protector, this is more of the same, much much more. There is definitely a natural progression. You won't be disappointed.THERE IS A FIGHT IN THIS FILM WHERE AN AUTISTIC GIRL FIGHTS A GUY WITH TOURETTES. Capoeira Style. That fight alone is worth the price of admission. Pay it and enjoy"},{"rating":"1","title":"clever premise, repetitive execution","review":"**1/2Zen (the spunky JeeJa Yanin) is a young girl with a crazy kind of autism - one that makes her all but inarticulate yet gives her near-superhuman skills in the area of martial arts. When her mother, a former-gangster-turned-straight single mom, is diagnosed with cancer, Zen uses her unique fighting skills to collect all the money owed to her by a band of cutthroat criminals.\\"Chocolate\\" is a damn silly movie at times, but there's no point in denying that there is at least some purgative and entertainment value in watching a sweet, innocent kid consistently beating the living crap out of a bunch of surly, burly bad guys - at least, that is, until the novelty wears off and monotony and redundancy become the order of the day.The martial arts sequences are exceptionally well done, but this overly repetitive Thai movie could use a little less fighting and a little more variety in its storytelling to maintain the audience's interest."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring.","review":"Sucks big time. Ong Bak movies are classic compared to this one. If you have nothing better then watch it but be drunk and it will be a classic."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad Movie w/ Good Fights","review":"To put it simply, this movie is what you call a bad movie, it is a few fight scenes away from a 1 star."},{"rating":"1","title":"Martial arts mediocrity","review":"I bought this movie because it was one of the only I could find on Blu-Ray. Visually the movie is great, but after that disappointment sets in. I thought this movie was going to be similar to Ong-bak the Thai Warrior. I was wrong. The action scenes are ok if you like matrix style wire fighting. If real butt kicking is what you crave then this is NOT the film for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Gimme my mom's maney! ha ha","review":"Too slow. Dark scenes.

The storyline starts of slow and the fight scenes are repetitive, uninteresting and bland. A muay thai autistic star? cmon thats garbage!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"an entertaining martial arts flick for all","review":"This movie is very entertaining. It is not going to garner any high brow artistic awards but, this story of an autistic girl who manages to harness her strength to help her sick mother is a winner. Granted, the plot was a little soap opera-ish but it was moving and the fight scenes were furious. I enjoyed watching this movie from start to finish. I did not enjoy the english dubbing on this version. I prefer watching movies in the original language with subtitles; thankfully, this movie is filled with much more action then words....."},{"rating":"1","title":"D+ for effort","review":"I wanted to like this movie, the premise is awesome. A young special needs girl goes Bruce Lee. Totally awesome concept, but it falls short of being a watchable movie, for me. The pace, the tone, the annoying subtitles that didn't match the dubbed English. Parts of the movie made no sense to me what so ever --Again, I think the best part of the movie was the trailer.I wish there was a rent option on Amazon Moises. I felt that I spent to much.There are B Movies, but this was just a Bad Movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"This sucks!","review":"The action scenes are good, very much like Jackie Chan's acrobatic style, but the colors and sounds and cinematography are just too low-budget quality to like. The story is too one-dimensional. There are no character developments. If you want a martial arts film that has all that, see Ichi -- that is the best martial arts film I have ever seen."},{"rating":"1","title":"kind of weird action import from Thailand","review":"This review is for the Amazon VOD rental of this film. I found this filma little off putting. The story line and action are pretty good but I foundparts of the flick kind of strange. The bad guy in the flick is surroundedby women who appear to be really men. I know it is not PC but that is justnot my thing. I thought it took away a lot from what was otherwise a fairlydecent flick."},{"rating":"2","title":"Expected Something Else","review":"The concept is fresh and interesting, but I was disappointed with the cheesy overdubbing. I heard of the film from someone who had seen it with subtitles and I believe that would have preserved more of its original character. In spite of that it was enjoyable."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Terrific Movie...","review":"I've read the other \\"less than five star\\" reviewers and I disagree (respectfully). This was an incredibly terrific movie. It has a story that builds and delivers THE most awesome action sequences throughout AND they just keep coming. I'm new to Japanese martial arts movies and only recently \\"appreciated\\" Quentin Tarantino's \\"Kill Bill\\" for the \\"genre art\\" that he successfully conveyed. I am so impressed with the production that was undertaken to make this movie! The story-line was good. The acting was very good. It is a terrific movie with acolades to the choreographers, the stunts, the sets, the martial arts production crew; all of whom left me very entertained and impressed..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Plot is whack... but who cares???","review":"Nobody gets these ultra-Thai action movies for the plot. you shouldn't either. This movie, on par with Tony Ja movies, is what all action movies should be: Pure REAL action. This movie takes it to an entire new level because it is a small woman that is kicking everyone's butt. I recommend Hollywood stepping up their game by having every Hollywood fight scene to be 100% real... with real consequences."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Martial Arts film","review":"I really enjoyed this film. The story line was very good, the action was awesome. The main character did an awesome job I think in correctly playing a character with Autism with an obvious savant trait."},{"rating":"1","title":"Absolutely RUBBISH","review":"I am so disappointed with this video \\"tutorial\\"... the author skips so many steps during the process of recording and for some odd reason expects you to just know all these things as if they're so simple you'd have to be an idiot not to know how to do it. He doesn't explain half the concepts for beginners such as \\"what do you mean by 'sending to a bus', etc.This has to be by far one of the worst video tutorials I've ever seen.

The market info was no use because it was very outdated."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book - lots of typos","review":"As usual, this was a great Patterson book. I love the Alex Cross series and have read almost every single one. I have ordered and read many books on my fairly new Kindle. My only complaint is that there are quite a few typos in this edition. They were so obvious that anyone in grade school could find them with no trouble. I doubt anyone proofread this copy. They seem to start in the middle of the book and continue till the end."},{"rating":"1","title":"What is so great about Alex Cross","review":"I must say that this book is suspenseful and quite a pageturner. However, I was left more than a little discouraged in the end.-SPOILER ALERT- Can someone please tell me what is so great about Alex Cross? What did he do to prevent the president from being assassinated? The answer...Nothing. The president was assassinated! How did he cleverly discover the I.D. of the other murderer...the 13 yr.old. The answer...he didn't. The killer had to call him to the house for the finale. I just don't get what is so great about Cross. He failed and so did the last quarter of the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"If Alex Cross tells me once more about the 'Mean Streets'","review":"I have now read all the Alex Cross series. I don't know why I persevered. I am so sick of Alex Cross telling me how hard he is, and what his Nana would have said.The general plot of the book is good. Perhaps the author could dream up another central character. Don't get me wrong I do enjoy books where there is a central character such as Jack Reacher (Lee Child's hero), or Bob Swagger (Stephen Hunter's character). When you read a book by Hunter or Child you attach yourself to the character. I can imagine what they look like and almost how they think. With Alex Cross I don't.To sum up though- good plot shame about the fairy of a central character."},{"rating":"2","title":"I loved the audio version of this book!!","review":"I am usually a person to read books, however I recently obtained the audio version of \\"Jack and Jill\\". It is fantastic! The reader keeps your attention by use of emotional inflection and even changes his voice for different characters.

Bravo to Mr. Patterson for encompassing his readers once again with his talent which makes the reader unable to put the book down."},{"rating":"2","title":"Unpredictable story lines in a great murder mystery.","review":"Couldn't put it down on vacation. Though his chapters are short, they do separate the two story lines in the book. Excellent job keeping my interest, which is hard in a book. The story lines were good and what happened in each was unexpected which makes it interesting. Will get his other books and read them."},{"rating":"2","title":"A lot of action and suspense","review":"The suspense and excitement was maintained throughout. It was an extremely fast read, especially since the chapters were only 4-5 pages each (which was a little different than I'm used to). I finished it in about 2 days. The storyline was interesting with a strange twist at the end. Overall, a fun book to read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great story, confusing ending.","review":"I've read all four of these books now, and I definitely found this one to be the most interesting read. It definitely gets impossible to put down as you try to figure out who is Jack, who is Jill, who else is involved, and who is the school killer (although I thought that could have dragged out longer).But after reading the very ending (not counting the Gary Soneji intro for the next book), I found myself saying \\"Huh?????\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Jack and Jill","review":"Once again Alex Cross proves to engage us on his quest to uphold the law and figure out the bad guy - Top!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Exceptional Author and Book","review":"Ok Now to undersatnd the concept of the Man Alex Cross you would have to read Along Came The Spider and Kiss the Girls.

And there is the Truth School Murders. A Sick Twisted Homicidal Maniac is Killing little Children that Attend Sojurner Truth Elementary School. Both of these very detailed characters are greatly written. they delve deep into there mind without surronding the novel onto them. The novel is not the most brilliant peice of Marksminship he has writtin but it is very suitable and ELECTFYING, It kept me turning the page after every single chapter until i knew i was done with the book.

(Maybe some of those pages could be used for further charcter developement or latent morality). Secondly, and most important, Patterson, in his novels, always tries so hard to get the reader to question the villians motives; however, once the motive is revealed I can't help but to say, \\"Thats it?\\" Patterson builds you up as if the reason for committing the crime is going to be some incredible reason that no one has ever considered before, yet makes sense. Nonetheless, once you understand why the crime was committed, you have to double check the cover and make sure your not reading a book in the \\"goosebumps\\" series."},{"rating":"2","title":"As always...amazing book from an amazing author","review":"My headline says it all, I have equally loved every single James Patterson book I have read, I am his #1 fan and this book...just like all his others, didn't disappoint me in the least!

I feel weary for Cross in this one and feel that the two plots of two different killers is almost too split. I began to feel sorrier for Cross and his family than I did for the victims at large. I liked the fact that the ultimate resolution to the main murder mystery was a surprise. The final action sequence felt a little forced to me. I couldn't quite figure out the details and quickly re-read it but just moved on as it didn't seem that important. I did enjoy the twist at the end with a good character. Nice!All in all it is a very good read but I felt it wasn't as well thought out as it could have been and only slightly split."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great Patterson Novel","review":"Jack and Jill is a great mystery that will have you on the edge of your seat and flipping pages madly. Not as good as the previous Alex Cross outing, Kiss the Girls, it still grabs and never lets go.Alex Cross is investigating the death of little Shanelle Green, who has been killed at the same school his two children attend. However, the following day he's pulled into another case, codenamed Jack and Jill.A respectable senator has been murdered by a duo. They begin killing other respectable people in Washington D.C., and it's suspected they might go after the president himself!What follows is a twisty page turner that will leave you with your mouth open wide. I especially found the identity of the school children to be disturbing.Read This!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A subpar book","review":"I am finding myself a bit tired of the Alex Cross series after this, my third book. I am tired of Cross' racist mother. I am tired of some of the ridiculous superhero elements of the hero, and I am tired of some of the strange habits of the author (for example, notice how many times the characters mention each others names while speaking to one another: \\"how are you Alex\\"? Fine John, how are you\\"? \\"I'm great alex. What's on your mind Alex?\\" \\"Nothing much John. I'm thinking about Seneji again\\". \\"Thats too bad Alex. You should get over him Alex\\" etc.). In this book, the ending is so absurd that it was nearly laughable, but by that point I was sort of expecting it. It is getting more and more difficult for me to suspend disbelief with each of these books. I may try to read the 4th, but I'm not getting my hopes up too high for it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where did this Ego come from!","review":"I have read Mr.Patterson's previous books with great enjoyment...interesting characters, great plots, etc. However, I found it very difficult to even finish this book, as Alex Cross' ego seemed to want to gag me every few pages! The story line and other characters were actually very interesting, but Mr.Patterson seemed to find it necessary to hit us over the head with the fact that his main character was 'the Hero'. Continually refering to himself as the 'Dragonslayer' became very tedious. It was as though Mr.Patterson had no faith in the readers to discover the intelligence and perceptiveness of Alex Cross. Anyway, I was very disapointed, and unforunately am unable to bring myself to read his next book, in fear of his self absorbed 'hero'!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book","review":"Another great book in the Alex Cross series.

So glad I've finally started reading the Cross series."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty good","review":"Not as good as the first two in the Alex Cross series, but solid nonetheless.

This title translation should have warned me: Sun, *Murder* and Stars.It was a good choice from a beginning language student's perspective, but ultimately a disappointing book. One thing that really bothers me, and as another reviewer pointed out here, there is no actual police work or detective work. For example, murders are committed in very public places yet nobody reviews videotapes. Really, I don't see what it is Alex Cross did in either of the two separate serial murder cases, other than thinking real hard about them and sleeping badly when more crimes are committed.Oh well, on to Stephen King's The Stand auf Deutsch."},{"rating":"2","title":"Patterson just doesn't stop!!","review":"I am an avid reader of James Patterson. I really enjoy his main character, Dr. Alex Cross. To truly enjoy the \\"Cross Experience\\" you should start with \\"Along Came a Spider\\" and \\"Kiss the Girls\\". While it is not necessary to understand this story, it does piece things together a little better.Patterson tells the story from both Dr. Cross' side and from the Killer's point of view. He is so detailed and descriptive that I felt like I was inside the killers head, and in the killer's mind, everything he did made sense. Amazing story. A must read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Patterson's Best!!","review":"I have been reading the Alex Cross series (in order) over the last few months. Jack and Jill is by far the best in the series.

And the ending is going to leave you wanting more-more-more! I am a big Patterson fan. Love the short, action packed chapters and all the little surprises. He makes Alex Cross into a likeable guy.

It's a real joy to \\"find\\" him, his family and friends book after book. \\"Jack and Jill\\" twists and turns at every page and leaves you (as all previous Pattersons for that matter) breathless at the end.

The other is a pair of psychopaths called jack and Jill who are killing the rich and famous of Washington D.C.this novel like his other two masterpieces is filled with gut- crunching action, terror, and brilliant plot twists just when you think you figured out who are the killers Patterson fools you again!

The stories build based on characters introduced in a previous novel but incorporated into the current novel. If one doesn't remember the exact details of a previous story line it is explained in the current novel. It is like reading about an old friend because his character is being developed in each novels in the series.

The \\"Dennis-the-Menace\\" subplot got in the way, the Jack-and-Jill sex was PG, and the author had no way of utilizing the sexual mutilation theme. Way to go, Patterson! Cha-Ching! Another pot-boiler!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor dialog, wooden characters, cheap psychology","review":"None of the characters in this disappointing book came alive for me; the detective, Alex Cross, interesting in the first few of this series, was a cliche here. The book simply didn't deliver on the promise of its first few chapters."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boy, what I wouldn't give to get my wasted time back.","review":"I bought this book at an airport, and by the time my flight was through, I was so angry that anyone would allow a book this bad to be published that I had to get on Amazon...If you're the type that enjoys 3 page dissertations on what someone ate for breakfast, really needs to be reminded, ad nauseum, say, every two pages, that our \\"hero\\", the \\"Dragonslayer\\", really, really, feels bad for murdered children, then this book is for you. In fact, fans of books that have infeasible plots, zero fact checking, mindless diatribe, and technical errors throughout, should love this silly little waste of paper. At times it was so bad that I found myself laughing. I'll never get that time back.It's not writing, it's typing. Even my recycled bin groaned."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book should have had half of it cut out.","review":"This book should have been two seperate novels, or they should have cut out the part about the Jack and Jill killers and just had Alex hunt the child murderer. The child killer is by far and away the most interesting plot in this book, whereas the actual Jack and Jill story is a mesh of too many plot twists, poorly thought-up characters, and too many forays into unbelievability. And probably the worst part about it (don't read on if you don't want the book somewhat spoiled) is that Alex really doesn't influence the Jack and Jill killer-plotline that much. But if you can muddle through the Jack and Jill parts, the hunt for the child killer is VERY entertaining, and in fact the killer is one of the most interesting/believable villians that I've seen in a novel in quite some time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why Does Anybody Read This Guy?","review":"I got about a third of the way through JACK & JILL before giving up on the pointless, plotless story. This is the third Patterson book I've tried to read, and I have never finished any of them. At first I thought I'd just picked one of his weaker efforts. Now I'm convinced that they are ALL weak efforts. Which raises the question: Why is this guy so darn popular? I just don't get it. Patterson shows no interest in characterization, his plots consist mainly of violent death scenes loosely strung together, and worst of all, he writes at a seventh-grade level. I've read children's books that are considerably more sophisticated than anything Patterson has written. There are dozens of suspense writers who outdistance Patterson in every aspect of his craft."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Book","review":"This was a book that I could not put down and was not disappointed with the ending. What an amazing twist, would never have made the connection ........ well, worth reading."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"The best two things about this book are that it's mildly entertaining and that it's a fast read. Other than that, there are too many unresolved questions at the end (possible sequel?) and there's not enough congruity between the two parallel story lines. There are the usual plot twists and turns, but these usually had me thinking \\"that's dumb\\" rather than \\"wow!\\" If you just want a mindless read and don't care at all about the quality of the story, this fits the bill. Otherwise, skip it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Reader","review":"Wow this is probaly one of the best books he has written. One of thos books that you are dying to read the last page to see what happens and just when you think they have the killer... well read the book. If you like Patterson then this is a must read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Same old, same old!","review":"If Gary Soneji doesn't come back and exact his revenge on Alex Cross then I will! Same old Alex. Same old kids. Same old grandmother. Same old EVERYTHING. I ended up skipping parts of this book just to get through it and still didn't miss a beat. Alex Cross has more lives than that cat that Gary Soneji mysteriously sent to the Cross family in a previous novel. While I liked the others in this series, this was, by far, the worst! Maybe the next character won't be so predictable and in-your-face smart."},{"rating":"2","title":"Alex Cross is sensational in another Patterson thriller","review":"Another great Alex Cross novel. James Patterson is a great writer and this was one of the best books I have read in a long time. Very suspenseful and could not put the book down until I finished."},{"rating":"2","title":"Really good!!","review":"James Patterson is an amazing author. This book had all kinds of twists and turns. Between the school killer and Jack & Jill, made this book hard to put down. You never knew what was going to happen next or what was up Jack & Jill sleeve."},{"rating":"1","title":"Painful","review":"While this book does have an unexpected ending, it borders on painful to read. The author (usually quite good), tries to make up for the lack of developed characters with gratidous sex scenes. The whole plot: The president's life is in danger. Besides the poems \\"Jack and Jill came up the hill, to kill, to kill, to kill\\" this book is the same theme you've seen on every cop show fifty other times. It has an underlying plot involving a child murderer. The book appears to be two short stories, sewn together to fill a book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Bother","review":"The story is somewhat interesting but extremely repetitive. It could have been half as long. Patterson kept saying the same things using different words. (Get my point?) All of which I could have lived, if it weren't for an ending that is very flat, uninteresting, disappointing, weak, lame. (Take your pick.)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing, repetitive - and boring","review":"Having heard so much about Mr Patterson's big reputation, I bought a copy of 'Jack and Jill'. Wish I hadn't bothered. As far as narrative structure is concerned, a high school teacher would be entitled to expect better from a class of 14-year olds (and would!). Monotonously short sentences, basic punctuation, little or no subtlety or sophistication in the way of grammar or syntax... you get the idea. Maybe Mr Patterson thought he was writing a fast-paced pulp thriller, but the masters of that particular art knew how to turn a sentence, how to make their work challenging. As far as 'Jack and Jill' is concerned, I've encountered more demanding stuff in a tabloid newspaper. At least I now know one author to avoid in future."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fast moving and hard to put down","review":"I have enjoyed James Patterson's books. Jack and Jill was no exception. Running two simultaneous story lines, with entirely different villains, kept me turning the pages. The short chapter format made it even harder to put down. \\"Just one more chapter, then I'll go to bed\\" doesn't work when the chapters are so short. You are compelled to keep going! I admit I would have liked a better ending, at least finding out who was behind the presidential assassination. But all in all, it held my interest, and I look forward to Patterson's next book"},{"rating":"2","title":"great read..entertaining..why be critical?","review":"Patterson presented his typical entertaining style, not to be comparedto previous books, but on a stand alone basis, exciting, andentertaining. Take what your given and enjoy!"},{"rating":"1","title":"How did Jack and Jill get to be a bestseller?","review":"114 Chapters - get real! This book is poorly written in allaspects - organization, loose ends in the plot, characterdevelopment, unreal dialog, too many unanswered questions.Can't imagine how this feeble effort got to be a bestseller..."},{"rating":"2","title":"another superb thriller!","review":"Patterson has done it again with another page-turning thriller! This one is especially interesting because it hits on political assassination conspiracies, which makes you start thinking about the real ones like JFK, etc. I don't want to give away too much, but please read it! If you love Patterson's surprises and you like politics or conspiracy theory, you'll fall in love with this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"I'm hooked on Patterson!!","review":"I am not one for writing down all the details of the book but will always give my honest opinion. The pages just kept on turning. Once I got started I could not put it down. He brings all of his charcters to life. Never a dull moment. If you like short and faced paced chapters this book is for you. This is now my third book and counting."},{"rating":"2","title":"Doesn't live up to Kiss the Girls","review":"I like Patterson so I'm not saying that I don't like this book, it just didn't compare to Kiss the Girls. It was suspensful and had a good plot but I didn't find it to be as much of a page turner as I had hoped it would be. Don't get me wrong, once I got into it it was hard to put down, the only problem was that it took me about the first third of the book to do so. Patterson still does a good job of portraying Dr. Alex Cross in such a way that you feel like you know him and his short chapters make even the not so exciting parts quick to get through. Overall I guess I would recommend this book if you like Patterson and have the patience to wait for the expected excitment."},{"rating":"2","title":"Alex Cross is the Man!","review":"I decided to skip the first two Alex Cross novels, (Kiss the Girls & Along Came a Spider) only because I regrettably saw the first two in movie form.Jack and Jill was a solid book filled with mind twists and a wide range of emtional moments. Just when you think you have figured it all out, guess again. I loved this book from the beginning to the end. I will continue to read the rest of the Alex Cross Books.If you are trying to decide if this is for you, I say read it and you will love it too!"},{"rating":"1","title":"My Third Patterson Novel, I'm Done","review":"I've tried, after numerous recomedations, I just can't get into Patterson's style of writing nor his character, Alex Cross. I agree pretty much with the other 3 Star or lower reviews. Alex Cross is too boring, contrived, and unlikely as a detective for my enjoyment. I don't enjoy Alex's family ties, his partner, his methods of investigation [he has none other than his \\"intuition\\"]. The dialogue isn't realistic...I feel I could do better and I don't consider myself a writer. The murders, the victims, and the perpetrators are beyond my realm of believability or interest. I'm a big Micheal Connelly and Harry Bosch fan. Maybe i'm spoiled by the suspense and realism of the crimes, police work, and dialogue of his books and characters. Patterson's stye of \\"whodunnit\\" doesn't do it for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good enough","review":"I think that the story of the book is a little bit out of reality, I don't think that if the president's life is threatened he will make his normal life and he will walk in Manhattan like a normal person, I also think that the people who works and live inside the White House are under investigation all the time and are followed by the security people in their spare time, so part of the story of the book doesn't have much sense. Nevertheless the book is a page turner and the end of the book, for me, was the only way to finish it, you will guess the end before you read it."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best","review":"The Best Alex Cross book. Other goods Alex Cross books are Kiss the Girls, Roses are Red, and Cat and Mouse."},{"rating":"2","title":"fast and furious pace","review":"the story was so good and i couldn't put this down. it was a not stop read...."},{"rating":"2","title":"This book was very entertaining and had me up late at night.","review":"I think James Patterson is an extraordinary write and \\"Jack and Jill\\" exhibits that. He writes very thick plots but at the same time uses language that anyone can read and understand. The story was very exciting, as the plot twisted and turned until the very end. Patterson had me guessing the entire ride, and what a ride it was."},{"rating":"2","title":"A True Washington Thriller","review":"Cross is back as they say! Patterson has done it again. He truly understands the way Washington functions and how to entangle a reader in the cities' inerworkings. When he writes about an apartment or a restaurant...you feel the need to go and see if it really exists or if it's just more fiction. Jack and Jill leaves you guesing as to who \\"really\\" did it up until the end, the way Kiss the Girls did. If they make another or his books into movies, I can see Vingh Rames playing Sampson. anybody else?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Another winner!!","review":"The book grabs your attention at the outset and keeps the reader enthralled until the last page is turned. James Patterson did it again with another Alex Cross winner!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Mindless entertainment","review":"For pulp writers, you have to remember one thing. It's not art; it's escapist entertainment. Characters aren't important. The plot can have holes. And as you're reading it, it's alright to think \\"No way can this ever happen.\\" Also get ready for the author (and I use this term loosely) to repeat the same story again and again and again and again and again. Grisham, King, Koontz, and Crichton are masters at telling the same story over and over and selling millions.Well along comes James Patterson, and he doesn't even change the main characters. So, should we be surprised that every story seems the same? No, but it's a great way to give the brain a rest before starting up another more accomplished piece of literature.Happy summer reading."},{"rating":"2","title":"Book review & Kindle Touch.","review":"Just got back into reading on a regular basis. Patterson keeps chapters small, quick, to the point and enables fast reading. Fast paced in action and very easy read. Have now obtained 3 other books, chronologically, in the Alex Cross series. Wish I had started reading again, sooner. Kindle Touch is a God send. Great product with numerous options and alternatives. Have since purchased a Kindle Fire HD for my wife."},{"rating":"2","title":"Jack & Jill","review":"Another great James Patterson novel in the Alex Cross series. I do not think there is a more intriguing character than Cross. I have read several, but not always in order, which limits the enjoyment. Would recommend any of the Alex Cross series. A spell binder. [...]"},{"rating":"1","title":"mediocre story","review":"As far as murder mystery type stories like this one, I consider Jack and Jill to be well below average. Not unreadablely bad, but just thoroughly mediocre. The killers are not very interesting, and their motivations are never really clear. There is a strange side-plot about a jouvenille killer, which doesn't seem to add much to the story. And then there is Alex Cross, who seems to solve this one on pure luck. Not a very compelling story at all.The audiobook is average or better in terms of production values. The reader is pretty good, and they have some nice variety of voices and sounds etc. But nothing really stood out. Perhaps the cast had trouble getting excited about this dreary story just like the rest of us did."},{"rating":"1","title":"boring book","review":"This book plods along. A US Senator is killed by the girl he took to a dinner party (the girl works at the White House); yet ace detective Alex Cross fails to interview her as a suspect? In DC, a city gripped by terror, a shooting occurs during the intermission of a play but no one has any idea who fired the shot? This book is a waste of time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pass","review":"This novel is severely hampered by a predictable, unoriginal plot, and cardboard cut out characters. It was dry, and utterly unsuspenseful. In fact, I really struggled to get through it.The book has the feel of something that was written off the top of the author's head, in about a week and a half."},{"rating":"1","title":"Here we go again","review":"I really enjoyed ALONG CAME A SPIDER. It was original and suspensful and had a great twist at the end. Patterson used this same formula in KISS THE GIRLS to somewhat lesser effect but it was a good book none the less. Now Patterson returns to the well yet again in JACK AND JILL. Enough already. If he can't find new ways to present Alex Cross's cases then he should retire the character. As I read this book I knew perfectly well that the male/female team of killers was not who the author was trying to focus our attention on. Once again the same plot device is used and it just gets weaker and weaker each time. I don't plan on reading any more Alex Cross novels... I've read them already."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful, horrible, overwritten, melodramatic junk-reading","review":"Listened to the audiobook version of this James Patterson novel in the car -- simply because my spouse bought it off a remainder table cheap and I figured we should get our money's worth. Twenty minutes into it I wanted to chuck the first tape out the window the writing (and the audiobook narration) was so overwrought. But then I listened longer as I realized how amusing the bad writing was. A wonderful text here for a creative writing class: how to write junk fiction that sells but which you'd never want to put your name on. Sad that someone can write as poorly as Patterson and sell oh so many books."},{"rating":"1","title":"My last James Patterson novel...","review":"After reading Along Came A Spider and Kiss The Girls, this book removed any chance of me picking up another Patterson.

This one seems to read \\"my publisher wanted this yesterday\\" in between the lines"},{"rating":"1","title":"THE ROT BEGINS...","review":"After two brilliant novels, James Patterson has written a book that is both unoriginal, and doesn't make sense.(Warning: the next few paragraphs will give away the whole novel and all it's plot twists)The story is about two CIA agents (you don't know that in the beginning) who sets their sights on killing the president of the US of A. Yes, I know, in films and novels, the presidents life is ALWAYS in jeopardy, despite the thorough protection of the secret service.Patterson must have thought that that one storyline wouldn't bring the novel to a sufficient length, so he gives us another serial killer. When the killers identity is revealed (the killer is a twelve year old kid whose name I've forgotten) you'll be laughing...Well I laughed anyway.And last but not least, where would a Patterson novel be without a tender romance.

Very powerful story."},{"rating":"1","title":"An episode of Baywatch has a more intelligent ending!","review":"Patterson has succeeded in writing a great page turner. The twists and turns will keep you up reading long past your bedtime. HOWEVER: the ending is supposed to be the climax of all the earlier work. KISS THE GIRLS fails miserably in it's conclusion. The ending is actually an anti-climax after the event in Chapel Hill. Patterson obviously had his sights on converting this story into a movie script, and the ending reads like a bad \\"B\\" movie.One cannot help but wonder about Pattersons dark side with the inclusion of such seat squirming passages as the \\"snake and milk\\" chapter. Also disturbing is his fascination with his \\"GLOCK\\" and repeated racist remarks"},{"rating":"1","title":"Yawn.","review":"I give this book a 3 only because it provided some marginally interesting details left out by the movie, which is why I read it. Hardly compelling at all, though it tries so hard to be, this tale is a better movie than a novel, an almost unheard of embarrassment."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Real Page Turner!!!!","review":"'' Kiss The Girls '' was one of the most entertaining,chilling \\"crime\\" novels I've read.

It was a great read, loved the suspence and drama. I can not wait to start his next book."},{"rating":"2","title":"about what you expect","review":"James Patterson writes a lot of different books now (with a lot of people) but in the good old days he wrote with a pretty consistent mystery/thriller style. He's a little bit sadistic at times, but all in all he draws you in with great characters and intense plots. I don't like some of the fields he has strayed into lately, but this one is classic Patterson, for better and worse!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I Love This Book","review":"Personally I don't like to read but this book was so good that I could not put it down. It was a little perverted at times however I don't think it hurt the quality of the story. This is one of Pattersons best works. From beginning to end it was non stop action and exitement. The affection between Alex and Kate was one of the finer subplots in the book. It's too bad the movie did not do it justice."},{"rating":"2","title":"Can't put down this book from the first page...","review":"This book was my first Patterson book.

I read it in two sittings, in complete suspense, until the very end.Fascinating characters and storyline. CREEPY subject matter, which I adore. No dull filler in the second act. No let down at the end.I really wish he still wrote books like this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Read!","review":"I had seen the movie before ever reading the book. I liked the movie a lot and when a friend at work told me to read the series, that it was so much better I downloaded the entire collection. I definitely have enjoyed it. And would recommend it to others. The series is not for those easily offended by rape, torture or any kind of sadistic violence. My only complaint is that the kindle books are pretty expensive, I found 1 through 17 as PDF files for fourteen bucks and downloaded that. But I definitely would like to see his other books cheaper so I could read his other collections."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disgusting","review":"This is my 4th James Patterson novel and absolutely my last. The sexual violence was pornographic and his portrayal of the women characters was shallow and demeaning. How in the world could Kate feel any sexual feelings towards Alex just a few short weeks after having been held hostage and raped repeatedly? I threw the book away and wish I had never read it."},{"rating":"2","title":"This book is masterfully written!","review":"In the city of Chapel Hill, a murderer named \\"Casanova\\" is stalking beautiful women that are extraordinary in their line of duty. Now Alex Cross gets drawn into the murder case when his young cousin Naomi Cross, gets kidnapped and taken to \\"his house of horrors''.My opinion of this book is that it was a thriller in the making. This novel is full of suspense and murders taking place in a big city. This book is masterfully written and has sharp 2-3 page chapters."},{"rating":"2","title":"OMG! This book is GOOD!","review":"I picked this book up at the airport returning from Thanksgiving with the family. I read it in the airport, on the plane, and didn't stop until I finished it a few hours later in my dorm room. This book is good! I am a big fan of Patricia Cornwell books and was in the mood for something similar. While not from the same vantage point, Patterson is a masterful storyteller who knows how to hook a reader and keep it suspenseful. I found myself talking out loud to the characters, as if I were watching the movie instead of reading the book. Be warned, however, that there are some graphic scenes, including graphic sexual scenes. Other than that, I had no problems with the book. For a lazy day of relaxing reading, pick up this book. But don't pick it up before bed or you won't be sleeping the night away. :-) Now go buy it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointing","review":"This is probably one of the worst books I have ever read. I normally like mystery novels and thrillers, but James Patterson's writing style completely turned me off to this book. The language was extremely dumbed down and the plot was very tedious, to the point of being unreadable. Do yourself a favor and skip this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Clumsy plot, undeveloped characters","review":"When I first read this book, I expected it to be good or at least interesting since it was made into a movie. However, I was badly disappointed. The author tries to go over the top with having not one but two serial killers, but the result is soggy and nearly unreadable. The plot is confusing and boring and halfway through I found that I just didn't care anymore. Most of the characters are cliches, and all the violence was unnecessary and gratuitous. I wouldn't recommend this book to anyone except the hopelessly bored."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible Book","review":"This was a Horrible book....Found many discrepancies in the writing...gratuitous sexual descriptions that didn't add to the Plot at all... so many characters ... you didn't connect with any of them.... if THIS IS good writing....then I need to quit my job and write books.... this was a horrible novel... I couldn't wait to finish it... so I could bring back to the library. I would nEVER NEVER buy this book it is horribly written and has no redeeming qualities"},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliant concept, at a fast pace","review":"Once again Patterson comes up with an un-put-downable book.

Patterson is a talented man!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Axe Says","review":"What a ride this book was. I could apply every cliche in the literary world to this one, rollercoaster, unputdownable, electric, they all apply. Mr Patterson has written an excellent novel that simply flows from page to page, his short chapter style guides the reader cinematically through this disturbing tale of two serial killers at large. Never before has a book broke me out in a sweat, or made my heart race, and in fact, made me shout out loud. Buy it, read it, and then pester someone else until they do the same. Enjoy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book","review":"PROS: This is one good suspenceful novel. The mood is great, the characters are great, and the book is great. This is another great James Patterson novel. James Patterson rules!CONS:Don't know why they made this one a movie instead of the first book with Alex Cross. (\\"Along Came A Spider\\")BOTTOM LINE: I would recommend this book to people who didn't see the movie, because if they already saw it, it spoiles the fun."},{"rating":"1","title":"wanted to give it a goose egg, but they wouldnt let me","review":"This guy is the most overrated writer in the business. I heard so much about this writer and in particular this book, so I gave it a shot. I couldnt even finish it. Patterson is a painfully juvenile writer. This book reads as if it was written by some one in grade school. An example of this is his character descriptions. Patterson is constantly saying things like: \\"she looked like wynonia ryder\\" or \\"he looked alot like mel gibson\\". Give me a break! Mr Patterson has the dubious distinction of writing a book that is vastly inferior to the movie. If you want to read a good book that deals with this subject matter, read John Fowles' The Collecter. Or if you are looking for a talented crime novelest, read David Martin. Dont waste your intellectual energy on this hack."},{"rating":"1","title":"Misogynistic trash","review":"Plot is incoherent at best. If a woman (who was medical student -- not law enforcement) escaped from a serial killer, would the FBI really allow her to go on a stake-out of... a serial killer? Would they let her return to the house from which she was abducted alone... with the killer still on the loose?The big break in the case comes when a reporter reveals the name of one of the two killers -- with no explanation as to how she figured out who she was.Pure misogynistic trash."},{"rating":"2","title":"A near flawless thriller!!","review":"This is classic James Patterson and shows why he now sells so many books and has so many fans. Everything a good thriller needs are in here: A relatable protagonist, vile antagonists, drama, thrills, twists, gruesome scenes that will stay with you, and unpredictability. I really enjoyed this a incorrectly guessed the killer (s) multiple times. Cross is intelligent, warm, tough, and not perfect, which is a perfect blend for a main character. The evil that is in this book at times is almost too intense and also is perfect for this type of book. The only thing that keeps this book from being a five star book is Patterson's use of extra sappy dialogue at the strangest places. Other than that, a perfect book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Plot is pure fantasy","review":"Although this book held my interest, it was not very believable. Suspense was used throughout the book, but the whole thought of a DC detective and his partner being able to leave their job to work in a foreign jurisdiction is strange. He wouldn't have been given the time of day there. Also, why would a victim be permitted to be placed in danger in stake outs, etc, throughout the latter part of the book?"},{"rating":"2","title":"U Dah Man","review":"This is the master at work, Patterson's finest book. Everything about the book is right--the dialogue, the social commentary, the bond between the two sickos, the suspense, the thrill ride, even the short little chapters and the shifts in point of view. Here is what Mr. Patterson should do before writing another book: re-read this one. When you write like this, U Dah Man, Jimmy. U Dah Man."},{"rating":"2","title":"What a treat.","review":"In this riveting second installment of the series, Alex Cross is pitted against not one, but two macabre killers. This one is brought especially close to home when Alex's niece is abducted. It is a race against time as Alex tries to locate his niece and the other girls who have seemingly disappeared off the face of the earth."},{"rating":"2","title":"Kiss the girls","review":"Very frightening. Good suspenseful who done it.' Would have Ben good if they had hooked up but understand why."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow!!","review":"James Patterson does it again. If you liked Along Came A Spider, you will love this one too. It had so many twists and turns that kept wanting to read more and not put the book down! Coming from me who graduated from college in criminal justice, i hope i never come across anything like this in real life!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Another Cross Winner!","review":"Kiss The Girls was very well written basically because there so many mysteries that were left to be answered until you find out and it's not anything you expect. Once again i loved this one which has Alex dealing with not one but two murderers. You find out who the Gentleman is pretty quickly and just when you think you figured out who Casanova was it is not who you expect it to be. I absolutely loved this and could barely put it down. Although the climax was not as exciting as in Along Came A Spider the ending is still satisfying and i wont give anything away but you even get to find out what happened to Gary Soneji. Read Along Came A Spider for those who have not started the Alex Cross series. You will enjoy this one alot more."},{"rating":"2","title":"One Wild Ride!","review":"From the 1st page, I was hooked and I wanted to do nothing except READ THIS BOOK! I couldn't turn those pages fast enough and talk about suspense, I couldn't wait to get to the end so I could find out, once and for all, who Casanova was! The first book I've ever read that I seriously considered \\"cheating\\" and going to the end to find out who the killer was! A fantastic book for any suspense/mystery fans and also fantastic for anyone wanting something different to read. Buy the book and enjoy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This is the one!","review":"Of all of Patterson's \\"Cross\\" novels, this still remains my favorite. The premise was (at the time of writing) original and amazing. You could practically feel yourself there among the women trapped in Casanova's collection at times, and it was all in all a great book. The movie tried to be faithful to it, but 60-year-old Morgan Freeman as a thirtysomething Alex Cross just didn't cut it. Don't base your opinion of the book on that movie...trust me. This book is one you'll finish quickly and enjoy tremendously."},{"rating":"2","title":"amazing work Mr. Patterson","review":"This was the first \\"Real\\" Book I had ever read growing up, and my cousin gave it to me and told me I simply had to read this book. I read it straight for 14 hours and completed it. At the time, I was 13. I couldn't put it down. I'd recommend it to anyone with an open mind and a thirst for a good read! 5 stars- Megg"},{"rating":"2","title":"Spine Tingeling !","review":"I have read all of James Patterson's books and Kiss the Girls was one of the most intense. I could not put the book down. I felt like I knew Alex Cross and his family by the end. When the movie came out, I had to see the premiere, but needless to say, no justice to the book. I look forward to more of James Pattersons writings."},{"rating":"2","title":"The movie does not do the novel justice","review":"This book is a masterpiece of human insanity and the need for control. The character of Alex Cross is an attractive young widower who does not need our sympathy. He has two young children but with the help of his grandmother is doing well as a single father. Then you have Kate an ambitious young medical intern who has bad luck with men. Their characters get thrown together when she is kidnapped by the same \\"Casanova\\" as his favorite niece. The \\"Casanova\\" is faceless and Patterson's protrayal of him makes you yearn to remove the masks which hide his face. This novel is full of suspense and mystery. Alex Cross is the investigator we all hope we have if something goes wrong,we all hope to be as strong as Kate Mctiernan, and hope we never encounter Casanova. In all the movie \\"Kiss the Girls\\" didn't even get close to showing the audience the complexity of the human psyche."},{"rating":"1","title":"Utter Tedium","review":"I can't believe I read the whole thing, it was truly dreadful. Patterson wants to be Thomas Harris when he grows up, but just can't cut it. An easy enough page turner, but ridiculously plotted and had no characters or ideas to catch this reader's interest.Patterson has some serious personal issues about women he should resolve, and leave the rest of us out of it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Formula Book which insults the readers intelligence","review":"This book uses every best seller trick, short chapters that always end on a suspenseful moment, lots of action, sex, torture, etc. Unfortunately the author insults our intelligence every step of the way. How does a woman end up in the woods, beaten and crippled, yet there is no search to see where she comes from (ever hear of bloodhounds). This is only one example of the stupidity of this book. I will never read another book by this author."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good no brainer","review":"This was a good book, with a chilling plot. Not to be read while home alone-ladies. It turns your stomache in a way that the movie was unable to do (and keep its rating to an R). Kidnapping, Rape, Rape, Rape. That's the plot."},{"rating":"2","title":"The movie was awesome....but the BOOK was more than awesome","review":"This is the best book I have ever read this author has TALENT, my god does he. I read this book in 2 days..I could NOT put it down I didnt even eat...I read it every chance I got....I couldnt even sleep...it was GREAT...OUTSTANDING!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as Described","review":"Although I am very happy with your prompt shipping... this book has no dust jacket. That was not mentioned in the description. I only buy books with a dust jacket."},{"rating":"2","title":"This book is tough to put down once you get started!!!!","review":"Kiss the Girl is a tense novel which gives you the thrill. The story begins when an homicidal maniac who abduct pretty intelligent girls, which he keeps in his house that is hidden in the dark forest. Most of the detective can hardly trace back of what he does, because he is good."},{"rating":"1","title":"This novel is simply terrible.","review":"The incredible popularity of this novel boggles the mind. Reading this novel left this reader believing that Patterson penned it for the sole purpose of putting new product on bookstore shelves. Weak characters, inane plot twists, and numerous mentions of brand name products (if you like commercials, watch TV) prevented this reading from suspending disbelief - a necessity to enjoy a work in this genre. For example, a young woman is kidnapped, beaten, and repeatedly raped by a serial rapist-kidnapper-murderer. However, after her release from the hospital she goes back to the same apartment from which she was kidnapped and the police fail to keep surveillance over her residence. Even more unbelievably, she develops romantic feelings for one of the detectives on the case almost immediately after her release from the hospital. A wholely unbelievable scenario. Consider spending your time and money on a Sherlock Holmes novel instead of this inane, advertisement filled drivel"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great but some inaccurate statements","review":"The writer makes regular references to Alex's service revolver, a Glock. Well Glocks are all automatics. In another place he says Alex clicks off the safety to his Glock, wrong again, Glocks have their safeties built in to their triggers. In another place the writer describes the gun as having 12 dangerous bullets. The 9mm Glock carries 19 rounds unless the police decide to use the \\"civilian\\" clip that only holds 10 rounds. Does this guy ever do any homework? Is there an editor or a technical consultant?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Pass on it","review":"I read this because it was on NPR's top thrillers list.... but I found it not particularly satisfying. It was quite illogical, full of stereotypical characters, contained gratuitous sex (I don't mind sexual content, this just seemed misogynistic and pointless) and I found the distinct MAWG (middle-aged white guy) point of view quite annoying, especially since the protagonist is supposed to be a black homicide detective. Apparently this character is pretty popular, but I thought the portrayal was completely unconvincing and pretty insulting.I love detective novels but this one is low on my list. I can't imagine why it is so popular."},{"rating":"2","title":"Style of Writing","review":"This is the first book where the style of writing makes more than half of its success. Short and clear chapters surely facilitate the building of the whole picture. Also, this style helps metropolis-people like me who travels in the underground: whatever the distance of your journey is, you will never get off in the middle of a chapter !!!! Well done."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome!!!!!!!","review":"This has got to be the best, most suspenseful, thrilling, frightening, and riveting book I have ever read. I could not put it down once I started. The movie was not as good as this book. I would highly recommend this book to everybody, except the squeamish."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not even open this book!!!","review":"\\"Kiss The Girls\\" was easily one of the sloppiest books I have read in quite a long time. The chapter are only 2-3 pages long and nothing is fully explained. Alex Cross is a great character but it would be a lot better if we got to know more about him. The enemies are one-dimensional and never fully given an opprtunity to shine. I hated everything about this book and I just wasted valuable time reading it."},{"rating":"1","title":"not as painful as a root canal","review":"This movie was generic Hollywood, but it had potential, so I decided to read the book. To say I was disappointed is putting it mildly. This book reads like a novellization of the movie. The plot is nearly nonexistant and Mr. Patterson is simply not a very good writer (he uses exclamation points in the text, for heavens sake--a favorite trick of junior high girls to punch up their diary entries). Now, I am not someone who looks down on popular culture and the thriller genre. I read large amounts of murder mysteries and I've been counting the days until the sequal to \\"The Relic\\" was released. In short, there is little I can't struggle though. This book, however, was too much for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Juvenile plot... cliched dialogue... total waste of time.","review":"I'm usually so easily entertained by unrealistic action/detective stories that I feel a little guilty tearing throgh them. I expected that to happen with this 'best seller', but it starts out unbelievable and then just gets dumber and dumbest... until I was yelling at the stupid tape.Supposed 'expert' profiler/detective Cross wanders aimlessly - not bothering to protect his prime witness (or even question her closely), check phone records, or maybe look around the area where she escaped - while his niece languishes in the killers lair being raped (& not minding it???) for weeks. The FBI & local cops let Cross run the case because he's such a genius, I guess...I'm usually too gullible, but this ludicrous plot made me just laugh."},{"rating":"1","title":"WARNING - Absolute waste of money and time","review":"The identity of the first killer comes from a reporter's computer notes ???? and the second killer just reveals himself in the last pages???? AND THIS IS SUPPOSED TO BE A DETECTIVE STORY???"},{"rating":"1","title":"Girls aged 14 seem to love this book; they should read more.","review":"Although I enjoyed Along Came A Spider, after reading this book I doubt I'll ever read another James Patterson. Hard to believe his rave reviews. Unfortunately, with the money his name ensures, he and his editor and publisher have little incentive to produce any more quality thrillers. This book is a severe abuse of his best-seller status; he should care more about his literary reputation. The other Patterson (Richard North) is a better writer, as are many countless others who are lesser known."},{"rating":"1","title":"Reasonably engaging, but ultimately pretty lame","review":"I bought this book at the airport to read during a 4.5 hour flight. On the positive side, the book accomplished it's primary mission of keeping me occupied during the flight (I don't care for flying all that much). The characters are likeable and the story is mostly interesting. I'm not sure if I care for the author's writing style (\\"Joe Smith was the Killer! It was Joe! Joe!\\"). The red herring that leads you to falsely deduce the identify of the killer isn't clever as intended. Rather, it left me annoyed. I don't mind that I was wrong in my prediction, but there was not any substance whatsoever to support that conclusion. The book kind of felt as if it was written with a movie adaptation in mind (haven't seen the film, so I can't comment on the quality of that). I'm not a voracious reader of this genre, but I've read a few Thomas Harris titles (Silence of the Lambs, Red Dragon). I felt that those two were much better than this one over all."},{"rating":"1","title":"HORRIBLE","review":"THIS BOOK IS POORLY WRITTEN AND ONLY GIVES WOMEN CREDIT FOR BEING SEX SLAVES.

We didn't even read each other's book (fortunately we didn't spend money on them - we could just return them to the library). The book's only redeeming feature is that it's fast paced, but the ending was disappointing. This book was beyond R rating for me and R is definitely my limit. We just discovered Richard North Patterson (again we each had one and we thoroughly enjoyed both)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Middle School-level reading","review":"This book is very very easy reading. I polished it off in about 6 hours.If the author hadn't reminded me every few paragraphs or so of how rotten I should feel for being white, it would have been a better read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Exploitative and offensive","review":"I love to read, but this book was really dumb and very exploitative. The fluff mystery plot seems to exist only as a means of setting up disgusting situations. James Patterson, shame on you! I hope your mother doesn't know you're responsible for this trash. It reads more like porn than fiction. I actually warn people against this book and threw my copy away. I'm not conservative at all, but I am still amazed that people buy this book and recommend it to their friends -- what does that say about you?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Shallow thriller","review":"This is a thriller that reads like a cheap romance novel. The plot is simple and the characters are trite and unreal. After reading a Forsythe novel, this novel reads like a comic book.The only reason I gave it two stars instead of one is that it is a mercifully fast read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Convoluted, confused and poorly-written","review":"This was another book which I consigned to the dustbin when I was done with it. There are just certain books, when there is one fewer copy in the world, that make the world a better place. This book had a confusing plot that seemed not to have been thought out by the author and basically the author wrote whatever he felt like each time he sat down. This also comes across in the actual sentences and paragraphs. It seems that not only within a paragraph, is the author unable to stay with a thought, but in the time that it takes to write from the beginning to the end of the sentence, the author has forgotten what he was talking about. An abysmal example of what happens when an author writes a quality first novel and feels duty-bound to churn out sequels."},{"rating":"1","title":"Needlessly gory and poorly written as well","review":"It disturbs me to see how many reviewers, particularly females, raved about this book. This book contains some of the sickest sexual scenes I have ever read. I am not a prude, nor do I mind sex or violence in books if there is a reason for it. However, the sexual violence in this book is unnecessary and very disturbing. This is easily the worst book I ever read. I could not finish it and I regret even starting it. I would say it was one step shy of pornography of the sick variety. Judging from the reviews, however, many people are not offended by this sort of thing. People are entitled to their opinions but there are some things that simply should outrage us all.

The snake scene - creeped me out for weeks!I was really disappointed in the ending. For a twist to work at the end, you need to bring back a character you've seen more than twice in the entire book!

I listened to the condensed version and because it was condensed it made the story more action-packed than usual. The tension builds and builds until the final explosive scene. Patterson has a real knack for crafting really malicious villains, and this book is actually one up on that because there appears to be two such viscious killers out there - one in North Carolina and one in Las Angelas. Girls have been going missing for 13 years around North Carolina, and Patterson's anti-hero Alex Cross is brought into this because one of the missing girls is his beautiful and successful niece. There is a lot of graphic violence in this, but it is certainly an attention-grabber.

The only way you can view it larger is if you insert the particular DVD that the image is on, and there are 7 DVD's.

She acts as if she invented the idea...and what is worse, people are buying it. I cant believe people are buying this tape to learn how to be grateful.

Much of the material here was reworked for the _Batztoutai with Memorial Gadgets_ 2LP that came out a couple of years later, and in the state we get it here, it's still unrealized, a chaotic morass of sounds with no real internal cohesion.

The book is strong in the beginning, and the intense relationship between Hirel (an emperor's son) and Prince Sarevan is enough to carry it through quite well until the halfway mark, where the author descends into a jumbled mix of convoluted reasoning and ill-conceived plot moves that destroys the whole thing. I won't tell you how it ends or how Judith Tarr resolves the stated \\"impossible\\" problem of her two very MALE princes falling in love, but I will say this; I nearly ripped the book in half when I realized the path she was taking. What an utter cop out."},{"rating":"2","title":"A seed was planted","review":"A family friend gave me this book as a child.

I can remember reading through this over and again and marveled at these fabulous people and what they accomplished.

What that true nature is, I have no idea and I don't think he does either. Worth wasting two bucks just to experience the jaw-dropping vacuity.

BUT when you put all that fluff aside, the Dad in this movie isn't anything more than a big pompous windbag. The father in this movie just reminded me of all those people that I've bumped into that brag about the same unbelievable things that they have or have done... yet everyone knows that they are just like me and you... boring slobs. For example, when the father blantantly steels his son's thunder at HIS OWN WEDDING! It just makes me cringe. He was no hero.

The movie definitely carried Burton's stamp with its dreamy, gothic surrealism; fantastical characters; and the familiar lofty themes from Danny Elfman's score. However, the story-line seemed a little too familiar...just a different person telling a tale to a different listener.

I believe that every father should be able to tell stories to his children. This movie is moving and tells a story that's as great as the story his father tells in it. When I have children, I need to be able to tell them stories that will make their imaginations grow and flourish. I believe it's important, and this film has inspired me to do just that. I recommend it to everybody - if not for some sort of inspiration, at least for a bit of entertainment."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than the Book.","review":"Very rarely does a film come along that is claimed to be better than the book, especially by me, one of those cynical-book-reading-types that always has to point out that the Book was way better. I think Big Fish is one of the few instances where this is not true. The Book is good, don't get me wrong, but I believe that Tim Burton did an amazing job bringing the book to life. The story was consistent the entire way through, no important parts missing that people who don't read books completely miss out on, and it's visually stunning. The actors cast fit their characters flawlessly. Watching the film felt like what my imagination would have created for the visuals while reading. I always recommend to people to read the book, it's better. However, in this case, I'd say watch the movie first. It's beautiful."},{"rating":"2","title":"Touching and imaginative...","review":"I'd recommend this to those that love a good story with a bit of tall tale fantasy in them. It's a beautiful, colorful movie of tall tales told by a father to his angry son.I personally found the son's character a bit annoying because of the anger and attitude he constantly gives to his dying father, but if you put your focus away from him, you get drawn into the fathers tales of his life before his time comes.Truly touching. Watch it with your loved ones."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not for the dumb thinker!","review":"Big Fish is not for the dumb of mind. There are so many metaphors in this movie, that you can watch it time and time again and still catch more. Big Fish is about a son reconciling with his father, due to his father proclivities for telling tall tales. But when you see the movie, you will see that they really aren't tall tales. The whole movie is a metaphor describing life as an adult and what you heard of as a child. For instance....if throughout your childhood, you were told of twins that were 'joined at the hip', you would then believe as an adult that those twins were literally joined at the hip. The reality is different, of course, but not when you have come to hear the same description from age 3 to adulthood.This movie bascially is one big lesson in life. The past may not be what we remember, but it is how it is remembered that really is the key to living! I highly recommend this movie to anyone!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"sappy and tedious","review":"This movie is a dog. I found the flashback fantasies annoying, sappy, and boring all at the same time.

I mean, the whole movie is about Finney's character telling stories and it's connection to his life. Kids have apparently enjoyed this film and understand it. So, you don't have to have a superior IQ to view this film.Personally, I couldn't sit through more than 40 minutes of this movie, and neither could my boyfriend. While the acting was very good-it did not touch any nerves with me. I felt it just dragged on, and the characters were rather dull and emotionless. Maybe I missed a significant moment in the film which I was too impatient to wait for. It certainly didnt capture my heart enough for me to sit through it. As far as being a slow, dragged out film, it is pretty much in line with \\"In The Bedroom\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unappealing Finney","review":"Sunday, August 15, 2004 / 2 of 5 / Unappealing FinneyWhile I typically love Tim Burton's work, I found Big Fish to be oddly polarizing. Snippets of the life and times of the main character when played by Ewan McGregor are much more enjoyable than watching the bulbous Albert Finney \`flounder' about in the present day incarnation. The luminous Jessica Lang languishes in the role of the wife in present day, standing by as a prop while the dispassionately played son tries to synthesize reality and his father's tall tales fed him over the years. An odd film, and not his usual quirky special way, it just didn't work for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Melancholy tale of a son discovering his father","review":"Excellent story of a son discovering his father: the man he never knew.

True to the book, but smartly changed when it served the visual medium of film. One bit in the book I was hoping Tim Burton would discuss why he didn't take was the thing that really kept people in Spector, the imaginary town. In the book, there's a fierce dog that bites people's fingers off if they try to leave. Very Burton-esque. Couldn't figure out why in the film it was about the shoes.However, I loved the relationship between Edward and Sandra Bloom - both as young people and as older folks. The simplicity of their love and complete acceptance of the other was touching. I thought William struck exactly the right tone, trying to come to terms with his father before the latter's death. All in all, the movie was an interesting juxtaposition of 'real life' and fantasy."},{"rating":"1","title":"grossly ascetic, self-indulgent","review":"Big Fish is a creative film. If anything it is fairy tale for adults, a romp in a decadent imagination. In that sense it was fun. But more than anything it left a taste of grossly ascetic self-indulgence in my mouth. The social satire bite that made a strange story powerful in Edward Scissorhands is gone. Instead we have to be content with a childrens book that tells us nothing substantive other than we should let our imaginations run free and value family (or something like that).

You ain't seen nothin' yet.What a huge disappointment. It never, excuse the pun, reels you in. The best parts of the movie are the ones without Burton's playful imagery. Tim Burton's films are really starting to annoy me. They are so childish and lack any sort of real substance. They rely solely on the visual aspect, and that gets tiring after awhile. It's like if Tim Burton were a painter then his medium of choice would be crayon. Granted he can do some really good stuff in crayon, but step up and be a man for once. Put away your crayons, and try using some paint."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Up to the Hype","review":"After all the wonderful ads, I was really looking forward to this movie.

I can see the reasons, but I believe this to be the superior film.Both movies have incredulous story lines, but in Gump's case, they tried to make the impossible seem real. In Big Fish's case, you never know what is real and what isn't. You won't know the truth until the very touching end.Brilliantly directed, and unbelievably overlooked by many film lovers.I'd put Big Fish in my top twenty any day.Brilliant, strange, touching and memorable, Big Fish achieves greatness on every level.Another brilliant contribution from Tim Burton, do your self a favor and rent this.I think you'll be amazed by just how original and innovative this movie is."},{"rating":"2","title":"when dad dies","review":"Edward Bloom is dying, and his son Will, whose wife is pregnant with their first child, dearly wants to know just who his enigmatic father really is. The problem is that Dad was a blowhard storyteller who talked about things he did not do and did not talk about things he did do (\\"we never talked about not talking\\"). He was a combination of the Easter Bunny and Santa Claus, very charming and very fake, and so Will laments, \\"I have no idea who you are.\\" But maybe Will has misread his dad, and all the stories are true in some sense. The overall theme of Big Fish is thus entirely poignant, but the metaphors mix rather badly with humor, surreal scenes of giants, witches, crows in dreams who prophesy death, etc., and an extended love story about Mom and Dad. This good film could have been better if the visual medium had not overwhelmed the otherwise rich plot potential."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good story","review":"Every once in awhile I go the the theater to see a movie that I normally wouldn't see on the big screen (waiting instead for it to come out on dvd) and this was one of those times. My nephew is a fan of Tim Burton so off we went to see Big Fish. I had no idea what to expect, so no way to get let down, and I was pleasantly surprised with the show.Basically a feel good, father-son story, this isn't a flick for those looking for action packed fasted paced story. It is something I'd normally wait to rent and while I recommend seeing it, it's hard to give a strong buy recommendation as the story, once told, is hardly exciting enough to see again.That said, I do recommend this movie, it has a strong message to send about life and love and the relationship between parent/child. It is about forgiveness and letting go and also about seeing things from another viewpoint."},{"rating":"1","title":"So...","review":"...I guess I don't need to see anymore Tim Burton movies.

Granted, part of the problem this time isn't his fault. I thought the novel Big Fish was corny and obvious. And I find Ewan McGregor's performance to be way too.... Gumpish... for my tastes.

None of the characters were very overly likable.I tell my son better stories than those in the movie.I would qualify this movie as a \\"'B-' rated theme movie of the 80's\\" if I could. The \\"Brat Pack\\" made better ones. It was better than Highlander II, Mortal Combat, Street Fighter, and The Avengers. They got a \\"0\\" star rating.It would be a good movie to watch on a rainy Saturday afternoon if there the best thing on TV was an old Tarzan movie.On second though, I'd watch the old Tarzan movie.Secondhand Lions was far superior and I should have watched it for the 15 time instead of watching this movie.Sorry, but this is my opinion."},{"rating":"1","title":"This movie stinks","review":"I like Burton's stop animation work, creative. This story is just a lot of rambling non-sense that's disjointed and boring. Oh yeh, the stories might be true in the end? Revelationary.

This is the third dismal movie he has directed in a row. Relying heavily on picture perfect \\"aren't we imaginative\\" sets that look television commercials quality and less on building some tension and plot Big Fish is as much fun as watching a fish out of water suffocate to death. The biggest offense in this movies is the talk-over narration. Could you imagine a movie like \\"The Wizard of Oz\\" if we had to listen to Dorothy blab on and on about what she had experienced instead of allowing us to discover the wonders along side her? If you have seen one of those tedious \\"In a town called perfect\\" tv ads with all the sugary nursery muzak you've already seen Big Fish.

It has humor, fantasy, and an overall outstanding story! Ewan McGregor plays a fabulous Edward Bloom, an eccentric young man on a journey to find a \\"bigger pond.\\" Tim Burton delivers a wonderful and touching story in this film about a dying man with a son who won't accept him as he is. The movie takes you on the twists and turns through Edward Bloom's life as his son tries to discover who his father is. Although mildly disappointing for some Burton fans, as it is not as weird as some of his other movies, you will not be dissapointed with this movie. The cast is great and the story is phenomenal creating an exceptional film!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Whimsical Tim Burton Film","review":"I thought Big Fish had alot of cute, whimsical scenes. But the scenes that really stood out for me were between the realistic Son, and the story-telling Father. The movie shows alot of depth as these two people try to understand eachother.

Anyway, I just wanted to say that I liked the movie because it's not mainstream - it doesn't really fit into any genre. It was fun to watch the story unfold, not really knowing where it was going to take you. I pondered over the movie in the days after I saw it, trying to find \\"the message\\". In the end, I decided there wasn't one, but at least it caused me to think, and to consider my own relationship with my now-deceased father. If the movie accomplished nothing elese, that was enough.

It had spectacular imagery and the acting was wonderful, but story-wise, it didn't really grab my attention and turned out to be dissapointing. Some of the characters were interesting, some annoying and pointless. I definitely liked the 'stories' parts of the film more enjoyable than the present times scenes.

Basically, McGregor's failed attempt to speak with a Southern accent ruined it for me, particularly since Albert Finney (who plays Edward Bloom in the later years) is a native Southerner and speaks accordingly. The end result: it was extremely hard to believe that McGregor and Finney represented two stages in the life of one character... In fact, they appeared to be two totally different people. Nevertheless, I have to admit that the set design was fantastic."},{"rating":"1","title":"pure doo doo","review":"I am from the south and we don't all speak with exaggerated accents and we don't all lie to get our points across. shame on you tim burton for perpetuating this hateful stereotype of southerners!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Parents corner","review":"Just wanted to say, on top of being drab, it was filthy. with crude coments and nude shots frome behind, I would not recomend it to any family who is sensitive to movie content."},{"rating":"1","title":"Big Fish??

Don't buy Big Fish."},{"rating":"1","title":"a far-ranging fantasy","review":"\\"Big Fish\\" is a chick flick about male characters. Many will find this mixture of tall tale and reality, strangely unsatisfying in spite of competent acting performances turned in by Albert Finney, Billy Crudup, and Ewan McGregor. The women are relegated to very minor roles and their characters are barely fleshed out.The story of Edward Bloom, a \\"social person\\", and a storyteller who embellishes the truth at every turn. The movie revolves around a series of flashbacks, some believable, others fantastical. Bloom's son struggles to find the real man behind his father's ever-changing smokescreens; he wants to connect with his father while there is still time, before Bloom's terminal illness claims him.\\"Big Fish\\" will doubtless fall into the \\"love it or hate it\\" category. This reviewer did not find a great deal to love."},{"rating":"1","title":"Falls short.","review":"Being a huge admirer of Tim Burton's work, I eagerly anticipated seeing \\"Big Fish.\\" However, I was completely disappointed by it. This was supposed to be a very personal film for him and yet it feels utterly impersonal. There is no point at which I was pulled into the story. Although Billy Crudup's character knows his father is dying, he treats him father as a child and seems to have no emotion about the eventual loss. This seemed unbelievable. I was also expecting something more colorful and visually stunning. Expect for one tender scene in which Albert Finney and Jessica Lange are in the bathtub fully clothed together, this film unfortunately falls short of it's potential. It's possible that I had expectation that were too high, but nevertheless, it just didn't grab me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply Beautiful","review":"This is a great movie.

Some quite funny moments (my favorite is the North Korean ventriloquist) and just some really odd and unusual images, along with some endearing and likeable characters made this an entertaining film. However, I found the \\"moral\\" of the story to be fairly wishy-washy and lukewarm (we live on in our stories), devoid of any real intellectual sustenance.

The way he makes the movie all dark, and just....amazing at the same time is amazing. He is like one of my favorite director of all time, Better than Spielberg. This is a father and son movie and I would understand if someone cried during the film. I felt like crying. This is like the first really great fairy tale in year's...!!!

Ewan MacGregor and evereybody else does a great job. I can't believe this did not win best picture at the Academy Awards. Tim Burton's recent films have not been very good, but he really outdid himself on this one. Albert Finney plays an old, dying man whose son has never thought much of his amazing tales.

I found Big Fish uninteresting, slow moving to the point of boring, and it didn't seem to have a point. It sounded good from what I heard told about it when it was in theaters, with its giant and enchanted town, its evil old crone who forecasts death, its \\"big fish\\" and its love story, but when I watched it on DVD I was put off, and I can't quite define why. Big Fish has a good cast and some nice sets and once or twice it almost seemed to find its pace, but it never grabbed me, and that's unique among everything Burton has done.

If the cinema where I saw this movie burned, at least I would have the solace of knowing that a print of this terrible movie was destroyed.I am a huge fan of movies with fantasy components(Brazil, Moulin Rouge, etc.)and therefore found it puzzling that I disliked this movie so virulently. The movie flip flops between the present and a story of the dying father to the fantastic stories that the father tells. The problem is the juxtaposition of fantasy and reality. The doses of reality prevent us from properly entering the world of fantasy; and the sometimes bizzare story scenes make us unable to find any true emotion for the dying father.This movie fails on all counts.I strongly suggest that anyone considering seeing, buying, or even renting this movie reconsider.I'm only giving this move a star because I have to."},{"rating":"1","title":"See another movie instead","review":"Don't waste your time with this movie, see another movie instead.

RIP OFF!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"ill fitting, cheesy sounding","review":"I was expecting much more than this. None of the three supplied sizes of molded ends fit my ears, they just will not stay in. Even if I do manage it, they stick out ridiculously. The dang things are HUGE and very ugly.It is very difficult to tell the right from the left. How hard could it have been to make each side a different color? As it is, they are *silver* colored semi-soft plastic. They have a miniscule colored dot to differentiate sides, but I need a magnifying glass to see it in most lighting.As far as the sonic quality is concerned, they are no better than the $10 pair of generic buds you get at your local five-and-dime. Save your money, don't buy these."},{"rating":"1","title":"cheap, but not worth it","review":"Everybodies ear shape is different, but I personally find all three of the supplied sizes of hearbuds to be very uncomfortable. But the worst thing about this package is the terrible quality of the headset. The published frequency response is a joke - they sound like dollar store earbuds. I consider my money wasted, and I'll be buying some shure or etymotics isolating earphones."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lennie Tristano, cool and muddy","review":"This is a very nice record, beautiful cover and fascinating playing by the trio Lennie Tristano (piano), Peter Ind (bass) and Tom Weyburn (drums). The only disappointment is the rather muddy sound, which is not typical for the mid 1950's recordings. Maybe one reason might be that these sessions were recorded during the years 1955-56 at the Lennie Tristano's Manhattan home-based studio by himself as a recording engineer. This album is available only in a new 180 g vinyl format and it is a new production. Despite the sound limitations it is highly recommended for every serious Lennie Tristano fans. Hopefully this will be published as a cd with a better remastering."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst ever book","review":"This is the MOST terrible book I've ever bought in my life. I don't have many VB books, but I have a total of 8 VB books.I bought this book thinking I could learn something with it, but nooooooooo... it just contain a stupid sprite.dll that does all the work. So what are we suppose to learn?This guy is just showing off what he can do with VB and makes you pay for it. He's nothing but a LOUSY teacher, he definitely sucks, I'll never ever buy any books from this author anymore.I STRONGLY oppose to this book, don't even think of buy it, if not you'll regret it for the rest of your life."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very misleading!","review":"I was really excited when I bought this book,thinking I wasactually going to learn some cool stuff.

A reasonable assumption from the title. The book not only does not do it, but it doesn't even attempt to do it. What the book should be teaching is hidden in a DLL that accompanies the book. So one learns nothing. Even the DLL is amateurish (it causes GPFs for one thing).As an experienced programmer of 36 years I have read hundreds of computer books. This one is close to the worst one I have ever read. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible...","review":"Half a year ago, I thought this was a good book. Today, I believe it is a really, really, bad, waste-of-money, pathetic un-useful book. I mean, even those free web sites written by nobody are better than it.

First off, they didn't even teach you code, they just tell you to add some ocx to your program. Secondly, the ocx was messed up!! Also, when they got to the 3D programming part, you had to include into your program something that was written in C++. I was really hoping to learn something from this book, but unfortunately I didn't."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ditto's to previous reviews","review":"This is a VERY ATTRACTIVE book - only on the front & rear covers. That is it's only redeeming value. It shows a high resolution - rendered drawing on the back which made me think I was going to be doing this with this book... NOT! I Wish I had read the other review and the Warning! Warning! Warning! on page xxi before I bought this book!!! You have to set your display to only 256 colors or you'll get a GPF (crash!). The other clue I should have heeded was discovered on page 153. It's a screen image which says, \\"...Unregistered Version 1.0 Register to get:- 16 and 24 bit colour depth support...\\" This is a cheap shot! I am not going to send him MORE MONEY (whatever 22.50 pounds is). You can get ActiveX controls which support 16 & 24 bit color for free on the internet! The book is too expensive for what you get and I am returning it to the place I bought it from. I'll be happy to stick with my \\"Instant VB Animation\\" by Michele Leroux..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not Buy","review":"This book seemed a little intimidating for me. I am just a beggining programmer with little experience in advanced animation. This book was misleading because it told me it was designed for everybody. The author of the book wrote an active x control that the entire book is based upon. This active control is sharewhare and if you want to get one that works with 16.7 million colors he charges you. I paid 60 dollars for the book I'm not paying you 30 more dollars. Also the book does not teach you how to make animation from scratch just use a bunch of DLL files that come with the book. I had trouble loading all and using the dll files and am still having trouble. The version of visual basic he is using is not the same as mine because some of the examples in their he is telling me to stuff that I cant do because it is not in my visual basic 5. I do not recommend this book to anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Why not?","review":"Yes, I agree it's cover is very attractive, but so is the content.

Aside from the storyline, the illustrations are otherworldly. It really appears as if the faeries have been squished between the pages. I first saw this book my junior year of high school and have been serching for it since! I looked for this book everywhere and Amazon was the only one able to find it! DEFINITE recommendation! Brian Froud brings them to life!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Could have been taken to greater length.","review":"At first I was all eager to get, and read this interesting book, but was however disappointed. I would say that it is too shallow, and Brian Froud's illustrations are not at all convincing since it kind of should look like 'actual' pressed fairies - in photorealistic style, and not pastel colored pixies. They could have done that, and certainly Froud is talented enough, but it does seem rushed. When you compare the quality of this book to 'Fairies' then the later is much better in illustration - knowing it is a different type of book. The idea of the book is a very good one, but it could have been better, however the story itself - all the little entries are funny though."},{"rating":"1","title":"You never know what lurks behind a pretty bookcover...","review":"I rate this book 1 Star solely because it is THANKFULLY a very fast read! I received this book as a gift, had never heard of it and naively assumed it was a sweet story about pretty little sprites like Tinkerbell! In reality it is a Victorian era girl's \\"diary\\" about \\"faeries\\" who she contends are all the blame for her infered sexual dallinces. I found nothing amusing between the pages- either handwriten or \\"pressed\\"! The hideous drawings of flattened faeries must represent her repulsion of her own sexuality, men and love. That's all I got out of this book! On behalf of all beautiful angelic faced sprites, the only kind that truly exist of course,I not only condemn this book but most certainly would never recommend it for young readers- or anyone of any age for that matter! I suggest using it to stoke up a fire on a cold winter's night!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Buy This For Your Children","review":"Don't you DARE buy this book for your children unless they are interested in child pornography. I bought this for my daughter for Christmas since she has a fairy obsession. I received the book and looked through it to make sure it was in good shape. I ripped the bad pages out and wrapped it. There were still TONS of bad pages though. It talks about the author getting kissed on the lips by their uncle and sex! I decided to unwrap it and blot out the bad parts but there was almost nothing left except a few pages so I threw it away. What a waste of my time and money!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Incredible!

It's numbers are ISBN 0-684-83206-2 and is a wonderful addition to your collection. The calenders are a daily reminder that we need to laugh much more than we do.

My daughter needs one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fascinating Fairy Book.","review":"Once i scanned through the pages of this book i had to sit down and have a proper look. As so many other readers i couldn't put it down until i finished it. It's interesting, and at stages somewhat confusing. If you know some background details of the \\"reality\\" behind fairies you will know what Lady Cottington is talking about when pouring her heart out on the pages of her diary. The pictures are intriguing, and awakens the wondering if this could be real or not. And if it's just a confused soul that found logic in her insanity by describing whatever she did that was moraly wrong as the fairies fault. She captured the images of fairies and other creatures, wheter pressed or drawings colorfully in watercolor paint. Very interesting, make sure you have a solid belief about fairies before reading this book, it might change your mind!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Lady cottington- o how i wish i was her...","review":"...She must have had such a brilliant life o how i wish i could catch fairy's they're also beautiful. almost at least at one point in this book you can relate to her!!!i have read the book i just haven't got it yet but i suggest that any of those who have a great imagination and want to, must, at least, read this!!!!everyone must love Lady Cottington's pressed fairy book!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not sure I like Pressed fairies","review":"This is a cute book but I guess I just can't get into the idea of pressed fairies (really because of the symbolism) - the end of the book underscores the impact - there are no more fairies (well, they're dead, pressed between the pages of the book). The book just rubbed me the wrong way I guess - I rather see anything free and alive than caught, tagged, pressed, preserved and dead. Gave this two stars because the artwork is indeed nice and taken with a grain of salt I guess it has some humor - problem is the lack of compassion."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cute fun plus some \\"ew, yuck.\\"","review":"Lady Cottington kept a journal from the time she was a child, in 1895, until 1910. During that time, she captured many of her thoughts between those pages. Her thoughts were the least of what was caught.As a quiet and innocent child, she would sit in the garden. If she was quiet enough, the garden fairies would come out. They would hover in front of her, over the book in her lap, andSNAP. The book slammed shut on the fairy, leaving colored fairy-goosh on the two facing pages.We are assured that (a few unfortunate cases notwithstanding) that the fairies were not hurt in the process and left only a psychic impression. Still, there's a queasy macabre sense about the book's premise.It's illustrated by Brian Froud, so you know it's good. It's written by Terry Jones, a Monty Python alumnus, so you know it's funny. That's about it: good and funny. Enjoy!//wiredweird"},{"rating":"2","title":"I Knew There Were FAIRIES Behind The Potting Shed........","review":"I absolutly loved this book, its a bit large and people are selling it for way too much but its worth it! the paintings were amazing! brian froud struts his stuff again! although i wouldnt recomend this book to readers under the age of 13, it has partial nudity if not full, on some of the faeries, and some discriptions wich would not be suitable for the inocent."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely a one-off!

I only stuck with it out of respect for Gellis's earlier works, including Roselynde and Alinor. This one is poorly thought out and executed. None of the characters rang true; Alex second guesses himself so frequently that I wanted to scream. Desiree's abrupt personality changes made me shake my head in wonder. I could never work up enough interest to care whether or not Vachel actually carried out any of his not well planned schemes. And the love scenes were almost laughable at times....an example is a one sentence paragraph: \\"Oh, oh!\\" Desiree cried. I am saddened at this below-par work from a normally engaging author and I hope her next book takes us back into the writing and magic of her earlier works. I give this book 2 stars based on my respect for Gellis as an author, not based on my enjoyment of this book at all."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gellis Lover","review":"I am a great fan of Roberta Gellis. Of all of her books, I love the Roselynde Chronicles the best. So, I was glad to see another story from that series, although it is not of Alinor's direct family. The hero is the nephew of Simon, Alinor's first husband and the story occurs between \\"Roselynde\\" and \\"Alinor\\". Those of you who like the rich historical detail and the authenticity of her stories will be glad to know that Gellis has continued to be true to the period. Those who like \\"bodice rippers\\" in general will love the story as well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Packinghouse Daughter","review":"We lived in Albert Lea, MN, during the time of the big strike there.

I was hooked! It's roomy but not too big for my lunchbag needs. The material is flexible enough but not limp -- the bag stands up on it's own. It also feels really neat. It seems to be well-made and simple enough that if necessary I could do some repairs.

It's huge and amazingly stretchy. I bought it to go with the laptop sleeve and carry it instead of the charger bag. When I did use it as a lunch bag, I could put a whole pound of strawberries in it, plus my lunch. I had it so full I thought it might rip, but it never did. It just stretched even more. I think it would seem empty with only the lunch pictured with it. It won't keep frozen food frozen long but it's ok for bringing ice cream home from the store.

If you're stylistically opposed to upbeat '80s new-age synth rock, there isn't really much here for you, but genre notwithstanding many tracks are quite addictive in English or German. Within the synthesizers and power-set drums, there is a bit of variation in style, from the well-executed middle-of-the-road fast-rock of Noah Plan to pointedly bright and simplistic U.S.A., to an unusual take on experimental reggae in Lifetime Guarantee. Silent Night is the worst fit on the album, but even it is variety (how many times do you ever hear '80s synth spoken-word jam in German?).

Once you get it, you won't want to listen to anything else. The lyrics are deep, full of alcohol and heartbreak.

There are also serious, sad songs like \\"Enjoy Your Day\\" and \\"Sorry About That.\\" What I like most about Alkaline Trio, what sets them apart from other bands, is that their lyrics are actually poetry, as beautiful to read as they are to listen to. My personal favorite songs on this album are \\"Cringe,\\" \\"As You Were,\\" \\"My Little Needle,\\" and \\"Sorry About That.\\" For anyone who hasn't heard this album, I reccomend that you go out and get it ASAP."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow thats a great rock record.","review":"The alkaline trio is a damn fine rock group and this is a wonderful album, records as good as this are truly few and far between.

It starts with two eccentric rich old men who both are absorbed in their collection of bears. But, they both want to own the first Teddy Bear - the million dollar bear. One actually steals the bear from the other and is pompous enough to admit it. I am drawn into the story by the \\"million-dollar\\" bear who only wants to be loved for who he is. Yet, he is kept in a temperature-controlled safe in the dark to preserve him. Then too, along the way, the author gives us \\"side-bars\\" of humor with episodes engaging the butler. A favorite bit of humor sneaks in when the child spies the eccentric millionaire wearing his false face disguise. This is a delightful story with a powerful impact for readers of all ages. The author weaves the story to bring a satisfying - yet, surprise ending. This book leaves me with a \\"warm and fuzzy\\" feeling."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is a must have book for anyone who loves Teddy Bears!!","review":"With the help of wonderful illustrations and great storytelling ability, you can truly feel this wonderful teddy bear's loneliness and his ecstatic bliss of finally being loved...really loved.

Perhaps if I eat it all I will finally 'od' on licorice and leave it alone for a long while. Update: Did not overdose on licorice. Note to self: never order 5 lbs of any candy again. Note to others: Licorice can raise blood pressure. If you are watching your blood pressure, don't buy 5 lbs. The best licorice I've ever tasted was Lucky something.

It still haunts me in a pleasant sort of way, and certainly turned me on to the power of Stephen Hunter as an author. He weaves his books together in a way that will quickly have you hunting for the next one.I run into guys that have read his stuff, & we just smile with the knowledge we've shared a powerful experience in realism by reading his books. Speaking as a southerner, Stephen Hunter nails the culture as few writers today can achieve. Be forewarned, it's strong medicine. He takes you right to the scene of the crime."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent suspense and real characters","review":"Good guys against bad guys but after awhile you forget who is who. You identify with bad ass Lamar and his group of murdering misfits and understand what makes them tick. On the other side Bud is imperfect but on the side of good. The book sweeps you along to what you know will be a violent end. It doesn't disappoint, this is a great read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great insight into the criminal mind","review":"One of Stephen Hunter's best books. Hunter creates a terrifying super-criminal. This guy is scary because, through Hunter's writing, he becomes real. Unusually for books of the genre, we get inside the mind of this murderer and understand his amorality and logic behind his actions. The other characters in the book are very well drawn as well.This is as real as you would want it to get."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good ol' american cops and robber yarn","review":"What fun!! A book you either love or hate and I loved it. Borrowed it off a mate and didn't give it back (must be the Lamar in me). The characters are two dimensional but not dull, the bad guys care for no one and are burning a one way track straight to hell. The cop is a gun totin, hat wearin, tobacco chewin, good ol' American boy from the deep south. They're on a collision course and heaven help anyone who gets in the way.

You can complain all you want about the first paragraph being disgusting, but you have to admit it hooks you right away. I loved the insights into the criminal mind: especially in how Lamar set up the Denny's robbery.

I'd read reviews saying that it was bad, but I had no idea. When the hero of the book has no redeeming characteristics other than getting an upper from hurting people, well, you know what to expect. Since this was shown as one of the Bob Swagger novels I expected him to make an appearance, but no such luck.It was ALL downhill.. Don't waste your time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Book lacks a moral rudder","review":"Hunter writes with a lot of energy and adrenaline, but the book is shallow.

Attempting to regain the time I spent reading it I lied to a friend and said oh this is really good you must read it. He read it and said oh you are a bad man. the opening description of Lamar Pie and his physical prowess was a warning I did not heed, oh woe. the characters are so bad, for instance Bud Pewtie oh. James Ellroy said that this book was good and that it hummed with the rhythm of blue grass and it does not.So many authors have taken the detective genre and written amazing novels- James Ellroy's American Tabloid is a fine example and to be fair maybe they tricked him.

If you all read it my revenge will be complete."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very entertaining","review":"I have read about a half dozen of Hunter's books and this fits in very nicely with the rest.

The action is top notch. I highly recommend this book and I look forward to reading the next Stephen Hunter novel."},{"rating":"2","title":"Stephen Hunter's best book.","review":"My friend gave me this book and I was skeptical because of the title.

This is another of Stephen Hunter's books that is just begging for a big screen adaptation. It features some truly wicked action set pieces, the highlight of which, for me, is an insane-o shoot out in a DENNY's restaurant. If you like tightly plotted thrillers with memorable characters and just the kind of books in general that zip thru you compulsively once you pick them up, you can do no better than DIRTY WHITE BOYS."},{"rating":"1","title":"overwrought characters","review":"I am a big Stephen Hunter fan but this book was so over the top that I almost couldn't finish it.

Even the \\"good guys\\" are disgusting. Extremely violent, every other word is a profanity. I should have guessed it was going to be bad from the title, but I felt like I needed to read it if I was going to review it. I love thrillers and action books, but this was just too gross for me. I read \\"Point of Impact\\", which I enjoyed, but because of this book, I probably won't read any more of Stephen Hunter."},{"rating":"2","title":"Powerful & Original","review":"A lot of thought and detail has gone into this novel.Throughout the book details large and small add real credibility to the story. Most of us would never consider robbing a bar and if we did we would never think of the clever tricks Stephen Hunter comes up with.The characters are well developed and interesting. We are taken inside a brutal prison and into the mind of what hollywood would paint as simply a bad man or psychopath and actually see parts of his character to respect!The only thing that prevents the book from being perfect is a couple of loose links. They almost feel like coincidences that go against the grain for the rest of the books down to earth, give no quarter style. The tracking down of Lamars car and hide out stick out in my memory.Even with this critisisum I still found the book hard to down and rate it very highly."},{"rating":"2","title":"Outstanding Prose","review":"This is one of the most outstanding books I have had the pleasure of reading. The author is one of the best to come along in quite some time. A number of people did not like it because of the language and violence and that is their problem and does not take away from the fact this is a great read.

They repeatedly told her she was worthless, everyone hated her, and told her to die. She tried to hide her symptoms as long as possible, believing that everyone else heard voices also. She was able to make it through college, before she became overwhelmed and attempted suicide. At first her parents though she was under stress, that she was going through a phase and expected her to snap out of it after a bit of rest and relaxation. Instead, Lori began the revolving journey from hospital, to half-way house, and back again as she struggled in a seemingly hostile world.From shock therapy, to talk therapy and endless medication Lori spiraled rapidly out of control. Told from multiple point of views, the book explores the effect of schizophrenia on the patient, their family and friends. I would highly recommend this book to anyone interested in mental health, or affected by the disease."},{"rating":"2","title":"Unbelievable","review":"I absolutely loved this book. I could not put it down. The fact that Lori grew up in the same county as me, attended the same college (Pace), shopped at the same stores, and ate at the same places made it so real to me, like she was speaking to me, right there in the same room. Although I do not have the disease, I know of people who do, and I too, thought there was little hope for them. When Lori would describe where she had gone on what day and time, I tried to look back and remember what I was doing at that time. Being from an affluent area, one can really lose sight that these things happen to real people - not just crazy people in the middle of no where. I would love to meet Lori or find out how she is doing now. If you are from Westchester NY, especially, and have an interest at all in psychiatry or pscyhology - you should definitely read this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book! Great price!

I highly recommend the book, and I'm glad it's part of my collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must read for all adults-","review":"This is a book that not only educates but provides the reader with a new compassion for those who deal with mental illness. Ms. Schiller presents a very complete picture of the sufferings of the mentally ill. From her writing, I gained a new perspective- including greater compassion- for those who are victims of this awful illness. I have only the highest praise for her honesty, her insight and her struggle. She is to be highly commended. A definite read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rare and informative","review":"As a psychotherapist, this book made a deep impression on me. I never expected to read such a convincing and engaging acccount of the schizophrenic's experience. I feel more able to empathise and understand by clients for having read it. I recommend it highly to anyone interested in the subject and, especially, to anyone struggling with the disease in a friend or family member."},{"rating":"2","title":"INSPIRATION!! GRIPPING! EYE OPENING!","review":"I'm a psychologist. I attended a seminar several years ago and had the pleasure of meeting this author and hearing her speak. What a courageous soul! The book was excellent; she told her story well! For those of us who are so-called 'sane' -what a shocker to have a personal glimse into how devastating a mental illness can be and how much of an uphill struggle it can be for people like her. What an eye-opening experience! I give her much credit for her battle and she has come out triumphant!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Riveting!","review":"This book helps see into the confused world of mental illness like no other. Wonderful & hopeful!"},{"rating":"2","title":"You can't put it down!","review":"Being in a psychiatric hospital much like Lori, this book rang bells of similarity. Finally a look onto the other side of this illness. Beautifully written from all perspectives. An easy reader, but well worth picking up!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A illness of its own","review":"I chose to read this book for a project at school because mysister Andrea in California is suffering from this disease. I havelearned a lot about the illness through the mind of Mary-Beth (Lori Schiller). I think that it is good that she was able to recognize that she was encountering an illness. To be able to see the problem and put it into remission, and then to turn around and write a book on how she did it, she helps other people get a better understanding. This disease can tear a person and their family apart very slowly. I know that my sister will soon end up the way Mary-Beth did if I do not seek help for her. By reading this book it gave me a preview of what things could be like. I only pray that they do not get any worse ... As far as the book, I liked it a lot and I thought it was very educational."},{"rating":"2","title":"Quiet Room","review":"Could not put the book down. At the end I wanted to know more about Lori. Very good reading."},{"rating":"2","title":"excellent","review":"One of the best books I have read on mental illness. As a mental health nurse this helped me to empathize with my patients and better understand the tourment they go through on a regular basis. This book was beautifully written and hopefully opens everyones eyes to the need for attention on mental health care in our country."},{"rating":"1","title":"watching paint dry","review":"i understand where she is coming from, but it was a bit dry. my review is a little under average, but its my opinion. cant change it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Really fun!","review":"For anyone who lives in Milwaukee or has connections there, this is a great book. The photos are top-notch and I learned a lot about the city from the interesting explanations. My only disappointment was that the Allen Bradley clock tower wasn't in there. Maybe, being built in the early 60s, it didn't qualify as old enough, but it IS the world's largest 4-sided clock (with faces twice the size of Big Ben) and quite a landmark. So 4 1/2 stars if I could :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great gift","review":"Bought this for my brother for a Christmas present.He's the most critical person I know and absolutely loves this."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Must Buy Book","review":"This book has absolutely the best photographs I have seen showing the history of Milwaukee.I have lived in Milwaukee my whole life and I have learned so much.Every person I show this too has raved about this book.What a fantastic bargain!"}]`),E={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:D},data(){return{visibleCount:6,poemsData:B,isLoading:!1}},computed:{visiblePoems(){return this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(o=>setTimeout(o,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=6,this.isLoading=!1}}},M={class:"card-container"},j=["disabled"],C={key:0},O={key:1};function N(o,e,n,u,r,s){const c=y("PoemCard");return a(),i("section",null,[e[1]||(e[1]=t("div",{class:"top-banner"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🎉 Your SNAP 🥳")])],-1)),t("div",M,[(a(!0),i(w,null,f(s.visiblePoems,(h,g)=>(a(),b(c,{key:g,poem:h},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),s.hasMorePoems?(a(),i("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",disabled:r.isLoading,onClick:e[0]||(e[0]=(...h)=>s.loadMore&&s.loadMore(...h))},[r.isLoading?(a(),i("span",O,"Loading...")):(a(),i("span",C,"See more"))],8,j)):p("",!0)])}const W=d(E,[["render",N],["__scopeId","data-v-032cfea9"]]),P=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"quotes/42.md","filePath":"quotes/42.md"}'),H={name:"quotes/42.md"},G=Object.assign(H,{setup(o){return(e,n)=>(a(),i("div",null,[v(W)]))}});export{P as __pageData,G as default};
