In January 2010 the product stopped working properly. It now skips sound every 5 seconds or so. I tried calling Coby's warranty service and their CSR verified what I feared. The warranty is exactly as it states on Coby's on website:[...] . In order to get a replacement you have to send the original item back to Coby (which will likely cost you $4 shipping) AND you must send them a $6 money order to cover return shipping back to you. So essentially the warranty is useless as it's going to cost you more to get a replacement then buying a new one from Amazon. The product did work perfectly for 8-9 months so if you are ok with spending $9 every 8-9 months then this product might be ok for you (assuming you get one that lasts as long as mine did), otherwise look elsewhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"Short Product Life","review":"When I first started using this, I loved it. It worked fine in my car cassette deck and had decent sound. Then, after about a week or so, it stopped working. It would no longer play in my cassette deck, which ejected it as soon as I put it in every time."},{"rating":"2","title":"2 out of 3 work","review":"Over the past 2 years, I've bought 3 of these cassette adaptors: one for myself, and 2 for my parents, who both have nice new iPods as of last Christmas. 2 of them worked in several different cassette players (including 2 different auto-reverse cassette players), and the sound quality was great. The third one would not work at all in an auto-reverse cassette player, so I sent it back and Amazon.com refunded it with no problem. We replaced it with a MP3-radio transmitter, which works almost as well as the cassette adaptor was supposed to."},{"rating":"2","title":"love it","review":"This item is great. My first one lasted two years and only broke because I got it wedged in my parking break and yanked too hard and messed up the wires. I am re-purchasing because it is a cheap, effective way to listen to an ipod through your tape deck. MY car is ten years old and when its super cold out, sometimes the tape deck keeps spitting the adapter out. My trick is to bang it a few times on something and insert it again. Other than that, the thing is flawless. You'll see other ones on Amazon for much more and the reviewers seem to have issues."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for the price","review":"I needed a way to listen to my iPod in my car, but I didn't want to spend a lot of money because I don't spend that much time in my car. I tried a few of the less expensive FM transmitters and they either did not work at all, or they worked so poorly that I quit using them.This is a good product for someone who needs functionality over premium sound quality. Overall--excellent for the price."},{"rating":"1","title":"Low quality, don't waste the time or money","review":"Like some other reviews on here, I received this product, inserted it into my cassette deck, and plugged in an iPhone -- only to find that the right channel of the music wasn't working. No matter what I did (reinserting the cassette, fiddling with the plug, etc) I could not get the right half of any audio to work. Went to a local store and bought a different brand of cassette adapter (Maxell)...that one worked perfectly right away with full stereo sound. This Coby product has poor quality control, for whatever reason the right channel will not work (my guess would be a problem with the cable or plug). Don't waste your money, buy a different brand!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Hiss/Pop during playback","review":"I ordered the Coby CA-747 Cassette Adapter brand new from Amazon. Item arrived as promised. However, the sound quality was horrible. I used a Phillips adapter prior to purchasing this one. The Phillips lasted about 2 years. One day the sound began to come out only from one speaker. The sound quality of the Phillips was outstanding. This one, not so much. I'm not sure if I received a defective unit. I returned it back to Amazon. I will purchase another Phillips and hope the jack does not go bad again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Does not work","review":"Just very disappointed to say that it just does not work. The cassette just stops rolling, so not useful at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Already broken","review":"After two days of use, one of the audio channels (right, I think) has cut out completely. The wire the comes with this is extremely cheap, and the wires have messed up somehow at the 1/8\\" connection side. I can get the full audio after messing with it, but it again goes out if the wire moves at all. Unacceptable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible","review":"Bought it as brand new from Amazon. Everything came packaged, new, on time. The problem was the actual cassette adapter. Only one side of my car stereo works when I plug this in. Not only that, but the sound quality is terrible (Which I assume is due to the faulty product). I can't even return it because it came in a package that requires ripping, so I can't put back the plastic box since I used scissors. Don't buy this, better luck buying one for $0.99 and hope for the best with that."},{"rating":"1","title":"initially worked but then........","review":"Overall, this product worked ok with my ipod. However, when I played some songs, the quality of the songs didn't transfer well into my car speakers. They would sound very shrill, especially if there were words containing the letter \\"s\\". Also, sometimes the songs would lack in bass whereas when I'd listen to my ipod with regular apple headphones, there was a good amount of bass in the songs. About 6 months after using the cassette, the wire started breaking (and I never removed the cassette from my car nor did I handle it roughly). Music started coming out only from one of my speakers. After trying to fix it with electrical tape, sound wasn't being transferred at all to my car speakers. -.-'"},{"rating":"1","title":"You get what you pay for","review":"When I bought this I was in desperate need of a new cassette adapter for my car and wasn't looking to break the budget, so I bought this guy. At first it worked okay, but within a few weeks it started skipping and making music painful to listen to. Furthermore on more than one occasion it got jammed for one reason or another, and I eventually just pulled the wire out of it (yes, I know, not intended). Perhaps I got a faulty one, but in the end I was not very pleased.

I recommend going with dynex it seems like there the best brand out there when it comes to cassette adapters."},{"rating":"2","title":"Quality cassette adapter","review":"I agree with the others that have provided a favorable review. I am pleasantly surprised with many aspects of the product. It feels like a quality product.

Good thing I crank my tunes or it would get annoying.Sometimes my 1998 Lexus ES300 will just simply not like the adapter at all and keep ejecting it, so I can't use it at all for that trip.Maybe my adapter is faulty, but I don't think so. I think it is just hard for the tape player to spin like most of the other adapeters on the market.Update - this thing never works now. \\"Push tape in, reverse, reverse, eject.\\" That's what my music sounds like these days.I finally just chucked it in a dumpster."},{"rating":"1","title":"Works well until it wears out","review":"I bought this in August and it had completely destroyed itself by February.

I inserted it into the cassette player on my stock 2005 Honda CR-V radio and driving bliss resumed - listening to my ipod. Then my radio began to FF the casette, thus interrupting the playback. I ejected it, and tried two more times. Each time, 20 minutes in or so, it would FF.I sent it back.Your mileage may vary."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's doing what it's supposed to do...","review":"...and doing it much better than other expensive brands.I bought a Philips before this one and it didn't last for 3 plays.

It worked noise so I decided to buy a new one which more expensive. I think it will better than my cheap one. But, everything is disappointed. I inserted it into the cassette of my car and the noise is louder, but that is not the worst thing. The tape runs every 30 seconds and stop about 3 seconds.

The sound quality is far much worse than FM transmitter my friend has."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works Great!","review":"Cheap and easy. We bought two and use them in two different car stereos with two generations of iPod."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works Great! Great upgrade","review":"I had a Maxwell cassette adapter that i had bought from Walgreens for about 10$ a few years ago. Every time i would attach this to an mp3 player i had to make sure the sound was about 3/4 on the device or it would get all muddy.Beside for the muddy it would also broadcast the sound in very low quality (even with a good system [Bose, JBL etc..]). I finally decided to look for an upgrade, and i found this with really high amount of 3-5 stars and very few % of lower.This has been one of the greatest buys i have ever got, its quality is amazing, the feature to switch which side the wire comes out of is a very useful feature for cars that have the tape in horizontally. The only issue i have with this adapter is that it makes a clicking sound while it is in the tape deck (it can be drowned out by music but still can be annoying if the music isn't that loud)."},{"rating":"1","title":"VERY Disappointing!","review":"I was very encouraged when I read so many glowing reports, especially regarding older vehicles. However, this product DOES NOT work well in my vehicle, a 1999 Jeep Cherokee with the factory-installed stereo system still intact. I'm not sure why, but I have a suspicion that it has something to do with the fact that my tape player does not have an actual play button - it begins playing the tape as soon as it is inserted. I tried switching between radio/cd/tape and then engaging the adapter and iPod, but that did not help. When engaged, the volume is so low that you cannot hear it while driving. I could go on - but .... You really do get what you pay for. And I was so looking forward to listening to my iPod while driving."},{"rating":"2","title":"Does the job it is designed to do","review":"I use it in my 2000 Ford Expedition and it does an excellent job.

No static or interruptions...I love it! The only reason I didnt give 5 stars is; if you have the music turned way down you can hear a slight whining noise coming from the player. But I rarely have it turned down that low, so it really isn't an issue. Also, I read that some people were having problems with it not working with auto reverse tape players, however I haven't had any problems any all. I am so happy with this purchase!"},{"rating":"1","title":"doesn't work","review":"The cassette doesn't work on my car tape player. I have had cassette adapters in the past and I know that after awhile they get finicky. But this one doesn't work from the get go.

But I have yet to check on it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Did not work in my car's tape player","review":"This adapter did not work in my car's tape player. My car tape-player has an auto-reverse feature that can not be disabled, so I assume I had the same problem that other reviewers noted.

And because the connector to the cassette is modular it will work with a wide variety of decks. Sound quality is good, though I didn't do any kind of rigorous test.The problem for me was noise. I purchased it to replace another adapter that was intermittently noisy. This one makes a permanent, very noticeable, non-stop clatter whenever the deck is turning. This makes it totally unusable for me and I'm going to have to return it. That's unfortunate, given the price, but there you are."},{"rating":"1","title":"Useless","review":"I bought this so I could listen to my iPod in my 1997 Ford Escort, but it didn't work at all. It kept switching from side one to side two and then ejecting itself from the tape deck about every thirty seconds. It was absolutely worthless, so I went to Wal-Mart and bought a Phillips adaptor instead. That adaptor works just fine, so it's not my tape deck's problem."},{"rating":"1","title":"One-year manufacturer's warranty is useless","review":"I liked the unit it broke after 3 months of very light use. Upon opening it up for inspection, I found that during assembly, a wire had been screwed through, and that caused enough tension to eventually break the solder. Coby will honor the warranty, but it costs more to send it back and pay $6 for return shipping than it would to replace it. Careless assembly combined with a warranty inappropriate for the unit make purchasing this a gamble. Too bad it worked well at first - Amazon will pay return shipping to Amazon for a time if an item is defective, but it broke after that time had passed. Perhaps cheap electronics are best bought form a physical store that has a generous return policy."},{"rating":"2","title":"So Far So Good","review":"This is the second one I've bought (the first lasted about 3 months) - works great, just hoping I get more than 3 months out of this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Coby Cassete Adapter","review":"I bought this cassette adapter roughly 3 weeks ago and it has already stopped working properly.

Coiled so that you do not have to worry about loose cables in the car. Can move the connector to multiple positions. But it does not stay in the deck. Ejects after only about 30 seconds. My old one AS-470 did not do this. This one apparently does not work well with auto-reverse decks. I should not have to modify it to make it work. Not worth it. Avoid this unit. Waste of money. My old one, I had to place it with a certain side up, which made it work properly with Auto-Reverse decks."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just ok","review":"I couldn't find any of these cassette adapters in the stores, maybe they're not making them as much anymore? this one definitely causes a slight distortion if my music is turned up even a little bit and has an odd humming sound when the Ipod isn't plugged in.

The quality of the sound is not as good as if having a direct MP3 connection, but I consider it very good...(not sure it's even fair to compare).

Why was it rushed to print?","review":"O'Higgins has summarized his approach to making a switch from stocks to bonds on pages 165 to 170. The problem is the instructions for calculating yields and yield differences are confusing and unintelligible. The BTDWB allocation strategy results are summarized over a thirty year period in a table on page 151-152. The BTDWB would have selected 1-year TBills as the optimum investment nine times since 1972. But the data presented shows T-Bills were not the best investment eight out of nine times. This book and BTDWB strategy is flawed. I wish I could get my money back."},{"rating":"1","title":"10% of this book is education about Bonds; 90% stock basics","review":"I bought this book because I wanted to learn more about investment products OTHER than common stocks. Instead, (in the book on tape), I got 5-10 minutes about the different types of bonds, a little detail about T-bills, and the frank admission that this book \\"doesn't really discuss corporate bonds\\". WHAT!? The whole rest of it is spent preparing you to run for cover for the upcoming crash of 2000 - for that, I must say he was prescient (Too bad I didn't read this in 1999!). More time is spent describing the basics of common stocks, and how the major industrial averages are calculated than is spent on bonds! Oh - and that WRONG formula for computing the price/sales ratio erroniously also made it onto the cassette version. I actually had to rewind the tape to see if I had heard correctly!"},{"rating":"1","title":"If my investing were this sloppy . . .","review":"Your biggest return this year may be to not buy this one. As others have noted, the book has more holes in it than my broker's ethics. As one example, the simple demonstration of how to use the method doesn't match the text. Worse is the fact that there are inconsistencies in the method even using what Higgins provides. The method recommends in some situations that we buy treasuries--in fact, in those years STOCKS were more often the better investment. So is 1999 stocks or zeros? And will it matter if the DOW hits 10,000 in software that only allowed 4 digits?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not enough content; poor research.","review":"I gave the author 2 stars because I agree with him on one basic premise - equities are generally overvalued. However, I found the rest of the book to be entirely lacking.First, it severely lacks content. The book is short to begin with - and what few pages it has are spent poorly. Almost 1/3 of the book is dedicated to descriptions of the 30 DOW companies.His investment strategy is simple. In fact, it's too simple. His conclusions are based upon very little research - nothing more than historic data that just happens to work out.He has some valid points (i.e. zero coupon bonds as investments), but spent very little effort crafting it. The knowledge encapsulated within the 200+ pages of this book could be condensed to a single web page with little effort."},{"rating":"1","title":"superficial","review":"Although O'Higgins' point about stocks being over-valued is well taken, he does not go nearly far enough to prove his thesis. His new method is not back-tested before the late '70s, and he provides none of the source data that would enable an interested party to verify his returns or extend the method."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poorly written","review":"The central tenet of this book can be summarized in one sentence: \\"Buy bonds because stocks are due for a meltdown.\\" Problem with this book is that it's repeated so often. Finally in the next-to-last chapter, the investment strategy is introduced, but the fundamental reasoning for why it works is not explained (why gold?). There's even a major editorial error. It says to subtract the S&P500 yield from the bond yield and to invest in stocks if the result is \\"greater than the S&P500 yield.\\" In fact it should say \\"invest in stocks if the result is less than zero\\"--i.e. the S&P500 yield is greater than the bond yield."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not very good, but....","review":"The book was not very well written, and why he felt the need to devote 70 pages describing in copious detail all 30 of the Dow stocks is beyond me. However, his 30 year zero-coupon analysis does have something going for it, and the inflation rate is a good predictor for a change in asset allocation."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hire an editor","review":"I'm disappointed in the quality of this book. O'higgins is probably on to something, but the explanation he offers on how to use his method is just about incomprehensible. Did no one bother to read this book before shoving it out the door?

I've seen lots of books that are entirely backtested and don't work in the future, but this is a new one. The stock market has been overvalued since 1980? He's stuck in T-Bills with his +5% in years where the BTD5 are doing +30%.It's too bad he feld the need to put his name on this total piece of trash, and start it with the words \\"Beating the Dow...\\".

He doesn't give you any reason why that indicator should be valid, he merely tells you that it would have been right in 29 of the last 30 years (or something like that). He could as well have proposed using the AFL/NFL Super Bowl Winner as his indicator.If you just want to try a \\"system\\", whether or not it makes any sense, this may be for you.

But as with many comedians of his ilk, there is a lot of muted rage beneath the humour (check out John Cleese in his pre-Fish Called Wanda days, for example -- especially the Fawlty Towers series). And this rage of his is what comes across strongest in Live on Broadway, and it simply gets in the way. Then, too much of Williams' material here is a rehash of stuff he has done before, or stuff other stand-ups have done (and done much better). To see him on top form, check out his earlier stand-up videos from the '80s and '90s.

It was a good kind of exhaustion. I recommend this DVD to anyone who enjoys laughing, really hard.

I didn't think I could be turned off by this kind of humor. I've heard other comedians do it before and it's funny. Robin Williams with his quick wit took it was over the edge. He'd hit something vulgar and just keep on going with it until he took it way too far. Also, I don't necessarily mind hearing the F word 50 million times (I didn't count but it must have been close) but the jokes were just too raunchy! He just went over the top. I've never seen R.

The one time I accidentally bought a 3-in-1 that didn't have conditioner in it, my hair dried out after two washes and got horrible split ends. After only three applications I had to throw the bottle out. I lost more than an inch off the bottom of my hair.

I cannot believe this is supposedly award-winning! It smells nothing like a powdered sugar cookie. It smells like some type of dishwashing liquid.

If you want a Philosophy product try any other scent, but not this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wish I could rate it lower...","review":"I am a HUGE fan of Philosophy, I buy everything I can.

I have most of Philosophy's scents and this one is truly mislabeled. Don't think that you have gotten a defective batch when you first smell this product. Don't think you should return it and get another bottle when instead of being greeted by a warm, buttery, baked-goods scent you are hit hard with the aroma of lemon-fresh toilet cleaner. Many of Philosophy's scents (such as Cinnamon Buns, Senorita Margarita, Double Rich Hot Cocoa, Mint Chocolate Chip Ice Cream, etc...) smell much like their namesake..or are, at least, believable. And if used in your hair, unlike most of the three-in-ones, this one will leave an after-fragrance. You've been warned. Since these products are fairly expensive, I would strongly advise trying another scent...unless, of course, you like to smell like a lemon fresh toilet."},{"rating":"1","title":"Warning - Animal torture","review":"I like Ed Gorman.

She gained accolades for her complete Chopin Nocturnes, and this recital of Schubert's great sonata D. 784 and Moments musicaux has the same virutes: sensitive, restrained musicality, a lovely singing line, and complete lack of eccentirity. But that's also the problem: one longs for more dash and flash, more overt personality. After all, Pires is up aginst the likes of Kissin, Edwin Fishcer, and Richter. Being sensitive and pleasant doesn't make you a standout."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow! A Terrific Book!","review":"This book is a great book on cat behavior. If you want a humorous guide to understanding what makes your cat tick, \\"Dear Tabby\\" has all the answers.

Levin's masterpiece is concise yet far reaching, although necessarily superficial in places. It is not overtly religious, but it will resonate with believers in a Creator. The thesis of this work is played out each and every day in our media, bureaucracy, politics, and culture; as such, it should be required reading for any thinking person.

My big complaint is that the power adapter stopped working within the first week (the light still comes on but no power makes it to the cd player)! The main reason that I bought this kit is because it is the only one I saw that came with a power adapter so I would not have to burn through batteries just trying to listen to cds in my car.

The camera is very light, which is not a good thing. It's made of cheap plastic. The pictures it takes are of very low quality. The flash makes objects appear washed out, even when the subject is 10 feet away. Low-light pictures are awful. They turn out with a brown tinge. My four-year-old Canon could make low-light pictures look not too bad.In short, pay a couple of extra bucks and buy a Canon.

I called Kodak and explained that I did nothing to the camera to cause this, and they fixed it for me.And then yesterday the exact same thing happened, again, while I was on vacation. And since it was one week over a year old, the warranty is void and I'm basically screwed, and now I'm wasting my entire day off from work looking for a new one.In addition, the quality of the pictures even at the highest quality is horrible, as they are blurry and look smeared.I will never buy another Kodak as long as I live."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unreliable","review":"Camera diedThis review requires that I write ten more words.

I also don't like the fact that the TV always comes on when you turn on the power - I might like to go straight to the radio, but that doesn't appear to be an option.

The graphics could be better: I'd like to see the wheels actually roll when taking off! As far as graphics are concerned, tho' it does show battle damage to a high degree - better than most. But this is an old sim - you get what you pay for. I'll tell you one thing this sim has going for it: sound. The engines are a nice smooth growl; better than Il-2. Another example, when you're flying the B-24 and cycling thru the different gun stations. The sound of the gun is real - I know, I've fired 50 cals! Even the sound of the spent cartridges hitting the metal deck - Superb!. If I could merge the sounds of this game w/ the graphics of Il-2 - now THAT would be an awsome flight sim! To me a flight sim is the sum of all it's parts.

Now, thanks to this immensely enjoyable book, I am happy to report that for the first time in my life I might actually be able to hold a coherent conversation about these and more. By presenting some of the most challenging ideas imagineable within cultural (and even pop cultural) contexts, and writing about them with wit and humor, Ouellette has done the near impossible -- she's made physics fun for the lay person... fun, and, dare I say, maybe even a little bit sexy. I imagine that even if you did have a better grasp of physics than I did prior to picking up this book, you would find it to be an extremely entertaining, smart, and very humorous refresher course."},{"rating":"1","title":"Errors--can this book be trusted?","review":"This book was strongly recommended to me in my search for something accessible regarding quantum physics. However, like others reviewing this book, I'm bothered by the factual errors in the first few chapters regarding elementary facts about telescopes, microscopes and lenses. The President of the American Physical Society's insistence in the factual accuracy of the book and the author's similar insistence in her foreword make them all the more irritating. Even the Penguin editor should have caught these boners. How can I feel confident when she gets to a discussion of the Copenhagen interpretation of quantum physics?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Easy read for the average Joe, still interesting for physics buffs!","review":"This is a great book that skims the surface of a number of physics topics. The author does a great job explaining each topic in an easy to understand manner, then continues to go more in depth, while still being understandable for the average reader.

There are sections on laudanum, tae kwon do, fathering a child, transgressive education, and seasonal vegetable sculpting. There are many illustrations, all black-and-white.The thing is completely over my head. It appears to be a book you're meant to take into the john and read a few paragraphs at a time.

I felt like the author was trying to pad it to reach a certain length. he also brought up his previous position with Extra's Mansions & Millionaires a ridiculous number of times. The book is written with an attitude that I find distinctly crosses the line from confident to cocky. Furthermore, the editor did a poor job. There were numerous numbers that really didn't add up. For example, early in the book he mentioned that your appraisal costs should be form $300 - $600, depending on the size of your house. Later on, the number changes form $300 - $500. There is also a section titled \\"How a new tax law made me $60,000,\\" and the numbers in it are laughably incorrect, not to mention he claims to have made $120,000, not $60,000. Not a deal breaker, but if such a lack of concern was shown for these details, how can I expect that the other subjects covered were portrayed correctly?

I listened to it and if I had been reading it I would have dropped out after the first chapter. I like Jan Burkes' books but I don't recommend this one. You can read other reviews to see what the book is about - her Irene books are great - unfortunately this time she chose to write about Irene's husband - a cop - and could have easily dropped 200 pages. This book is hard to follow - 15 disks on audio and so slow that I find myself drifting off and not listening to it until suddenly something new has happened and I have to go back and figure out what that was.The book starts out wonderfully in the first few chapters. If you want to read/listen to this book get it at your library. Don't think about paying for it.Do check out the earlier Irene books. They are much better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great face moisturizer (and SO safe)","review":"I apply this safe natural oil after showers and it soaks in well, leaving my face really soft for far longer than commercial products. Given that more and more ingredients in commercial products are found to be unsafe, I'll opt for 100% natural anyday. Being a cancer survivor, when I read that parabens are found in almost all breast cancer tumors, I tossed my paraben-containing high-priced moisturizer - replacing it with this oil. Years ago, I used apricot oil around my eyes and now at age 66 have almost NO wrinkles, so I know how effective these high quality oils can be. Only drawback is that since they don't have preservatives - they go ransid - so I plan to replace it at about 6 months."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Good Ideas","review":"I really enjoyed reading the book. It sounded great on paper, but because I am a novice and first time dog owner, it was easier to read than put into action. The shaking/tossing can trick did wonders in the beginning, but according to the book, you have to keep it a secret from the dog that it is you who is tossing the can. Well, needless to say this was almost impossible. My pup put two and two together in no time and suddenly the can trick didn't work anymore. Also, it was difficult to teach my dog to heel without seeing a trainer do it in person.

Not so, Nick Dismas, the unfortunate hero of Others. Nick is more than a tender hearted guy, born with deformities, who, gee-wilikers saves the day. Nick is well fleshed out, bad habits, sullen attitude and all. The storyline sets out to be realitively creepy, the set up is slow and well managed, but the payout - well, that's a wee bit over the top. A little too much. Quite frankly, the wrap around story, with the angels was unnecessary but charming. All in all, with the real, human characters and strong start and middle - this book is well worth read. Nick himself, is worth a perusal of the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Herbert's Best Book--Terrible Conclusion","review":"Is this the same James Herbert that wrote The Fog and The Rats? It seems he's lost some of his touch here.

Unfortunately he uses his gift to tell a story of monsterously deformed human beings who are treated with cruelty. Why any reader would want to put such images into his/her mind (which is the equivalent of eating sewage) is anyone's guess. I did not know what I was getting into when I bought this book and I sure wish I had not read it. Is it a \\"horror novel?\\" Yes, but not the kind of story or descriptions that you would ever want to read.

It promises a lot but ends as a freak show run by a dastard Doctor who has a mummy as his twin-brother. Yes, Hell is mentioned in the prologue (however quite unpersuasive), but in the end there is absolutely no connection with the beginning of the book. Oh, and I forgot to mention Mr. Dismas, who somehow did not cause a stir of pity in me (despite him being beaten several times during the book for the obvious purpose to stress \\"the moral\\" of the book - that it is difficult for him to live this sick life among us, sick people). The narration is too verbose and repetitive at times. The author seem to have spent lots of times visualizing his monters before depicting them on paper, but \\"scary monsters do not a book make\\", nor a weak love story between the two invalids either...

I've been using both knives for a couple of months now and find that they do a great job without stressing my hands or wrists. I mostly use them for fruits and veggies. I strongly recommend that if you are new to quality knives you should go to a store and handle a bunch to see what feels most comfortable in your hand then buy it on Amazon where the price can't be beat, especially with free shipping. I like the storage box that the knives came it. I set it in a drawer and keep the knives in it. It keeps the knives safe and me safe from them! I must say that the hollows on the santoku knife edge don't seem to stop food from sticking, but I don't find that to be a problem."},{"rating":"1","title":"Indiana Jones and the Emperor's Tomb","review":"DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT for Mac.

The cork on the bottom is more than big enough and you won't need to worry about scratching your wood with a little bit of common sense and care when lifting them. The design is somewhat soft and indistinct but I think that adds to the \\"old world\\" look. If you want a \\"photo sharp\\" image these are not for you.In short, very nice coasters.

The margin around the image is smaller than is shown. May not be a minus, but still, it shows that the sample image isn't accurate at all.3. The print quality is very poor. It's very blurry, can barely make out the world map -- maybe it's the problem in image selection, the amount of detail simply isn't fit for such a small coaster. And the worst part is the different inks used do not line up (it'd have a red outline next to a blue outline when the two lines should be perfectly overlapping, for example), so it has the cheap-newspaper look.I would not recommend this, for self or for gift."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as pretty as the picture","review":"I thought these would look nice with my decor but the map is very faded.Old World Passages, Sandstone Thirstystone Coaster Set"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Happy","review":"Just got these coasters and I'm not pleased with the picture on them.

One chip in particular is large and visible from across the room. My main issue is I believe they have been previously used which is the reason for the chips. The box is well worn, much more wear than would occur during shipping. Additionally, the inside of the box is stained and dirty. Not dusty as in some sandstone dust but actually dirty. The wear and appearance gives the impression they were purchased at a yard sale and not new from the manufacturer. They were inexpensive so I'll just eat the cost instead of spending the time boxing them back up and making a special trip to the post office or UPS store. My schedule isn't flexible enough to arrange for UPS pick up. I cannot be absolutely certain they are used but based on their appearance, damage, and the condition of the box it's very hard to come to any other conclusion."},{"rating":"2","title":"nice","review":"one arrived damaged and we did not do anything about it.. they look nice and we like the holderI wish they had packaged the coasters better so that one would not have chipped but really we just needed one so it suited our needs"},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful","review":"I had a different coaster set that I bought at a Home Goods, but they kept sticking to the button of glasses until the inevitable happened and one broke.

I have a very nice electric razor that I enjoy using and can shave in a quarter of the time it takes me to shave using a disposable. However, there are times, such as during the Christmas season, when I don't shave for several days and have a healthy growth of facial hair. After these times when I decide to shave again, my electric razor just won't do and I have to resort to using a disposable razor. I've discovered that the BIC COMFORT 3 ADVANCE PIVOT TRIPLE BLADE RAZOR is one of the best razors to use. It offers a very smooth and clean shave and I hardly ever nick my face or chin when using one. The razors have a lubrication strip of aloe and Vitamin E that adds some protection to the countenance and chin. I was only able to use these razors two to three times each because of how infrequent I rely upon a disposable razor in shaving. However, I really liked the end result and highly recommend using it for a comfortable shave."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ouch!!!

It's a $2-3 battery performing like it should. The problem is the mis-pricing, which clearly must be an innocent mistake.)Amazon claims that this dime-sized Duracell 2025 lithium battery has a retail value of $100. Since they're selling it at close to a 90% discount, and since my Energizer 2025's have been somewhat disappointing in terms of longevity, I bit.So what's the difference between this Duracell battery and the Energizer? Answer: The Duracell costs over 4 times as much as the Energizer.At first, I considered titling this review \\"Ripped Off!\\" and giving the product a single star.

Has a sternum strap (in case you are planning on rappelling down any mountains or skydiving with your violin.

The only downside is the system of attaching to the case is not real handy if you want to take the straps on and off a lot. I suppose you might get accustomed to the routine, and there is a pocket on the back that they are designed to fold up and go into. I personally just leave them on all the time.

Navigating through special education is often a foreign experience for parents. From Emotions to Advoacy helps parent negotiate in the best interests of a child.

As other readers have said I think the writer spent to much time on disecting every song, and talking about the various types of sub-genres of music.

Im not a fanatic but grew up listening to them along with various other music varieties. That being said I am a music biography junkie and have read plenty of them. This is pretty poor. No real insight into the band. Most of the information is from other printed media and the writters opinions are to long winded. He repeatedly uses the term 'memorable' for songs which drove me nuts.

Buy it if your a Metallica fan but don't expect too much."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Truth about Joel McIver's opinions","review":"I walked away with the distinct impression this book was more about Joel McIver than about Metallica.About 80% of it is his opinions on the bands music and the thrash metal genre overall, with some quotes from people within the genre included, and about 20% hard information on the band, it's members, and it's history.A big question to ask after reading any biography is what did you learn about the topic of the biography that you didn't already know. Unfortunately with this book, the answer is almost nothing.However I now do know what Joel McIver \\"informed\\" opinions are of Metallica, their music, the thrash metal genre, other bands in the thrash metal genre, and his opinions of those other bands and their music.While I understand any author will include their own thoughts about a subject in a biography, when they let those take over the majority of the work, they're misrepresenting what the book is really about."},{"rating":"1","title":"Author needs to lighten up.","review":"First and foremost, I am a huge Metallica fan as the author states he is. With that said, I enjoy all of Metallica's music from every album with the exception of a couple of songs. Unlike the author however, I understand that musical styles change with time. The whole book is about the author complaining about Metallica's recent music and how it's not as heavy as the first three albums. Not worth the time to read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing assessment of veteran band's 20+ year career","review":"Having read some initial buzz on this book, I was looking forward to it for a variety of reasons. No doubt about it, Metallica has forged an impressive career, dominating record sales, selling out hundreds of venues and providing enjoyment to millions of fans all over the world.Sadly, despite my high expectations, the book breaks little new ground. Almost all of the material within is simply a rehash of previous magazine articles and interviews. Even more disappointing, the writer's very open bias towards the band's earlier work leaves fans of the later albums (Load, Reload, etc) feeling like second-class citizens. It comes across not as an open-minded review of the band's career, but as a preachy 'better than you' attitude -- a complete turn-off."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too many opinions, not enough new info.","review":"One would think that an opinionated, hypercritical analysis would make for an exciting read. NOPE!!!!!! Avoid this piece of junk. I hated it so much I'm avoiding this guy's Slayer book, inasmuch as I've always wanted to read a career spanning Slayer bio. The funniest part for me though, was when this guy offered his e-mail address so the reader can argue with him. Pathetic! Did I mention that this book should be avoided? The \\"So What\\" book and \\"Some Kind of Monster\\" DVD's were in fact self-indulgent pieces of cr*p, but at least the real players were involved. Hopefully when Lars calls this book professional, he's either being ironic or just showing us a kinder, gentler Lars after the whole Napster debacle, which, a decade later, with the recording industry on its financial knees, Lars was proven correct!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Lovely Voice","review":"This album soothes me while driving, along the crowded highways and rush hours.

I followed everything the book said and I could not be more disappointed and angry. Some examples: this book said to get Huggies diaper because it was just as good as Pampers but cheaper. Well, Huggies leaked and got damp as soon as my baby peed. All the diaper problems went away as soon as I switched to Pampers. This book lists the amount of baby clothes you should get. Don't listen to it unless you enjoy doing laundry every day! The book also give its highest rating for Combi Ultra Savvy stroller. Just check out the rating and comments for this same stroller at Amazon. Need I say more? Just be careful new moms and dads.

The book provides numerous web sites (for manufacturers, retailers and government agencies). The web site maintained by the authors is also helpful and when I couldn't find my way around it, I got a quick response to my email requesting help.

It does an excellent job rating the major (and not so public) manufacturers. I learned more about product safety issues from this book alone than from all my other combined.

It promises to save you 20-50% off things you \\"have\\" to buy. I feel the promise is a crock! The only thing I did like about this book was the product review. It listed which products were better then others. The only thing this book did help me with was buying a baby monitor. Most of the time the book points you to buy the more expesive items (such as baby Gap clothes) because they are supposed to stand up to more wear and tear or be better quality. Higher price doesn't equal higher quality.

The graphics are as good as you will find in adventure gaming and actually look as good as most action titles. The problem this game faces is that by using a keyboard interface and streamlining the game, they limit the player to one inventory item at a time. This means that in many locations, you will do a lot of running around collecting items that could have been saved with even the most basic inventory system present in action titles.Still the voice acting is decent and the soundtrack is the best on the market.

The first couple of texts are extremely simple, and all of them only use the present tense. I found the end-dictionary comprehensive enough for my use, although it didn't include some words from the Exercises that follow the texts, which is an unfortunate oversight. You will go through this book quite quickly though. I much preferred the slightly more difficult \\"Beginner's Russian Reader\\" by Lila Pargment since it is useful much longer, but is more difficult when you are first beginning. Its also unfortunately a bit difficult to find in the US for some reason although very easy to get in the UK where I purchased it."},{"rating":"2","title":"not too bad","review":"This book is definately a 'first reader', as it is quite simple. All the text is in present tense. I do not mind this, but the thing that I find most wrong with the book is that it has a dictionary in back that ostensibly contains all words necessary for reading the passages, but in reality contains about 50% of them. This only means that one must look the words up in another dictionary. But at the same time, there are some words that have multiple meanings, and you look them up in a seperate dictionary, and will not be able to glean any meaning from a sentence. But overall, I have found this book to be very helpful."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Challenge to Begin Reading Russian","review":"The title and introduction are written in English. There is also a three-page glossary at the back that contains cyrillic Russian and roman English. Besides that, it is 55 pages of cyrillic, with some simple pictures drawn in.There is absolutely no help in reading this--you need to either possess this vocabulary already or have a dictionary handy. This is what I needed--a book that doesn't contain a cheating transliteration 1 inch away. I was thrown to the wolves, and had to read on my own in this book.One thing I should point out is that this book was written for teenagers from the perspective of teenagers. I felt like I was reading \\"Dick and Jane\\" in Russian. Be prepared that this is a very simple book, and not something an adult with pride would want to be seen reading in public. However, pride comes before the fall, and this book was valuable to me in learning to read Russian."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is a first book for someone who knows Russian.","review":"I had read several reviews of this book and thought it would be a good first reader. However, no previous reviewer stated that there is no translation!

You will have to have had some background in the Russian language before tackling this book. The story line is simple and straightforward while still remaining interesting. For the beginning Russian student, the text is challenging enough to be educational but still simple enough so that the student does not get too frustrated. The only problem I have with the book is the glossary. It should be more inclusive. You will need a good Russian/English dictionary for some words. I recommend this one:English-Russian, Russian-English Dictionary. Overall an excellent supplement to a Russian course for the beginning student."},{"rating":"2","title":"Useful tool and great buy","review":"This little reader is very useful and a great buy. What I like most about it is that stressed syllables are marked to assist with pronunciation, and the drawings aid in figuring out the meaning of new words. The only negative comment I have is that quite a few of the words in the readings are not listed in the glossary in the back of the book, but that is a minor drawback. The level of the book is very basic and is a great tool to get beyond memorizing phrases and make the jump into sentence comprehension."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Tale and interesting too!","review":"Mr. McColley has written an interesting story about the Civil War.

For the iPaq, this port is at the bottom of the handheld. The 210 degree arm does not rotate to this area. In order to have the proper connectivity, you have to turn the handheld on its side. This then requires another software program download (not freeware that I can find) to rotate your screen to the landscape view, unless you can read sideways without getting a headache.Before buying this product, check your handheld to see if your IR port is between 4-8 o'clock - if so, this may be a difficult keyboard to use."},{"rating":"2","title":"Targus Universal Wireless Keyboard","review":"While not as good as a regular wireless key board it does a passable job of providing a full key board for my Palm TX.

I cannot determine whether the problem was due to the keyboard, the software, or my old PDA. Newer, faster PDAs might have a better success rate, but the potential for problems will still be there.

Personally I *cannot* deal with an 18mm spacing keyboard -- the tiny 1mm difference really feels different and causes pain. So when I learned that the Targus universal keyboard was \\"full-size\\", I assumed that they meant 19mm since that is commonly defined as full-size. ALAS NO, Targus lied: their universal keyboard is an 18mm key-spacing keyboard and consequently a problem. I do not know why Targus has decided to ruin their formerly excellent folding keyboard in this new version. Sometimes companies just do very stupid things. They don't bother to ask customers, or they ask the ones who don't care about the product details anyway.

Crowley's deck is strewn with symbolism compared to the simplicity of the Waite deck.

The chapters are written alternatively by Toren, the former binge drinker, and his mother, Chris. They both provide a great deal of research with each chapter so that the story is not just theirs alone. There are helpful boxes throughout the book summarizing information with a list of them at the end for easy reference. I plan to keep a copy on my desk so that if a student should remark about it, I can lend it. This book will save lives and keep families together."},{"rating":"2","title":"Honest, Compelling, Educational","review":"I wish I had had this book when I was raising my teenage daughters.

I read this book over a two day period a couple of weeks ago, and haven't been able to stop thinking or talking about it since. I have given several copies as gifts and am anxious to talk with my friends and family members as they finish it. In fact, I think the very best thing about this book is the invitation to discuss a topic that is often complicated,misunferstood, and even taboo.

Toren tells it like it is: glamorous, cool, crazy, and ultimately unfulfilling. This book probably won't change your mind about drinking, but it will give you a glimpse of what lies ahead, perhaps years from now, if alcohol comes to consume your lives. Read it, and keep it in the back of your mind."},{"rating":"1","title":"Close, but not quite","review":"The book was full of great facts about alcohol and the teenage brain. If you are a parent of a teenager who is at risk of alcoholism or even a parent who is looking to inform themselves on the subject, it's a good book. However, if you are a parent currently dealing with a teenager with a drinking problem, this book will leave you wanting. Chris didn't see Toren's drinking as a problem until he checked himself into rehab at 24. Chris does give ideas of what to try with your teen, but she didn't actually deal with trying to get a teenage drinker sober.

A travesty!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book!","review":"Dinesh D'Souza has traveled through a vast territory of ideas, arguments, worries, concerns and fears - articulating a vision for how Captalism has provided the engine for the dramatic change around us. Rather than feel guilty, or fault the weaknesses (which he illuminates in detail) of the West, Dinesh offers a promotion for the advancement of what works, why it works and how to harness the energy of the human spirit - the VIRTUES of Greed - to for the first time in human history dramatically raise the quality of life for all.

However it failed in 6 months and few days.Coby probably knows the reliability and hence only warrant it for 90 days.I think its wiser to just spend some more money and get a name brand, they are robust and last till they are outdated by technology and not due to failure of cheap components used."},{"rating":"2","title":"This book is for a comical witty person who loves mother.","review":"Hal uses a sarcastic and poetic style about him, that reminds me of Woody Allen. His brilliant style of writing reflects his love for his mother. You could feel the warmth and bond he had with his mother. The poems reflects his early adolescents to his growth as a man. I could not stop laughing at the poems because I was able to reflect similar situations in my very own life. Hal's poems have uplifted my spirits and have made me retrospect the hilarious moments I have indulged in with my mother. Not only is this material hysterical, but it puts you in a frenzy in which you are not sure when you will be laughing your brains out."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another Winner by a Winning Poet","review":"More hilarious and touching poems by a unique and masterful poet.

I just bought the mac version because I remembered having so much fun playing the PC version when I was in high school. I've heard mixed things about the different sequels that have been made but the original version is really outstanding. I played my way though the military campaign in about a week and had a lot of fun. It's challenging but not so hard that it detracts from the fun.I know that now the mac version of this game is going for no less than about 70$ (which is what I paid for it) and often more but if you can get it for less than 100$ I think it is worth the price."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great flow!","review":"I am really happy I finally got this video.

Now, I check it out from the library when I want to do the short yoga routine."},{"rating":"2","title":"Work Up a Sweat","review":"This yoga DVD is very good if you want a little cardio with your yoga. There are some intenste sun salutations at the start that really get your heart pumping. There are also some vinyasas between the standing poses. I just did this workout today, and I was sweating and my heartrate was up! It's more of a power yoga, and not for beginners.If you can get the set of all three Earth, Water, and Fire it's a great set. The Earth is geared so even the beginner can do it. It introduces the sun salutations. Water is more of a relaxing workout. This series is also good because they do inversions, and lots of yoga DVDs don't do shoulderstand or headstand."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works up a sweat!","review":"I am an advanced exerciser but intermediate yogi. All the Amazon rave reviews lured me to purchase FIRE. I'm so glad I did. It's an hour of great flow & challenge. The headstand part was my cincher since so many yoga DVD's don't have that. My favorite practice is Ashtanga ,& this had some similarity."},{"rating":"1","title":"Workout? Yes Yoga? Not in my opinion.","review":"I know I am the only person, so far, who is not entranced with this DVD. I bought it because it had such a plethora of glowing reviews. I am not happy I did.What drew me to yoga, after decades of long distance swimming, was the philosophical component of the practice. Yes, I love a strong work-out, and I do one every day (Ashtanga Primary Series, Hatha Vinyasa, or Yin-Yang), but I don't want my yoga to feel like an aerobics class. If that's what you're after then buy this DVD; but, if you want something with a bit more yogic depth I would recommend Shiva Rea's Solar DVD. (It may be sold as the Solar Lunar practice. I am partial to the Solar practice and the meditations on the Lunar disc.)The other thing I was not happy with when doing this DVD was the lack of music. Again, if you like your yoga sans music this may be the DVD for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thanks for sharing your testimony!","review":"\\"What Now\\" is a stirring and encouraging testimony. Like many women, Camellia Johnson married her husband with the hopes of changing him. After giving her life to Christ, the desire to change her husband became compounded with the need to have a \\"shared\\" spiritual life. No matter how she tried to persuade her husband to attend church, he often would become resentful and choose not to go out of rebellion.Camellia learned to concentrate on her growing relationship with God through regular bible study and prayer. She surrounded herself with mature Christian friends. Camellia's faith proved to be extremely valuable when her husband is diagnosed with cancer.Camellia's story will encourage female believers in unequally yoked marriages as well as others who desire salvation for their loves ones. Often it is the life we live that serves as a greater influence than trying to push concepts on a person."},{"rating":"2","title":"No frills disc production...","review":"I'm going to skip the stuff most other reviews have covered, and go over why it loses a star.The dvd production packaging is extremely no-frills. The fit and finish is ridiculously minimal. There are no extra features on either disc, no produciton notes or other info about the trip, a resource index, anything that would cost virtually nothing to include on a dvd final product. The packaging clamshell is a double with flimsy discholder; mine were jostled and playing loose when it arrived.The mastering was done correctly at least. The video quality is very good for a standard def DVD.If there is anything I have a problem with in the actual content, is that this is treated far more as a documentary with minimal discussion on anything but the presentation. Honestly, I would have preferred Stephen Fry exhibit his own personal feelings more often, considering how he opens this series explaining how he was almost American..."},{"rating":"2","title":"3.5- Unbalanced view of America nonetheless interesting","review":"As an American, the series is fascinating with Fry trundling about in places I had never so much as glimpsed. This is both a fault and a boon- as everything seems fresh and exciting, but at the same time, time crunching has Fry spending less than a minute on some states, far less than they deserve- while, for example- painting the picture of one state as a bygone hippie nuclear silo which altogether misses its rich history. Indeed, he skirts around the edge of several states while I felt, for exmaple, he gave alot of time toMississipi, which is how every state SHOULD have been. Worth seeing in spite of odd pacing."},{"rating":"2","title":"A true delight.","review":"I believe that America is best seen on road trips; the diners, the out of the way places (such as the splendid Wall Drug in South Dakota), the magnificent scenery. Stephen Fry seems to feel the same way and this BBC series shows why. The combination of things uniquely American, sometimes strange and sometimes wondrous, and the sublimely British humor of Fry are an irresistible pairing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Could Be Much Longer","review":"As far as my wife and I are concerned, Mr. Fry could have done one show per state.

Is there something I'm missing here?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Does what I bought it to do","review":"The pros: quality on Skype calls is fair to good; it works with both my landline and Skype; and it's cordless, which is essential for me.The cons (are many): poor button design; the phone does not offer many common phone features, including distinctive ring recognition, speed dialing, and allowing spaces to be inserted into alphanumeric entries; supports either Skype or Yahoo -- not both at once, which would be really nice.I also had some serious installation problems. VTech's technical support was useless, and I had to find the solution on my own.I needed a Skype compatible phone that was both cordless and would allow me to take calls from my landline, as well, and I got that. But this phone was probably put on the market before it was ready. Future versions might be amazing, but this one is disappointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yet another failure to run","review":"This game is impossible to run on my system.

Tech support doesn't responded to any of my many e-mails and I've been waiting for a response for months. There is no phone number to call listed anywhere in the box or on the website.

Please read all these reviews before you even CONSIDER buying this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY","review":"This software is full of glitches. It requires a tech background to get started , after downloading several patches from the website. It frequently 'crashes' for no apparent reason.

My Mom bought it for me for Valentines Day and I immediatly installed it on my computer. This took a while, but finally it completed. I crossed my fingers, hoping it would work b/c my cousin said it didn't work on her comp. when I bought her the same game for her bday.

After a while, I found that this game is not entertaining at all, quite confusing, and aimless. The objective of each mission is not so clearly stated and you are puzzled with its control panel. You'll have an array of building tools and options. But you don't know what to do with them. No tutorial included, poor 3D graphics, pity music/sound ambient, confusing gameplay, aimless obejectives.I wish I wasn't attracted to its cover and publisher notes at the back of the CD case. I suggest you to avoid this game. Buying this game is worthless, wasting your time, and not fun at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your time","review":"At first I was all excited about buying Mall Tycoon 2.

It would send me back to the desktop after the first 15-20 min. into it. I finally found a patch on the internet witch solved the problem, but after I finally got the game to work it wasnt as fun as I thought it would be. Its hard to understand how to play and when you do get the hang of it its imposible to keep your mall from going bankrupt (even with loans). Its just not worth the money or time to figure it out! I wish I would of read the reviews before I bought it. I strongly recomend not wasting your time with it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Educational tool!","review":"The game seems to run fine on my Nvidia 5200 card. The online instructions are not very detailed, yet it was easy to get going. I would recommend that players \\"map\\" out the mall on paper to get all the \\"modules\\" to fit efficently.

Through quantitative research with hundreds of women who have received their MBA's from Stanford University, Zappert provides both research-informed analysis and vignettes from mothers who have made a wide range of choices as applied to child bearing and raising. The book contains both useful tips and items to ponder when making important decisions concerning career paths.My biggest complaint about this book was that it sometimes drifted into the area of fantasy for most working mothers. Understandably, the research focused upon moms with a very high income potential, but professionals come in many career areas and have a wide range of incomes, and many cannot afford the type of \\"solutions\\" suggested by the book, such as a full-time, live-in nanny.However, I do feel that the book provided very useful information and is an important resource."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing new here....","review":"Zappert's survey-based research provides no new insights or solutions for working moms.

The cover made the novel look tempting and I like the idea of a novel about China with a lot of scope. \\"Dream\\" starts out interestingly (though the first paragraph is badly overwritten), but somehow the history takes over, and I sometimes felt as if I was getting a condensed survey of Chinese history ater 1911 rather than the main character's story. Also, the writing is somewhat cliched and clumsy--that took away from my ability to appreciate the narrative flow. All in all, I would recommend other books in this \\"genre\\"--Jung Chang's \\"Wild Swans,\\" or Pang Mei Chang's \\"Bound Feet and Western Dress\\" over this one.ge"},{"rating":"1","title":"Good for young people, but less so for sophisticated readers","review":"The writing of this novel is a bit flat-footed and the characters lack real dimension, but this would be a nice gift for a teeanger interested in finding out more about China history. Sometimes, historical events are more understandable when them come through the medium of fiction, and though Dream of the Walled City is prosaically written, it does provide a birds-eye view events in China of the last century. I wouldn't recommend it, however, to an adult with more sohisticated tastes."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Stellar Story","review":"I would rank this among the best books I have ever read. The characters came alive for me. This is an epoch novel like Gone With the Wind tracing the lives of family members from the Chinese civil war to the rise of Mao.

Once you start reading it, you won't want to put it down.

I sure hope to have this book some day."},{"rating":"1","title":"A total pain","review":"I'm not sure if I'm more bummed out by the pillow or the cover, but I bought this cover so I'd have something to use when my babe barfed...or worse...all over my pillow. When I washed the cover some of the inside stitching started to come unraveled. Then when I tried to put the cover on, good god, it was absurd. It actually makes me want to ditch the whole pillow. You need two hands, a good 5 minutes, and a lot of patience to stuff the cheap foam 'pillow' into the cheap case and zip it up. Mine is still all crooked because after at least 5 full minutes of wrestling with it I just gave up.Oh, and this pillow does NOT have the new velcro buckle. The buckle is the normal style and not as adjustable as the covers for the deluxe pillows."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hilarious.

I heard that a new CD was being released and bought it without hesitation.To my disappointment, this CD is 80-90% material reused from his 2004 album \\"Dog Years\\".There is a DVD accompanying the CD that has a couple of good standup routines from Comedy Central, but again, they're old material.I won't disagree with the other reviewer who like Mike and his talent as a stand-up. But \\"Dog Years\\" sounds like the first album of a up and coming comedian who's hungry for the applause and working hard to get it. If you don't own it, you should. It's a good album.Then you can go ahead and skip buying this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"comedy for fools","review":"Listening to this corndog city is a complete waste of time. It sucks. It isn't funny, which is the only complaint that should matter when reviewing a comedy cd. I can honestly say that I listened to the cd straight through without so much as cracking a smile once. IT'S NOT FUNNY! It's corny and lame. I was wondering what drugs the people in the audience were on to be laughing consistently at this drivel. This guy is the next Bob Saget, and I can't believe how cheesy people are to think that this junk is humorous. If you want some real laughs, try listening to Lewis Black, David Cross, or Mitch Hedberg...comics that are actually funny. Sorry Mike, I know that you're trying, but you need some new material."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hilarious!!","review":"This cd is one of the funniest I have heard in a long time.

The final four or five tracks are new, but everything before it is simply a rehash of previous material, occasionally with a new quip thrown in before or after a specific joke.My advice is that if you already have \\"Dog Years,\\" go ahead and avoid this purchase. For the most part, it's nothing you haven't already heard before, though it's just as funny. If you don't have \\"Dog Years,\\" then jump on this one instead, since it has much of the same material, plus the extra DVD."},{"rating":"1","title":"Black numbers fade in one wash!","review":"The shirt itself seems ok but the black screen printed numbers are done with really crappy ink.

I was so amazed at the realistic piano sound of this keyboard and so were my friends and family.

For one thing, keyboardist Robert Lamm, by far Chicago's best and most prolific songwriter in the band's glory years, had been in a real slump on the previous two albums. \\"Upon Arrival,\\" composed with bassist Peter Cetera, wasn't much to write home about, but on his more uptempo contributions, Lamm sounded fired up again. \\"Manipulation\\" was good, as was \\"Thunder and Lightning,\\" cowritten with Cetera and drummer Danny Seraphine.But it was Lamm's \\"I'd Rather Be Rich\\" that served as the album's highlight -- it's musically fresh, and the lyrics consitute a scathing indictment of the yuppie lifestyle.Too bad the rest of \\"XIV\\" sinks under the weight of Peter Cetera's soft-schlock balladry. Cetera writes or cowrites six of the albums' 10 tracks, including the yawners \\"Song for You,\\" \\"Hold On\\" and \\"Overnight Cafe.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Even the deity we know as Tom Dowd couldn't save Chicago","review":"Tom Dowd needs no introduction. He's a deity if you love 60's and 70's music. So, bringing him in to pull Chicago's commercial fat out of the fire seemed to be a great idea. I bought this record simply because I couldn't imagine him being involved with a dud. Another deity, Phil Ramone, failed to get the band turned around with \\"13\\", and Dowd, a close friend of Ramone's, should have read that email from Ramone and seen this coming. Oh wait. There was no email in 1980. Duhhhhhh.The material ranges from bland to cluelessly bad. Dowd can't make gold out of gum wrappers. These are gum wrappers. Bleechhhhh."},{"rating":"1","title":"Chicago's worst album","review":"Chicago's worst is still better than a lot of bands ever recorded. Chicago seems to be going through the motions on this release. The death of Terry Kath and the drug use appears to have hit rock bottom. Nevertheless, there are some decent songs here, but nothing really good. The good news is that after Chicago released Chicago 15, a greatest hits volume II release, they started to get it together on Chicago 16. Bill Champlin added needed vocal ability and song writing ability. Also, guitarist Chris Pinick, who first appeared on Chicago 14, was a great improvement over Donnie Dacus, who replaced the deceased Terry Kath."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sorry-not enough good stuff!","review":"I would give five stars for the wonderfully craftedChicago classic \\"Thunder And Lightning\\",as great a pop song as this band ever made.But aside from that and the spiky newwave of \\"Manipulation\\" \\"14\\" earns it's two stars just for those songs and only half a star for \\"Manipulation\\".Nothing else here be it ballad or uptempo rocker even earns a mention and aside from yet another clever cover jacket this is'nt worth music musically."},{"rating":"1","title":"Alas for a once fine band","review":"After the death of Terry Kath this band started to disintegrate.Donnie Dacus came aboard for a couple of comeback attempts, but this one album pretty much wrote the end for them for me.Peter Cetera turned them into a shlock and shmaltz outfit, bereft of their former passion and power.

If true, as many of you who work in the industry attest, then I wonder how we are still afloat. I found the sexual behavior quite disgusting - mainly the whole trading floor cheering a scene on the roof of an adjoining building.

Dave Meadows is the director of research at a large brokerage firm gets drawn into a morass of shady operations that promise millions of dollars - if the underhanded machinations don't backfire, and if his conscience doesn't get in the way. A gritty look at the realities of Wall Street economics underscores this attention captivating and suspensefully written tale of financial greed and corporate corruption."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ever wonder about the true existence of the Chinese Wall?","review":"The book is told to be based on ficticious events. However, after reading this piece, I question how ficticious it really is or how far it really is from the truth. I will never look at another research report the same. A must read. Quick, entertaining, and argueably transparent. A fun read for anyone on the Street or considering a career in ER."},{"rating":"2","title":"Exciting read and educational for those of us on the outside","review":"I throughly enjoyed this thriller both for the story and the content which puts the reader right into the middle of Wall Street and how the investment banks work.

Well, Wall Street has similar conflicts of interest between the analysts in Research, the bankers and the brokers.This is a fast-paced novel by a man who has been there,and it shows the seamy underside of Wall Street--the part we only read about occasionally in the papers. It reads as smoothly as any spy story by Clancy, and with as much suspense. The characters are alive and recognizable.In any good fiction, there has to be enough of a grain of truth to make the story plausible. The plausibility here is enhanced by the author's many years as a Wall Street analyst. He is writing about the world he knows, and you get the feeling that it is just as he describes it.Joseph (Joe) Pierreauthor of Handguns and Freedom...their care and maintenanceand other books."},{"rating":"2","title":"READ THIS BOOK NOW!","review":"Conflicted is a fast-paced visit through the previously cloaked halls of an equity research department. So that's what happens in there! While we have all read a lot about the investment-banking conflicts with which many real-life analysts have shamed Wall Streeters, Culp exposes many other temptations that lure analysts to behave in dishonest ways and are well rewarded for it. Michael Culp's novel is revealing, enlightening, and entertaining. The character development is so rich as to put a face on each name, to empathize with Robin, to feel Carl's sleaziness, and to imagine the skid marks left behind by Ken's Bentley. Culp's story-telling is captivating. The story's cadence is strong. I could easily visualize the action as it played out. It takes only a few initial pages to get sucked in. Then, you're hooked through the last word."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tells it like it is.","review":"As someone who has spent the last 15 years on The Street, I can attest to the veracity of this book. The author obviously writes from his own extensive experience and the result is an in-depth look behind the scenes of a big firm that should ring true for anyone who's been through it.The only caveat is that for those not altogether interested in the minutia of what goes on the book may become a bit tedious (as the reviewer from Miami states). But I think that most investors and practitioners will find this a compelling story. I had a lot of difficulty putting it down."},{"rating":"2","title":"Useful text","review":"The book is a great resource for Comparative Politics courses at the graduate level. The language is not easy to grasp at the undergrad level, though the content itself is useful. The authors provide many references, and this is indeed helpful, but for students who do not have prior knowledge of the major theorists in CP, reading the text will be like looking for a needle in a haystack. Definitely not an easy-read. They draw on a very wide range of examples from all over the world, which is refreshing.

This book is jam-packed full of true stories of different treasures that have been stashed, found, lost, stolen, or still waiting to be discovered. There are also tons of great color photos and drawings of the different treasure hunters, treasures found, treasure ships, maps, etc. The treasures range from sunken pirate ships to gold hidden in caves to treasures buried and more. There are lots of interesting stories about the people who have made it their quest to search for lost treasures and what they discovered.

There were far too many philosophical/religious debates between the main characters. Also, there was good action but you had to read through so much junk to get to it. Aravan and his crew are hard-core, but the rest of the characters fall flat. McKiernan seems to love psychotic villains, and this book is no exception. I just wish that it hadn't required so long to find him and kill him. Please, if you're his editor, encourage him to curb his impulse to jump on a soapbox and preach at us!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excelent","review":"I enjoyed this book. It has a plot that never seems to stop turning in unexpected directions.

The story line itself wasn't bad, but the way he writes is truly awful. Everything is explained in pains-taking detail via long drawn out conversations between the characters, in completely unrealistic dialog. And the plot moves along s-o-o-o-o-o-o-o slowly! It took me almost a year to finish this book. I wanted to like it, but I'd read a few chapters and then see some other book I'd rather read...and I rarely put down a book once I start reading it!

It doesn't matter if it's got the Kershaw name, it's a ten dollar knife. I bought this to replace a Rapala filet knife that was a piece of junk, wouldn't hold an edge and developed burrs all over the blade. I own a Kershaw skyline that is my EDC that I love. This knife is dull out of the box, the tip of the knife is laughably dull. If you are looking for a knife to cut through fish like butter, this is not your knife. If you are looking for a backup knife with an easy to clean sheath that you feel like spending 3 hours sharpening, this may be your knife. I can't speak on the quality of the steel or whether it will hold an edge (once you actually put one on it). The handle is nice, it feels very solid and well balanced in the hand. Out of the box, I would consider it unusable. May as well use a butter knife.

Wilentz's style is simultaneously raw and refined. Very refreshing indeed. Martyrs' Crossing is a work of shocking candor and devastating immediacy and I can only hope to enjoy more fiction from this fine writer in the near future."},{"rating":"2","title":"We are all at different levels of understanding","review":"I read this book several years ago, and continue to recommend it to my friends and book clubs. As I read the various reviews, many who were dissappointed with this book seem to be emotionally charged about the situation in the middle east. Unfortunately, there are many in the populous who are not quite as educated, nor as emotionally charged by this particular situation. This book does a wonderful job of reaching out to those who want to begin to understand the human aspect involved in this, and many other conflicts. As a mother, and one who has lived in Africa amidst severe and tragic conflict, I found this book to be both timely and engaging. Wilentz does a good job of character development without political judgement. Not an easy thing to do when conveying such charged subject."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Ask Me Why","review":"I love almost all books about Israel and Palestine. I can love Thomas Friedman and also Yaron Hazony; Amos Oz and Meir Shalev, right wing and left, fiction and nonfiction. So, don't ask my why because I cannot give a rational answer as yet, but I really disliked this book. I only know that it did not grip me and that I do not recommend it at all. Somehow I found it dreary without redeeming artistic qualities. Somehow I plowed through it but am left feeling emptied not full. Don't yet ask me why."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a Great Book, Others are better.....","review":"on the Palestinian reality, especially, I strongly suggest reading as soon as you are able, Masha Hamilton's wonderful rendition of Palestinian Village life in the past, \\"Staircase of a Thousand Steps\\", which far better connnects to this People and their Plight than does Ms. Wilentz who doesn't as other reviews have stated, really get beneath stereotypes. I love all novels about the Mideast but this one just doesn't cut it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Read Amira Hass Instead!","review":"Agree with many reviewers here. There is something profoundly false in this book. Disagree that editing is what was needed. A deeper understanding of the Palestinian people is sorely lacking and ditto: I found the Israeli soldier's musings purely farsical. If you want to know what the Palestinians endure, read Amira Hass' beautiful \\"Drinking the Sea at Gaza\\", though it isn't fiction, it might as well be. Read Rubber Bullets by Yarom Ezrahi, or Coming Home to Jerusalem, or Avi Shlaim.. This book is using and abusing a terrible situation, not adding to its emotional truth with imagination, but detracting from that, as the non-fiction books mentioned do not. Now, this is a leap: but why a twenty year old photo? And why such a totally dismal cover, one that is discordant with text. Everything about this book, including that I bought it, bothers me. I just take the Middle East too seriously to bear this tripe. Seriously, Read AMIRA HASS; she's the Giant in this pond of writers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Should have stayed with nonfiction","review":"I loved Ms. Wilentz' work on Haiti, a country I came to know well. She wrote brilliantly. I also know, not as well, the Middle East she writes about in Martyrs' Crossing, a book I read the minute it was available.I wanted to love it, but could not. It is not a good novel because it is more a parable than a plot. There is something terribly predictable here, and also I felt there was a steady greyness, like rain, running throughout the entire narrative. I believe the author would have been wiser, and benefited her many readers, to stick with non-fiction. That's because for a novel one needs more interiority, less predictablitiy. There is something too pat about her descriptions of the region, even though she clearly knows the current political realities. That's not the point. She doesn't know how to write a good novel. A shame..."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Serious Disappointment","review":"I've read so much good about this book. I'm a reader who trusts my own tastes and I read this one all the way to the bitter end. It is a serious disappointment because the hoopla and hype are not anything like what is in the covers here. I'm not immune to seeing the Mideast conflict from many points of view. But I am immune to poor prose, what is here, I regret to say, in almost every page. Bad dialogue. Poor characterizations. I've really nothing positive to say about this novel, except I hope that Ms. Wilentz goes back to non-fiction."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disappointing","review":"As a great fan of books dealing with the Israeli/ Palestinian conflict, I opened this book with high hopes. But I was terribly disappointed. This book needed a great deal of editing it did not get, and a few re-writes too. It doesn't get to the depth of a situation that so badly needs elucidating. This book doesn't succeed on any count: not as a good read, not as an elucidating read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Poetic, haunting, splendid fiction debut","review":"I can scarcely do justice to Amy Wilentz's extraordinary first novel through a mere review. \\"Martyrs' Crossing\\" was the most haunting, touching work of fiction I have read in a very long time. No other novelistic treatment of the Middle East in recent years comes anywhere close to this book. What Ms. Wilentz offers is an insightful look at age-old causes that simply aren't amenable to conventional political and diplomatic interventions. She's captured her characters--Jews and Arabs alike--just right. What a moving book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the Country I know","review":"I'm an Israeli who refused to do army service--that's how much my family is from the \\"left\\" and against war with the Palestinians.

Really liked on first listen, and the last three pieces are absolutely mesmerizing and haunting. Batwings is one of the most beautiful Coil pieces ever, the kind of song that makes one feel expansive and melancholy, sort of like a beautiful view of the Appalacians with fog lying in the valleys...and I disagree with Gracchus2 that it takes repeated listening to appreciate. The second half of the song is unmistakably lovely. The are several pieces on this album that render me contemplative and appreciative. I haven't heard Songs to Play in the Dark 1, so cannot compare. I have heard lots of Coil and must say this album is a nice blend of the melodic and the \\"sound\\" sides of Coil. One of my favorites. I would give certain pieces 5 stars on this work."},{"rating":"2","title":"Low-key cousin to Volume 1","review":"At first listen, this more subdued, darker-eyed cousin to Vol. 1 is a rather underwhelming experience -the vast majority of the pieces seem somewhat one-dimensional and over-repetitive. However, a certain hypnotic beauty does reveal itself on \\"Ether\\" and, in particular, the stately \\"Batwings\\" after repeat plays. While there is nothing here to match the chilling dynamics of \\"Are you shivering?\\" from Vol. 1, \\"Tiny Golden Books\\", which almost threatens to transmutate into bubbling techno, \\"An Emergency\\", a short, frosty, Rose Mcdowall-sung piece, and \\"Paranoid Inlay\\" are just interesting enough to redeem the exercise. As with most of Coil's work, it grows more interesting and nuanced with each play..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Aural Bliss! Better than Love's Secret Domain!","review":"I have always had a love for Coil, but never felt they could do better than \\"Love's Secret Domain\\"...that is till now! This disc is chuck full of that Coil creativity that we all know and love! Electronics, distortions, space synths, manipulations, left to right speaker play. They must have used every trick in their bag for this one! This disc never gets stale! I feel it's far better than Vol. 1 I can't pick out a favorite as they all work well as a whole. There are a couple long pieces, that by the time they're finnished, you feel as if you had been transported through time, and space! Headphones are highly recommended!

So many parents, in the process of pushing themselves and their children to win, succeed and outstrip the next guy, lose sight of what truly matters. The authors also remind us of the loss of joy and delight that parents deprive themselves of in the rat race to raise overscheduled and underappreciated kids. A highly readable book for parents which can help them lead more meaningful lives."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Return of Sanity to Parenting","review":"This book is a tonic for the harried, anxious souls of modern parents. Writing with passion, clarity, and conviction, the authors get to the heart of why we create frantic family schedules in our quest to be perfect parents. I'm afraid that too many parenting books make matters worse by raising the bar even higher for anxious parents who feel they can never do enough. This book shows how to set realistic standards for oneself as a parent, and to keep first things first in the lives of our children. Couldn't be more timely."},{"rating":"2","title":"Release the stress for the modern parent","review":"I bought this book because of many excellent reviews. It is really useful and provides some new ideas that help the modern parent, like me, to release from the stress of over-child-support. This stress has been started before the baby was borne till my child is studying in the primary school now in my case."},{"rating":"1","title":"Repetitive and poorly documented","review":"I can't agree with another reviewer more - this book can be condensed and the message given out in 10 pages - mostly because it is written more as an opinion without much examples. I was looking for some concrete illustrations to support the authors' points and there are extremely few. If I want to write a paper, this book will provide very little evidence. The authors just drag the topic on endlessly, expressing the same opinions in different ways. Overall, a boring read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hidden Treasures","review":"In the lengthy reviews I'm reading, I seemed to have missed something!!! I truly found a real hidden treasure in the never before released records. It is Leopard Skin Pill Box Hat. This song alone is worth the money spent for the two records. It is super phenomonenal!!!

It is very sexy, very funny and sung to ABSOLUTE PERFECTION. When I heard this particular verson of this song, I could not believe that it had never before been released!!! It is Dylan at his very very best! I was really astonished, really. Play it loud on very good equipment! Of course, there are other songs and takes that get first place, but this take on this song really stood out for me.

Instead we get this \\"soundtrack\\" to the Martin Scorsese documentary. I'm sure that will be good, even great, but this CD, though filled with excellent music, doesn't offer much of anything new. There's nothing here that's going to startle the ear unless you've never heard Dylan before. Like another reviewer said, this set seems recycled.

The author has a passionate distate for Harry Bridges that colors much of the subsequent discussion. I also have to say that some of the \\"facts\\" presented are tenuous, especially for a journalist. Information about Oppenheimer is controversial at best, and he seems to use some facts out of context to advance the vehement anti-CP line.I should note that I read this book in Paris which made me laugh out loud about some the claims the author makes about the importance of California radicals on world politics and intellectual history. In the end, I wish this was a 300 page book stripped of most of the author's more outrageous opinions and presented as a good history that is seldom read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Failed to prove his point","review":"As a native of Massachusetts (and world traveler), I expected to learn the opposite of what New Englanders learn in high school: how California changed us. Schwartz left that point behind after penning his title.I agree with other reviewers that his grasp of history (pre-WWII) was good - I learned a ton about the early settlement and development, and that has enriched my travels here. I also agree that his rant about communism was too much. But there were other problems - the book turned into a SF-Chronicle vs LA argument, for one. Also, by concentrating so much on CA history, Schwartz forgot to say how it traveled east. And I thought I was going to learn that. He avoids Hollywood cultural history too much (the part that does not pertain to Communism), when that would have been vital in proving his entire point.I could go on, but will close by saying that the book is worth reading until it gets to the year 1918. Just tear out the rest."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow, the best and most fun book I read in years","review":"An increadibly interesting and fun book; the best book I read in years.

A masterpiece"},{"rating":"1","title":"A Communist Behind Every Palm Tree","review":"This is an incredibly silly book. I picked it up hoping it had potential, because it seemed to want to delve into the interesting topic of --without irony-- California intellectual history.Instead, Schwartz uses this book an a opportunity to expose almost everyone halfway progressive in the state as either a Communist, a Stalinist, or both. The funniest laugh I got was when Schwartz refers to 'The Grapes of Wrath\\" movie as a failure compared to the book-- and that no one watches the movie any more (!)-- but then goes on to cite Ma Joad's sentimental ending speech about \\"the people\\" as a prime example of Commie influence in Hollywood.Only one problem-- that speech was proudly written by-- get this-- that great fellow traveler, DARRYL F.

Just knowing that I again will be treated to another story woven around this very savy crime reporter, Annika Bengtzon, leaves me filled with anticipation.The story of the bomber unfolds around pending Olympic Games to be held in Stockholm and; in particular, the life of the managing director. The author has done an outstanding job of making her characters very realistic. Indeed, one is most certainly able to identify with their day to day struggles.

But you can also improve your chances of passing any of those exams by tackling the problems in this book.Mata-Toledo offers some 400 problems. With the answers to half of these in the book. He tests virtually the entire syntax of SQL; an industry standard. Everything from arithmetic functions to group functions to making complex queries, and more. Of course, it will take you time to go through these problems. But that is the point of the book, after all.Also, the book is cheap compared to the other books that specialise in a given database vendor's exam."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Schaums book","review":"Good affordable Schaums's outlines book.

The story book is short and simple, perhaps by too much, but I guess that leaves more room for imaginary play. The pieces seem to be durable and my five year old has no difficulty putting the pieces together. She really enjoys making new animal creations out of them. The pieces are, however, tough for a just-turned-3 year old to put together. She still enjoys playing with the creations once they have been assembled.Overall, this toy provides a lot of creative fun for kids."},{"rating":"2","title":"La CD est magnifique et plein de mages!","review":"Desirs Contraires is a new make or break album by Anggun with more mature voice and music arrangements.

From gays and lesbians coming to grips with their own bisexual natures as well as many male-male-female situations, plus lots of unusual and diverse relationships and styles of relationships, I honestly have not seen such a diverse collection of erotica in one anthology. The writing is great. Each story is so different from the next. While all stories are sexual in nature, some really make you think. This is not your average erotica collection-- no-- it is a cut above! I can't wait to read volume three. Volume two is even better than Volume one, which I loved."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great writing on a provocative theme","review":"Leave it to Carol Queen to assemble such a talented assortment of writers. Though I am not bi-sexual, I picked up the book while staying at a friend's house and was stunned by the universal sexiness of these stories. I was familiar with some of the writers already (M.

There were only one or two stories in this anthology that were fairly predictable, but the majority of them were definitely worth my time. I enjoyed this little romp enormously!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Trivial and not very sexy","review":"I love Carol Queen so I bought this, but, blah, not much to it.

You get Tanenbaum's newest book, True Justice. The story of infant deaths in New York and Delaware (low and behold, Tanenbaum's lost real world case was in Delaware), too-young and too-stupid mothers, and the complacency of the law. Well what we have here folks is something to not waste your money on. Buy something else. His characters are two-dimensional, his plot (oh, you need a plot) thin, his dialogue unrealistic.

The book is dismaly small, and full of stereotypical over-generalizations that are typically found in Western sources. As is typical with books about 'Wahhabis', it rarely quotes the works of Muhammad ibn Abd al-Wahhab directly.Definitely not a scholarly work, but one which summarizes the anti-Wahhabist view of Wahhabism.If you want to read this work, keep these points in mind, and also read Natana D.

One would have to have a graduate student's knowledge of Islam and its various schools of thought to get much from it. In addition, the author obviously has a very dull axe to grind when he discounts the teachings because of the area of origin of al-Wahhab: \\"Najd had not been notable in Islamic tradition for scholarship or movements of spiritual renewal...\\" and \\"However, its occurance in the hadith literature does convey a sense of foreboding with respect to this part of the Arabian peninsula and suggest that any movement originating there should be viewed with great caution.\\" Chaper II, pages 5 and 6.

This man, who hates Jews rabidly, and the state of Israel moreso, dares to cast stones at the Wahabbies? (Yes, I spell in jest.)To my mind, his views are cut from the same cloth.

Sure the thing seems to work well, but it couldn't have cost fluke more than a few dollars to manufacture. If I shake the unit it rattles because there are loose components inside. I would also be wary of dropping this, as it will likely break immediately.This unit gets two stars because it works well and does what its supposed to.

My wife complained to me about them... more than once... saying they were EXTREMELY noisy. They worked OK for a VERY short time, but it didn't take them very long to become \\"dried out\\" and start \\"skipping along\\" on the windshield, making much noise, and no longer cleaning the windshield as they were meant to do. Apparently, Anco uses VERY low quality rubber for these... hence the low price. If I could have given them zero stars, I would have.

His descriptive metaphor bring all five senses into the reading of this novel. The characters step off the page with a realism that is nearly tactile.Though the setting of the action is cheifly the \\"hollows\\" of rural West Virginia during the electrification of the US, the novel also takes you along wonderfully descriptive tours of select ethnic settings including New York and Russia.

This is nothing but cheap foam; that was our first impression when we opened it up, but we kept very open minds about it. However, by the end of our third month sleeping on it, every night we felt like we would roll into our 'hole' when we got into bed, then climb out of our hole in the morning. Our comforter looked horrible on it since the first thing you saw were those two deep depressions. So what we ended up with was a higher bed around the outside, but lower in the middle; it looked like an under-baked souffle! We finally took it off and I wish I could return it.

Part of that might be a slightly-warped wiper arm, so I'm not confident assigning all the blame to the blade.* The retention mechanism is not too secure in my opinion. It was in tight originally, but over time worked it's way out and the blade came loose while operating. Flimsy plastic. It's happened twice so far.* The blade frame is the proper size, but the blades themselves are about a half inch shorter than the OEMs. Would have expected all 19\\" from a product that claims 19\\".Overall I would say this is a good value - decent blade for a cheap price.

So far, the blades seem to be working very well. The provide a clean swipe with no chatter. I am looking forward to seeing how long they last...but for the price, they can't be beat!

When #2 hit 80 K I used an A/C Delco belt for the Timing belt and Daco for the A/C and PS. I did not want to wait for amazon and finding gatorback locally was hard. The result was that the car ran like new which was noiser than #1. Also Even though the PS belt was tight to specs it slipped when I went through a puddle of water or in the rain. When I tightened it more it broke and wrapped itself around the crank pulley (Ps pump was OK as was the idler pulley so it was the belt design).

It has two basic rule sets: basic and advanced. The first one, fast and fun, using only three 6 sided dice and the second one realistic, but a bit boring sometimes."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best RPG system for all time.","review":"GURPS is the final evolution in roleplaying games. The system offers realism and flexibility with a smooth flow of play. The character generation mechanics (the heart of any rpg) are the best of any game I have ever seen. The GURPS world source books are extremely well researched and provide a strong foundation of support for campaigns of any kind."},{"rating":"2","title":"EXCELLENT","review":"Tired of D&D? Want to MAKE a character? Want to specialize? This is the RPG for you then. Make your character JUST like you want him/her/it. Want to be dumb and disgustingly good with a sword? It is your choice. GURPS can be as simple or as complex as you want it to be. That is its hook, its magic. You want to shift numbers all day in a battle you can. You want battles to be swift, vioklent, and over so you can get back to the story you can. I highly reccomend this system."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sasquatch Theater","review":"The latest film in the Sasquatch genre (there are enough now to call it that) is really pretty much just ho-hum. It isn't good (and what self respecting Sasquatch film would be) and it really isn't bad enough to elevate it to win a Golden Yeti as best Sasquatch film of the year. Not a lot of action here as it seems most of the killings, and with a crew of ignorant redneck hunters in the movie you can rest assured there will be killings, occur off-camera. I can understand this choice by the fimmakers as this Sasquatch is particularly rubbery and stiff. The film does feature a quick glimpse of Roslyn WA where Northern Exposure was depicted, particularly the Brick bar and grill. The film-makers took a big risk however in not casting Lance Henriksen in this Sasquatch outing as he has become synonomous with Sasquatch filmography (check him out at IMDB.com he has been in several other gigantopithecus extravaganzas)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Bigfoot Exists In This Movie!","review":"Good quality from Amazon, the movie was okay but didn't have enough bigfoot in it!!

All the obligoratory stuff is here, the bad hunters that tick off the Bigfoot enough to kill them, the youngsters who only get \\"scared\\" by the Bigfoot, and the mayor that is worried what the attacks will do to the tourist season.This movie is full of bad acting, bad directing, bad storytelling, and enough cliches to choke a Bigfoot, crazy or not.

Then I realised that the makers of the DVD have been careless and printed the film with the wrong aspect ratio. The DVD shows about 2.4:1 on the screen whereas the writing on the case jacket shows 16:9. Fortunately I was able to stretch the vertical part of the picture to obtain the right dimensions. The resolution lines then enlarge to the point where it becomes distracting - even with progressive scan. I am surprised no-one else has picked this up. With the right aspect ratio and ignoring the lines the picture is quite watchable with nice colors and scenery.The other reviewers are correct. This is not a horror movie. This is really about a monster's crusade to rid the world of criminals while leaving decent folk to live their lives in peace. Maybe a forest version of a type of caped crusader (eg. Superman, Batman and Robin, etc)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible!","review":"I liked many bigfoot films that have received less than stellar reviews, but this one insults the entire genre. There is NOTHING good about this film what so ever.They dare title this the legend of sasquatch? What a complete & utter joke. I would love to know where the budget went for this because it sure did not go on the creature or the actors? Don't waste you're money, its not even worth watching on tv let alone renting.

Then you'll get to see the apeman some 20 years later as Miles O'Keefe, now in his early fifties, plays a nasty poacher and continues to demonstrate his minimal acting talents. But hey there isn't anyone any better in this dull, lifeless mishmash that features some guy in horrible makeup playing the Sasquatch. Brandon Henschel, a professional dancer, plays the hunky jock who needs to get an A in his biology class and so he takes three comrades into the mountains just after a bear has supposedly killed three poachers. ALthough the other three teens aren't as despicable as Henschel, they don't offer much charisma either and the whole thing just reeks of low budget pap. Is there a good Sasquatch movie out there?"},{"rating":"1","title":"The Incredible Brown Hulk","review":"This movie was cheese at it's best. Crappy acting, crappy effects, crappy plot. The only thing that was interesting was the 'sasquatch' itself or as I liked to call him - The Incredible Brown Hulk, because that's what he looked like. Or at least thats what I thought he looked like because all I got were a few glimpses through trees in the dark. The only highlight of this movie was some partial nudity for about ten seconds. Total waste of time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sizes","review":"These are good blades but be careful with Amazons sizing as they may fit but are not necessarily the best size for your vehicle."},{"rating":"1","title":"blades don't work well","review":"I expected the blades to be crappy based on the price: they are. Also, this is a single blade (a car has 2 blades). The crappiness comes in here: part of the blade hovers over the windshield and doesn't actually wipe any water away.

Can't complain. I live in Florida and with the harsh sun, the blade has not dried out. Works nicely, does not squeak, and was easy to put on. Shipping was quick too. Why spend more?

They clear the windshield well, no streaking. There is little squeak when they first leave the park position on my vehicle. That said, I was wiping dew at the time. I'll update after a good gulf south downpour. I have used Anco before, they seem to be good cheap wiper blades.Update: Well, you never have to wait long for a good rain down here. Performance was good in a heavy rain. One thing I did note is that at higher speeds, 75+, the wind seems to catch the blade and make it skip. This is a full size E-350 van, so it may be the vertical windshield has something to do with that.Update 2: 2 months later, the blades chatter on the upstroke unless they are very wet. In a full downpour, they still function adequately, however as the rain slows, or if you are wiping dew, the upstroke is extremely noisy and doesn't clear the windshield."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Value","review":"A snap to install, literally.

The 1st order with 2 wipers had one broken plastic end and was unusable. I returned the item for a replacement. The replacement came today. The box had already been opened and the blade was bent in the center. The pin for the mount was missing. Having been through returning the 1st blade I decided that this one was salvageable with a plier bend and a bolt with Loctite to replace the missing pin. When I went to mount it, the mount was too small. The only other mount was too large. The standard mount was missing. I believe that I was sent a wiper that was returned as damaged by another customer. Until Amazon can supply an undamaged wiper, buy elsewhere.Update: The third time is a charm. I just received another replacement in pristine condition, sent overnight UPS. This time a smaller, more rigid box was used. Amazon's return policy is excellent.

They were selling it cheap so I decided to start my hobby with something low cost. Well, you get what you pay for. I automatically assumed that all RC planes advertised flew. The plane was just too heavy for its power output. I even took the bottom wing off to see if that would make a difference, no deal. How long the plane stayed air born depended on from how high I let it go. I went to target and bought the Air Hog Aero Ace and boy; the Aero Ace was and still is the bomb. I still have a lot of fun with the Ace.Thank you AMAZON for allowing feed back on products.

I bought this plane about 2 months ago (from an eBay merchant). The first plane sent to me would not charge. After paying for the additional cost of shipping the product back to the merchant, I got a replacement plane that would charge and would fly for about 30 seconds per charge. However, on a turn, one of the two props needs to slow down and the plane would nose dive into the ground. The plane was just too heavy for the output power of the props. Don't buy this plane. Buy the one made by Silverlit. Silverlit makes a plane that looks almost identical to this plane but works a whole lot better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great foundation","review":"This foundation is great. I have tried many - most recently Clinique - which was fine but for about the same cost, I am MUCH happier with this one.

Really good explanations of all parts of digital photography that someone with a new SLR needs to know. This book is above the level of describing depth of field, and the standard SLR questions.

I have been a film SLR photographer for decades and now am on my second generation DSLR. This book reminds me of my old Kodak Photographers Handbook and my Nikon SLR handbook. I think I will use the Pro Digital Photographer's Handbook for many years.Michael's information about sensor technology compared to film and how lense design affects this is one example of the depth of topic in this great handbook. He also covers the digital workflow from simple (little to no editing) to complex (steps for client based work). The color management section was very useful to calibrate all my devices.I highly recommend this book for the photographer who understands the basics - depth of field, apertures, shutter speed, etc. (Although he has a great section about sensor size and depth of field).Buy it and enjoy it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"You need this book","review":"So, you want to be a professional photographer? If so, you need this book to provide the kind of information you'll need when starting out.

That's the kind of practical business advice you won't find in other digital photography books.The amount of useful information in this book is amazing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent read and resource","review":"In transitioning from film to digital, I needed some books for a quick transition and to avoid reinventing the wheel. I don't have a lot of time, so a focused and detailed reference that could rapidly take me to a functional level was needed. I was very happy with the accessibility and the level of detail presented. I read the whole thing, but realize that I will need to go back to it to get the full value from it (e.g., when I find the need for a particular technique or action). It does address workflow, but that is not its focus, which I would describe as more of a broad, but sufficiently detailed introduction to many issues and techniques available to the digital photographer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pure originality","review":"The pixies are the MOST underrated band . . .EVER. I realize that their popularity has grown since their break up, but when the best band of the 90's (nirvana) says that you're their greatest influence, you're doing something right. Every song on this CD throws so many different ideas at you in usually less than 3 minutes. That's impressive. Also, the songs are so diverse that it never gets borring . From the edgy break my body to the poppy gigantic, which is the best song on the cd IMO it's all pure orriginality in the best form humanly possible. I heart the pixies. They are definately a band that is an aquired taste, considering i completely hated them for the first 3 months i had their cds, now their my favs."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Hard Music","review":"Great music almost Punk in the harshness and antagonism of the sound. The catchy quick sounds are reminiscent of the Ramones at times but with much more indepth sound and lyrics. None of the songs are very long and each one really gets you pumped. Great music to listen to while your working out or doing anything for that matter since it just gets you going."},{"rating":"2","title":"as good as the hype","review":"Surfer Rosa, while not as musically intricate or well-constructed as later releases, leaps out of the speakers with a certain urgent and excited energy that the Pixies would never match. Everything sounds so uncontrolled and immediate, as if it came flowingly and naturally. From the upbeat fun of \\"Bone Machine\\", to the balls-to-the-wall pop of \\"Gigantic\\", to the raucous verbal assaults in Spanish of \\"Oh My Golly\\", each song on Surfer Rosa has its own distinct flavor and personality. Kim Deal's angelic voice weaves beautifully with Black Francis' piercing nasal wail. Joey Santiago is a quintessential pop guitarist; rather than merely following the chords and vocals, what he plays is its own entity, such as the colorful melodic hook of \\"Where is My Mind?\\", or the bluesish meanderings of \\"Brick is Red\\". Surfer Rosa makes for a very satisfying listening experience."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful upgrade over the standard cd","review":"The Pixies have never sounded so good in this hybrid SACD edition of their first full length album. The only people to have heard the Pixies sound this way were the original studio engineers it's that good. Every detail stands out and the stereo image is so good you can pick out the layers of vocals and guitars. The bass is detailed and thick. For the audiophile that is even a marginal fan of the Pixies this is a must purchase title."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just buy it","review":"This is one of the great rock recordings of all time. In the sixties, there was Dylan with Highway 61 Revisited, the Beatles with Rubber Soul, Big Brother with Cheap Thrills, Jimi Hendrix with Are You Experienced. In the seventies, there was Patti Smith with Horses and the Ramones. In the eighties, there was the first Pretenders album and there was Surfer Rosa. In the nineties, there was Nevermind. It's too early to know what will be a classic from this decade, but too late not to know that Surfer Rosa helped make the eighties worthwhile.I can't add much to 100-plus reviews below. This is the Pixies at their most energetic. There isn't a bad moment.

The usual pixies themes, mutilation and obsession."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pixies best album","review":"Following their remarkable debut EP \\"Come On Pilgrim,\\" Pixies teamed with the great Steve Albini for their debut LP, \\"Surfer Rosa,\\" which itself became a touchstone of independent, \\"alternative\\" music, cited by Kurt Cobain as one of his favorite albums and a significant influence on Nirvana's music.From the bombastic (and perfectly tuned, mic'ed, and recorded) drum intro of \\"Bone Machine,\\" to the strange beauty of Gigantic, and the punk intensity of \\"Something Against You,\\" to the snaking bass line and lyrical genius of \\"Cactus,\\" this album is as huge in its span as it is in its sound.Never again would the Pixies so much as attempt to match the grit and grime of this album, and that's probably for the best. But for all the nice production values of Bossanova and Trompe Le Monde, they never sounded better, and they surely never had a better album cover."},{"rating":"1","title":"over rated","review":"If you're expecting an album as consisten as Doolittle, save your money.

I don't really find much talent in that genre or on this album. \\"Where is my mind?\\" and \\"Gigantic\\" are the only songs on this album that I would listen to multiple times. The other songs have no soul, groove or rhythm. Just a lot of distorted noise and nobody playing toghether - very Sonic Youth. This album is about 33 minutes long and we have to endure some kind of conversation for a whole minute toward the end of the disc.

Was there a single actual musician in this band? I have never in my life heard a band that was so utterly, apocalyptically devoid of actual talent.It doesn't matter how influential this band was or how popular they were (or are) in college frat houses. Stupid music is stupid music, period, and The Pixies' attempts at writing 'music that's so bad that it's actually kind of good' failed miserably. Unless of course you think lyrics like \\"This song is about a superhero named Tony!\\" are the stuff of brilliance.Silliness is not an art form.

This is a great album, from the first to the last songs. A little surprise for any Bowie fans out there, David covers the song cactus on his latest album Heathen. Each song is very spirited. With all the new bands out there this blows them all away, and the cd is 14 years old now. So while the \\"yeah, yeah, yeahs\\", \\"The Donna's\\", The Strokes\\", \\"THe Vines\\" etc are all getting the press this is the cd that you should be listening to."},{"rating":"2","title":"A big big love","review":"This album is nothing less than amazing. Don't listen to the reviewers who say that this album is boring or overrated. I can listen to these songs no matter what kind of mood I'm in. I listen to it almost constantly. The melodies are downright beautiful, yet the music somehow manages to be extremely harsh and angry at the same time. Black Francis has the best voice in rock and Kim Deal complements him perfectly. I only have one warning: Listen to this with an open mind! It is very weird at first!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Their masterpiece album !!!!","review":"Surfer Rosa is without any question my personal favourite Pixies album - it's raw , loud , fast , agressive and brilliant !! no other Pixies album has the same sound as this masterpiece - classic songs from start to finish - if i was stuck on a remote Island with one album in my hands this is what i'd have with me. 10/10 a classic!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Must-Have","review":"At this discount price how can you not have this album? It only runs 33 minutes but it packs more punch then albums three times it's length. Like others I heard the song in \\"Fight Club\\" and I had to have the CD. It is one of those lost wonders I never would have been turned on to any other way. \\"Where is my mind?\\" is one of the best songs I've ever heard from the 80's.

Surfer Rosa is a part of rock's history now, above all our petty criticisms and nit-picking. I may not be enthralled by all the songs here- the second half is quite a bit weaker than the sheer genius of the first half, and even contains some almost disposable songs (Tony's Theme? Vamos?). But rather, its the great stuff that sticks with you- the bone-breaking opening to \\"Bone Machine\\", the lovely spanish rhythm to \\"Something Against You\\", the sheer pop genius of \\"Gigantic\\", Kim Deal's breathy vocals being a bonus, the mind-blowingly brilliant boy-girl chorus to \\"River Euphrates\\", the weirdness of \\"Broken Face\\", the bass line to \\"Break my Body\\"...This, and Doolittle, are two albums any fan of rock'n'roll can simply not do without."},{"rating":"2","title":"Teen Heaven","review":"Ahhh nostalgia. The Pixies were the \\"College/Alternative\\" poster children of the late 80's, early 90's.

While more money was spent producing later albums, \\"Surfer Rosa\\" stands on its own, less filtered, more raw, capturing the Pixes at a time when they were just beginning to coalesce as a band that \\"owned\\" its sound.

There were questions that had nothing to do with what was taught and even a few that required answers that didn't refer to anything learned.

Instead of just compiling reports from qualified MDs, PhDs, etc., Carper regretfully goes one level further and INTERPRETS these studies for us. Unfortunately, she is not qualified to do that. Her background is not in medicine or health, she is just a writer. She wants to sell books, so she becomes super-positive with all her \\"analyses\\". Sorry, Ms Carper, your embellished opinions are not objective, are not scientific, are often flat WRONG, are not separated from the factual information, and thereby destroy what might have been an informative book.

The Israel PO plays in a very romantic way (whether this is due to Bernstein artistic choice, or to lack of ensemble playing I don't know). This works really well in the more playful Petrouchka but takes a lot of edge away from the best moments of the Sacre. Compare the mysterious (almost creepy) opening of the Sacrifice scene in Stokovsky/Philadelphia with the plain atmosphere of the same first 10-20 measures in this recording.

I liked not only getting to see Lise and Joshua's plans but also getting a glimpse in to the life of the villain. The chemistry between Lise and Joshua was evident from the very beginning and was great watching them both fight it then finally give in. Getting to meet Hotwire, Nitro and Josie was great too. Just catching little snippets about Josie and Nitro made me eager for their story, those two are going to be explosive. And Hotwire's southern charm was cute and had the desired affect of putting Lise at ease. The camaraderie the three men have was inspiring. My only gripe with this book was the take down of the stalker was kind of anti-climatic. We were rushing throughout the whole book to stay ahead of him and then....bam, he was taken down without a fight or anything. Just seemed a little to perfect. Otherwise, I was engaged the whole time. Can't wait for Willing the next in this series."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hot and Ready","review":"I read this book and couldn't put it down, love the couple and the hot and steamy sex and romance"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great read!","review":"First Lucy Monroe book I've picked up.

AND ABLE."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too much GRAPHIC sex, too little plot","review":"I like a good romance. I like a good suspenseful story. This, however was neither. The book was just one graphic sex scene after another and little plot. The sex scenes were pornographic, simply put. After awhile, the scenes lost all their titilation and any semblence of romance. I imagine a man reading the scenes would be turned on. They were just gross to me. As for the plot, I kept hoping it would get around to it. After chapters of sex scenes I wondered what had happened to the stalker! Then when the story climax approached, it just fizzled. No story climax at all. What a let down. Skip this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Enough, already!","review":"I agree with a previous reviewer that Ms. Monroe's books cross the line into soft porn.

Each heroine is either a virgin or has almost no experience with sex but of course has incredible sex with these emotionally distant men--yeah, right, their incredible penises are all they have going for them.And of course after all the sex they have while repeatedly telling the heroines this is not a relationship, just sex, they suddenly and for no apparent reason realize they LOVE the heroines so they can have a relationship after all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buy a whole size larger than you think","review":"I bought a 9 1/2 size Men shoes and they were to tight.

Instead, it was a thinly disguised excuse for the author's collection of anecdotes about the Washington rich-'n'-famous. The only practical advice given are gems such as \\"temperature is important--don't let your guests be too hot or too cold.\\" Gee--that one I'd already figured out for myself. If you want to read about the Washington social scene, this is a great book. If you're seeking advice about how to entertain, don't bother with this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Adventurous, indeed....","review":"Formerly of Washington, D.C., I couldn't resist reading this lighthearted romp into Sally Quinn's world of entertaining. I don't believe Quinn wanted to write a book that laid out clear \\"do's and don'ts\\" á la Judith Martin, but instead wanted to lead by example - sharing stories of her party successes and misfires. Some of the stories are absolutely priceless, especially the ones involving Colin Powell. Quinn stresses overall the Golden Rule of Hostessing: treat others as you would want to be treated. Another one of my favourite tips is \\"no matter how bad the food is or what disaster befalls you in the kitchen, when all else fails, make sure you have plenty of booze on hand, and the party won't be a total bomb.\\" So very, very true.If you have some down time in your own world of adventurous entertaining, pick up this book and settle in for a good time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hilarious - I loved it!","review":"I entertain frequently, and Ms. Quinn has a most delightful way of discussing the angst (and disasters!) of every experienced hostess. \\"The Party\\" had me laughing out loud, and I have been giving this book as a gift to other friends who entertain.

So whether your guests are 'famous' or not, her wisdom is true."},{"rating":"2","title":"This was a fun read--light and breezy","review":"I don't think Sally Quinn meant for this to be a guide to entertaining. It's light and breezy and certainly a fun summertime read. If you don't have an interest in Sally and Ben--and in Washington--you might find it not so interesting. BUT, if you do, you will probably find it very entertaining.I did manage to pick up some entertaining tips along the way. They may come under the description of common sense advice, but it's good to hear them nonetheless from someone who has entertained a lot--and been entertained a lot. These tips include things like--don't have the same party every year, don't play party games without warning your guests ahead of time, don't ask people to give toasts unless they have had time to prepare---and the list goes on.The bottom line is--I loved this book---and give it a hearty recommendation!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A collection of Sally Quinn's name-dropping stories","review":"The title of this book implies that it's a how-to-guide to throwing a great party. You do get a few tips here and there, but this book serves mainly for Sally Quinn to name drop, describe the fun parties she's hosted, and generally tell you how terrific she is. Sally Quinn was the style editor for the Washington Post; her husband is Ben Bradlee, the famous Washington Post editor during Watergate, the Pentagon Papers and a number of other significant historical events. The tone of this book is lighthearted, and many of the stories are quite funny. After a while, though, I got tired of reading about \\"when Hillary and Bill came over one time,\\" or \\"when all these Senators and Representatives were at our house,\\" or \\"when we hosted this fabulous dinner party and everyone in Washington was talking about it for weeks.\\" The tone of this book was too self-congratulatory for me to fully enjoy it."},{"rating":"1","title":"An annoying waste of money","review":"This sounded like an interesting insider's view into the party habits of famous people in Washington, D.C.

I thought this would be my opportunity to replace the entire work bowl mechanism, which is scratched and dinged up. I saw the \\"frequently bought together\\" and that is what I ordered, all three pieces for over $80.The product looks great. It fit onto the bottom (motor section) of the Cuisinart very snugly. I was feeling lucky! YES! A full replacement was within my grasp.But it was not to be. The top lid would not lock onto the bowl. I tried, my husband tried (with more muscle). Nope, it wasn't happening. I tried the new lid pieces with my old bowl, and it worked like a charm. I am returning this bowl."},{"rating":"1","title":"costly and did not fit machine","review":"Had to buy a replacement bowl since our original broke. Figured it would be better to spend 35 bucks for a bowl than buy anew cuisinart even though 35 dollars is ridiculous for a piece of plastic. Be that as it may, I bought it and then it did not fit correctly with my machine. Had to use a knife to slice some plastic off so the machine could work properly. Not too nice for an expensive piece."},{"rating":"2","title":"Workbowl perfect fit","review":"Anyone with a food processor (Cuisanart) be sure to check for replacement parts as they are all available.

Very unhappy with this transaction. They were not willing to work with me via email exchange to make it right and provided no phone number to try to resolve to my satisfaction. This supposed \\"replacement\\" bowl would not work with the parts of the original unit as is supposedly should. If this needed their own top then is should not be sold separately and only sold with their top. They only gave me the option of returning, but I had to eat almost $20 of shipping fees (original and return) for a $31 item. Since it was their fault and not mine that their product did not work, then they should have at least credited the original shipping charge. In fair dealings with other reputable businesses, when it was their fault, they supplied a prepaid shipping label for the return. These folks did not."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Pleased","review":"I have had my Cuisinart DLC machine since the 80's. It has worked hard for me over the years and it is still going.

It fits and will continue to do all the work I need it to do for years to come."},{"rating":"2","title":"Quite Good","review":"This book has a large variety of leider. I was quite impressed with the Mozart selections, however, I was unhappy to find several Mahler pieces.

The book is still worth it, though, just ignore those few pages. :)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Mediocre conducting spoils this","review":"Great sound and great playing but the conducting leaves much to be desired.

The story moves along quickly over the time span of one weekend spent in the country. By far, Cameron's strength is his use of dialog. He masterfully conveys what his characters are feeling in a clear and emotional way.

But they're all outside, discussing this (not to mention--except ever-so-discreetly--that), missing the train of thought that brought them together (and which will, later, by car, drive them apart).

Or is he reporting on 1970, the year the Knicks won the NBA Championship. The two stories don't intertwin seemlessly as he would have them, and you are left feeling like you haven't been fulfilled on either of the stories in this book. I gave this book 4 stars based more on his obvious joy in writting it (which makes it very fun to read) than his actual skill in writting it.

With the exception of Ward Clapham's story the book is exceptionally boring. I think what I disliked most is the Authors (D. Michael Abrashoff) constant comparisons of the leader he was writing about and his time in the NAVY. I would just be getting a good picture of Leader he was describing and he would ruin the feel by adding another \\"this one time on BENFOLD\\" story.

My own experience as a Navy officer made the Commander's first book uniquely appealing. If I had served under a commanding officer like him, I would still be in uniform.Instead showcasing new leaders and new ideas, every chapter of the sequel informs us how the subject of the story brilliantly implemented the Commander's ideas - and giving us a new story or two about HIS ship to prove it. Instead of a cast of inspiring lead characters, the \\"Great Leaders\\" of the title are reduced to minor supporting roles.While his first book gave a memorable presentation of management and leadership ideas, he didn't invent them. I have read the same principles in various forms in dozens of other books and articles over the years. Commander Abrashoff missed an opportunity to make waves with these tales, instead sailing back through the same waters that he covered before."},{"rating":"2","title":"Outstanding","review":"Excellent book on providing team building skills.

His points are well taken, and I only wish the current commissioner would take heed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Preachy and Long Winded","review":"After a promising start about his relationship with the \\"Old Perfesser\\", Casey Stengel, Herzog's account reads more like a long winded sermon. I expected more substantial content rather than a rambling diatribe about how much the game has deteriorated. After a while, I couldn't stomach Whitey's egoistic rants about his slant on baseball strategy. Yes, he was a great manager but he is not the sole proprietor of baseball genius. It is a meandering read and a major disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"A bit of a disappointment","review":"I hate to rain on everyone's \\"Whitey parade\\", but I was disappointed with the book. Maybe my expectations were too high; knowing Herzog to be a baseball \\"lifer\\", I was expecting a book filled with insights about today's game and \\"inside baseball\\". While there are some gems , they are hard to find. Too much of the book is filled wth Herzog's rants about almost every facet of the game today and anecdotes that often are not amusing nor insightful except to expose Herzog's enormous ego.His constant self aggrandizement detracts from his message. Maybe self aggrandizement is his message."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good start, but ultimately too self-serving","review":"Whitey's book starts off well enough, with good stories of his days as a player and a scout. His perspectives as a manager, however, are too narrow for anyone who isn't a die-hard Cardinals fan.

I called the manufacturer and they sent me another filter basket. I used the new one this morning and it did the same thing!I plan to call them again and find out what my options are as to getting a different model. Also, it is hard to replace the carafe after you pour your coffee. It is a very attractive unit, but function seems to have been comprimised in order to make it good looking."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Coffeemaker I ever had","review":"More trouble with this one than it is worth.

I would set the time and the spring would get stuck while the maker was brewing. This would cause the filter chamber to fill up and overflow leaving a big mess to clean up. I finally dismantled that option.I just got done throwing the unit out after it quit from two years of medium service. I had a Bunn coffee maker previously and did not want to shell out the money. The Bunn had lasted me over 10 years. Needless to say, I went back to Bunn and bought the thermal version from Target. I have only had it for a week, but I am thrilled so far."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Coffee Maker","review":"This coffee maker is a gem.

Not only did the room description in the book not resemble the room I was in, but the directions to the hotel were messed up. The closest subway station to the hotel (as per the instructions) was on a different subway line in a different neighborhood than the real station - which by the way -was a rail road station. I have no idea where they dug up the hotel from, because no-one around it even knew the street name. I would not be surprised if the Eifel Tower directions send you Versaille.

But how do you combine those notes to write a symphony? This is the only book on the market which really shows you how. It consists of a detailed ODBC reference and highly useful sample code that shows how to take the API calls and make an application out of them.The calls are grouped in logical sequences, each call is thoroughly described, and then an example of a program that uses that call (and other calls) is given.The writing is extremely clear. The presentation is excellent. The book is extremely well organized.It does not assume any prior knowledge of ODBC though it assumes you know how to program C.C is the only language used in the book. The use of ODBC in other languages such as Visual Basic is not discussed.Though this book is old; I cannot recommend it too highly. I've used it before and I'll use it again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent!","review":"This is inarguably the best book on straight ODBC API. Very lucid in its presentation and full of practical examples, every page is packed with all the essential information. This is really a serious book for the serious ODBC programmers and every tool and technique to get the job done can be found in this book. My only wish is that the authors would update this book from ODBC v2.0 to v3.0, perhaps also include a few chapters on OLEDB."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nodding off","review":"I found myself becoming extremely sleepy while reading this book. Scott Frank's constant state of heroin-induced ennui, combined with his complete lack of humor, made for a very soporific read. An exception to this is his tale of transporting heroin across the Mexican border and his subsequent encounter with a good-ol'-boy customs guard, who, after inspecting the tracks on Scott's arms, decides to let him go anyway. A palpable sense of self-absorption emanates from his writings. It works pretty well as a period piece of the late seventies heroin scene. Recommended for those who really, really like to read about heroin."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wow","review":"I can't find the words to describe this utter failure. The spooky sounds and images are highly repetetive and hokey. The production value is hilarious.

All you see in the whole thing is a couple of different PLASTIC pumpkins set in different badly staged places. Sometimes they are lit with a fake flame sometimes they aren't. Oh yeah...there is some guy skulking around in a cheap Halloween costume too. The sound effects are laughable. I was planning to have this playing in the background of my Halloween party this year but would now be embarrased to. The packaging is deceiving in regard to whether it was made professionally. I'll either be giving this away, probably anonymously to an enemy, or throwing it away which is redundant in regard to the $10 I spent on it.

I like only one song on here, and that's the song LaToya does with Michael Jackson. So I give it 5 stars. However, I gave good feedback marks to the seller, before listening to this CD. I had this album years ago, and I can't remember the exact record label, but I'm CERTAIN it was NOT Cherry Pop Records! Yep...that's what on the actual CD. Copied, burned, with reprinted booklets, this seller is getting over, and should be jailed. I have to turn my volume up all the way to the limit just to hear it, because the CD is of very cheap quality.

With the exception of \\"A Taste Of Love (Is A Taste Of You)\\", every other song suits La Toya's whispy vocals. I agree with the idea that La Toya would have gained her most success as a Disco Diva because there were many successful female singers, both solo and in music groups or projects who had singing vocals similar to her own. However, with the right lyrics and production to bring out the best of her voice, she can excel at both funky Dance songs and smooth Soul/Quiet Storm styled ballads. An example of this is the surprisingly sunning Soul ballad, \\"My Love Has Passed You By.\\" I enjoy the songs such as \\"If I Ain't Got It\\", \\"Lovely Is She\\", \\"Save Your Love\\" and of course the hit lead single, \\"If You Feel The Funk.\\" Overall, of the La Toya albums avaliable to purchase, this is certainly recommended! Let's hope the fabulous album, \\"Startin' Over\\" gets release soon!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Just what my son wanted","review":"I ordered the Justice League as a gift for my son.

I loved it, the hour long episodes and the characters went well together. I was able to get this at only $15 too so that is a major plus for a blu-ray set. The only problem I had with the series is that martian man-hunter's potential was never reached. It seemed as though he should dominate in every way but in the end would always have to be rescued. Batman, superman, and wonder woman are the true stars of this show but green lantern and flash play good parts as well. If your a fan of comics then this set is probably just right for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Start To The Series","review":"While definitely not as good as the second season, this is worth a buy if you are at all interested in any of the superheroes.

Once again, DC tries to reinvent Aquaman - and fails. The brooding and \\"surface hating\\" king of Atlantis comes under attack by one of his own government officials, and ends up sacrificing a hand to save his infant son. All the while, he's busy being snarky with the Justice League and even mouthing off at Batman. Big mistake, as any fan. DC did indeed move on quite well, only ruining a few more episodes by having Aquaman appear to wreck them as well. My advice - skip this episode (and others such as \\"Wake the Dead\\") and enjoy the others, up into JLU."},{"rating":"2","title":"Full screen BD?","review":"I should have known as this was a tv show but its only viewing option is in 4:3 aspect.

I purchased this dvd series twice to make sure I wasn't just crazy, I looked everywhere online to see if I was the only one experiencing this problem and guess what, its a problem with the sets. Every website and the back of the box itself lists that the season comes with subtitles in English and yet the option isn't available anywhere on any of the 4 disks. I've email the WB every day since 3/21 when the set came out and no response at all.

While having a season set is certainly a good thing, it also means that the first two discs and the first two episodes on the 3rd disc are all repeated material.Having the added commentary along with the new episodes doesn't quite justify the purchase price, but if it sends a message to WB headquarters that \\"Yes, we do in fact WANT season sets.\\" Then I'm more than happy to pony up the cash."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for a Standard TV with a PS3","review":"I love Justice League. So I began to collect the whole series and decide to initiate with this release.In my case (I have a 36\\" standard TV with a PS3) the extra cost wasn't worth it.First of all I get a square letter box, I mean that in my TV it doesn't display in a real full screen, although it should. So, all that I see is an image in the center of the screen about 3\\" smaller that it should be.The sound isn't impressive either. As other review stated: most use of the center and a few of the whole rest of speakers.Not really special features.For me, this is an average DVD and not worth the extra cost. Stick to the DVD and avoid the BD. That's a shame, because I love this series."},{"rating":"2","title":"3 1/2 rating, to be true, but still it is a very good season.","review":"Because I cannot rate a 3 1/2 for this product, I'll choose the 4 stars, as these season is entertaining (but NOT as much as Season 2, which is WAY BETTER!!), and at the same time is cementing some facts that on later season will become crucial, and surprise-inspiring.Most of the episodes/stories are divided in two episodes, so they are relatively easy to follow.Again, things REALLY turn up to be surpirising and highly entertaining in Season 2 (and even more, in Justice League Unlimited Season 1), but you got to have Season 1 to understand a lot of things that will come up next.Enjoy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Handfulls","review":"This five volume set is just incredible!

I do not think he is evil, just too in touch with his emotions and his power. As for Cameron, Micheal better not fall in love with her. I like her and all, but I don't think she can be trusted. After all, she did give Valenti the info he wanted on the others... I think Ms.Matz did wonderful work with the characters. We think they're all good, then all bad.

There are few other authorities on journalism who are as good. Bradlee admits his mistakes and applauds his successes. Sort of a feel good story -- Bradlee's was indeed a good life. The narrative carries like a good novel, unlike Katherine Graham's memoir, whose story about the same paper gets bogged down and incoherent. Bradlee is a writer before he is an editor. His concise, clear reporter's style carries through to his autobiographical prose. A fine read for anyone interested in recent American History or American journalism and newspapers."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great Book","review":"Mr. Bradlee's book is a crisply written and most entertaining look at his family life and his life in journalism, from the period leading up to World War Two on through the Watergate Era. This is autobiographical writing at its best; honest, informative, funny, sad, hopeful, and never boring. I learned a lot from reading this book. I hope high schools and colleges are using this fine work as part of any course on post-WW2 U.S. history.A great book by a great writer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Q-See Quality","review":"Q See Quality?????I purchased the Q-See QSNDVR4R as part of a security system complete with four cameras. While performing an initial parts count and visual inspection, the following discrepancies use found:1) The instruction manual was written in French.2) On the DVR: All camera input BNC connectors retaining (4) nuts are missing.3) On the DVR: Both video output connectors are protruding at approximately 85 degree from the case instead on the normal 90 degree? Is this stressing the circuit board? Only one had a retaining nut installed. Where was Quality Control?Bench checkInitial setup was uneventful. After running the system overnight, I shut it down for a few hours. After power up, one camera failed to produce an image. Resetting power corrected the problem.

I have bought numerous Canon products from Amazon with no issues till now. After speaking to 2 customer service reps, who insisted the problem was Canon's, not Amazon, I have now lost faith in Amazon.

If you are just looking for a simple remote this is not what you are wanting.

He is abducted into the story - how? we really dont know. Sometimes he hears the typewriter clicking away; and sometimes not - then he has some freedom from the writer's plot to try and influence it. The novel is a pirate story 500 years ago written in the style of 1940 pulp, a kind of a parody, including in the start a funny scene about writer and publisher relation - but not an interesting story.The pirate story itself is outdated and the good idea of the modern charater in the historic person, trying to free himself from the bonds of the writer, never really takes off. Hubbard was a very productive writer and did not think twice about what he wrote, so the theme is not folded out. A shame, it is a good idea. - Nothing about Scientology which came later."},{"rating":"1","title":"90 minutes of my life that I'll never get back!","review":"After the first two movies in the series, which were pretty decent, I thought that was all there was.

Or, you can't figure out how to use it. I haven't had any problem with a mess or leaking or boiling or anything like that. It makes a fast, strong, good cup of coffee and I've owned dozens of coffee makers over the years. It lasted about 3 years for me, but I use it daily and to be honest, I haven't had a coffee maker last much longer than that in years. Next best cup of coffee to my Senseo Pod one-cup system or my expresso maker. High wattage makers are the best, and it's tough to find one for a decent price (like this). You also get a fuller, better flavor with a cone filter, so you get it all in this one. I guess the top is tough to remove from the carafe, but no biggy, better than it flopping around! I've gotten them for gifts and everyone is satisfied and I'm buying another one for myself today. Highly recommended!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Melitta Malady","review":"As a follow up to an earlier positive review, my unit lasted 16 months and no longer heats.

Then, after a couple of weeks the off / on light stopped working all of the time. The worse part however is the spring that holds up the cone to let the coffee drip into the pot is not srong enough to use 2-3 times a day. So now if your not careful the cone floods and lets coffee grinds and water into the pot undrinkable. What a mess to clean all of those grounds everywhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed!

Unfortunately this Earl Grey was very disappointing. I cannot be sure if the tea was inherently bad or that it was due to bad packaging. The tea bags were not individually packaged and when I opened the box, there was absolutely no scent of bergamot. The flavors had all but lost due to exposure to air, assuming the flavors were there when the tea was first blended. After steeping, there was a strong bitter taste and a very faint resemblance of an earl grey. The tea was not expired. In fact the expiration date is three years away. It's interesting to speculate what taste it will have by then."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Book on Yoga and Samkhya","review":"For both theoretical and practical study of Yoga Sutras and Samkhya philosophy this is the book to buy, read and keep reading.

It is a deep and wonderful read for serious, intellectually inclined students of meditation. It is very esoteric and goes into great detail on the nature and functions of the mind, and the yogic processes of arresting and transcending the mind, culminating in Self-realization.I am a spiritual writer and teacher, and I recommend that my meditation students start with How to Know God, a basic book on the sutras Patanjali, then graduate to this text if they vibe with Patanjali.

She has instead bored me to tears with her version of Helen's life."},{"rating":"2","title":"Reminiscent of author's Henry VIII","review":"I really enjoyed this book. For me, it was truly a page turner, even though I obviously knew how it turned out. It was reminiscent in style to the author's Henry VIII, which I also loved. It was clearly written by Helen, with her perspective changing through the years. Of course, it did have that \\"subjunctive\\" perspective, starting with her having to attend Menelaus' funeral - and then flashing back to her youth. I did find myself going to an atlas many times to find some of the locations - such as where the family was exiled prior to returning to Sparta in the beginning, and also trying to determine what was at Troy today. I also enjoyed the way in which the author brought the whole pantheon of Greek mythology into the action of the story."},{"rating":"1","title":"poetic, yet boring","review":"Ms. George write very poetic, yet I found the book quite boring.

I have read all the others and was disappointed in each. In order to finish \\"Helen of Troy\\" (for a book review) I had to skim mightily through the final 200 pages. How could these Trojans have been so stupid? They couldn't recognize the spy among them even though the reader does early on? They REALLY thought the wooden horse was a gift and not a trap? Oh, please.Helen and Paris are self-aggrandizing, spoiled children who care only for themselves. I wanted to slap her as soon as she stepped on the ship to Troy. Don't waste your time on this one, there are far too many much better historical fiction books to read. Try all of Beverly Swerling's work.

Flowery descriptions of every possibe venue,and adjectival overkill make this basically intriguing tale into a never ending bore. One tolerates pages of unnecessary prose in the hope of coninuing the central theme. I assume that the author is striving for a \\"big book\\". but achieves a fatally overwritten tome."},{"rating":"1","title":"A clumsy retelling of a gloriously epic tale","review":"A clumsy and incomplete retelling of an otherwise gloriously epic classic tale. George cannot decide what types of personalities her characters have -- is Paris vain and immature, clinging onto Helen, or is he strong and manly? Has only a few years elapsed since Helen left Sparta or was it 20? Is Helen committed to Paris and her new course or is she torn? Very difficult to build relationships or understand any of the characters -- none are endearing, even though one may be tempted to feel sorrow for the fate of Andromache and her young son at the end. Poorly written. George does not do her subject matter justice in this case."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautifully done...LOVED it!!","review":"I bought this book as an impulse cheapie with hardly any intent on reading it because I've never been intrigued by Greek mythology. It's one of those that I thought of as \\"last resort\\" if I get bored. I decided one day, after it lied on my nightstand for 2 months, to just go for it and read the first few pages. If I don't like it by then, I put it down. The problem is that I couldn't put it down!!! When I had to sleep, I was anxious to wake up and start reading again. I carried it everywhere I went. The book got in my head so much that I actually dreamt about it on many occasions...something I have never done before. I loved this book from start to finish.

I've come away from reading this book feeling that Cipe must have been charming and idiosyncratic, but I still don't feel I know much about her or her design philosophy. She comes across as almost disdainful of the work she is best known for, designing and art directing women's fashion magazines. It's also written a bit dryly with some confusing back-and-forth of events. Don't forget your magnifying glass; the examples of her design work are presented not much larger than thumbnails!

It was very unclear how to transfer maps from a PC to a Palm T3 SD Card. Other reviewers point out that you can't do address lookups on the PDA which limits the usefullness of this package.

It will not allow you to route from current GPS position to a point. And...when you try to map a shortest or quickest route, the system freezes after up to 5 minutes of \\"thinking\\" the computation. The software is only effective at routing for very short routes. Anything I tried over 10 miles would take at least 5 minutes to compute. And I'm using a newer HP Ipaq with plenty of memory. This software stinks.

Each album went out and did something different. However, with this album, if you can even call it that, it's like they went into the studio for 5 minutes, pushed some buttons and said \\"that sounds good enough\\". This album has got to be one of the laziest outings ever by CB. It doesn't even sound like them half the time, it's like some 10 year old made an album and they just put their name on it. I miss the days of Surrender where every song was awesome. With this album though, I can't stop thinking that even I could've made something better with my $100 midi keyboard. The tracks are about as minimal as you can get. Hopefully this isn't a sign of things to come. In any case, fan or not, I would suggest saving your money with this one. It's lazy, has sloppy production, and is just overall confused on what it is trying to convey."},{"rating":"2","title":"Yes, You Are the Night","review":"There are not so many bands in the musical panorama which, after releasing a singles' collection of a decade of existence, have made out 2 great new albums just after it.

I had high expectations for this release, I have always hear Chemical Brothers songs and to be honest none of them really grabbed me until 'Do It Again'. Being the loyal cd buyer that I am I bought this disk and found it to be rather lackluster, it doesnt flow very well and the tracks just seem kind of thrown together. Maybe I need to keep listening to it but all in all I am not impressed, I really hate writing negative reviews but I cant seem to find anymore then 3 SOLID songs on this disk.

This album is worse than I can really verbalize, so I won't try so hard (just like they didn't try with it). Go to youtube and check out the salmon dance. If you can watch that and tell me it sounds good to you, by all means get this, but I haven't found the hamster dance funny since the 90's and it is about as good. I am 100% positive that much of the support of this is just because it's by CB. If it was their first album, they'd never have gained any traction at all with it and for no other reason than that it is horrendously unenjoyable and amateurish."},{"rating":"1","title":"WTF","review":"Saturate was pretty good.

The one song I really like is the first song but after that it is just a lot of beeping noises.

This story reminded me of growing up on our farm and brought me back to my many adventures as a child, working with animals. I laughed and cried in every chapter. I simply couldn't wait to go to bed everynight so I could read more. It was like a Daniel Steele, only without the romance. It was so good, it's convinced me to train this summer to be a volunteer in Minnesota.

I have another pair of headphones with a curly cord that is a pain to untangle after they have been in a bag.The over the ear cup design is perfect to insulate people from outside sounds. They are adjustable for different head shapes and sizes. The sound quality is good (not excellent), but adequate for my needs.

The first pair lasted me around 8-9 months before the plastic on one side snapped at the adjustable joint. Using some tape I rigged them up to work a while longer, only to have the other side snap. My second pair lasted almost as long and broke in the exact same manner.

They cover your ears entirely, and don't become uncomfortable or cause you pain even after hours of use. For the price and the quality, I would recommend it for all of those who need headphones occasionally. For those who usually wear it a lot though, I'd recommend you to buy some more expensive headphones. These will not last long. They were my third pair of headphones in one year, and now I'm done with buying $50-less headphones. I treat them well and do nothing but keep them on my head all day. Still, they all tend to break around the same spot if you wear them too much: the regulator strap just breaks, and you get stuck with a one-sided broken headphone. That's why I'm not getting headphones with plastic straps anymore. If you have the choice, go with rubber, metal, whatever floats your boat and doesn't appear as breakable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works well","review":"I am not an expert in sound quality.

I wouldn't recommend these to anyone, I paid $20 for mine and honestly they aren't even worth that.

Marie Ursule's descendants, born of Bola and her lust for different men, dash off to disparate lives, which Brand describes in separate, always lyrical, chapters. Although Brand's repetitive use of certain phrases can wear thin, she shows a brilliant command of the emotional side of language. I would not recommend this book to casual readers because its emphasis on language and theme, and not plot, might disappoint them; however, this novel has much to offer serious and attentive readers."},{"rating":"2","title":"A necessary reference","review":"This book is a necessary addition for your bookshelf if you have an interest in novels about the Royal Navy. It details, chronologically, the Royal Navy ships lost between 1793 and 1900. Perhaps not surprisingly most ships were lost because of bad weather, poor navigation, or other misadventures (fires, mutiny, etc.). Besides the listing, there is a handy index by ship name which allows the reader an easy reference to a particular ship, and another index by geographic area. It is interesting to read, for example, of the fate of some of the ships captured at Trafalgar, some of which were recaptured shortly afterwards by the Spanish. I found that this book is a handy and interesting reference. It also provides brief details of the results of some of the court martials following the losses. The publishers printing job was not the best, as my copy has three blank pages where it should cover the years from 1890 to 1900, but that was a minor problem."},{"rating":"2","title":"Outstanding Philip Catherine with an outstanding BJO!","review":"Until now, I knew Philip Catherine mostly from playing his superb guitar music in a trio or quartet(from his albums and live concerts).

'A 'Got to have one ' for every jazz guitar lover!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Completely blown away!","review":"This is bound to become a classic or a masterpiece in the idiom of jazz. Philip is one of my guitar heroes and i was a little hesitant when i saw that this was with an orchestra as i prefer almost always band formations over orchestral ones. But there are exceptions, of course. And this is one of them. The arrangements are exquisite and very, very well executed. And the guitar playing is AMAZING even for Philip who is always just that. The Trumpet player is really good too, and his solos are memorable. All in all a great recording which will surely be at the top of my list of great jazz records of recent times!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Only for the WW 2 Junky","review":"This was a somewhat interesting book from a different point of view then we usually get in by American or English authors works. The details are interesting and not usually reported. I think the book could have benefited from either better editing or a straight chronological method in presenting the story. I also know that when books are translated you usually miss out on some of the more subtle points the author was trying to make and I find the writing is usual a bit more wooden as you have with this transcript. For me personally I would have liked more detail of when he was a soldier and less about the post war trip to France. It was probably the only politically correct way to publish the work, but I felt that it was experiences that did not help the book. If you read a lot on World War Two then this is an interesting view into the German solder. If you are a casual reader then I would look a little further."},{"rating":"2","title":"A favorite in our house","review":"Got this book as a gift when my son was born.

Vasconia, her Servant, and their relationship, She hates the way he never has an opinion of his own, but the truth is serving her with all his heart is the only way he feels he can show his love. Genesister are two Girl pilots that love each other and, they KNOW its considered Taboo to be in love and wish they were opposite sexes, but Luna spends most of the episode Anguishing over that problem. They don't actually have sex, so it can't really be called hentai. Finally team GodDinner becomes engaged, and invites Goh and Anna to the wedding If you bought the first 5 volumes for the crazy relationships than this is right up your alley. Even thou the story with Goh and Anna is in the background for now, there is still a lot of Giant Robot fighting, and you get to see their powers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Okay for Junior High School","review":"But not for an adult.

After the first few chapters I had trouble putting it down. Christy Barritt does such a great job of weaving an entertaining web of coincidences together that that the reader just has to keep turning the page to see what happens next. She also does a really great service addressing the very hidden issue of relationship abuse and how something like that can happen in even the best publicly appearing families.

Finally, the board itself actually has a laminate surface (front and back), with painted-sides. The quality is so poor, there is actually paint all around the edges of the board with brush strokes well into the laminate playing surface. Hang on, let me look at the box...Ahah! Well, the box I received DEFINITELY does not have the \\"SOLID WOOD CHECKERS & TIC TAC TOE\\" label like in the Amazon listing.

Also the checkers do NOT stack one over another when you get a king. The second checker on the top of a \\"king\\" will simply slide off.The unusual feature is the fact that they are black and light brown instead of the ususal black and red."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sent it back","review":"I got this for my mom as a gift because she wanted to play checkers.

More pictures should be shown. This basket fits well on the walker with only 1 cross bar. It might not fit on walkers with 2 cross bars. The basket is slanted, not straight up-and-down. So the bottom rear edge of the basket sticks backward into the area of the lower cross bar. Even more importantly, since the bottom rear edge sticks backward like that, the walker can no longer be folded flat.

It continues her tradition of sensuality mixed with human character flaws. My favorite part was the second half of the book, Dance Of Dreams. I read this in one night and couldn't put it down. It is one of those books I will read over and over. It tells of the struggles of one young ballerina who has great aspirations. She has tallent and grace and attitude. She also has the attention of her mentor and sometimes dance partner, Nickoli Davidov (Sorry if I spelled that wrong). He is an arogant, proud, yet wonderfull man who is carried over from the first story. Together they are a wonderfull team. Ms. Roberts not only created fufilling characters but she also gave us a seemingly realistic view of the Ballet World. It is a must read, something to cuddle up with on those rainy days when we want to be some one else."},{"rating":"1","title":"Reflections & Dreams Review","review":"I'm a big Nora Roberts fan, but this one disappointed me. Her characters didn't seem real. Perhaps because it was based on the world of Ballet, which is foreign to me, her characters seemed one-dimensional.

In any case, it won't deter me from trying one of her novels again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Price","review":"I have many watches of different price ranges and I found this one to be fairly priced for a great watch.Light weight and comfortable on the wrist.

It is a great house album, with some inspired vocals. Unfortunately, some of the vocalists tend to take away from the tracks, rather than add to them.

But does includes some pointers and info that anyone could learn from. The term Master in painting is used so loosely now days compared from when the term was coined and meant something so long ago. But to clarify, I am not downing the author, he is a great painter. Good book for any oil painters collection and or reference."},{"rating":"2","title":"I love this book","review":"Although not really a beginners book and without notes on mediums, pigments ect or a clear step by step. This still has to be one of the best instructional art books I own. David Leffel has to do the nicest, modern 'old master' still lifes of anyone I've seen and the book is worth it for the catalogue of his work alone. True, some of the prints are blurry and out of focus which is disappointing but I would still rate it as a must have for any realist artists bookshelf.This book, plus works by Thomas Buechner, Richard Schmid and Gregg Krutz (and a book put out by the Rijksmuseum on still life techniques) have to be the overall best and most helpful art instruction books available at the moment in my opinion for the realist painter.If you like realist still lifes then get it - it's worth it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible Image Quality","review":"I have to warn you that I was extremely disappointed in the printing quality of this book. Every image lacks any saturated color, the blacks look flat and gray removing any punch that may have existed in the original paintings, and most of all, they are blurry to such an extant that I feel ripped off. I can guarantee you that many of these image files didn't even meet the 300-dots-per-inch requirements of offset lithography. Yes, a publisher can print lower resolution images, but they will look exactly like the images in this book; awful, blurry, lacking punch and conveying abysmal quality. It's not a cheap book, but the printing is decidedly so."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Dissenting Review","review":"The previous reviewers have been so glowing in their evaluations of this book that I feel compelled to dissent. I returned my copy after a few days because it fell way short of my expectations. I was first struck by the very poor quality of the reproducions: many are blurry to the point of distraction. And despite the opinion of one reviewer, I would caution a beginner to stay away from this book. Rather than an instructional, it is a series of notes culled from classes given by \\"the master\\", and it reads that way. Admittedly, much of the information contained in this book is valuable. But it is much more a collection of bon mots on oil painting than a systemmatic guide. If you are expecting that, you may enjoy it as much as some of the other reviewers. (Just don't expect great reproductions)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as advertised","review":"I ordered this shirt for my 16 year old son.

I keep on moving my Melitta from one room to another without success.I do have a table clock that gets the correct time from Colorado (where the atomic clock is located) and it seems to be working fine so maybe there is something wrong with the coffee maker's clock.

The book delves nicely into the sources of deep ecology and its response to other perspectives on environmental issues. I found it a quick read (I read it at the gym, but then, I read Heidegger for fun) and well put together.It will not, however, make someone who is coming from a perspective far from deep ecology change their mind.

When the instrument is set up with specific voices and preferences, it will default (including volume) to the original start-up mode within a very short period of time, if there is an interval of no keyboard activity. This is annoying and not useful if the keyboard is being used in a professional setting.We chose to keep the product, as it's only being used for vocal rehearsals.

It suffers from the same problem most card game software does--it doesn't feel like playing with other people. On the \\"medium\\" level the AI shuffles the deck in the machine's favor as you improve. Unfortunately this has the affect of making you think it's stacking the deck instead of playing better. Also, the \\"help\\" is poorly written--if you don't already know the card game the help is confusing--just buy the Hoyle book or Bicycle book to learn a game you're not familiar with--it could do with tutorials and hints to help you improve your game."},{"rating":"1","title":"A waste of money","review":"Freecell solitaire is rubbish - legal moves are constantly disallowed.

Well written, concise, to the point, it makes pertinent reading and a useful text in historical terms, but also as a prescription for future US presidents"},{"rating":"2","title":"An Unexpected Pleasure","review":"Eyewitness to Power was an unexpected pleasure. I have watched Gergen as a pundit for years and thought that he, while articulate, was a little too milktoast for me. I picked up this book on a lark, and once I began to read it, never set it down.I have read countless business books on leadership in business. Most, if not all, paint the picture of the perfect unerring leader. Gergen, on the other hand, writes about what he observed - the strengths and the warts of those he served while in the White House. As a result, he has written what has become my favorite book on leadership.Leaders come in different shapes and sizes, with different skills and experiences. And Gergen shows how each of these Presidents used their unique skills and experience to lead. Some better than others.This is a book that should be a must read in all MBA programs as it tells the story of real leadership and not some fictional, unattainable ideal."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good read","review":"I disagree with the reviewers who are, apparently, too sophisticated to recognize insight, or else dismiss the book as \\"Beltway blather.\\" We regular folks are much less fussy. I do not have access to inside information so it's fun to read about the details from someone who does.I part company with Gergen only on the matter of the \\"fine, upstanding men\\" (Chapin, Krogh, et al) he describes in the Nixon Watergate White House. He makes them out as victims! He asserts that they never would have gotten into trouble if it had not been for the \\"atmosphere of intimidation\\" from the top. Sorry, Mr. Gergen. They went to jail not because of their dirty tricks in the White House but because of perjury. Perhaps, indeed, they thought that this is \\"the way the game is played\\" when it came to the dirty tricks. But by the time they were testifying in federal court, the games were over. These were well-educated adults. They most certainly knew what perjury was. No victims here; no sympathy either."},{"rating":"2","title":"Expected a bit more","review":"After watching David Gergen on various panels on CNN, I view him as a voice of wisdom, experience, and moderation. He leans quite a bit further to the right than I do, but this book is still a good read for insight into how our leaders function behind the scenes. He has definitely seen a lot of presidents in action. It's politically correct and measured in its criticism - I expected Mr. Gergen to be a bit more hard-hitting in his assessments. However, I still enjoyed it and learned a lot."},{"rating":"2","title":"A room with a view","review":"Too often for my tastes, knowledge about politics or officials - for most - comes in the form of media soundbites. My appreciation for material and experiences as described by Gergen is second to none, and we could certainly use more fair-minded and balanced assessments such as those he provided about the Nixon, Ford, Reagan, and Clinton administrations in which he served.Gergen succeeded in detailing the weaknesses and strengths of each president, the nuances of working with cabinet and staff towards implementing policy, and the sometimes harrowing walk between principle and what is \\"effective\\".Read it, and add to the wave of those who really care about how the world and nation's leaders get it done."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor packaging","review":"I really loved this platter and ordered for my first time cooking Thanksgiving dinner.

Set to an almost impossible task, Arilyn must discover whether she is willing to risk her soul as well as her life.

I'm glad the Germans didn't think of his idea of welding a rocket launcher onto the Sub to send Nebelwerfers flying inshore. It might have changed the history of Operation Drumbeat.The commandos he sent ashore to run sabotage missions reads like something out of a Hollywood Movie.I'm surprised that Hollywood has not made the book into a film or that the History Channel hasn't snap it up for one of its programs.

This is a wonderful book that reads more like a thriller than a naval history. I was hard pressed to put it down and only wish it could have gone on another 445 pages. As well as Admiral Fluckey's engaging prose, the book is full of photos of the Barb and her crewmembers, as well as charts of her various patrols and engagements. Fluckey's good humor and enthusiasm permeate every page, all the more remarkable when one considers he was well into his seventies when he wrote it...and the old fellow is still kickin'! I've learned that Thunder Below has been optioned by Stephen Spielberg. This is unquestionably the kind of book that can make the transition to the silver screen.

The author and the Barb's Captain, Eugene Fluckey may have written a somewhat self serving book, but it seems that he actually deserves credit for his superb job as skipper. He certainly deserves credit for writing an extremely entertaining book.

Fluckley was a foward thinking and agressive skipper yet at the same time he cared for the sailors under him.Fluckely writes so well even a lay person can understand what tactis he was using during many of his daring attacks including one on a harbor on the coast of China that left the Japanese military beliving that it had been anything but a lone submarine.A great read for any military history buff.Tom Cancy could not have come up with better fiction than the true story told in \\"Thunder Below\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"NAVAL HISTORY","review":"This type of history, written with this type of in depth knowledge, is always of interest to a wide range of audience.

After ensuring a reasonable, historically based explanation is used to justify the on-going existence of the Roman Empire, the author bases the story on a 'magical', psychic ability called 'massing.' WHY? There are so many possibilities for conflict and interaction, yet 'massing' becomes a critical part of the storyline. Really detracted from the quality and was largely pointless anyway.

Instead, I was bombarded with a barage of misleading evidence and a plot development that had the makings of a high schooler. The characters power struggles usually ended up with either a fist-fight, or an unended conflict that resulted no where. These characters learned nothing from their mistakes, and continued to perform as a 5 year old when scolded. It seemed that Card wants to carry these small conflicts into each novel to bring familiarity, but all it brings is a sense of immaturity from even the God-like being. All in all, this book is hardly worth the $5.95."},{"rating":"2","title":"Overtones of the Oversoul","review":"This is the first OSC book that I ever read.

I applaud Card for being able to mold such vast and unwieldy ideas into a coherent and interesting story.Although I'm not mormon, or of the LDS persuasion, the parallels with the Book of Mormon are easy to see but do not in anyway affect the experience of the book, either for good or bad, in my opinion.Read the book, you'll like it."},{"rating":"2","title":"The main character seems more real to me than even Ender.","review":"I loved this book.

I read the entire series within a few months and could not put them down. Not only are his concepts original in-so-far as his creativity but his inner meanings challenge modern day concepts and reveal some that most wouldn't even consider. The focus on youth ESP in a fashion similar to Ender's Game is very prevelant throughout the entire series. The concept is very engaging and stimulates the imagination. Card does a superb job of bringing to light other issues like homosexuality, racism, and sexism throughout all of his books in the Homecoming Series.

I you want to read the real story, and be uplifted at the same time read the Book of Mormon. Yes, I am a member of the LDS church, and it is wrong to make money by exploiting your church. Yes we have a church book store. I hold that in the same opinion that I hold his book. If you want good literature read Robert Jordan,Terry Brooks, Terry Goodkind or R.A. Salvatore."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor story. Poor editing.","review":"This is not Orson Scott Card's best work. The focus of the book is on the children in the story and is so similar to his other books that you could easily search and replace names of characters. There are frequent typographical errors and it generally lacks polish. Indeed, the review on the jacket isn't even for this book, rather it is for 'Xenocide'. The story line plods along and you could easily skip entire chapters without noticing. Towards the end of the book it becomes obvious that this was an introduction to a series rather than something that would stand on its own. I'm saddened to write a bad review of an author I am otherwise impressed with."},{"rating":"2","title":"Full bodied and interesting.","review":"Intriguing. You're kept interested throughout, though in hindsight this entire series isn't really that awe-inspiring when you come down to it. Read it for entertainment. If you want something important and deep by Card, try Ender's Game, though I'm sure if you're reading this, you probably already have."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliant, but quite far from his best.","review":"OK so the plot goes almost exactly nowhere but hey this is the STARTING BLOCK!!!!! This is the setting up of a five part series this is the preperation. Though sometimes it might seem like an over inflated synopsis, it does not stop it from being brilliant!!! Mainly because of the charecters being so well fleshed out- Nafai's brothers Meb and Elemak are so ANNOYINGLY CRUEL, but they're meant to be.... and the story is really quite clever and complex and all with lots of little sub-plots and hidden motives and emotions. BRILLIANT!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Enlightening","review":"Though the book is based on the Book of Mormon's characters and their lives, there are several other fictional characters added in, and their situation is clearly different, even their religion is different. If anything, Card gives greater religious insight than the Book of Mormon or the Bible to the possibility of communication between God and man and the meaning of life in general. If you have ever prayed and wondered if there is a God out there and if he or she heard you, then this book is worth reading, regardless of your religious beliefs."},{"rating":"2","title":"From a Mormon perspective, an interesting idea","review":"Having read the Book of Mormon and being a member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints, I found this book to be interesting. To LDS readers, the similarities to the stories of Nephi in the first few chapters of Book of Mormon will be obvious. Predictable story for LDS readers, but thought provoking."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Good Seminary Teaching Tool","review":"I thought that this was a great book with a good storyline. I'd recommend this book to anyone who like sf. If you're a Mormon, though, you may find the plot a little predictable. I thought that Nephi (pardon me, Nafai) could have been less of a wimp. In the original version (and I mean ORIGINAL version) I didn't see him as being so obsessed with 'being a man'. It is a good story, and with a few modifications, it might be fit to write in gold!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice concept, rather dissapointing execution..","review":"After reading Ender's Game, Speaker for the Dead, and the worthing saga I was looking forward more Card novels... This one looked like it would be good, epic scale, cool computer, building of civalization, -- all the elements that worked so well in the other books i've read. But they don't work here. It not long before this book becomes a shapeless mess. I could say this and this and this is wrong with it but it wouldn't accomplish much. Nevermind, there are very good card books: The first two in the ENDER series and the ingenious WORTHING SAGA... so look at those first you should be very happy with them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pathetic Retelling of the Book of Mormon","review":"Having read the Book of Mormon, I was surprised that this had series had received any praise at all, and I am even more surprised by the reviews that state how \\"original\\" this story is. Card's retelling of the Book of Mormon in this series is pathetic - the story is lifted almost directly from the Book of Nephi in the Book of Mormon, the science fiction twist on this Book of Mormon story comes across as pedestrian, the writing is drawn out and exacerbating for most of the book, and the character development is just sad.If you want a better telling of this story then read the Book of Mormon.If you are not interested in reading the Book of Mormon then I suggest you stay away from Mr. Card pathetic Memory of Earth series."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very slow book that didn't make me care to read the sequels.","review":"This was the first book by Card I've read and considering how popular he is, I was disappointed. Even though I'm non-religious, I really didn't mind the religious parallels that some other reviewers mentioned, because I thought they were handled in a good and believable way. But I was disappointed with the story itself. It starts out very slow and never really takes off until the last couple of chapters. And then it leaves you with an ending that just sets the stage for the sequels. This wouldn't be a problem if \\"Memory of Earth\\" itself was an entertaining book that made you want to read the sequels, but it didn't make me want to do that. For the most part of the book, I wanted it to end so I could start reading something else.I wouldn't recommend \\"Memory of Earth\\" and it didn't really make me feel like reading any more Card. But who knows, I may give Ender's Game a chance since people say that's his best."},{"rating":"1","title":"wait a minute....","review":"I picked up this book with enthusiasm as I found it soon afterreading Ender's Game. I found it somewhat disappointing, sadly.It just didn't engage the reader like Ender's Game did. It alsoseemed mildly familiar.. as did the names. Then it occurred tome that this wasn't Card's story really.. it was a sci-fi'dversion of parts of the Book of Morman! Names were lifted, etc.(I'd read parts of the Book of Morman while being 'recruited'at one point by this cute Morman lass.. but that's another story!)Anyway, while the story is somewhat interesting, I wasdisappointed by the fact that it seemed that Card probably spenta lot of his time and energy trying to make a good story froma weak one. It doesn't quite come off."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't be put off! Keep reading the rest of the series.","review":"I'm a big Card fan but Memory is a bit of a dissapointment.

Within each chapter, each lesion is presented with key features listed in a bullet list on one side, with the text opposite the list. The images are at the end of each chapter (the only drawback of the book, as far as I can see), and are of superb quality, all in full color. Some of the chapters also contain decision trees for classification of lesions, to aid in the differential diagnosis. All in all, I have found this book extremely useful in my busy practice."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is not a standard USB adaptor","review":"When this product was delivered I discovered it has something that looks like a USB connector, but it is not a standard USB connector.

This book was o.k. to read before the trip to familiarize yourself with the park, but was useless as a reference guide once we were there. We basically gave up on it and used our Frommers Guide to the Western National Parks. The index is incomplete, the maps are cartoonish and difficult to read, and some of the explanations in the question-answer format with\\"ranger Norm\\" made me feel as if they were questioning my intelligence.

However, I found it to be rather uninteresting. I've known and lived with the kinds of people Ms. Powers describes, and their self-righteousness at living \\"outside\\" the mainstream gets tiring very, very quickly. I was hoping for a good bit more cultural criticism, what one gets is a series of vignettes about Ms. Powers experiences. It is well written, and I bet Ms. Powers would be a great person to hang out and have a few drinks with, but I declare myself disappointed with her book."},{"rating":"2","title":"I was there, man.","review":"Well written, insightful, entertaining.

Keep Looking.....","review":"Tom Wolfe she's not. She may be in love with her subject, but that doesn't save this book from reading like a masters thesis where you're allowed to quote your friends as sources. The points that she makes (bohemians need substitute families, bohemians like drugs, bohemians like old clothes) do not bear the lengths that she goes to make them. The scenes that she cites were over fifteen years ago; during her record store days they were just switching from vinyl to CDs. If you're looking for what constitutes bohemia now in America I would wave you off this book. If you're looking for a fun read about \\"bohemia,\\" I would do likewise. She tries to lighten the going with the occasional witty description, but these don't help a wild subject marry a wooden, pseudo-scholarly style. You have to wonder, in those groovy San Francisco group-pads she invokes, what she was reading..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Please don't waste your time....","review":"More than a year has passed since I bought and read this book, and while I truly dislike spreading negativity, I feel compelled to warn others tempted to spend their time and money on this depressing memoir. The book is mistitled; the author and her feather of friends are neither 'weird' or 'bohemian'. Re-titling this book 'Ennui: My Self-Absorbed America' would properly describe the story told within.Honestly - from a woman who cherishes my thousands of books...I could not allow this blot on my shelves, or in good conscience donate it...I threw it away."},{"rating":"1","title":"Who the hell says \\"Bohemian\\" anymore?","review":"Former New York Times writer Ann Powers' memoirs are a clutsy, misinformed attempt at defining a generation best known for its piercings.

NOT! Largely autobiographical, and including many mundane details of the lives of her boring friends, the book gives no sense of her growth as a person, a serious weakness in personal anecdotal material. Ms. Powers also lacks a sense of history, or the logical facility to come to conclusions based on facts and comparisons. Everything simply IS. The only rule seems to be that Nothing, and no one, is subject to any kind of judgement. Oh, I've thought of a second rule that has been applied - different is rule 1. Anything \\"same\\" is uncool. How boring."},{"rating":"1","title":"oh so pretentious","review":"i snored through this one.

If you have ever worked retail, especially music, books, or movies, turn immediately to the chapter on the Cultured Proletariat. If you say you've never participated in this rebellious shadow economy, then I say you're a liar. Read it and recognize yourself, but don't laugh out loud...your boss might be watching. Also, Mr. and Mizz Bohemia out there, relax. Don't be so critical when someone actually offers an autobiographical glimpse into those more wild times of thier lives. Many of the past reviewers are not able to see past the one crime Powers committed: she got on with her life and is able to look back and examine the temporal context in which she lived...."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome for keeping away mice","review":"Let me tell you. This stuff really works as a mouse deterrent. I live in a townhouse in Brooklyn so pretty much you are only as clean as your neighbors and critters travel easily between buildings and floors.

After some good old fashioned Googling I read about this peppermint oil stuff.All I did was dab some cotton balls with the oil and stuff them into crevices in the ceiling.

The bottle of peppermint oil with a few drops leaked out of it was in the same cupboard. GUESS WHAT I FOUND THE NEXT MORNING: a mouse turd, right next to the bottle of peppermint oil. I'm not joking.

Freshened them up each week AND after cooking. In short, I used this entire bottle in 2 weeks. YET, I saw 2 mice devils in these 2 weeks. Also, let me add we do not keep trash in our apt, and wash dishes as soon as we use them. SO this does not work. I guess I am going to become a creepy cat lady now...and hope that helps."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didnt quite work for me!","review":"I bought this in hopes of detering nasty mice.

We had a problem with mice in our new house, so we purchased this along with some plug in electronic pest control devices to keep the mice away. Of course, we started using both at once, so I have no idea if it's this or the electronic device that's keeping them away. But either way, we put this on cotton balls and put it into our cabinets and areas where we were frequently seeing mice. We have not had problems anymore. This would also work as a nice air freshener. Even if it's not keeping the mice away, it smells very nice!"},{"rating":"2","title":"treatment fo mice","review":"I read somewhere on the internet that 1oz of peppermint oil mixed with 1 liter of water can be safely sprayed around the house to discourage mice from living and nesting.

Better than mouse traps and smells nice too. I would be interested if it works for other people too. Cheap enough also."},{"rating":"1","title":"I must have tough mice...","review":"I tried the peppermint oil trick on my kitchen counters and the next morning found a mouse turd right on top of the cotton pad soaked with the oil.

The peppermint smell is overwhelmed by a foul nasty odor. The product is nothing like the (german) peppermint oil I used in the past. It is either contaminated or the result of a nasty chemical extraction instead of steam extraction. If this product was FDA regulated it would be recalled and pulled off the shelves. Totally useless (except maybe for repelling mice, if that works at all) and potentially toxic.Thanks to the other 1* reviewers I ordered only a small bottle and minimized my losses.Maybe this is just a bad batch (other reviewers obviously love the product) but I am not going to try my luck a second time with this manufacturer.Looking for other suppliers........"},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't last","review":"After reading other reviews, I was hopeful this product would help keep field mice at bay.

Great all natural method especially if you have animals."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great value!","review":"I bought this peppermint oil because I read online that it would deter mice. The label says that this oil is not intended for ingestion, so I am only using it for external purposes. I soaked some cotton balls and placed them around the house and in cracks/holes in the walls where I heard the mice. I haven't heard them since the first night I used the oil! Hopefully they're gone for good. This oil is also nice for tension headaches and muscle aches... I dab a little on my fingers and massage it into my temples or shoulders.

Lined the areas with wire mesh, maintenence filled holes in kitchen and still coming in. Used this and have seen/caught way more mice than before the application.

Blending the old with the new is nice, however you end up with some \\"gaps\\". These allow the woodland creatures free range for getting into the house! Traps worked, but catching them one at a time and resetting the traps was too much. Then I read about the peppermint oil. I soaked some cotton rounds and place them in and around the kitchen draws and pantry. At first the smell is very strong but pleasant. It wears off in a few days and I think the mice get used to it. I worked for a while, but you have to continually resoak the cotton. After the smell was gone, the mice were back. Eventually, I gave up and used decon. I hate to do that, but so far the mice are definately gone! I would suggest to use the peppermint first. It does work, but I guess it depends on how many rodents you have to chase away! Good luck."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rodents Be GONE!","review":"Ok, I had heardpeppermint oil was good for rodents, but was skeptical.

Every year we put out poison and inevitably one will end it's life in our attic or wall....horrible, horrible smell!I had noticed \\"them\\" scurrying around in the attic again this year and had my guys pour some of this peppermint oil on cotton balls and toss around everywhere...attic, perimeter of house, outbuildings etc. Absolutely amazing, critters left and so far haven't returned (3 weeks now).

It takes less time to get it out, chop what I want, rinse it and put it in the dishwasher than it does to hand-chop anything. I can't believe it took me so long to buy it.

There are still some issues that need to be resolved. I guess if you were brought up in a Christian home and overly protective, you would fall for the context.

It reads, at times, like a high school or college research paper, loaded with personal opinion from the author when it is facts I was seeking. Constant references comparing Grant to Napolean, Ike, FDR, and various 20th century leaders is annoying. I noticed two \\"between the lines\\" references comparing the current US president disfavorably with Grant. One example of the references that drove me crazy;(page 121) \\"The line the Clinton people threw at George Bush pere in the 1992 election campaign might have been aimed with equal effect at Grant: \\"It's the economy, stupid.\\"\\" George Bush \\"pere\\"? Good thing I had high school french.The only redeeming quality is that the book is short, and if you wanted a quick read on President Grant this is the one. However, be prepared to experience a book chock full of cute and annoying associations."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a best choice bio","review":"This is a pop biography not up to basic historical standards. It is a quick overview with as much attention to suggested modern parallels (often in movies) as to the historical situation of the topic. The authoer often makes sweeping generalizations which are unsubstantiated (even countered by some historians). From reading other Grant bios one can see places where Korda simply misses some things.The book is nicely written and engaging. It will provde you a brief overview of Grant, but don't take it as authoritative."},{"rating":"1","title":"Needed a better proofreader","review":"I lost interest in the book, and thought it lost all credibility, when three times on one page (p.62) the book referred to a General McClennan, instead of McClellan. Inexcusable for a major publisher."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good book of comparisons","review":"This book was basically an examination of the modern views to Grant with a great amount of comparisons to Napoleon, Walpole, Montgomery and Ike. This should have been titled \\"Famous Generals of WWII with Historical American Connections.\\" Mr. Korda is a native of the UK and uses his knowledge of its history to always let the heroes in Europe, and his past biographical subjects (Monty and Ike) appear on every other page (Literally, EVERY OTHER PAGE). There was one part in particular that was supposed to describe Grant's appearance but instead talked of Monty's \\"unassuming beret\\" and Ike's \\"jacket\\" and Churchill's(another major character in this book) \\"unflapibilty.\\" Enjoy it if you like historical parrallels to Grant and a host of European notables. It was a waste of a Christmas gift."},{"rating":"1","title":"Recommendations","review":"These amazon reviews have done their job, in convincing me not to bother reading this book.

This is the worst book I have ever spent money on, in terms of animal training. It will do far more damage than good. Their suggestions are ridiculous, especially when they are based on the assumption that your pet thinks like a human. People will expect their pets to respond to these training methods and when they don't? The publisher should have checked the facts before letting this one go.

You wouldn't mind if they backed up these points with research, data, and solid arguments, but instead all you get is completely unsubstantiated claims, assertions, and the occasional letter of testimony from a supposed customer.

This book, rife with spelling, punctuation and grammatical errors, is the perfect example of an author having just enough knowledge to be dangerous.

In my opinion, as a veterinary hospital practice manager who works with doctors specializing in canine and feline behavior, the only words for the techniques provided here are \\"laughably wrong.\\" In fact, many of the techniques are guaranteed to reinforce behavior exactly opposite of that the owner is trying to achieve.This book will certainly appeal to those who already have a deep distrust of behavioral experts and veterinarians--simply because its recommendations are the antithesis of proper training and nutrition.

I wish I would have looked up reviews on this product before I purchased it. We have gone through 2 machines in 3 months. First machine leaked from the handle and the spout, we even had problems getting the coffee to come out as the spout handle had a mind of its own. The second machine was fine for a while, then the handle started leaking as coffee brewed and the last straw was when the glass knob blew up as the coffee was perculating. What a mess. It is obvious that there is no QC at the factory. Walk away from this one, it is an accident waiting for a place to happen.

The red/green lights on the front make it VERY clear when the coffee is ready to be poured, and I get rave reviews from those who have tasted the coffee (and smelled it while it brewed!). Just remember to use coffee especially ground for percolators, as the other grinds tend to be too fine and will leak into the coffee!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Perculating problems with Melita coffee urn","review":"We've had our Melita urn for a couple of years. It has worked fine until recently. It does not send the water high enough up the tube to perculate and drip water over the coffee grounds. The unit is beyond warranty. Very disappointing. A waste of money for a product we thought was made by a reputable company with a good, reliable line of products. I wish we could get a refund. Next urn will not be a Melita.

I got the sense that the Chinese authors are begging to be taken so seriously that they fill the stories with big words strung together to the point that they end up incomprehensible.How does a sky secrete anything?

It does have one spectacular car chase or rather motorcycle pursuit on winding roads of south of France. There are some nice perforamnces and it's fun to see James Mason play a villain although he's a likable one. Liv Ullman is fine and Jill Ireland plays a hilarious rich hippie chick.There are the usual plot absurdities but Bronson is the reason we watch these movies and he's no different here. He's a very likeable tough guy trying very hard to be nice around bunch of incorrigable villains.The main concern here though is the resolution quality. It looks like they transfered a video quality image. On a high def flat panel it looks aweful, but you can still enjoy the film. I wish they would remaster but I guess that's why the price is cheap.

I wouldn't say that the Wusthof Le Cordon Bleu 8-Inch Cooks Chef Knife changed my life, but it changed how I viewed cooking!I have had this knife for several months now. It is still as sharp as when I first got it. I even took it out into the elements at a family cookout, and it is back in my kitchen good as new. To say that I love this knife is not an understatement.Now, I will say that I baby it quite a bit. I hand wash it and dry it after every use. I also store it in its original box.

I didn't have any sort of expectation for Wusthof but now I understand how much more high quality this is.The most surprising thing was that there is no pitting whatsoever!

One barrier to the enjoyment of this in the US has been the price, which this grill provides a very good inexpensive grill that is good for parties or large families."},{"rating":"2","title":"RACLETTE RULES!","review":"First tried raclette 7 years ago while I was studying abroad in Dijon, France (home of \\"Le Savoyard\\", the world's best raclette & fondue restaurant!). Been obsessed with the cheese ever since! When I returned to the States I had to get a machine for myself. Absolutely love my grill from T-Fal. I bought an earlier version about 5 years ago. It's perfect for enjoying raclette at home. Does what it needs to do....melts the raclette cheese! And everyone gets their own little tray. Non-stick grill and trays make for super-duper easy clean-up. If you love raclette....GET THIS GRILL!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good raclette","review":"I bought this raclette a couple of months ago. It is very easy to clean (you can put most parts in the dishwasher). The only thing that I overlooked when I bought this item is the fact that you cannot control the heat (only on/off). That does bother me at times. Other than that it is very good price/quality."},{"rating":"1","title":"Zeiss = not always great","review":"I thought this would be my \\"be all end all\\" monocular, and it seemed to have a lot going for it; light weight, nice objective size, alleged Zeiss quality, etc., but what a disappointment. The optics are not great. Chromatic abberations are reasonably well corrected, but the image suffers from softness at the edge of the field and is not terribly impressive. IMHO, it is nowhere near what I would expect from Zeiss. Admittedly, I am a bit of an optics freak, but this means that I have a good basis for comparison (Nikon, Tele Vue, Leica). I ended up selling this monocular to a backpacker, and I hope he is enjoying it, but for me this thing just didn't cut it, and I would imagine anyone else with a discriminating eye would feel the same way."},{"rating":"2","title":"Baby Looney Tunes DVD","review":"We have gotton alot of happy hours watching this DVD.

Bauer explains that most third world problems have causes which have nothing to do with the west. Furthermore, efforts to distribute foreign aid are often counterproductive and harmful. Bauer also discusses the causes of national wealth or poverty. In one of my favorite essays he explores the reasons for Hong Kong's success, being it has no raw materials and is one of the world's most \\"overpopulated\\" areas. Bauer argues the answer lies in a combination of its free market policies, as well as the motivation, aptitudes, and social mores of the people. The book is also worth it for the excellent essay on the non-problem of overpopulation. The book was great, however, what a boring title! Not exactly an attention grabber for all the exciting ideas in the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Unqualifiedly, the best introduction to liberation theology.","review":"In the 25 years I have taught liberation theology I have used many books. This is both the most digestible and the most faithful introduction to what at root is a movement of theological and scriptural reflection among the poor of Latin America. Mev Puleo's carefully selected set of interviews and first-person narratives of Brazilian churchworkers, ministers and scholars gives the lie to most of the ill-informed criticisms of liberation theology as \\"Marxist\\" or \\"played-out,\\" and shows both the intelligence and the compassion of those who have fought their way out of oppression and into liberation through listening carefully to the words of scripture and the voices of their own consciences. Their words challenge and prick our consciences too. Fifteen years old, the book is as fresh as ever."},{"rating":"1","title":"Outdated","review":"There are new helper functions in the D3DX library that eliminates parsing X files manually. Parsing X files is not really related to the book's topic, and yet you are forced to learn it because it's used throughout the book. Even worse is the fact that the code for parsing X files, which the book's examples are tightly coupled with, are no longer working with the newer releases of the DX9 SDK. So unless you go back to an older SDK release, none of the book's samples will compile. Even if you do use an older SDK, you will be wasting time learning functions and interfaces that have been deprecated. Bottom Line: The book's is very implementation orientated and the code are outdated, therefore it's best to stay away from this book to avoid frustrations."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice to start whit animation","review":"I buy this book because I can not find another book whit animation on direct x, but you need install the direct x sdk 9 to run the examples, and a good video card, if you not, show you many error of memory, in some cases this book are helpfully if you not have any idea how to made an animation or cloth simulation, I recommend this book for a start into direct animation, the book only help you to take a path to start into game develop, because are very hard to find a book how to show you made animations, there is many things and ideas you can save from this book to use like a guide for a start."},{"rating":"1","title":"My thoughts on this book.","review":"Advanced Animation with DirectX is not a good book at all. The author did a terrible job on the skinned animation parts and the later parts of the book is just plain bad. The beginning was ok but the code was not right. I tried to implement some of the stuff at the beginning and it didn't work. When I sat down and thought about the problem at hand and how to do it, I got everything working smoothly without using anything that was done is the book (which means the book was a waste of money). Who ever gave this book 5 out of 5 stars must be the author or a friend."},{"rating":"1","title":"Try to be more realistic will ya?","review":"This video was okay if you've never picked up a pair of chucks in your life. But for someone like me who practices consistently, it was very boring. Most of the techniques were take downs and traps. I consider techniques like that a waste of time for the nunchakus. Maybe some of you will like this video because of that but I feel that if the chucks are spinning constantly they are more effective. Another thing about the techniques used was that they were not very realistic for street self defence.

It is small, almost pocket-sized. The scale is easy to use and accurate. I also love that it has settings for grams, carats, and a couple others I do not use. The display is easy to read and the blue lighting of the display will shut off to help extend the battery life. It also comes with the calibration weight and a little pouch for storage. You may not see it in the picture, but there is a small tray that comes with this also. This makes it much easier for weighing out small gemstones. This scale does not come with the two AAA batteries necessary. So far I have found absolutely nothing amiss with this scale and highly recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible Scale","review":"This scale is very temperamental.

I love National Geographic. I did not love this documentary. It is not up to the standards of either GCT or NG. Although the cinematography was wonderful, the writing was terrible. Transitions were abrupt and nonsensical. The attempt to combine a chronological structure with a topical one, made the end result choppy. The reuse and over use of the same footage got to be annoying. I thought I was going to get an inside view, and although there was some behind the scenes footage, it wasn't enough to justify the title. It would have been better to have stuck with a true behnd the scenes look at the current Grand Central, and forget the history. Or, conversely, give the history and forget the behind the scenes. And hire a better writer!"},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"Inside Grand Central\\"","review":"What a fascinating video - so well-prepared and well-documented! An inviting look into building this American monument; the conflicts that nearly prevented it from being raised; the history of the materials, labor, energy and time consumed in the proces; the design of the entire area that houses Grand Central - a complex layout of paths and tracks underground used by so very many trains and passengers daily; the levels of the station that contain businesses and other attractions for visitors to the station; the SECRETS of the station, hidden for its most famous first visitor, but known to the people who work every day at Grand Central. Every moment of the video was interesting to watch - I highly recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rent this, don't buy it.","review":"Even better: rent something else.This documentary suffered from a lack of a script editor and a video editor. If you're over 30, you'll find the nonstop MTV style swooping camera movement nauseating. Suitable for a documentary on rollercoasters, not on a building.The same phrases are repeated too many times and should have been cut. They should at least be consistent. You will lose count of how many times they tell you how many people a day pass through the station. And the number they tell you keeps changing. Cmon.I found very little substance and at least 30 minutes of useless and repetitive fluff in this documentary. Very disappointing."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great little resource!","review":"I read the first 100 pages of the 256 pages in this book immediately after receiving it. I took a breath and read the rest the next day. What a handy reference to keep right beside my computer. With tons of basic information, the layout and graphics of this small fat volume make it very easy and enjoyable to read. Not only is basic astronomy covered here, but also space science including the brand new International Space Station. It has very convenient star charts and informative appendices. I recommend this for anyone of any age who wants to understand the basics of astronomy and space science."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ordered 2 ten packs, tried 3 different chargers, only 4 batteries worked","review":"I had heard some good things about Lenmar nimh batteries about two years ago - but had bought another brand. This time around, with the good price on Amazon, I gave these Lenmar batteries a try. I ordered two ten-packs. Only 4 out of 20 batteries would accept a charge. I tried an Energizer charger, a LaCrosse BC-900 charger, and a RipVan100 Lightning Pack 4000N charger. The LaCrosse is a high-end charger, including diagnostics on batteries (voltage, etc., displayed for each battery). None of these would charge 16 of the batteries - even in the 'recovery' modes available on the RipVan and LaCrosse. Returned the batteries to Amazon."},{"rating":"1","title":"This should be sold as 600mAh","review":"Bought these on 6/6/7.Right out of the box these Lenmar 1000mAh could be charged hardly to 600mAh.

The sound and video quality are extremely poor and very cheesy. It is obviously home-made by someone who didn't care what they were producing - Manson would never release this trash. Once you open the package, you notice that this DVD is part of a series of \\"Greatest Hits\\" of dozens of artists.

At first I was only mildly disapointed, as it was (very) low quality video of early Manson, and Spooky Kids. As I watched on my jaw hit the floor as \\"Godeatgod\\" started to play, a rediculous CGI/ real pictures of space, stars, and the cosmos accompanied it. I watched through the rest of the DVD, and found that this was by far the worst purchase i had made in at least a year. Overall, this DVD is of the poorest quality, in audio, video, and editing, and does a terrible job representing Marilyn Manson the band, and the shock rocker/genius front man by the same name.

Since the design lacks a brush at the tip, I found that the tiny pieces of fluff are not easy to pick up. However it is still does its job pretty well.The lack of a brush at the tip is both a pro and a con, since debris does not accumulate at the opening, like hair etc...

The maps are good and the advice on beaches was helpful. This is a book that you can take onshore with you in your backpack. It serves as a good intro, but of course you'll have to find other sources for more in-depth coverage of culture and history. What I found to be a huge surprise on my cruise was that almost all of the excursions that were offered by the ship were available as you got off the dock from private suppliers for a good 30% off the cruise price. The risk is very small and after a few ports almost everyone that I talked to went on their own privately arranged tours instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good for quick reference.

Everything from the history of the unit, the training they go through, the weapons and equipment they use, to the missions that they train for. This book combines all the information anyone would want to know, along with great photos, to produce a classic text on one of the United States' most elite military units."},{"rating":"1","title":"Misleading at best","review":"This book may be titled Marine Force Recon, but it spends very little time talking about what it's like to be a Force Recon Marine. The selection process and training only receive bare-bones detail; the majority of the book is spent discussing the Marine Expeditionary Unit and its variants, as well as the equipment used by the Marines. As such, it reads more like a Cliff's Notes version of Tom Clancy's Marine rather than an in-depth guide to Force Recon.It would be nice if there was a book written about Force Recon selection and training that was on the same level as Dick Couch's \\"The Warrior Elite\\", which focuses on Navy SEALs. Given the fact that most people don't even know that Force Recon exists, however, makes such a book unlikely. Anyone who wants to learn more about this unit has really no other option other than to read Bruce Norton's \\"Force Recon Diary.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"a discovery yes","review":"A discovery yes.

Although the 2X extender renders the A/F function useless on many Canon cameras, I found this to be a Very small drawback overall ( I prefer to manually focus under many of my shooting conditions). This extender is more suited for a low f/number lens due to the 2-stop change in brightness, but it is still VERY effective with my f/4 in normal lighting.

This is a testament to all mankind how horrible things can get when evil tyranny is allowed to go unchecked, when a group is singled out as a target by a society in economic turmoil. Both Death Mills and Nazi Concentration camps so raw, unvarnished footage, the start scenes of the mass graves, the piles of shrunken corpses, the gas chambers. If difficult, it is also spellbinding in a very dark way, not unlike rubbernecking at a bad auto accident. It is a fascinating topic, how not very long ago a major industrial modern European country could revert so completely to the most barbaric crimes on such a large scale. Yet these films, as disturbing as they are, only hint at the unimaginable suffering and horror of millions.

America is neither an empire nor ambiguous, and the current \\"international order\\" or \\"community of nations\\" they are talking about isn't the nation created by the Founders. Englishmen like John Winthrop founded America on the purely Deutoronomist basis of creating in a new land a Christian republic.

For young children something negative may be portrayed as a \\"lesson\\" to learn but in seeing that behavior in the first place a toddler-age child will emulate it so I don't want my kid seeing examples of evil and in this case in this film, potentially murderous (the fire) behavior AT ALL.

The CD delivers a variety of styles that make it exciting to listen to. You can hear \\"simple\\" blues arrangements as well as jazzflavoured songs like \\"The Kids From Glen Burnie\\" and even some funk (\\"Ms. Jeneration Hip Zone\\"). Cathy Jean's vocals are worth listening to, the backing band is professional with a good handling of their instuments. Furthermore, Cathy Jean seems to have some Austrian experience, according to the song \\"Austria\\" (even if this song sounds a little bit oriental). If you like good blues ballads, Cathy Jean delivers the right stuff for your CD player. --Frank Richter, CONCERTO Magazine, Vienna, Austria"},{"rating":"2","title":"Yes!","review":"Her CD \\"Marshall Road Apocalypse\\" is absolutely WONDERFUL!!! Goodness, I surely relate to her lyrics!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Touching, inspiring and just beautiful","review":"After thoroughly enjoying the book, I couldn't wait to see the movie. The movie was just as good, if not better, than the book. The character of Joshua was a great example of what Christ might be like if he were alive today. The movie had a simple message and a simple story line. Those hoping for the action of a Star Wars or Matrix will be disappointed. Those looking for an enjoyable movie that will leave you with the warm feeling of God's love inside will love it. Catholics, Protestants, and other Christian faiths should all enjoy it."},{"rating":"2","title":"We loved it!","review":"We had never read the book, let alone heard of Epiphany Films when my wife brought home Joshua from the video store. As a Christian, I am always a little skeptical of Christian films - too many seem under-funded and over-acted. We were pleasantly surprised, however, as we found Joshua to be creative, light, and intriguing. In short, we loved it! After inviting friends to a second showing, we found the response to be overwhelmingly enthusiastic. The film was showed in two parts, and one couple went and rented the film in the meantime because they couldn't stand the suspense! The beginning seems subdued, like Little House on the Prairie, but soon moves into a new realm that is both fresh and inspiring. It left us feeling great, although we did feel we had to forgive a basic theological premise which suggests Jesus might show up on the streets of hometown USA today."},{"rating":"2","title":"Joshua","review":"The catholic religion has gotten caught up in its own superiority. I don't think Jesus meant for Faith to be based on guilt or how much you're forced to donate to the church to keep your children in catholic school. Joshua is a refreshing look at faith. The movie is certainly not biblically accurate, but that's not what I'm looking for. This movie helped me to understand that faith does not have to be full of guilt to be genuine. I do not need to fear God to have faith in Him. I can love God as myself and He will accept me and love me back. That is the message in this movie. Jesus preached love and this movie reflects that. Don't compare the movie to the book, and don't look for biblical accuracy...just enjoy it for what it is."},{"rating":"2","title":"JOSHUA","review":"Excellent modern-day portrayal of Jesus Christ to this day and age. We were spellbound to see what was going to happen next. The actor portraying Jesus did a marvelous job of showing His great love, mercy and forgiveness.

The novel had a sense of mystery; the film did not convey this. It was obvious what was intended but unfortunately the film lacked that magical something.

This stunk!!!!","review":"After reading the book Joshua, which i thought was AMAZING, I was pretty leery of the movie. Christian movies are usually cheep, cheesy, and poorly acted. This movie was no exception. The only thing it has to do with the book was the title. Joshua the book is very controversial. It deals with all different types of denominations and how Jesus would interact in these denominations. The movie completely skips all of the important parts and just puts filler fluff. Save your money, don't buy this movie and instead read the book it is MUCH better."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Sacreligious film","review":"In a world filled with such confusion, it was horrifying to see a \\"Christian\\" film so distort the message of Christ. All Jesus did was to glorify His Father, and in the movie, \\"Joshua\\" never once mentions anything having to do with Biblical truths. A feel-good movie? Not if you're looking for truth. And even if you, as I, can see past the distortions to the 'nice' part, it isn't worth it. As Christians, we need to promote the message of Christ, and this film does anything but. I highly encourage you all to NOT watch the film, and instead read the Bible, to see the Christ's real message of love. It's worth it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Come on","review":"Joshua is another example of a film made by Christians that is laughed at in the mainstream community.

The story provides many thought provoking views on the life of Christ and their implications for faith. Plus, it's just an excellent read.It's almost shocking how bad the DVD is by comparison - constant, sappy background music, squeaky clean sets (i.e., unrealistic), and drained of drama. If you dare to watch, please don't let it put you off from reading the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Christian movie??? ...Far from it.","review":"There are many things about this movie that is just downright blasphemous.For example...Joshua(Jesus),plays pool at a tavern.Then after he beats his opponent,he tells him \\"You suck at pool\\".Jesus would NEVER tell somebody this! Saying somebody \\"sucks\\" at something,is a crude reference to oral sex.In another scene,it shows a woman who's nipples are poking through her blouse.It is VERY clear,that she is not wearing a bra.This is an invitation,to temptation,amongst men who view this.I could go on and on.This is NOT a Christian-friendly,or a family-friendly movie at all.Christians:Stay far away from this filth.It's a shame that Third Day would appear in this God-less movie.I used to really like them."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Deep Disappointment","review":"After enthusiastically reading the book this movie is based on, I was looking forward to seeing this.

I love Joshua, he's such a kind, healing person in the movie. The characters are real and charming. The message is from beyond the beyond so to speak. It's beautifully done. It had me in real tears of joy, truth and a feeling of knowing as well as \\"being found\\" at the conclusion. A true movie to last a lifetime. I can't believe more people don't know about it."},{"rating":"1","title":"enjoyment depends on if you read the book","review":"If you read the book...don't watch the movie.

I like the movie, but not until several days after i saw it. the message is still good, but not as good as the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"The book is always better.","review":"First, let me say that I've read \\"Joshua\\" at least 4 times, that's how much I love that story. When I found out that it was being made into a movie, I couldn't wait to see it. Unfortunately, it has yet to play in my area, so when I learned that it was out on VHS/DVD, I ordered it immediatly. I hoped that it would be very close to the book, unfortunately, it is not. For example, Father Pat, one of the main supporting characters, was portrayed as a bafoon; he is definately not so in the book. Major parts of the story have been totally left out. Other major parts de-emphasized. Still other parts never even appeared in the book. However, I will have to admit that the spirit of the story is still there. Fankly, if I had seen it first in a theater, I would not have bought the DVD. Buy the book, rent the movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Joshua","review":"I first saw this movie on TV and was so enthralled that I went looking for it. I found it at Amazon and ordered it. This is a story that totally grabs you and makes you think. Tony Goldwyn is perfect for Joshua. Heportrays Joshua just the way you would expect Jesus to act in this day and age. The movie will make you laugh and cry. It tugs at your heart strings. The one thing it really does is, makes you think. It makes you want to live in this town and know these people. And I am sure if you looked inside your heart - somewhere you have already met Joshua yourself. It is a beautiful story [originally a book] and I recommend it to anyone who wants to meet Jesus in the form of Joshua. I loved it."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the all time best movies.","review":"This contemporary storie of Jesus is so well done it makes you wonder why there aren't more good movies out there.

We bought this thinking it was a wholesome family movie--WRONG--It is not.It is NOT bibilically correct at all. It has Jesus (Joshua, main character)coming to earth before the end time-- as a man to visit Catholics and the Pope. And then on top of that---The man who is Jesus---leads a woman on--and just about kisses her. Then throughout the movie 'Jesus' makes the point that it doesn't matter how you worship God--as long as it feels good and you make others happy. He does this as he performs many miracles including bringing someone back to life. It all ends with this 'Jesus man' visiting the Pope and thanking the Pope for what he has done and encouraging him to keep up the 'good work'. This DVD is trash and that is where it wound up!Need I say more???"},{"rating":"1","title":"WARNING!","review":"We turned the movie off near the end when it became outright apparent that Joshua was supposed to be Jesus incarnate. As Christians, we were offended by this sacrilegious production. It was very distasteful. You may want to watch this before you let your children watch this, it will only confuse them. Joshua could have been cast as just an ordinary person who served and helped others; he did not have to be portrayed as Jesus in the flesh. Good message, terrible delivery."},{"rating":"1","title":"shallow and offensive","review":"I heard this was a Christian movie, so I was interested. But when the film was over, I was angry and offended. Joshua, who is supposed to be Jesus Christ in modern-day America, is a meek and shallow good guy who likes Christian rock, making crafts, and the Baptist church. And he doesn't appear to be Jewish. Apparently our Lord and Savior, the creator of the universe, would like to come back and set the Pope straight and tell people their cooking [is bad]. He'd be a mysterious hunk who asks people to work on building projects, but doesn't really call people to worship and obey him. This movie merely makes a parody of the Christian sub-culture in America. Would Jesus, who died by crucifixion, and his apostles, who suffered persecution and martyrdom for their faith, really think of Christianity as doing safe, comfortable, fun things?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money!","review":"Has some familiar faces but generally this movie lacks any substance. Certainly nothing in it is biblical, though you are led to believe that it might just be.... ---kinda sorta-- maybe---- in a touched like an angel kinda way.

I can understand if there was a problem or if the package was accidentally delivered to the wrong address by the mail, but I should have heard back from the seller after my 3/18/09 correspondence."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful script","review":"Many of my fellow reviewers pay close attention to the message of love in the film. That's a good thing, but there are many better films out there that are about Christian values without relying on an awful script. Once you've caught the idea that Joshua is guess who, watching the movie fills you with dread as to how the film makers are going to exploit this awful and cynical idea for the sake of Christian values. I guess that's my main complaint: it's a film that cynically uses its premise to sell itself and its movieland version of religion and love."},{"rating":"2","title":"Spirit filled","review":"This was a wonderful film filled with faith and hope.

Don't bother with your time and money, just buy the book. It was much more fulfilling. If you do buy the book, read it with an open mind and an open heart."},{"rating":"2","title":"Inspiring, Heart-warming, and Touches Every Emotion","review":"I had purchased this movie a few years ago and found it veryrelational to life and God in the lives of folks.

I was simply amazed by how powerful it was. THIS is how Christian entertainment should be!It is about a stranger who comes to this lonely town that needs a lot of help. The people there begin to see this stranger named Joshua do many wonderful things around their small town. He performs miracles, helps to rebuild a Baptist church, and shows each and everyone of the people unconditional love. A group of followers begin to support Joshua, and they stand by him in everything he does. They all begin to wonder: Could this man be the Messiah?Everyone in this film gives top notch performances. Tony Goldwyn (Ghost) plays Joshua. He should get some type of award. He deserves it.Great film! Highly, highly recommended!

It's calm, great storyline, well executed plot, believable characters, and great ending. It's totally worth watching."},{"rating":"1","title":"Quite a Disappointment","review":"If we measure and evaluate everything by the Book, which we try to do, then this movie falls far short of the Jesus (Joshua) we see in the Bible. Just the music itself does not honor the holy character of the Son of God. Rock music is sensual and worldly, and putting Christian words to it does not change it's corrupting character. Also, Joshua sent the young widow the wrong signals. She thought he was interested in her as a woman. Jesus would not have done this. I was moved in certain parts when he healed the blind woman, and raised Theo from the dead ( also healing his speech problem), when he touched the priest, and the Pope. It isn't that there was nothing good, but the fact that Jesus was represented so inaccurately at points was disappointing, and likely to mislead many who see this movie. I strongly encourage everyone who wants to know Jesus to read His Book, and pray for His enlightenment."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just a nice, nice movie","review":"I've never been religious in any conventional, church-going sense, but I got improbable warm fuzzies watching this movie. Tony Goldwyn aces every project he does, so I'm sure that's part of the appeal. Appropriately, the supporting cast is well-rounded and their roles don't seem any less important than that of the title character. If I have one complaint, it is that the last 15 or 20 minutes lack any attempt at subtlety; the message would have been more effective - and UNIVERSAL - if some things had been left to the imagination...or at the very least, unsaid."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful!","review":"This is a wonderful, heart-warming, engaging story.

Perfect family film.Too short though, it left you wanting to see more."},{"rating":"2","title":"Watched Multiple TImes","review":"I don't get tired of this movie. It's a fantastic Jesus-in-modern-day film that shows how love and real presence to other people can change lives.The only caveat I have is that, as a Catholic, I can tell the movie was made by Protestants. The portrayal of the Catholic Church's workings are not particularly accurate (for instance, a senior priest cannot decide if/when a younger priest gets a parish). However, I did find it refreshing that a Protestant treatment of the Catholic faith tried to be fair and non-judgmental.Definitely get this movie - you'll love it, and you'll love showing it to friends."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mislead by the stars","review":"A shallow film with loaded with thinly-disguised Christian dogma.

I realize that the original book was written by a priest, but it's still not Biblically sound.I seriously doubt that if Jesus Christ came to earth now, He would willingly make an idol for people to worship. He didn't do it while He was here the first time, and besides He would be breaking the Commandment \\"You shall not make any idols.\\" (Exodus 20:4)The story line is pretty good, and the acting is OK.

Given the relatively short novel that the film is adapted from, it should have been easy to present the story without oversimplification. Not so, I thought this movie was really pretty bad. They have really watered down the message of the book and have made Joshua a \\"Christians Only\\" hero. They have completely removed the Hebrew element from the book. I also agree with an earlier review that they made Father Pat look like a boob. Complex characters were given sitcom-like personas on film and ulitmately, I feel, the message is buried."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good; worth buying","review":"I have suffered from teeth grinding for some time now.

The Henckels block is sturdy and well constructed, very solid. However, I think it is important to note that the picture is slightly different from the actual product. The design is basically the same, but the picture shows 4 larger slots, but the block I received only has two. So my chefs knife, santoku, and 10\\" slicing knife wouldn't all fit, but I used a drill to widen one of the slots. It is also good to note that my cleaver doesn't fit in the cleaver slot, which will only hold a 3.5\\" width cleaver and mine was 4\\". So I did buy another cleaver to fit the slot.

The second one was chipped along the top corner and, even worse had a major chip in the middle below where you insert the top row of knives, AND right below that chip there was a large crack.

Unfortunately, the block only fit two of my larger knives, leaving 4 big knives without a home. Maybe if there were room for 4 or 5 larger knives I would have made due and gotten rid of a redundant knife or two, but as it was, this block is useless.Strangely, there was enough room on the rightmost column of slots that the slots could have been made sufficiently wide for my needs. For whatever reason, they didn't design it for my selection of knives. Oh well.All that said, it seemed like a nice enough block otherwise."},{"rating":"2","title":"Does what I need it to","review":"I needed a block that had a slot for a meat cleaver and this was the only block I could find anywhere with a slot big enough. I'm glad that it also has slots for steak knives so I can finally keep my steak knives in a holder. This holds all of my knives and it's just what I need. The only reason I don't give it 5 stars is because it's big and clunky on my counter. I would like it slanted more upwards so it doesn't take up so much space, but it's not a problem. Just wish it was a little more modern looking...also would like a darker stain but like I said not big issues there. It does what it's supposed to.

The controls are lame and choppy. The gameplay is very difficult in some levels where you have no way of not being spotted and wind up getting torn to pieces before you can find a spot to hide from the mob of people shooting at you. I wouldn't recommend this game unless you can get it cheap."},{"rating":"1","title":"More of a work project than a game","review":"I echo the comments of other reviewers here that this game was not a lot of fun to play. I was looking forward to this after playing the first IGI, and although I had my share of frustrating moments by not having save options it was good overall. Here you get all of 3 chances to save, and it's best to start saving as you go further along. With the slightest misstep you can have 100 soldiers right on you, and you're also an easy target from what literally must be a mile away for enemy soldiers with basic AK-47's. I was ready to throw my monitor out the window so many times I couldn't continue with the game, and I'm an avid gamer that looks forward to finishing each game I play. I'm glad I only paid $10 for this and not the $50 when it first game out. You'd be better off with another game.

Forget plotting, realistic AI or non-buggy gameplay. Look cool and those moronic gameplayers will buy it before the word gets around that its a bad game.The most insulting thing about the game is the limited saves. By doing this they take away how the player wants to play. It should be totally up to the player whether or not to repeat the same routine again and again and again until he has learned the precise combinations of crawl, shoot and duck that some incompetent programer deemed the only right way to go.

The fact that the author had a Great Pyrenees who lived nearly double the normal lifespan for the breed is enough to make a believer out of me. The recipes sound delicious, but I would be more likely to make them for myself than for the dogs. This book is useful because it gives you a running start in understanding the nutritional requirements of canines, not only in the text, but also with a simple nutritional chart.

Most games last around 30 minutes, with occasional hour-and-a-half games and the very sporadic 2-hour-or-more game. As a hardcore Starcraft, Warcraft 3, and Master of Orion 2 player, I'm not raving about this out of lack of experience with this type of game. It's just a solid game design.

As a teacher I found it helpful."},{"rating":"2","title":"Four stars","review":"In this book, the author describes the methodology of his teaching, which is based on trust and Kohlberg's theory of moral development. In addition to describing lessons, he details every minute of his day from 6:30 a.m. until 6 p.m. and how he spends his time with his students. This book is an easy read, but it's hard to believe most of what Rafe does with his students. I've never read about a teacher so dedicated and hardworking that he even spends his Saturdays with students. My favorite part of the book was where Rafe describes the money system he uses in class to teach kids about organization, planning and the value of ownership. The only thing I disliked about the book was Rafe's self-righteous tone throughout."},{"rating":"2","title":"I wish every teacher would read this one","review":"I am not a school teacher but my youngest daughter is and I bought it for her for Christmas and she loves it so I read it. I do some teaching in seminars and workshops. I was a kid who didnt like school and still remember those days. We need more teachers like Rafe Esquith, the Author.In this book he gives specific outlines of the creative ways he found to get the students involved. What comes through most is how much he cares, which is I believe the key to teaching anyone. If you know a teacher invest in this book and give them a gift that will keep on giving."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazon books .","review":"I love all writings and music than have expanded my mind and opened my heart to Love and Peace = GOD.I can feel the generosity of Spirit in many of those wonderfull boo-friends and music-lovers.

This book is a road map to how teaching should be. Some of it can be downright unbelieveable, but after seeing his kids in action, I can assure you he practices what he preaches.Teachers, read this book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"My hair is smokin'","review":"Rafe Esquith writes humorous stories about his experiences in the classroom and offers practical tips and routines for new as well as experienced teachers. I have been teaching only three years, but find myself in a poverty environment for the first time without the knowledge to reach my students. Mr. Esquith has assisted me in this challenge. A fun and easy narrative read for parents as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"A book every teacher should read","review":"Education that counts does not depend entirely on money, classroom equipment or technology. The greatest factor is a teacher who is excited about learning and knows how to engage learners in hands-on, mind-engaging learning activities. This book shows you what you can do."},{"rating":"2","title":"Exceptional Teacher Resource","review":"This book tells it like it is in education. The author's perceptions about how the government has messed up education are right on target. It is encouraging to see that other educators are speaking out about how education in America is heading down the wrong path. Mr. Esquith's approach to education, outlined in this book, recognizes that all students are different, and that all students are capable if given the correct motivation and challenge. I feel every congressman should be required to read this book so they can open their eyes to how classes should be run---without the constraints of a test-driven educational system. Hats off to Mr. Esquith for an admirable book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best ruler I ever bought!","review":"This ruler is great!

It provides fairly easy access to bending for all of the appropriate notes, and of course has a very appealing price tag. The case is a slight deviation from the Hohner norm - two plastic halves split down the vertical instead of the horizontal middle and opened by pulling the sides apart. The tone is quite normal - nothing special but nothing bad. The only problem I find is that overblowing seems to occur easier than with any of my other harmonicas, but that can be avoided. Overall a great beginner harp, and definitely recommended as a first or travel harmonica."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic Harp!","review":"This was my first ever harmonica, and I still play it more than my others to this day.

If you're considering getting it, go right ahead, you won't regret it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Value and Sound","review":"This was my first serious harmonica, and I learned all of my basic technique on it. I bought it because it was inexpensive, and seemed to be several steps above the cheaper Hohner models. Like those, the American Ace is (somewhat ironically) made in China, but nothing about this harmonica says \\"cheap\\". It has a modern, streamlined look (complete with an engraving of a Grumman X-29) and a decent weight to it. It is comfortable to play. While not absolutely perfect, the sound is very good and I found it easy to bend notes on it. The included hard plastic case is decent, but nothing special. Overall, I feel the American Ace offers plenty of value for the money, and would recommend it to anyone looking for an inexpensive harmonica."},{"rating":"1","title":"ummm :(","review":"This harp is not the best item for somone who realy want to play ,it\`s realy better for spare harmonica. But if you do decide to buy this harp make sure you clean it because the first time it gets diry (very dirty) it\`s no good. Also if you get the Aceyou may want to buy a nicer case. This case is not bad but it falls off easier and just itsn\`t as nice as some other cases."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not sure where 35 minutes comes from?","review":"I have been taking yoga classes for about 9 months and was looking for a video that I could do at home when pressed for time. The video starts with a too-long, unnecessary introduction and then goes into a series of Sun Salutations. The instructor moved quickly throught this series and failed to explain the transitions, so it was very difficult to follow. Her instructions did get better in the following sections. After sticking with this for at least 45 minutes, with no end in sight, I was bored and irritated that the 35-minute workout did NOT live up to its name. If you decide to use this video, make sure you have the following props handy: blanket, 2 blocks, strap."},{"rating":"2","title":"Definitely worth buying","review":"Haggard have been around for many years, but only with this album they could meet fame. Their orchestral sound has gained a touch of metal in The Seer. But in many places the metal sound feels like an instrument to give voice to the anger that is expressed in the album. It is so subtle most of the time that you can expect the same sound from a symphony orchestra. So Haggard has not changed in the essence of their music. Do you want a proof? My mother listens to it.The album, overall, is one of the best I have listened to in these past two years. Their folk, as well as Baroque, not to mention metal, melodies, touching upon many classical works such as Peter and the Wolf, arranged and collaged in such a beautiful way, enhanced with the use of three languages, create a genre rarely explored before. Even though the repetition of certain beats and tunes create a sense of 'cut and paste' after some time, there is no denying the immense effort that went into this record."},{"rating":"1","title":"up in smoke","review":"I gave this picture frame to my wife for a christmas gift,we pluged it in and within a half an hour it made a loud bang and smoke poured out of the thing like crazy....not a good gift.."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dissapointed","review":"My church decided to purchase these to make it more efficiant at the time of making the deposit to the bank, the deal seemed perfect only that when we received it and was ready to use we found out more than 50% of the straps where not stick as it should so we ended up placing scotch tape :("},{"rating":"1","title":"did not work for me","review":"These straps did not stay together.

Using the old computer I have destroyed many discs, RWs were the safe way to go. Even then it wouldn't write over a used RW. I've run into other frustrating bugs while using it. With the new computer, I have had trouble even getting it to the burning stage.

You call Tech Support for assistance and you get suggestions on what the problem may be but no one knows and the problem is still not resolved. I have used Pinnacle Studios before and had great results but decided to upgrade to the new version thinking it would have more features. No bad mistake, paid $129.00 for the item mailed in my rebate and never received it. They want you to mail the rebate info in whether you have received the item or not. They don't allow for time waiting to received the product when you order it and the item takes 2 weeks to get to your house. Now add that to the problems you have trying to get it installed and then editing a project only to find it won't burn to DVD. Please do not waste your money.

In some areas Quinn rattles on and on buut never seems to get to the point. Somewhat like asking someone for the time and they try (incorrectly) to explain how a watch works and leaves you wondering; what the heck was that all about?Another problem is that this book is now about 8 years old. A lot of changes have occurred in personal finance during the last 8 years.Although the book looks intimadating by it's size, the real problem is how much is left out.I recommend Suzes Orman's excellent book The Road To Wealth in place of, not in addition to this book. Other good books to get you up to speed include 10 Smart Money Moves For Women, Smart Women Finish Rich and 9 Steps to Financial Freedom."},{"rating":"1","title":"Looking for some great financial advice?","review":"If so, then keep looking. I'de recocommend Talking Money or The Savage Truth on Money, both of which are more current and better than this tome.Quinn's book is huge, but still lacking in critical information.

But, the big BUT here is that the contents are on the contrary.I beg to disagree with some of the suggestions Mrs Quinn offered. They sound odd. Out-of-the-blues! Money seldom heeds the one-way traffic rule that you and I would like it to. Mrs Quinn seemed to have forgotten that. Well, I would not advice anyone to invest based on what he or she learnt from this book. Its contents are shallow!

Also very repetitious. She spends pages discussing what should only take a paragraph or two.Also much of the information like a home is an asset and pay it off quickly is inaccurate. Notice she never discusses the expences tied in with that \\"asset\\" like mortgage life in addition to the regular maintenance of that \\"asset\\".Quinn mentions term life insurance but seems partial toward cash value insurance. In this regard, I definitely recommend Suze Orman who flat out states that cash value insurance is a ripoff and IF you need life insurance at all, term is the only practical choice...and I agree (I used to sell life insurance).Overall, I do not recommend this book. The best parts seem to be repeated over and over and much is outdated or inaccurate.Give this one a pass."},{"rating":"1","title":"BORROW IT--DON'T BUY IT!","review":"I gave this book a 3 only for peoplewho don't know beans about personalfinance and like to read as a hobby.The information is way too basic andsome is misleading i.e. her commentson stock splits. Quinn makes itsound like when a stock splits say2 for 1, you now have two five's inplace of one ten. The truth is whena stock splits a tremendous amountof momentum and excitement iscreated --- it goes beyond a stocksplitting,it's the amount of moneythat can be made during all phasesof the split that makes investing instocks that are splitting exciting. I saw similiar errorswith insurance. home buying, mutualfunds, credit etc, etc.etc. If youare curous, like was, you may wantto read this.

Avoid it like the plaque."},{"rating":"1","title":"Highly over-rated book","review":"The few 4* and 5* reviews are from people who basically relate to Quinn because of her association with Newsweek. Keep in mind that there is no correlation between a writer who only writes about money and her knowledge of accurate, comphrehensive and effective money techniques. If Quinn is so great, where are all of the success stories?? Hmmm????"},{"rating":"1","title":"College advice is inaccurate as well","review":"While I see a lot of complaints about insurance and investment mistakes in this book by Quinn, I am surprised that nobody has mentioned the misleading and outdated advice on sending your children to college. And not just 529 plans either.For better advice I would recommend Send Your Children to College almost for Free and Everybodies Money Book on College by Goodman.I do agree with the others though that the investment and insurance advice is off the wall.Not recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Retitled book - You can skip this one","review":"This is just another version of Everyone's Money Book released by Quinn back in 1991. Same book - more fluff.Do not confuse this title with an ecxellent book written by Goodman with the same title."},{"rating":"1","title":"A lousy book with too many pumpers","review":"I bought this book based on Quinn's presumed reputation as a \\"financial expert\\" and on the strength of the 5 star reviews on this board pumping this book. What a dissappointment! Not only is the investment advice bad, so is the personal finance advice. For example Quinn recommends cash value life insurance--this is the worst kind of life insurance for the masses. Pension and other insurance advice was equally ineffective if not downright misleading. Quinn even suggests asking your insurance agent to raise your premiums. Gee, why don't I ask my grocer to raise the price of milk and eggs and meats too! I agree with Quinn on credit and credit cards, but that is too basic to be considered worth the price of this book. Looking back, I really have an issue with who really posted all of those 5 star reviews and what their realintentions were! If Quinn is anexpert, then I suppose there reallyis a Santa Claus and a Easter Bunny too!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Has no business passing out investment advice","review":"We followed Quinn's \\"conservative\\" investment advice for our eldest sons college fund.

That is akin to asking a car salesman to tell us how much we should pay for a car and raise the price if necessary.As Suze Orman says, \\"The best financial advisor we will ever meet is the one that we see in the mirror.\\" This is especially true when it comes to insurance products.And let's put to rest the misconception that Quinn is tryig to put insurance people and other financial professionals out of business---she is supporting them, not attacking them!This boo is pure garbage. Avoidd it like the plague."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another potboiler written by a publicity hound","review":"P>There are many good books out there. Some folks think that any book written about personal finance is a worthwhile read. Take my word for it, you can skip this one.Quinn tried to catch the coat tails of Venita Van Caspel when she [Quinn] wrote her first back back in the early 80's (It bombed) and we thought we were only forced to read her rhetoric in Newsweek and that would be it.In the late 80's, personal finance books again became popular and you guessed it, Quinn made a comeback with two lame efforts; 1991 and this worthless tome that came out in 1997.Quinn is a talented writer, but IS NOT a financial expert. She needs to stick to journalism and forget trying to compete with legitimate female financial experts like Suze Orman or Terri Savage (Re: The Savage Truth about Money)You can skip this book and never miss a beat."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't do anything for me","review":"I am new to personal finance but found this book pretty much a study of the obvious.

For home buying, read Home Buying and/or Mortgage for Dummies."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book isn't that bad!","review":"No doubt, Making the Most of Your Money is now nearly 7 years old and a lot of the material is outdated. But at least Quinn does a good job on showing you how to reduce debt---so did my mother.While this book isn't \\"that bad\\", I would give it a pass. Suggest The 10 Day Financial Breakthrough by James L. Paris or 9 Steps to Financial Freedom by Suze Orman for some good financial advice and both of those books will still cost you less than Quinn's.There.

At worst, could cost you a bundle due to ineffective strategies."},{"rating":"1","title":"Easy to see why Americans are doing so poorly with money","review":"If this book represents the best advice available to Americans (according to consumers report), no wonder Americans are doing so poorly with their finances.In Japan, we save on average 30% of our income and are debt free. In America, you try to live on 125% of your income and are deep in debt.

Making the Most of Your Money gives whole new meaning to the word--archiac.And even though I love reading books on personal finance (Goodmans Everyone's Money Money is huge but a joy to read as well as up-to-date), this book was a hard slog probably because I am so articulate about personal finance and had to stop so often to circle all of the mistake int his book.I usually am perceptive enough to see a scam and hate to admit that I got taken, but I got sucked in by all of the hype about this archaic and very boring book.

On close inspection, the book was pulished in November 1997, and very much outdated. Yet to her credit, Jane is an excellent writer and does get the point across. Unfortunately, the info in this book is common sense that you would learn in any business school, newspapers, or magazine.

Quinn is a journalist and the best description of a journalist that I even heard was \\"someone with an idea, even wrong but has the ability to express it\\".Quinn writing on personal finance is amusing. I suppose Pee-Wee Herman will be writing books on bodybuilding and be considered an \\"expert\\" on building muscle right??Read Suze Orman or the new book by the Dolans which is excellent.Disregard books written by self styled and usually broke journalists who only write about money, know how to \\"express it\\" in writing, but have no earthly idea on how to make it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very dissappointed","review":"Based on Quinns presumed reputation, I thought that this book would be a winner.

It's terrible. And that is being kind."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not so sound advice!","review":"Unless you consider giving misleading pension advice, suggesting mutual funds that vastly underperform the market, recommending insurance advice that only makes your agent richer and home buying advice that includes buying into a toxic enviroment.Only the most naive to personal finance bought into Quinn's b.s. in the past and only a caveman would buy into it now.Terrible, terrible, terrible advice Quinn."},{"rating":"1","title":"I disagree with the \\"reviewer\\" from \\"Silicon Valley\\"","review":"After carefully reading that review, I can't help but wonder if that person has a reading problem or comprehending what she reads.The fact is, that as anyone who has read this book knows, Quinn does recommend Cash Value Life Insurance. She also recommends converting from Term to Cash Value and she also suggests Credit Life Insurance as well.So I have to agree with the other reviewers that Quinn is attempting to push cash value life insurance and other expensive unnecessary insurance products either deliberately or becuae she doesn't know any better.In any event, bad advice."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money on this","review":"Way too much misinformation. This book will cost you, not make you money.I would recommend Personal Finance for Dummies or Suze Orman's Real Wealth and other books for personal finance information.For wealth building, I highly recommend Cashing in on CASH FLOW by Laurence Pino and Multiple Streams of Income by Robert G. Allen.Anthony Robbins has an excellent seminar called \\"Personal Financial Power\\" that is a little expensive, but very effective.If you really want tol learn about money, go to people with self earned wealth like PINO, ALLEN and ROBBINS.

I also recommend Financial Freedom: Seven Secrets to Reduce Financial Worry also by Ray Linder as well as the other Making the Most of Your Money titles that were published pre-Quinn.I really have very little respect for writers who steal titles from other, knowledgeable authors and confuse the naive with opinions and not facts.Stay away from this book. Buy Linder's books instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book","review":"I don't have a lot to add beyond what the other people who have given the book 5 stars, but I wanted to take issue with some of the 1 star reviews. I know that stock splits get a lot of people excited and that sometimes the price of the stock will rise (at least temporarily), but that's not something that should be taken as a rule of thumb. Sorry, folks, but Ms. Quinn is right: you get 2 fives when you had a 10. And what is this attraction to Rick Edelman? I bought the Truth About Money and couldn't get rid of the stupid (and mostly useless) book fast enough.JBQ's book is great just for getting your finances organized. Just what *does* belong in a safety deposit box? I certainly didn't know until I read her book. I find her explanations to be clear and sensible."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not that good - I was dissappointed","review":"Despite the high flying five start reviews and obviously paid for article in Consumers Report a few months back, I found this book boring and totally lacking in real information.

But if you really want a good book to get out of debt, try \\"The Everything Book to Get Out of Debt\\"And I don't trust Quinns advice (or is that opinions) on trusts and estate planning either. There are better, more current books out there.When Making the Most of Your Money was written back in 1996, there were a lot of trust seminars going on so I assume that this is Quinns way of jumping on the bandwagon of a popular topic.

Each player has skills based on a scale from 1 to ten on batting,running ,pitching,and fielding.It's sad that there's no more Tony Gwynn,Mark McGwire,or Cal Ripken Jr but I understand because they're all retired. I think this game is better than High Heat 2003. I would rate HH2003 3/5 stars because it's hard to play and the Minor League players aren't even real. I highly recommend this game over HH2003.

Story after story of his life and experiences, but I was left disappointed coming up empty handed as I sought to find some guidance in prayer.I love his approach and agree that we don't need a formula. He wrote that the formulas and such (like ACTS) are like training wheels that we eventually need to ride free of, and I agree. I don't think we can approach God that way.

But the grounds fly everywhere! The plastic container is so full of static that the fine grounds stick to it like glue. This product does not come with a very good instruction book either. You have to experiment with times, settings, etc. until you can kind of get the consistency you want. I think I'll go back to my blade grinder."},{"rating":"1","title":"Absolute garbage! Very disappointing","review":"If I could rate this grinder with negtive integers, I would do it and write it in the sky for everyone to see. It began to fall apart on the second use. All attempts to use this result in inconsistent grind, with inconsistent amounts despite pre-measured 4-8-12 etc. presets, resulting in different and inconsistent coffee strength. It comes apart and doesnt seat correctly all the time resulting in a mess of grounds all over the counter. Spend the money on the Braun KMM30. I have one at home and one in the office, and this Melitta was purchased for the second office, and as soon as the 3rd Braun arrives, this gets pitched. I wouldn't chance my rating on eBay to sell it there this thing is so dissappointing! In the trash it goes.

Way too coarse for espresso - not even close. Much too inconsistent for French press. Maybe it's useable for drip coffee, maybe. But then why not just use a blade grinder for that? It would be less expensive, take up less space, and much easier to clean."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not satisfied at all","review":"I use a fine grind to make coffee with. The fine setting of this grinder wasn't close to the fine grind that I get from the grinders at my local supermarket.

I am not satisfied at all with this product and consider it a waste of money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible! Don't buy!","review":"This coffee grinder essentially stopped working after a couple grinds. Even the finest ground was totally coarse to begin with, then it quit entirely. I sent for a free replacement of the grinder gear (what supposedly was the initial problem), and with the replacement it limped along for a couple more months, still with very coarse grounds, then quit again. And, the countertop somehow always ended up a mess. I feel that you are better either getting a more expensive burr grinder, or go with a higher quality blade grinder for about the same price."},{"rating":"1","title":"Messy, inconsistent grind -- don't waste your money!","review":"My friend has an old (OLD) Oster grinder with a similar look and features from the 50's that her son found at a thrift shop. I've been coveting it for years so when I saw *this* grinder, I thought I'd found a comparable grinder. WRONG. The Melitta is messy, make sure you have the cup in tightly (when you can get it in tightly!) or it will shoot grounds all over your counter and the grind is nearly the same -- course, uneven, a little powder, a lot of big chunks -- whether on 1 or 18.If you want to make a decent cup of strong coffee, and forget about espresso, you'd have to take the whole beans out of the holder and re-grind your *already* ground beans again and again. I can't even give this thing away. I'm going back to my small, electric Oster Cafe' Mill for a decent cuppa Joe and the guys at Waste Management can have the Melitta."},{"rating":"1","title":"Inconsistent grind from a burr grinder?","review":"The whole point of a burr grinder is supposed to be uniform grind. Not this baby! I even did the retrofit suggested by one other reviewer. I reset the grind internally so it would be a finer grind. It worked only halfway. Half the grinds were powder fine and the rest ranged from large chunks to medium grind. Do not buy this grinder. I am now on the hunt for one that does what it is supposed to. What a disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"not a bargain","review":"I heard that burr grinders offer a better, uniform grind when compared to blade grinders. I do not have experience with professional grade burr grinders, but this one simply is not very good. It does grind coffee, so for the price it serves its purpose. But it is very difficult to clean the grinding mechanism and I had to fashion a seal out of duct tape to prevent it from spewing coffee dust everywhere (and yes, the container was locked into place). If you're looking for a cheap grinder, go for a blade. They're easy to clean and don't make a mess."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not good for finer grinds","review":"I am usually very satisfied with any Melitta products I buy, but not this one. This particular grinder is not good if you want an espresso or any kind of finer grind for that matter... which is the reason I purchased this grinder to begin with. The finest grind setting still looked like a regular drip grind. Needless to say it did not work well in my espresso machine."},{"rating":"1","title":"quality inconsistent","review":"I have owned two of these. the first one worked fine for a year (long enough for the price), so I decided to ignore the bad reivews and replace it with the same. The second one, even at the finest setting, does not work well enough to even grind coffee for a coffee press, much less my expresso machine. Some of the grounds are several millimeters across. Chunks of coffee bean, rather than grounds. I will not buy this one again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Melitta MEBG8B Burr Grinder by Salton","review":"This grinder is the poorest one I have used. It would not grind fine enough even for drip coffee, much less for expresso. After I took it apart and reset the adjustment wheel to the point of the burrs actually contacting, the grinder was adequate for drip. I expected better results since the design is essentially the same as a previous Salton grinder, the Maxim GC-30. The burrs, on the melita appear dull, as if they are cast instead of machined."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't last","review":"I bought two, one for me, one for my son. Worked ok but the grind would not be fine enough for those requiring it. However, my son's broke in less than two months, mine in less than four- in both cases it was a plastic part at the base of the grinder. Bummer since it's so reasonably priced, but I cannot recommend purchasing this grinder."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great if you like chunks in your coffee","review":"After trying three grinders, I thought this one might work. I ran into the same problem I had with the Mr. Coffee burr grinder: the grind's too coarse for espresso, even at the finest setting. The box also says \\"delivers consistent, uniform grounds\\", which is a joke. There are chunks mixed with powder. The beans also have trouble falling down to the burr wheel, so I have to stand there and keep shaking it to get the beans to fall down. The plastic also seems rather chintzy, like the Black & Decker I bought which chipped within three months."},{"rating":"1","title":"And it SEEMED like such a great deal....","review":"There is only one problem with this low-cost Melitta coffee grinder with all of these great features, but unfortunately it is a REAL deal breaker: Even at the finest grind setting, this grinder produces VERY large grounds. While at first this may not seem like a big problem, you soon notice that you need to grind about three times the coffee beans for your morning cup of coffee than with any other grinder model. So, within a few weeks you have just eaten-up any savings you kept by buying this low-cost coffee burr-type grinder -- and within a month you are just throwing money down the drain day-in and day-out. In other words, buy a more expensive burr-type grinder -- or simply a cheap blade-type grinder."},{"rating":"1","title":"Find another.","review":"15 settings but you need to get all the way to 13 before itcomes close to what is needed (size-wise) leaving 12 useless settings.Cover doesn't stay on while in use.Worst of all, it's messy.Grounds are all over by the time all is said and done."},{"rating":"1","title":"melitta products are inferior","review":"I received this grinder because I had purchased a defective Melitta Grind & Brew coffee maker through Amazon. The coffee maker had electrical problems and I sent it back to the manufacturer as the manual instructed. To make a very long story short---Melitta was not able to replace the coffee maker. They stopped making them. Amazon had my money and I waited over 4 frustrating months for a coffee maker. Amazon would not help me and after many, many phone calls Melitta sent me another coffee maker and the coffee mill to compensate for the Brew and Grind.

I filled the hopper and set it for the maximum run time and that was it.

I was very happy with it for a while, but it soon didn't grind evenly no matter what setting you used. And I soon found out I had to use twice as much coffee bean to make the perfect pot. I had difficulty removing the burr so my husband took the thing apart for me, and we found about a pound of coarsley unevenly ground coffee stuck in the back of the machine! What a waste! We have had unscrew and empty that wasted coffee twice so far. I am looking for a new grinder."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's all true","review":"everyhting they say about this POS is true.

I make coffee in a drip machine as well as in a french press, so I enjoyed the flexibility. While it worked, it certainly was satisfying for the price. The difference in coarse and fine wasn't as good as my current unit, but it worked. Well, for a while - the plastic wheel which held the element snapped in fairly short order. No goodsie! So, works okay for the casual, non-discriminating consumer; but it's a Bic... disposable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible Grinder","review":"This isn't worthy of being listed on Amazon!!

Phooey!"},{"rating":"1","title":"NICE LOOKING BEAN KILLER","review":"BEWARE. The grinder is compact and nice looking but that's it's only virtue. It has a top hopper that is supposed to hold 1/2 pound of beans. Storing beans in the hopper will GUARANTEE STALE BEANS AND BAD COFFEE. THE HOPPER AND LID ARE SO FLIMSY THAT THE LID DOES NOT LOCK IN PLACE. ANY VIBRATION AT ALL CAUSES IT TO POP UP AND COME LOOSE. I could not get the lid to stay in place just trying to but it on out of the box. You have to hold the lid down manually when grinding or it rotates itself and pops loose. The ONLY way to use this grinder is to measure out the amount of beans you need and then put them in the hopper and grind them all. But don't do it if there is anyone asleep in the household. This thing makes enough noise to wake the dead. And, at the middle setting in the grind adjustment, IT PRODUCES GRAVEL."},{"rating":"2","title":"This Aint for Yuppies","review":"I've had this for about six months now. I paid $19.99, and for that price bought two, because I don't expect it to last forever. It works just fine, but a person needs to keep in mind that you're not getting a precision instrument ... those cost MUCH more. For my needs, a drip machine, it works just fine, allowing me to buy beans that produce a much better cup of coffee than the canned variety. Yuppies craving espresso look elsewhere.I've taken it apart and adjusted the grinders, but there's a limit to what can be done. The wheels aren't exactly machined to the closest tolerances, but they're more than adequate for drip machines, with a fair amount of \\"dust\\" (espresso sized) thrown in.In short I'm very pleased."},{"rating":"1","title":"Melitta MEBG8B Coffee Mill","review":"This coffee grinder did not meet our expectations. It states that it grinds \\"from very coarse to very fine for espresso\\", but we could not get it to grind to this level.

So we returned it and are in search of a better grinder."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mine burned up, too","review":"Well, I can't find it at the moment but somewhere on Amazon I posted a review of this grinder right after I got it, saying what a steal it was for a burr grinder. Wrong. After about a month, one day a smoking smell came out of it, and after that the motor was dead. It never did grind the beans all that evenly, in truth; to make 12 cups a day for my Bodum Santos, I am getting better results with my Cuisinart Grind Central whirly grinder."},{"rating":"1","title":"Motor burned up","review":"I enjoyed this mill. The price was good and the grinding was acceptable. Its small footprint and good capacity were also in its favor. Unfortunately after owning it for less than 2 months it started making a strange noise and smoke started to come out of the motor. Needless to say I disposed of it immediately. It would have been too much hassle to try to get it replaced under warranty considering the low price. I cannot recommend this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"You only get what you pay for.","review":"First of all, I will say that I use mine daily, and have thrown out my old blade grinder for this one. I like the 1 touch operation and the bean holder. What I don't like is the construction of the grind catcher. First of all, if you select the 12 cup setting, the grind bin overfills and clogs the entire unit. Why there is a setting that can't be used is beyond me. The grind catcher is also a little messy. There is a lot of \\"coffee dust\\" that floats all over the counter. You can dial various settings for a fine or coarse grind, but I don't really notice a difference in the outcome. I use a drip pot on occassion as well as a French press. The French press requires a more coarse grind, but the unit tends to give the same results as the setting that is recommended for the drip pot. If you are looking for a good burr grinder, this is not it. If you are looking for just any grinder, I think this is better than blade grinders at about the same price."},{"rating":"1","title":"Melitta MEBG8B Coffee Mill","review":"My Melitta MEBG8B Coffee Mill just died unexpectedly in the middle of grinding coffee the other day. It was about a year old. It was nothing but trouble from the moment I received it. It was extremely messy. The kitchen counter and the floor, and ME were always covered with a spray of ground coffee with each use. It clogged up, even though I cleaned it every time I used it. It would arbitrarily clog up and the motor would smell like it was burning out. This was with regular, careful use. It is a poorly designed product, though when it does grind coffee, the ground coffee is acceptable. Please don't waste your money. Find something of better quality.

It worked for a few months before the motor burned up.During use, I discovered how messy the grinder is. You have to be festidious to keep the counter clean, and if a house guest trys to operate the grinder on his own, you end up with a mess.Once the motor burned up, I sent it unit back for replacement. They were helpful, and in a couple of weeks the new unit arrived, complete with broken buttons. The only way to make the unit behave was to unplug it.Now, immediately I have to send the replacement back for replacement. What a hassle. Cheap grinder = poor quality = frustration overall. Not smart to buy cheap products manufactured in China and expect them to last at least the duration of their value.The grinder has been more of a hassle than it is worth. A pain to use, works nice when it does, a pain to replace. I would have been better off investing a little more money and getting a better product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste even $5 on this item","review":"Where do I begin? First, be prepared for the grinder to spit coffee grounds out all over the place when you grind the beans. The design of the plastic grounds catcher is defective; the gaps cause the machine to spew grounds everywhere. It has 18 settings but they really make very little difference in the grind. You pretty much get chunks or perk grind with this. It doesn't grind fine enough for good drip coffee. The silly lid makes no sense whatsoever. It simply rests loosly on top but doesn't stay on. This is an awful product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Useless!","review":"I bought this grinder to go with a brand new Bialetti Moka Expreess espresso pot I received for Christmas. I've heard that burr mills are the best way to grind coffee. I wanted one, but I didn't want to spend big money. I wasn't expecting much for the price of this mill, but I thought, \\"How bad could it be?\\" Man, was I wrong! No matter how I adjusted this thing, the grind came out unusably coarse. It wouldn't grind fine enough for a percolator, much less espresso. Seriously, I could have done a better job with a hammer! It doesn't really deserve the one star I'm forced to give it. If you can't make coffee of any kind with what comes out of it, it's useless junk!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Inexpensive for a reason","review":"This grinder is a great example of \\"you get what you pay for\\". It has a nice style and it's small size makes it fit right in on the countertop and that's where the positives end. Being mostly plastic, I knew there was going to be a static problem, I was willing to live with that for the price. There is very little difference between the course and fine grinds.. so much for making espresso AND french press. In the drip even the finest setting produces coffee chunks so large as to waste about 30% of your coffee. I would suggest not wasting your money, no matter how cheap you find it, it's not worth it."},{"rating":"1","title":"won't grind very fine","review":"I returned the first one since it died after less than 2 weeks.

Ok for the home but don't think about trying to use this in an office, it wouldn't last a week. 2) Grinds the beans great if you only need it for a drip coffee maker but even at the highest recommended setting it doesn't come close to getting a good espresso grind.

However, it is very messy to clean and the front control buttons are easy to hit accidentally. For example; when you are removing the front chamber to empty the grounds, you would naturally grip around the middle of the unit and that's exactly where the control buttons are. It feels clumsy to hold on to the top just so you don't start coffee shooting all over the place (yes, I am embarrassed to say this had happened to myself and my mother-in-law when she tried to make coffee for us).

The buttons stick, the lid (which one would expect to be secure, seeing as how it stores fresh coffee beans) wants to pop off at the slightest provocation, the plastic smells like it's melting while you grind, and all that is on the first use. I'd like to grind a \\"4\\" serving for espresso, but the button stuck on \\"8,\\" so I'll be drinking 8 cups at a time until I can buy a new grinder. Amazon, you should pull this item, and let some other vendor take the heat for having sold, to put it bluntly, a piece of crap."},{"rating":"1","title":"Returning it to factory","review":"Where's the Zero Star?HATE it!

I have had several coffee grinders and this one is the poorest performer of all. It only costs $20, but why spend $20 on a grinder that gives poor results when you can get a blade grinder for $10 that does a much better job? This Melitta coffee mill purports to grind from fine to coarse but in reality only grinds to a course consistency. I sent this item back as defective because the product information clearly states \\"18 grind selections, from very coarse to very fine for espresso.\\" This is clearly not accurate. I hope to get my shipping cost back. Anyway, it's a nice looking product but simply doesn't perform as expected."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of Money","review":"I bought this grinder about 6 months ago, and it worked well for awhile, but now the beans do not feed correctly and the buttons are getting stuck. I do not recommend this item."},{"rating":"1","title":"bad design, bad performance","review":"This is a poorly designed mill, cheaply manufactured. The grinding mechanism is easily clogged but difficult to disassemble for cleaning. The port into the hopper is too small and must be frequently unblocked. The hopper consistently develops excess static, causing large amounts of coffee to stick; it is badly positioned and fits loosely, guaranteeing a mess to clean up every time the mill is used. After four months of annoying service, the cheap circuit board attached to the power switch broke loose, finally ending the suffering. A nut chopper would work better."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Burr Grinder Budget Bargain","review":"A nice little machine for the price. It quickly delivers the amount and type of grind you desire. Unfortunately, this grinder spews coffee dust out both sides like a volcano. This problem is easily remedied by placing a piece of saran wrap around the Ground Coffee Chamber before grinding. This is an OK grinder for grinding a week's worth of coffee/espresso at a time, but the clean up is just too messy for a daily grind. I don't know if more expensive grinders are neater, but no other grinder does the job any cheaper. Brew on!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Melitta MEBG8B Coffee Mill","review":"Just does not grind fine enough or evenly for my needs. No matter how you adjust the grinding, the result is the same, coarse and uneven. I would not recommend this machine. I would probably send it back but for the price it seems hardly worth it, I guess I could use it in an emergency."},{"rating":"1","title":"I agree, don't buy it! Wish I had read reviews first","review":"Every review of this product is correct, I just wish I had researched this before I purchased, but I bought it on a whim because it was only $26. Well, now that I have used it 3 times it does not work at all, so I guess that only add $12 to the cost of each pot of coffee I made with it. For $26 I didn't expect it to last forever, but I did expect it to last through one bag of coffee."},{"rating":"1","title":"A classic example of \\"you get what you pay for\\"","review":"First, be prepared for the grinder to spit coffee grounds out all over the place when you grind the beans. The design of the plastic grounds catcher is defective; the gaps cause the machine to spew grounds everywhere. It has 18 settings but they really make very little difference in the grind. You pretty much get large chunks or perk grind with this. The grind is way too coarse for my drip coffee maker. The grinder is useless for grinding espresso. You will end up wasting a lot of coffee with this so in the long run, it pays to get a top quality burr grinder. This isn't it. This is an awful product."},{"rating":"1","title":"mezzaluna review","review":"i had hoped this would work as a replacement for my ancient ulu, a one bladed curved knife, however the two blades don't work anywhere near as well as my single blade.

It's a deconstructed fairy tale, one of approximately 18 billion, and the themes are familiar. Yes, the old stories were often appallingly misogynist and affirmed rigid patriarchal values, including a distrust of the other and the outsider. Yes, this was bad. Coover scores some points for not completely inverting everything- the witches aren't quite innocent, just no more brutal than everyone else- but the whole story is pretty one-note and forgettable. It offers nothing new, it just deconstructs the old, and without offering real change it's simply a grim and ugly affair."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a retelling","review":"Taking only the scintillating, perverted elements and adding a dark, unbounded hatred for all that is \\"church\\" this author's treatment of every story hinted at in this text is without feeling or imagination.

I returned the first one since it would not hold together because of a previously stripped-out screw hole in the fixture. Amazon sent a replacement, but that one, too, had obviously been installed before as there were small chips in the paint and glass shade, plus the ends of the wires had been stripped, twisted, and slightly corroded. In addition, the wire and chain is too short if you have high ceilings. I had to re-wire the entire fixture and replace the chain which, unfortunately, can not be found in the same finish.

After 1 month, we never use the thing, prefering our little coffee press or our old drip machine (the one we were replacing with this new one). The problem? The coffee is not hot. It is barely warm. The thermal pot doesn't even keep it warm for long. When we do use it, we have to put very hot water in the pot for several minutes before brewing, which helps but doesn't really solve the problem. (And it takes 10 minutes prep time.) I never thought of myself as a \\"hot\\" coffee guy but this stuff doesn't even come close, even if I pour the cup 1 minute after it is done brewing.

Another smaller complaint would be that the coffee is not especially hot, but my biggest complaint is just the mess.

My e-mail was never answered, so I am assuming that no parts are available."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor design, it will break on you","review":"Used this for nearly a year and loved it, then like so many other reviews here, the latch broke and the machine becomes almost useless (I now put a heavy empty glass on top of it to hold it down while brewing) It won't fucntion if not latched, hence until I find a new machine, I am using the glass.Though this machine has a lot of good qualities, it won't hold up, and I have also noted that the filter basket is not ever replaceable, which is ridiculous. This machine will be a good buy if you plan to die in the next year, otherwise, take my advice and look elsewhere.Sorry Melitta, but just a little more common sense in your design and plans and you would have had a solid winner here. As it is, its not a wise investment at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not happy","review":"When I purchased this less than 18 months ago, I paid over $100. It made good coffee. I would have liked the pot to keep it warmer a little longer - but I REALLY expected it to last longer than 18 months! I have not over-used the unit. Many days I did not make coffee in it at all. Today, it will NOT heat/brew at all. It still grinds the beans, but that is the end of it - Coffee beans without \\"water added\\" really do not make a very satisfying drink! I certainly will avoid another Melita product, might as well go back to a $25, discount store special!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Such a nice unit...too bad about the carafe","review":"We bought this coffee maker after years with a Black and Decker model that was a workhorse. We liked the idea of less mess with a built in grinder. The brewing/grinding unit works perfectly for us although it is more work to clean and does seem to grind beyond what is necessary. But the carafe is the biggest drawback and that's why we give it 2 stars! I can't tell you how many times I have dumped the entire pot all over my counter because I turned the lid a fraction too far. If you don't turn it enough, you only get a small trickle. Very frustrating.Doesn't seem like rocket science to me. If you spend that much on a coffeemaker, you should expect a better designed carafe.And now a year after owning it the lid latch has broken and won't brew unless something heavy is placed on top to keep it down. This seems to be a planned obsolescence feature as I have read at least a dozen or more reviews that mention the same thing after a year of owning. Hummm...."},{"rating":"1","title":"weak lukewarm coffee and breaks easily","review":"This coffeemaker is a great idea, but Melitta needs to go back to the drawing board.The coffee is lukewarm at best and if you like medium or strong coffee stay away from this coffeemaker. When you fill up the grinder to the recommended level, it will make 8 cups of paper thin warm coffee. Within 2 months of purchase the tiny PLASTIC piece that holds the lid shut broke. (The coffee-maker won't work unless it is latched closed). I got a replacement lid (6 week wait) and 2 months later and it broke again. I do not abuse my coffeemakers . I had my last carafe coffee-maker 7+ years.After advising me to take it apart and look for problems, Salton (who makes this product for Melitta) offered to replace it (not so willingly, and if I sent back everything with receipt and the original box). I wouldn't want another one.... This expensive purchase is headed for the trash can. My recommendation is to keep your receipt if you buy this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Forget it!","review":"I liked this for about a month - then the top wouldn't stay shut. I held it together with duct tape which I replaced as needed for a little over a year while I tried to get a replacement or at least a replacement part. It never happened. I then purchased the Melitta Mill & Brew non-thermal version from Target since I knew they would replace it if needed. I've had it for a year and a half and am very pleased with it. It would be nice, however, if a company decided to actually brew coffee at a higher temperature to really get the full flavor of the coffee beans."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst tasting coffee I've ever had","review":"I just received this coffeemaker yesterday. I have made six pots of coffee trying different grinding settings, different amounts of coffee and I have yet to get even one cup that is drinkable. The coffee is weak and bitter tasting. I have been using a Cuisinart Grind and Brew which makes wonderful coffee but the glass carafe broke recently so I thought I would try the Melitta Mill and Brew with the Stainless carafe. You cannot pour a cup of coffee without taking the lid completely off and it still leaks coffee all over the counter.

Now I don't have that problem at all.The coffee grinds and brews fast, tastes great, and the unit is easy to use. I love it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Make mine a Melitta !!!!","review":"This is my second Melitta grind and brew coffee maker (the first one lasted 7+ yrs with daily use)...THIS IS THE BEST IN FLAVOR, EASE OF USE, AND VALUE.Two of my friends purchased The Cuisinart Grind and Brew ($149.99), it is difficult to clean, makes weak coffee. It's very $$$$ for what you get... And no carafe!!!The Melitta makes a great cup of coffee, is extrememly easy to clean, and the thermal carafe does a great job of keeping the coffee warm. Hands down it is the best grind and brew type coffeemaker I have found! Everything is easy to set... if you want to wake up to great coffee.

To add insult to injury the company Salton takes back the machine in total--no replacement parts sent--in a 4-6 week turnaround.(either buy a new machine or go without making morning coffee for that time!!)and will only either fix or replace with a refurbished unit (someone elses old coffee unit???)Something not right here. Suggestion and rating: AVOID"},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfectly Excellent","review":"The coffee is hot enough, stays warm overnight (I don't like to burn my mouth). The carafe lets me work in the basement without going back to the pot. You must be careful putting the carafe back in, or you will get water overflow on the counter. The mill is loud.Overall, it does the job splendidly. Good, hot coffee. Easy to clean parts. Just what I wanted at a great price."},{"rating":"2","title":"I love this coffee maker!!","review":"I bought this coffee maker when I moved into a new place as a replacement for my old $$ coffee machine. I haven't regretting the purchase one bit! The large 10 cup carafe fills quickly, and the coffee is already warm, so you don't have to worry about a warmer, and with 10 cups of hot coffee, I carry the carafe with me when I am visiting neighbors in our apartment complex. The grind feature is another thing I don't think I could live without. There is nothing better then freshground coffee. I have stocked up on different flavored coffee beans for that special morning brew. Also, there are no filters to buy. The coffee is good, it stays hot all day, and there are no filters to buy. What more could you ask for?"},{"rating":"1","title":"coffee lover","review":"We had our coffeemaker for 2 months and it started leaking. We contacted Melitta and they send us a new part. It lasted one month. They finally sent us a new unit and it lasted one month. We really like the design and got many coments from friends but something is wrong. I read all the reviews and chose it because no one listed any mechanical problems. Something must have happened somewhere in the production line. I hope they are able to fix the problem it did make a good cup of coffee."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Hot","review":"I just returned this machine after a few days. It grinds fine but trust me, it does not get hot enough. My wife who is not a big coffee drinker looked at me and said the coffee is not hot enough. You can chug it if you want too. We preheated the carafe with hot water and it still did not help.Too much of a pain."},{"rating":"1","title":"A great idea while it lasted","review":"This product is scheduled to return to the US market in January 2006 - don't buy it. I spent $70.00 on a product that I may have got 20x use out of; I'm not impressed and will be returning to a grinder and coffee press (the 'keep it simple, stupid' approach).I owned one of these models for 3 years, it received light use during that time and I thought it was a wonderful machine until about a month ago when it began to percolate very slowly, generated a lot of steam, and would not turn off when all the water had boiled.I de-scaled it according to manufacturer's instructions with vinegar (old housewives' standby) and CLR, there is no improvement. I'm guessing that the thermostat has blown but there is no obvious way to take the machine apart to find out what is going on, or to clean/replace the part.I'm not impressed with the manufacturer's problem-solving instructions or the customer service provided by Seton (USA importers)."},{"rating":"2","title":"FYI, this is Abbado's Wiener Philharmonkier 4th, NPO 2nd Symphonies","review":"I'm adding the review because the Amazon catalog doesn't tell the whole story.The 4th Symphony recording is actually Abbado conducting the Wiener Philharmoniker in 1976.The 2nd Symphony (Little Russian) is Abbado conducting the New Philharmonia Orchestra in 1968.Both performances are excellent."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not good","review":"I have the Silver 54 key version of this keyboard.

The volume control doesn't work for the mic, which is ear-piercingly loud, and the volume buttons are incorrectly placed (the \\"volume up\\" button is pointing to the left and the \\"volume down\\" is pointing to the right) which can be very confusing for children who are learning.

If they had all been true, including the cheapness of the buttons, and the volume level limitations, it would have suited my needs very well. Nobody mentioned however that it has a serious software bug that causes irrelevant notes to sound when keys are pushed.If you play a simple C major 7 chord: c e g bflat, the instant you play the bflat a d and an f sound as well.

I'm glad that those who wrote the other reviews liked their purchase, but I wanted to share a different perspective. I returned it.

The upgrade itself takes minutes and is very simple so don't be intimidated by that either.One issue you may not recognize is that with DDR2 RAM you only get the best performance if you have dual channel memory engaged which requires you having matching sets in terms of speed and size in the slots. If you have some RAM that is faster it will slow down the faster one. Running dual channel then doubles the speed of the RAM by allowing it to communicate twice as much information.

There was no Miracle. Eating cheese sandwiches and vegetable stew for two weeks and drinking two quarts of water a day caused the crystals to dissolve. There was no difference from former attacks without the pills.

It does an overall excellent job and succeeds in its mission superbly. It should be noted that this text does not replace standard texts of critical care medicine but can easily act as an additional supplement to them.It may be a little too advanced for medical students but I will highly recommend it for my interns and seniors doing their critical care rotations. It can easily be read during the month rotation and brings out the essential key points that they should be learning."},{"rating":"2","title":"Totally Superb","review":"This book was spectacular!

Sarangerel's book is neither a hollow academic essay nor a self serving autobiography. Riding Windhorses is a practical introduction to Mongolian/Siberian shamanic culture, and a hands-on manual for bringing very ancient practices into modern life. It is written in a comfortable and logical style, which makes it quite useful for anyone of any background. This book also serves an important role by presenting shamanism from a cultural perspective not yet given: today's bookstores are filled with terrific N. and S. American shamanism books. Now, the culture that gave us the word 'Shaman' is being represented, and represented very well."},{"rating":"2","title":"I enjoyed a brief introduction to Mongolian Shamanism.","review":"I bought this book because I wanted a view of Shamanism as practised in this area of the world because the term Shaman was coined by the Tungus people of Siberia.The rituals and ceremonies are simple and could be performed by just about anyone.Chapter 6 deals with assorted forms of diviniation.The book is clearly written and concise; however; the author uses terms used by the Mongolian Shamans throughout the book, and in a few places; this is tiring and tedious.My only real complaint deals with page 91 \\"A more potent hallucinogen, the mukhomar mushroom has been connected with Siberian and Mongolian shamanism from ancient times.\\" (In my opinion; hallucinogenics are NOT needed, and NOT recommended.)Wah doh Ogedoda (We give thanks Great Spirit)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Ancient wisom made available","review":"The second of Chang-po's writtings with commentary by Liu I Ming.

Rebecca, Jake's wife, the lady of the novel is beautiful, kind and caring... but is in love with another man, the man who got her pregnant and left her. Jake married Rebecca to save her from scandal. Many reviewers have mentioned that Rebecca didn't deserve Jake for leaving him, but I think she suffered for it when she returned and Jake didn't welcome her with open arms.

I didn't really feel like he was as forthcoming as he could have been about what exactly made his ex-wife flip out. If there was nothing more to the story, he should have stated it, but he leaves the extent of his problem up to the reader to figure out. If he stated his whole problem, then the book is fine, and the ex was just a freak, but I have a feeling there's a little more to the story. And it would have been helpful if he could have explained what he knew about her family and why it wasn't the perfect family that she had always thought it was.

I am frustrated at the author's trivializing and rationalizing this illness. The behavior accompanied with this addiction is like having one's husband commit adultery. Sex addicts often cannot face the realiity of their behavior. I am fairly certain that Mr. Conant is not being fully forthright about his behavior, which in turn, makes Sara's reaction seem extreme. Furthermore, he seems oblivious to the hurt and agony she must have endured while only recounting his own.

He chose to use BOTH his parents' names so PLEASE respect this choice.

Such funny anecdotes such as his conversation with his mother about his career choice and how she is supposed to explainte this to his father while on a boat trip to sell an old house.

It washes up nicely, but keep in mind that this piece is not dishwasher safe (per the manufacturer).

Whether for breakfast eggs or quantites of stir fry meals it acts as a fry pan as well as a small wok.I am very pleased with this item and have had no flaking on the surface after four years of service. True, the handles get hot from the gas jet. That's why we use fire and not ice to prepare meals. But with a hot pot holder I can tip the pan and scrape out the contents into a bowl or onto a plate. With two pot holders I can give a quick shake and slip three eggs over the edge and onto a plate. Perfect for a single guy who enjoys a good meal."},{"rating":"2","title":"Favorite Calphalon skillet-10\\" Everyday non stick skillet","review":"I purchased this for a gift but own it myself too and it is my very favorite skillet.

I like Pokemon and have a Pokemon Silver and think there should be a new version of the book (if this series is going to do something), but that probably won't happen because the Pokemon craze has basically ended. I went to another book that had a list of all 251 Pokemon and now I have 245 of the 251 Pokemon in the Silver version for Gameboy Color.

Ordering it was a nice way to revisit some good memories. The only downside is that some of the info is slightly off/ made up. For example on page 37 in Pikachu's description it says \\"Pikachu do not like to be inside Poke Balls\\". This is a generalized statement based off of the fact that Ash's pikachu doesn't like to be in his poke ball. This is also the case with the surfing pikachu ash and the gang meet during season 1 of the tv show. Slight discrepancies like this are common throughout the book. That is the only downside to this book, otherwise its very interesting and also worth the money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sweet!","review":"Wow! This is a must buy for any Freddy fan!

More like a chinese knockoff. It doesn't look anything like the picture and even all the \\"features\\" of the glove don't exist.The color is completely wrong and reeks of spraypaint, which is pretty much what the paint job looks like. There is paint all over the blades and isn't even fully covering the shell. The fabric part of the glove is so light in color it looks like someone just cut up a cheap garden glove. It claims to have adjustable finger straps - lie. It's all plastic, and cheap plastic at that. It says the wrist is adjustable - also false. It has elastic on one side and a 3\\" rope dangling from the top side of the plastic to \\"adjust.\\"This has to be the worst Halloween item I've ever ordered.

This was a low budget film which for all its worth wasnt a bad movie. The story line was well scripted and the actors actually acted well above the salary which Im assuming wasnt much. This is not the first and it will not be the last of the \\" Ghetto Film\\" genre. I applaud anyone who has the drive to make a movie against the odds and have people purchase your artistic product.

Starring Corey Haim as a teen who just flunked his driving test, and the then unknown actress Heather Graham as the blonde of his dreams, this story is quite similar to other teen comedies of the 1980s. Funny but not hilarious; wacky but not wacked out, the book and story can be easily taken in over an afternoon. Many American teenagers probably have some first-hand experience with the adventures of the protagonist. Overall, this book is not worth the time to read it."},{"rating":"2","title":"this is one of my all time favs","review":"If you love to support local bands and have ever regreted the brakeup of a band.. this is it for me. Out of lawrence KS, this band influenced so many bands in the midwest and inspired so much great energy and music. Some of the proof that is that you can still buy it new on Amazon 10 years after the band broke up. The were a mix of new wave punk, alternative and distorted surf guitars. They are sometimes loud, but always full of energy and the vocals are extremely strong and controlled. (no whinning! and nothing is wasted).

I don't see how but then again I don't see a reason to have to scrape your teeth clean more often than once a month or every couple of weeks. Stuff does not build up that fast on your teeth anyway.

I now have cavities for the first time in my life at age 30 because these damn things were slowly building crevasses in my back teeth. Yes, I'll admit the scrap and flat side works well with these tools, but I felt like punching the first dentist I saw the day I rolled my tongue under my back molars and founds a sharp pit of worn enamel in several teeth.

Plus, the plastic on it cracked when I over-tightened the cap.Recommend this one for any one who has entered the Visor Age and left behind last century's Pilot technology."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sleek looking stylus has my two thumbs up.","review":"Want to make your Visor handheld even more attractive?

(Didn't affect writing with it of course)The orange tip did aid my writing in the \\"near dark\\", and felt a degree softer than the Handspring stylus tip.I have used the PDA Panache stylus for the Palm Vx and III, and find this to be a solid addition to their line."},{"rating":"2","title":"I love this stylus","review":"I love the feel of it, the weight and heft. It can be a little slippery, but I don't squeeze it as much as I seemed to do the first couple of plastic styli I tried, so it hasn't been a problem.It fits perfectly in the slot of my Prism, and the top is enough larger than the shaft to be able to easily push it out of the slot when I want to use it.I love the look of the bright shiny chrome, and the orange tip does help with visibilty on the screen. This is especially good for a person of limited depth perception (me). The tip is smooth besides, and doesn't dig into the screen. I do use screen protectors against everyday wear.The only thing I would change, if I ran the zoo, would be to add a screwdriver point like the Handspring stylus has.I love this stylus."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's doesn't cost its price.","review":"Unfortunatelly it scratch the screen, doesn't feet a visor and some kind of slippery.

The editing of this book is so poor it it resembles more a vanity publishing book (which is probably what it is, or started out as anyway). If nothing else, it appears to be nothing more than a random collection of trite aphorisms, general observation, and various Christian principles that can be found in no shortage of other books like Thing and Grow Rich, which at least has the benefit of being well-written and edited.

I used to get colds and flus very frequently, and now I barely get any. I like the lozenges better than the liquid because you get more for your money, and they don't upset my stomach like the liquid does. The only drawback is that it makes your mouth Barney-purple for an hour or so, so don't take it before a big presentation or meeting. Try it- it's well-priced and effective."},{"rating":"1","title":"Syrup is great, but PASS on the lozenges!!!","review":"I've used the syrup version of this product in the past, and had no issues with it. -Tastes fine, easy to swallow, and so on. However, the lozenge version of this product is HORRIBLE! It's like sucking on a gritty pill, not like a smooth cough drop. The actual taste is on the bitter side, and takes forever to dissolve. Additionally, you'll be left with a reddish-purple stained tongue.Overall, I absolutely would NOT recommend the lozenges. They're not convenient and have too harsh of a taste for the amount of time it takes for them to dissolve.

Nature Way's told me that the origin country of the syrup is propriatory and cannot be disclosed to customers. What???? My gut feeling is that this stuff is being Made in China and that's why they are hiding this fact.

Montoya, a recurring character, grapples with an accumulating set of victims that point toward Abby. Jackson's novels have been pegged Romantic Suspense, but the intensity here seems more like a Thriller. Recently I read, SHADOW OF DEATH, by Patricia Gussin. The jacket blurbs all said Medical Suspense because the author is a M.D., but I found it more a mix of Romantic Suspense and can't-put-it-down Thriller.

It has definetly put his creativity into a bigger category. He has said he has no idea how he got along without it before the purchase and the photos he has taken since would not have been possible with any other lens. It is exciting as a mother and supporter of his career to know that this purchase is making more of his dreams a reality and that for his clients too!!

Sure there wasn't any point why that guy was killing people but I did want to know what would happen next."},{"rating":"1","title":"MANGLED KING","review":"Stephen King should have sued the filmmakers for this abominable \\"sequel\\" to the original MANGLER. The script has none of the skill imbued in King's short story or any of the style of the original Tobe Hooper film. This one follows a middle aged plumber who buys the dreaded machine at an auction and becomes obsessed with repairing it. This leads to his being gobbled up and HE becomes a walking, killing mangler. Also involved in this mess are a father and son house burglary team, and a young girl who has just lost her job and her lover. They got trapped in the mangler's house and do innumerably stupid things, all without any real sense of suspense or credibility. The movie tries to use its gross out gore to make an impact but it ends up being sadistic and absurd. I wouldn't waste my time on this one, folks."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Mangler Is Back......","review":"I enjoyed the very first Mangler movie, though a old movie now. I rented this movie the day it came out for it looked like it promised to be a great horror film. Well, I was disappointed like I have been in many other \\"sequels\\". The gore and blood scenes make me give this movie 2 stars. Other than that, the movie is neither suspenseful or thrilling. The mangler machine is rebuilt by a repairman who decides to keep the machine alive by feeding humans to it. A couple of cool scenes but that's it. This was another let down movie. Barely worth the rental fee."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stick With the Original!!!","review":"The Mangler 3 was really disapointing to me.

And I wish folks like Mr. Dwyer would look at the gross inequities and harmful practices that currently exist in our public school system, which he apparently thinks have been eradicated by the ton of regulations that our state imposes.

The variety of expressions and models is awesome and I particularly like the photos taken at low and high angles. I also like the way the book is organized. It's perfect to have expressions grouped by person because when I'm drawing a character I need to see how that character's expressions look.

I need subtle, human emotions, but what I got in this book was a lot of outrageous expressions. If you're doing caricature, this book would be a great resource. If you need slight lifts of the brown, a downturn of the mouth, then take your own pictures. Also, I had hoped that the photos would have been arranged by emotion, rather than by model. This forces the reader to have to look at page after page of pictures in hope of finding the right expression. It's off to a book reseller I go..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Needs labels","review":"It's great to have all of the photographs of various people from different angles, but none of them are labeled. The author says that he asked the people in the photographs to act various feelings like \\"scared, angry, etc.\\", but he leaves that mapping out of the book. For me, it makes it almost useless."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Wonderful Resource for Cartoonists and Comic Book Artists alike","review":"Virtually Maria (Virtual Trilogy)I came across this book when I was looking for reference material to illustrate my Captain Cockle childrens' books and have kept it near my drawing board ever since.What I like about it is that it gives a very wide range of material in terms of expressions, angles and different ages that I have not come across in any other book of its type. It also uniquely shows some examples of how some of the photos have been turned into caricatures or cartoons (both of humans and animals) that give an interesting insight into how they might be used.My only criticism (which I see I share with a few other reviewers) is that it is difficult to lay this book down on a drawing table without it flipping shut again due to its paperback format. Spiral binding would have been better, but that's a small price to pay for such a valuable resource. I look forward to a companion manual perhaps on figures, hands or activities."},{"rating":"2","title":"Facial Fun","review":"This book has very good assortment of faces that go through a set of emotions.

Perfect."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unhelpful in its layout","review":"As an artist I'd love a great book of facial expressions. Unfortunately this isn't it. It's very tedious trying to find the right expression the way this book is laid out. I need to be able to search for a specific expression, not a model type.

The book claims to be an advanced book, but it falls miserably short from this goal. For example, chapter 3 is devoted to 'Processes' yet contains less information about it than the Windows 95 API Bible (ISBN 1-57169-009-3). And Chapter 14 covers file systems, but chapter 15, titled Device I/O, only covers file I/O , just briefly mentioning that it can be used for other devices like serial ports or printer ports.

Why do I like it so much? It's a bit wider than my 50mm, which makes it less difficult to use in closer quarters on my crop body camera. It's super sharp, especially when stopped down to f2.8 and beyond. There's little to no discernible distortion or chromatic aberration. The minimum focusing distance is less than a foot, which means it behaves almost like a macro lens. What would I change about it? Not much. The only thing I don't like about this lens is the noise. It's focusing motor is loud. Almost too loud.

I replaced the 50mm initially because it was not sharp enough albeit a good construction and felt it was a quality lens. This lens costs the same so I felt it should be about the same quality even if in terms of aperture it is a bit of a step backwards relative to the f/1.4 of the 50mm... but I was wrong. The 35mm f/2 is a HUGE step backwards in every direction. Every time I put it on the camera I feel like I will break it.. it is like a plastic toy. It is small and light, which is great.

It is fast enough when the light is good, but this lens really struggles in low-light situations. It is also very soft until about f/4, effectively making it no more useful than the kit lens that comes with the newer Rebel series cameras at 35mm.Were Canon to update this lens with a f/1.8 and USM, it'd buy it again, but until then, this is pretty much a lens to pass on."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another Winner From Canon","review":"I purchased this lens because if a bid i placed for a photography job that required me to do group shots.

I own a 85 1.8 and a 50 2.5 and this is sharper than either of these. Colors and contrast are good, but not amazing. My only real complaint with this lens is that the build quality (perhaps only on my copy) was below what I have come to expect from Canon lenses. The focus ring is not super tight, moves up and down perhaps .5mm. And the lens mount is not very crisp, it feels as if it rubs into position and is slightly hesitant to lock.

It's still my go-to lens for no-flash indoor photography, or any situation involving a shallow depth of field. Its focal length is great for full-frame and crop cameras alike. The focus ring's a little lackluster, but what do you expect for the price?Unfortunately, I've started to cheat on this lens occasionally with my new 40mm f/2.8 STM pancake. Sure, the 40 isn't quite as fast, and the field of view is a little narrower. But it's very quiet compared to the 35's ridiculously loud zoom motor, and it's much more compact.Canon should consider doing a direct update of this lens.

Bernstein must have only heard this version of the 9th and the 1970s versions of the 4th and 7th, because his later cycle with the Berlin Philharmonic were rather artificial and overly-sculpted--brilliantly played as they may be.This 1966 version of the 9th is really awesome--tough and powerful. It lacks the spirituality or mystery of some, say Furtwangler, Jochum or Wand, but it allows Bruckner to be heard without overshadowing him with the high gloss Karajan/BPO sound.Not the only version to have of this great work, but a very worthwhile one, particularly for the price."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't bother","review":"This guide is very incomplete!

The illustrations are dreamlike and evoke memories of growing up and skating outdoors. The story teaches kids to work together, try hard to overcome handicaps, and to cherish the times you have together. My five year old son chooses this book on many, many story times.

I admit it's difficult to listen to this album it is a little boring some times but 75% of the album is sharp. RZA is a genius (just like all of the wu) but i'd rather hear his production spread among artists then just a ton of one artist and no others. I respect the reviewers who gave this 4 and 5 star ratings beacuse i agree almost fully with their reviews but why are people buggin out about some songs being edited (listen to silent and tell me ghost's verse is edited!)

But it appears to be lacking all expletives, is this just the copy I received here in Australia or is that just the way it is?Apart from the heinous removals which cut harshly into the flow of some songs (although the Gza himself swears very little)this is a top album, the string work on track 2 has great impact and the Gza's wit and intelligence is second to none.After a slew of weak albums over the past few years, GZA's album is a relieving masterpiece."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better beats+a meth track coulda been 1 of best albums ever","review":"The genius's rhymes are a ten, average producing hurt this album as well as only having 1 video which i can say is boring even though iv'e only seen it twice. That fact that it is boring is probably the reason i've only seen it twice.

Too bad, no exposure, no meth, o.k. beats, i guess lyrics AREN'T everything."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nesta","review":"Legend is dope. Although it lacks the rough edge like that of the original liquid swords, it has a smoother matured sound. The beats and rhymes are tight on all the tracks.

I can't believe I have slept on this album for so long. GZA shreds through this album with some of the illest rhymes, concepts, ideas, and flow I have heard in awhile.

If not for that, this CD would get 5 stars. This album is obviously not as good as Liquid Swords and is better than Beneath the Surface (which is still in my mind a solid album). This album brings back some grimy beats with exceptional lyrics, which is nothing more than expected from GZA. The best lyricist in the Clan other than, dare I say Masta Killa. Best tracks on this piece are Auto Bio, Animal Planet, Fam(despite being edited), Fame, Highway Robbery(chorus does not fit song, ill other than that) Silent, Sparring Minds, Stay In Line, and What You Know About. Pick this up if you want some real Hip Hop, not any of that 50 Cent/G-Unit garbage. Must buy for any Wu fan."},{"rating":"1","title":"What happen ?","review":"remenber listining to 4th chamber ?

This album is the culmination of Gza's best work. This is one of the few rap cd's I would actually buy because I can listen to it straight through, without changing tracks. There isn't a lack of eloquence, by Gza, on any of the tracks.\\"Animal Planet\\" is a lyrical masterpiece. Gza parallels the breakdown of our society with that of the animal kingdom. Tracks such as \\"AutoBio\\" and \\"Legend of the Liquid Sword\\" show the maturity of Rza's beats and compliment Gza's amazing flow.Overall, if you're looking to escape from all the f-ing pop rap that's being played, buy this album, or download it if you're able to."},{"rating":"2","title":"The GZA is one of the few rappers keepin it real","review":"This album ain't Liquid Swords but if it's a sequel, it's a pretty darn good one, unlike Jay-Z's Blueprint 2, which was poor. The GZA's lyrics easily make him one of the best lyricis ever, and the beats are aite. The best song in my opinion is animal planet, cuz everything he explains about the animal world, is almost like the human world. The thing that made me give it 4 stars, was that how come I have the unedited version, and they still block out some cus words, that pissed me off, and some of the beats arent so great, other than that, people need to quit sleepin on real hip hop, and get of Nelly, Ja Rule, Cash Money, Eminem, No Limit,ect. cuz they fake, and listen to something real. Those who appriccieate real hip hop should have this right now."},{"rating":"2","title":"Solid work","review":"First off I dont understand why everyone says Beneath the Surface was subpar, that album is one of my top 20 of all time, I still listen to it to this day. This album is almost as good as Beneath the Surface, best tracks are Animal Planet, Fam and the hectic RZA produced Rough Cut. It only took two listens to appreciate this album. One strange thing I have noticed is all the songs are edited, I purchased the alleged explicit version but every song is a radio edit, I knocked it down a star cause that is kind of lame. I would recommend this album to wu fans and general hiphop fans. The album has like 9 different producers but the beats are well crafted and GZA as usual comes tight on the lyrical tip."},{"rating":"2","title":"this is junior's review","review":"I think legin of the liquid sword is tight.It has bomb beats i never get tierd of it.Their floes are crazy status and if you dont got their CD then your wour's than the word wak!.For those who have it ride on.All ways remember the saga continues Wu- tang.WHAT YOU GOT ON THAT!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Almost There......","review":"The GZA is one of, if not the best lyrycist in hip hop, and this album is a testament to his incredible skills. Tracks like Auto Bio, Sparring Minds, Uncut Material and legend of the liquid sword prove that the GZA is still in top form.Lyrically, this album can stand up to the original liquid swords. The GZA now drops more abstract, intricate rhymes as opposed to the blunt on point rhymes of Liquid Swords.Beatwise, this album suffers a little. RZA only produces 1 track, and it is not a standout. The other producers do a respectable job, sampling a lot of violins and horns, but not quite capturing the essence of RZA production that was seen on Liquid Swords.I miss the Kung Fu samples. They are a Wu Tang trademark, and are imcredible for leading off a song. The GZA for some reason has decided against using them for the last 2 albums now, hopefully they will be brought back for next time.The best Wu Tang solo in years, mabe since Wu Forever"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Purple Haze Brotha of Hip-Hop & Rap","review":"I am not going to go into a long essay about this album or all the previous albums of the GZA...each album is what it is....pure Genius. To date GZA is the most gifted MC on the planet...now there may be better MC's on Mars and Jupiter, but until we touch ground on those planets, GZA is the master.Each album is a progression of fighting styles. Each punch, kick, round-house, and flip is perfected to accurate calculations that most \\"so-called\\" hip-hop heads can not even comprehend. GZA, being the lyrical martial-art master, will never use the same style from album to album.So with that said...perhaps those who gave this album and Beneath the Surface a \\"so-so\\" review...re-visit the many styles of the Wu Tang's GZA.Remember there are 36 chambers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for Heavy Chewer","review":"This item I have found is great for my Rott.

My memory of him is now completely different. I was amazed to hear of how badly he treated his wife, how controlling and manipulative he was with her. He really did only care about his music, and that's not such a good thing in this case! Granted, Joy Division's music is amazing and influential, but at what expence? Deborah Curtis was very brave to write the truth about thim. The book itself was written fairly well, has a disography, published and never-before-published lyrics, as well as color photographs. I enjoyed it! All in all, I found the book inlightning, disturbing, depressing, but full of information and insight. Thank you to Deborah Curtis for having the courage to be so candid.

His writing bore the distilled intensity of the greatest poets, best exemplified on Joy Division's posthumous masterpiece Closer, a peerless, terrifying, airless work which in its final two songs suddenly transforms into a beautiful, war-torn smile of relief, a wonderful, liberating acceptance of death.Deborah Curtis tells her story - and her husband's - with terrifific passion and urgency but with a heatbreaking, neverending determination to understand who he was and what led him to take his own life.

Also keep in mind that at the time of his death, Ian had been cheating on his wife (and was apparently quite in love with his mistress) and the couple were in the process of divorcing. Several of the members have said vague things about the book about its apparently lack of validity in many respects."},{"rating":"1","title":"Missing from nearby","review":"When I bought this book I thought I would get to know a bit about Ian Curtis, but the person who wrote this book (his ex-wife!) doesn't seem to have been living in the same country as Ian let alone the same house. 'Debby' never had any meaningful conversation with him, didn't know lyrics until after the albums were published and hardly ever went to a concert. It's not a biography of Ian Curtis, it's the depressing story of an abandoned mother somewhere on the outskirts of Manchester. You get a glimpse of the exciting things that were going on at the time, concerts by all kinds of (to me) legendary bands like The Buzzcocks, but Ms Curtis doesn't bring us any closer to the excitement. The discography and the lyrics are what makes the book worth it's money (and I bought it 2nd hand)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Damn good b-iopic...very real and visceral!!!","review":"I hate to say this...but...Ian was obviously a Manic Depressive/Bipolar casualty...but only those who suffer from the sickness like myself have any inkling of a clue about his madness...and I'm fed the \\"F\\" up with most JD fans cause they simply don't get it...this is not \\"Indi Tuesday\\" ...to make things short...and by the end of recording sessions for disorder...it was obvious that benard and Ian were on different pages...the former digging the newpost/punk british wave and Ian still obsessed with the lunatic genius of Iggy Pop...substance was unfortunately a catalyst in Ian's suicide...being unfinished, mainstream, and over-all weak in my opinion...more of my little rant to come later"},{"rating":"2","title":"The enigma lives on","review":"Ian Curtis has been dead for over 20 years but he has left an enigma that still lingers on .

But yet when it comes to Ian's suicide it is quite chilling all the same . It provides lyrics both known and unknown to us and various unfinished pieces that he was working on .

This lens is known to have some problems with backfocus or soft focus that I would guess are a product of the barrel being knocked when extended. I wouldn't carry this lens without a hood. I bought an inexpensive third party hood from Amazon and it works great."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great 50mm Prime Lens!","review":"I have used the Canon EF 50mm f1.4 USM Prime Lens for several weeks and to sum up my reaction to it, all I have to say is that the lens has not left my camera since it arrived. I am pleased with all aspects of the performance of this Canon lens. It brought me back to the days when I used a fixed focal length lens with my first film SLR, an Exakta, from the 1950's. I continue to be impressed with the fit and finish of the hardware, the AF system, and the glass. I know that some reviewers have questioned the durability of this product, but I have not had the slightest indication that it will not go the distance. As an aside, I was very impressed with the delivery time provided by the supplier Adorama. One day after I ordered the lens, it arrived on my doorstep in perfect condition. Kudos to Adorama!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic Lens","review":"As soon as I got this lens I took it for a run at Balboa Park. It helped produce some amazingly crisp and clear photos. Continually impressing me more and more with each shoot."},{"rating":"1","title":"Piece of Crap","review":"I bought this lens tempted by Amazon's price drop on it. I have to respectfully disagree with other comments that compare this lens with the L line. Just out of the box I could feel the cheap construction, mostly made of cheap plastic. The focusing ring feels inaccurate and loose, with a short play before it takes action. I returned this lens immediately. I wish Canon was more straightforward about informing customers that everything that is not an L line lens (although some L zoom lens may be questionable too) is just hopeless toys for the unaware or under demanding amateur. Serious photographers beware. This lens is NOT an upgrade from the already crappy (but at least justifiable for the price) EF 50mm 1.8 it's the same type of construction and it is not worth around [...] at all. Honest and reputable retailers must receive a lot of heat and returns of this lens from unsatisfied customers. Don't do it. Save your money for the EF 1.2 L."},{"rating":"2","title":"a great lens!","review":"If you enjoy taking portraits, this is absolutely a must lens for everyone. Love it and really recommend it!The lens is working perfectly! My only concern is regarding the delivery.. it was delivered by UPS.. we were not home and the lens was left at the front door, in the hot Florida sun. Fortunatly we just missed the person, so we must have arrived minutes after because the package wasn't extreamly hot, but I was very mad about it and if anything would have happened to that lens because of it, it would have been a big problem.In the future Amazon should make sure such incidents do not happen again, otherweise I will have to think it twice about buying my stuff here!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Still Waiting","review":"This lens has received excellent reviews so I won't repeat what others have already stated.

If you are in a hurry for this lens it might be best to look elsewhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"Canon 50mm f1.4","review":"I bought this lens 5 days ago and fell in love the instant I saw the pictures. Used it all weekend and loving the lens until I set the camera on the tripod (about a foot high)and accidentally bumped into the tripod. Next thing you know, camera & lens falls on the carpet floor. Camera was fine but the lens now doesn't want to focus. I hear the motor and the focus ring is slightly moving but feels very tight. Even though I'm able to turn the focus ring, the distance scale shows that it's stuck on infinity. I've read reviews that this is a very sharp lens but the build quality is really bad. I truly believe that now. It will cost me over $100 to fix this lens on top of the $350+ that I already spent, considering I've only had this lens for 5 days. Picture is awesome but build quality is really bad."},{"rating":"1","title":"Skip the headache and the heartache and go for a better lens","review":"I love all my canon gear. I have a 50mm 1.8 and upgraded to this as I have progressed in my photography. Unfortunately, I have had the same sort of trouble the other reviews have stated. At this point I only have had trouble with the focus under f2.2. Every shot lost in two photo shoots and I had not realized until after researching on the internet as to why.No trouble with the AF failing as of yet, but I'm pretty disgusted that I have to redo two shoots - wasting both my time and the models time. Shame on you Canon!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice lens but soft :(","review":"I had a 50mm 1.4, build quality was better then my 50mm 1.8 but not as nice as my 85mm 1.8. Has beautiful bokeh but is just too soft for my taste. I guess I got spoiled with my 50mm f1.8."},{"rating":"1","title":"F1.4 autofocus problems","review":"When this lens works it is fantastic. Beautiful pictures, great performance even in lower light. Unfortunately, it hs died on me twice (autofocus). The first time Canon fixed it under warranty, mentioning something about a cracked housing or something. The lens has been well taken care of so I don't know what that's about. Recently, it started having the same autofocus problem again. It starts by not being able to focus on close objects. Now it just won't focus at all, not even manually. The lens weighs a lot more than the 1.8, but I don't think that translates to better quality components. Everything is plastic inside with relatively loose tolerances. I probably would have just gotten the 1.8 if I knew I was getting a short-lived lens. Very disappointing. Anyone considering buying this lens may want to reconsider."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful","review":"Worth the step up from the 1.8 - much happier with this one. Does everything I want it to do."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't wow me","review":"To me, this lens is just okay. The IQ is good, but I don't know if it's $250 good (the price difference over the 1.8 version). The build quality is definitely better - it's one of the reasons I bought it, after my 1.8 practically fell apart in my hands one day. I don't find the AF any better though - it hunts in lighting where other lenses work fine, and the colors just seem flat. Maybe I just got a bad copy, and need to send it in before the warranty is up, but I find myself forcing myself to use this lens to justify the purchase. Plenty of people love it, though, so I would recommend trying before you buy, or buy it somewhere where you can return it without issue if you end up not liking it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great product","review":"Love this lens! Works awesome in the gym and outside!

Worth every penny!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic first lens","review":"Like many previous reviewers, this was the first lens I bought for my DSLR after about of year of using the two included kit lenses. While I got many an outstanding picture with them, the two starter lenses simply cannot compare in terms of image quality to this 50mm f1.4 lens. It is also much more solidly built (e.g. the grip for adjusting the focus is rubber instead of plastic and the body is much weightier). For the cost, this an excellent lens and a must for someone looking to venture into more serious photography. Take one picture with this lens and the difference between it and a starter lens will be readily apparent."},{"rating":"2","title":"BUY IT!","review":"Listen closely, you will NOT be able to replicate the same type of images with anything in this price range. Its perfect for bday parties and low light situations. An aperture of 1.4 allows you to completely own the low-light hours while producing tremendous bokeh behind your subject. I've compared images against my 24-70m 2.8 at 50mm at 5.6 (where the 50 prime is the sharpest) and its comparable everytime. Any photographer will tell you to keep a handful of primes in your bag for best image quality when \\"zoom\\" is unavailable. All for 369 dollars!

A must have for any decent portrait photographer."},{"rating":"2","title":"superb quality","review":"This was my first \\"premium\\" lens purchase, so I considered it to be quite an investment at the time I bought it. After doing research on this and the comparative lenses, I decided to spring for this one since I have started doing some portrait photography work on the weekends. This lens provides really great quality images and colors come through very brightly. I really feel that this has helped me to get some of the visual aesthetics that I've been looking for in my portrait and even macro photography. It's solidly constructed and appears to be high quality. One thing that I really love about it is that it really soaks up a lot of light, so it's ideal for low light situations if you want your pictures to be less grainy. There's a lot more to this lens than that, but several of the other reviewers have already captured the specifics."},{"rating":"1","title":"Read the One Star Reviews!!","review":"Absolutely a fantastic lens for the money - while it's working. Like many of the other one star reviews, this lens simply stopped working before it's time. I could not have been any happier and would have called this the best lens for the money - had it simply not stopped working. Mine was the same problem as everyone elses, the Auto Focus just stopped working - even the manual focus broke. I wouldn't risk it, but I must say before dying before its time, this camera is excellent indoors when shooting in natural light. I wanted to buy another, but decided to read all of the lower reviews before that decision. Turns out everyone has the same issue as mine."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful Lens","review":"This is a wonderful lens with great image quality, very fast, and very good build quality.

Best price/performance of any lens I own."},{"rating":"1","title":"Junk","review":"This lens, the Canon 50mm f1.4 promised to be a really good lens. Well, maybe it is if the AF didn't stop working shortly after I spentalmost $400 to own it. I started noticing that all my images were blurry no matter what my settings were and then I couldn't even findfocus with the MF chosen. I have been shooting with a Canon DSLR (actually had three of them) over the last six years and never had a problem likethis with my other Canon lenses or my Sigma and Tamron lenses. Canon should take this one back to the drawing board. Apparently, I am not alone asI see many others have reviewed this lens here and at the Canon web site and found the failure of the AF system to have happened with their 50mm f1.4 also.Wish I had known about this before buying this lens."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice - Depth Of Field","review":"I purchased this lens because I wanted to experiment with depth of field. After my first three pictures I am not disappointed. The lens seems to have the ability to place the background in a blur with a nice sharp subject in the foreground all that with little work. Just what I wanted. I was concerned that the sensor size in my 7D with a 1.6 crop factor might limit my ability to achieve the blurred background, but so far I'd say at least with this F1.4 lens I have no issues."},{"rating":"2","title":"Working ok so far","review":"It working quite good so far, but when you attach the lens to the camera, you feel so tight.

I'm just glad I realized it and sent it back instead of using it for years as another unfortunate reviewer stated. After returning it, opted for the EF-S 60mm macro instead for various reasons. So as long as you don't receive a bad copy like I did, I'm sure you'll love the lens."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great upgrade from the 50 1.8 II","review":"I recently upgraded from the 50 1.8 Mark II to the 50 1.4. I find this lens to have a nicer rendering when used wide open, smoother bokeh, and I like the build better (though its no L quality lens). It works well on both my 5D Mark II and my T3i. Definitely a worthwhile upgrade."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointment","review":"When this lens first arrived, I was more than pleased with the results. Even with a fixed focal length it became my go to lens for almost every situation. Within a few weeks of arrival I shot an entire session using f/1.8, and every image came out clear and crisp. After taking only a few thousand pictures over about 2 months, the quality quickly started to deteriorate. Now I am completely unable to focus (in auto or manual) under around f/2.8 or so, and even higher for subjects more than a few feet away. I'm hoping I just got a lemon, but i've seen other reviews showing this problem, although after more use. Will be sending to Canon, hopefully they can repair the problem."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Lens Quality -- but the wrong lens for me","review":"This is an incredible lens, delivering consistently great photos. Auto focus is fast and accurate. Of course, the bottom line is what kind of image quality will it dish up -- sharp, crisp, brilliant, excellent. People look at the pix I shoot with this lens and say, man, this looks professional. The only problem is, I can never back up far enough to get the right shot with this lens. Inside the house, crops are always too close. Walking down the street, if I want to take a photo of a nice house, I have to stand all the way across the street to get the whole house in the frame. I'm using a Canon D20 with the 1.6; that means this lens is a 70 mm or more. The 1.4 is great for natural light photos indoors, but it's kind of hard to make a semi-telephoto lens work for a birthday party or what have you. After a year with this excellent and beautiful lens, I'm now looking at 35 and 30 mm alternatives, because I can't make a 70 mm work for my needs."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is the best prime lens","review":"This is the best canon 50mm f1.4 available for portrait photography to very low light shooting.

And while the first couple of shots & bob atkins tests went well, in the field- just regular walkabout tests- the autofocus went from fine to WTF very quickly. I began to wonder if it was my technique, but I do much better on my 85 1.8, which is known to have blazing focus speed/accuracy. But this was just bad. At one point theres 10+ shots with focus off.Reference shots full body/ poses of 2 prospective models ALL came out blurry, even at shot speeds of 1/160. I couldn't believe it- I think the lens has real issues bas 2/3 feet. So im going to go ahead and order this lens from amazon so i will have more than 7 days to evaluate.

I sent it back."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great lens, but cheaper elsewhere...","review":"This is by far a great prime lens for folks starting out. With a prime you can focus on the rest of the key elements to photography (namely lighting and focus) instead of worrying about cropping. With a film SLR, this lens shoots what the human eyes can see (no wide angle nor tele zoom) plus the bokah is really good on this one (bokah is the out-of-focus quality, great for all kinds of photos).The negative side is that even at new, the prices here are way more than you need to pay. One could buy one of these lens for under $300 new from more reputable online stores."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the extra vs 50mm f1.8","review":"I own 50mm f1.8 and this 50mm f1.4. The f1.4 is not worth in price if f1.8 is existing.Many test were performed personally. The f1.4 time to focus is not better than f1.8 (almost same time); the IQs are almost the same; f1.4 is much heavier; f1.4 has slightly better in color, higher built quality and silent focus.For those pros in f1.4 are not my favorite to count on lense. Many reviews mention this lense is not advanced than f1.8 (I hope read them early). I recommended to buy f1.8 and save the extra.

It was OK and did a descent job of capturing low light images (small clubs/concerts) but it has lost its ability to focus. If I auto focus, I have to back far away from my subject for it to lock on and if I switch to manual focus, the focusing ring just spins and does nothing. I have not dropped or handled this lens roughly, it just seems to have give out and quit working. Even when it did work, it was never tack sharp but I shoot with all L lenses so I know this isn't a fair comparison but I have seen other images this lens produces and mine never seem to compare. So I must have bought a soft copy along with being poorly built. I am being generous giving it 2 stars. I dont think I will replace this lens and I cant see paying $1500 for the f1.2 L version either although I would to have it."},{"rating":"2","title":"I love lense!","review":"As an amateur photographer, this lens makes me look like a pro.It quickly became my favorite, trumping the kit lens that came with my Canon 40D.Bravo Canon!"},{"rating":"2","title":"It works","review":"Purchased it from Amazon last Summer to shoot indoors without flash. It works under most conditions. In really low light, the focus may get slower."},{"rating":"2","title":"Compact Lens on the Go","review":"Love the light-weight feel of this lens and the short, compact body makes my overall camera feel smaller and easy to grab on the run. I'm still learning to best optimize the blurring because it seems a bit inconsistent. Sometimes I get some really amazing shots with interesting blurs on the edges and sometimes it looks a bit flat with minimal blurring on the edges. I use it mostly to take photos of food so the shots vary depending on whether I'm shooting something small like an apple or something bigger like a plate of pasta. The smaller objects tend to lend to more blurring. But am having fun so far experimenting and seeing the results. Does work nicely in low light but not great for shooting portraits of people because you have to stand far away."},{"rating":"2","title":"Blows the kit lens out of the water","review":"This is an absolutely magical lens. I pulled it out of the box, and it is SOLID. I was a bit concerned, by some reviews I'd read, that it would be fragile and not so well put together, but anybody responsible enough to pay $400 for such a lens will take plenty good care of it to keep it working flawlessly. I'd compare the 50mm 1.8 to the likes of a kit 18-55mm as far as build, and this 50mm 1.4 is clearly a huge step up. Anybody looking for razor thin depth of field and the associated speed (especially for candids) will be thrilled to own this glass.

I absolutely love the quality of this lens and the 1.4 aperture is fast enough for most low light situations. I upgraded to this lens from the 50mm 1.8 and couldn't be happier with that decision. The only thing to be aware of with this, as any prime lens, is you may have to work harder to get the shot you want. Because my last two camera bodies have had \\"crop\\" sensors, this 50mm lens goes from being 50mm zoom to feeling like 80 or 100mm. 8/10 times I go to shoot I've intuitively positioned myself closer to my subject than I'd like to be. It's great for getting intimate portraits, not so great for shooting kids for example. I'm ALWAYS having to back up to get the shot I want.

Its not my imagination. I ran a test with a tripod and three focus cards on sticks. Very disappointed.I assume you can adjust it, but that should be the manufacturer's job.Thanks be to Amazon, they accepted a return at less than 30 days and gave me a refund.Canon should hire Amazon's Customer Service Manager. You have to like Amazon. Canon Customer Tech Support actually told me that I had to be wrong.

I loved that lens for while then I decided to upgrade to this with a bit larger aperture. The price is affordable, especially if you buy it used.The difference is only 0.4 in aperture, but boy that creates even more amazing photos! Bokeh is beautifully and effortlessly done, and the subject stays crisp sharp. I love its small size, easy to haul when traveling as I often do internationally.Though there's one more step up lens out there at 0.2 larger aperture, the price difference is simply too enormous for me. My budget is tight and I cannot afford $1200+ for this next step up lens. I would if I get into portrait business but mean time with my pet portraits, this lens is more than enough. I would rather spend $1200+ to add 24-70 f2.8 L instead!This IS a keeper lens for your camera bag, and you won't want to let this lens go for a long time!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for low light","review":"I got this because I take a lot of pictures of musicians in bars, and therefore there is a lot of low light.

It goes without saying that as a prime you are stuck with 50mm.

I loved it when I first got it because I took so test shoot in the street and the picture look must sharper than my other three lenses. The shallow deep of field is great. from F/1.4 to F/22 aperture, what can't you do? last month, I tried this lens on the sub-way station, and the lighting is just dam dim. but you know what? I can hand hold my camera and still get a 1/125s shutter speed in F/1.4. I snap shot people in the station and the auto focus worked quietly and fast. The picture is sharp.I am not rich at all, but I never hesitate on choosing a F/1.8 or a F/1.4 because F/1.4 is what I know I need as a serious photographer. You really can't compare a 1.8 to a 1.4, not in the price and not in the built-in quality."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor quality","review":"Very poor quality. It died on me twice, each time on an exotic trip - horribly disappointing! Both auto and manual focus stopped functioning. Canon fixed it for free the first time, the second time it was no longer covered by warranty. I probably took just 300-400 shots with it total! It appears that a lot of Canon products - unless you buy the most expensive ones - are having quality problems. (My lens was made in Japan, BTW). The Toyota syndrome? Would like to buy it again, hoping that I may be be lucky this time - but do I want to risk spending over $300 just to see it die somewhere in Burma or Borneo while getting ready for one of those on-my-god shots, which is exactly what happened to me TWICE?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Celestial Lens","review":"The first time I used this lens was on a wedding shoot. I read some in-the-mouth advice somewhere that said every photographer needs a 50mm prime lens to be happy. So I thought to myself \\"I'm every photographer!\\" And plopped down the $300+ for this.I was beginning to regret the decision until I used this puppy.Pictures so crisp and clear and beautiful came out of my camera that day. Pictures that need no sharpening, no photoshopping, no curves adjustments or contrast adjustments. Just honest to goodness dead sexy clar pictures.I was so happy with the pictures that I composed a poem about this lens on the spot! It goes:Oh I think that I shall never seea lens so ripe with clarityThen the 50mm which sits abreastUpon my camera's lovely chest.I now don't mind 'walking around' more, or ditching a zoom lens. This lens is Empyrean."},{"rating":"2","title":"Superb lens","review":"I've been in and out of photography for many years. I've recently compared the Canon EF f1.8 and f1.4 lens with each other (I currently own both) and made comparsions to the excellent Canon 28-135mm IS lens.The f1.8 lens is very good as well, but lacks the build quality and lowest level light gathering power of the f1.4. Additionally the f1.8 lens has a 5 vs. an 8 blade iris and accordingly blurred point light sources tend to be pentagon shaped instead of round.When compared to the 28-135mm IS lens, the difference is notable at the edge of the lens and in depth of field. Also stabilized (IS) lens reduce camera shake but do not freeze action. Accordingly, the f1.4 lens is superb for baby friendly flash free indoor photography.Bottom line is that the f1.4 lens is about as good as it gets. It has superb low light capability, is light weight, has razor sharp images and deep depth of field, produces great contrast, is very well made, very quiet and fast focusing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Canon EF 50mm f1.4 USM Telephoto Lens","review":"Good value for the price. Have not used it much so I have yet to see how it holds up."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fast and Clear","review":"I bought this lens for low light photography well the plus is it allows more light in than my EF70-50mm F.8 IS lens or my Sigma EX 18-50mm F.8 but it hunts in dark spaces in AF that is the minus. It will lock but by then it is usually to late. When shooting near wide open if you can't focus fast and accurately in concert photography you are sunk. I often use MF instead of AF. I can't use flash so I am forced many times to use MF. It is however very well built not L series well built but compared to the F.8 version it is a tank. It is also crystal clear too. So for me it is a trade off. The hunting in the lowest light is why it does not get the Th star."},{"rating":"2","title":"1.4 Lens","review":"Great Lens for low light and it is a fast lens.

However, picture-wise, I see no difference but the price and the material of the lenses. It's heavy and seems to be more durable as opposed to the plastic/lightness of the 1.8. Honestly, I use my 85mm f 1.8 more than the 50mm f1.4. But that is my opinion and I am NOT a photographer. I just like taking pictures of friends and family."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Lens Purchase Possible","review":"I was thinking about getting the 50mm f/1.8 but once I went to the store and saw it I changed my mind. It already felt like a plastic toy that was going to fall apart in my hands. The manual focus ring is non-existent. The 50mm 1.4 on the other hand is a beauty. It really feels nice in the hand especially with a metal mount I can rely on. The full time manual focus is great even though this camera isn't a true USM. The low light focus ability of this lens is decent. Although the lens has somewhat of a soft focus at 1.4 is gets sharp at 1.8. All in all great lens. It id definitely worth paying extra over the f/1.8"},{"rating":"2","title":"Familiar Ground","review":"After many years working with film and a 50mm lens, this marks a return to old habits of picture framing, and generally it has been a pleasant one. Very good to great sharpness of focus, and the typical excellent light and color qualities Canon brings to its lenses. But the feel for manual focus leaves something to be desired. The focus ring feels loose not firm, being able to be moved from side to side, and it has a gritty feel to its manual focusing, not smooth as virtually every other Canon lense I've owned has been. The result is where I would want it, but the feel of the lens leaves me uneasy. A look at someone else's copy of this lens showed these less than wonderful qualities to be even more pronounced in his. The kicker is that to get excellent build quality, you evidently have to spend five times as much for the f1.2 version."},{"rating":"2","title":"Don't forget the Crop Factor!","review":"Bought this for the Digital Rebel (300D). 50mm translates to 80mm because of the 1.6 crop factor. Not an issue for me but something for the potential buyer to be aware of. Lens works great - solid build, sharp focus, quiet motor - no problems encountered so far."},{"rating":"2","title":"50mm f1.4 is an excellent lens","review":"I use this for architecture--exteriors of skyscrapers from a moderate distance. On a digital camera, it's also a great portrait lens. The slight barrel distortion that others have mentioned can easily be corrected in Photoshop--if you even notice it. If you're shooting digitally, it's not a problem to correct. Frankly, it hasn't been a problem for me. Great lens."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice photos, but horrible build quality and failure prone","review":"Well, when it works, it takes nice shots. The large aperture makes for some pretty good bokeh for the price. However, most copies will not accurately focus throughout a range of distances (for example, mine was spot on until the subject got about 6 feet away, then it was extremely inaccurate from there to infinity). The autofocus mechanism is also failure prone and if it happens out of warranty (it WILL happen) it costs about half the value of the lens to have it fixed. You can sort of protect against the AF failure by storing the lens with the hood attached, but my copy failed while using this method. I'd go with the cheaper f/1.8, or the slightly more expensive Sigma 50mm f/1.4 if I had to do it again. Simply not worth the trouble and I've gone through three copies of this thing. All were not acceptable."},{"rating":"1","title":"canon 50mm 1.4","review":"this lens was ordered as new but came with a LOT of dust inside on the elemenst. Also was slow to focus."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great lens - arrived broken","review":"I needed to replace my originally 50mm 1.4 because it was dropped accidently by someone over the weekend. I ordered a new one and it arrived broken. The lens box was NOT protected at all in the shipping box from Amazon. It had some bubble paper on only one side. The lens was rattling inside when I opened it. Gave it a quick test run and photos were blurry and AF struggled to lock. I put my 580ex speedlite on and the shots were still not tack sharp. Hoping the replacement lens they are sending arrives in NEW and WORKING condition. The lens arrived without a packing slip too which is odd for Amazon."},{"rating":"1","title":"A $500 (or more) lens","review":"I paid $360 for this lens and for a year and a half I had no regrets whatsoever. The images are sharp and clean with no CA or distortion of any kind really. What sucks is that after a year and half the AF motor has given up, and now Canon wants another $150 to repair the defective lens. I suppose if you used this lens mostly for portraits this wouldn't be a huge concern because you could always focus manually. I, however, used it for street photography, so by the time I would finish accurately focusing my shot is long gone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great lens! Great lens for cinematography as well as portrait photography","review":"I do not regret purchasing this lens! After owning this lens for a couple of months now, I have really grown to like it. There is a definite difference between the 50mm 1.8 and 50mm 1.4. The build quality is definitely a step above the 50mm 1.8. It doesn't have the plastic type of feel to it.The pictures IMO comes out a little soft for my taste. If you're looking for an upgrade from this lens, I would definitely look into buying the 35mm 1.4L. One of my friends owns this lens and it's PERFECT for cinematography. That wide angle does make a HUGE difference in your quality of shots. just fyiOverall, I greatly enjoy this lens and is great and definitely recommend it for beginners as well as the pro photographers/cinematographers out there.(I use this lens with a Canon 7D and a Canon 5d Mark ii)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Worthy upgrade from Canon F1.8","review":"Build quality is much better than the Canon 1.8 50mm, of which i have broken two now.

But like many others have also said, the autofocus loves to break, rendering it a manual focus-only piece of glass. Mine's not broken all the time - not even most of the time - but when it does refuse to work, it seems to do it at the most inopportune times. If all you're doing is taking pictures of the kids, go for it - just remember to always rest it on its back, never with the glass facing down. That's how it gets injured, or so they say. But if you need it for weddings or other blink-and-you-miss-it events, you can't trust it.It's a 5 star lens if they ever fix this issue, but until then it only gets two."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Lens","review":"This is a terrific lens.

I've used it in many low-light situations, and it always delivers. Just be careful wide open.

Swirled with peasant discontent and royal intrigue, Westmark is the beginning of three books that chronicle the country's revolution, the meaning of war, and of course a charming relationship between the young main characters. Without hesitation one of the best children's books I have ever read and sure to be loved by both boys and girls."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"Hey Cowboy, Wanna Get Lucky?\\"","review":"I like Baxter Black - his writings and singing.

I can see this stretching or eventually failing when used in anything other than a simple interior run.The Zmodo cables look more like very heavy extension cords, with the two cables run side by side.

These problems might sound minor, but they are not unless you dont mind taking a nap while you try to insert a cd.

This was the second album I bought by him and I was instantly hooked. The music sounds more complex and intricate than Harry Met Sally and Harry's voice sounds more mature and confident. It is fast becoming one of my favourite CDs of all time. The Big Band sound is amazing and Harry's self-penned songs like 'Nowhere with Love' and 'Come By Me' are fantastic. If you even remotely liked the When Harry Met Sally soundtrack or simply like beautiful well-written Sinatra-esque songs, you will enjoy this CD. I reckon after a couple of listens you'll be hooked singing along with Harry like a trooper!

This album has the freshest Big Band feel that Harry has ever captured. After the uninspired original compositions on \\"To See You\\", I was delighted to hear him concentrate on older classics such as \\"Time After Time\\", \\"Cry Me a River\\", \\"Danny Boy\\", and \\"Love for Sale\\". The title track is simply his best original effort since the Christmas album. By the way, if you were lucky enought to see this band in concert, you heard a world-class \\"screamer\\" (the trumpet player who is designated to play all of the incredibly high notes). I don't know the guys name, but he is the best I've heard since Snooky Young was with the Tonight Show Orchestra.

There's an additional label on the front of the CD that says \\"The Return Of The Big Band\\" that mislead me. I happen to be an immense fan of the \\"We Are In Love\\" album and was really hoping to hear this type \\"Swing\\" influence in his new aformentioned release. This man truley dosent know how easy it would be for him to be \\"The King Of Swing\\" right now in America. Shadowing such artists like Cherry Poppin Daddies, Brian Setzer etc.. That weird funk influence throughout \\"come by me\\" ruins it. \\"Tracks \\"Nowhere With Love\\" and \\" Come By Me\\" are the only tracks I liked that was reminescent of that so missed \\"Swing\\" sound.

There are people who love the music out there, and the music on this CD was an \\"Well, if all else fails\\" attempt. Well, all else failed, and so was getting me back as a fan.

Back to using a big band, and mixing his newly composed songs with the standards, this is a treat. And certainly, the big band sound is not at all over-powering. Harry does some terrific piano solos. Just listen to him on the title track. Just brilliant. Plus there are a lot of magical solos throughout performed by different members of the band. And the beautiful \\"Danny Boy\\", not at all a jazz song, is given a fresh treatment thanks to some lovely orchestrations.

I would definately say that I got the most for my money. This album is a wonderful mix of standards and original works, combined with Harry's smooth, mellow voice and nimble fingers at the piano. I'm a huge fan of his more upbeat numbers. My personal favorites are Nowhere with Love (which wasn't exactly upbeat, but it did have a jazzy attitude that really appeals to me) and Come By Me. Some of his slower tunes seemed almost TOO slow at times. Perhaps a change in the order of tracks would have remedied this. I was especially disappointed with \\"There's No Business Like Show Business.\\" I like this piece upbeat, fast. However, all of this failed to detract from my overall enjoyment of the album. The point is, I love it. I will absolutely be picking up some more of his work."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great!","review":"Harry Connick Jr. is on of my favorite singers, and I was glad to see him return to his original style of singing. The first two songs on this c.d., \\"Nowhere in Love\\", and \\"Come By Me\\", and wonderful. His version of \\"Danny Boy\\" is touchingly beautiful.

Yes, there is more big band then the past albums, but it also includes romantic and instrumental tunes. This album makes you tap your foot and for those that can let go, makes you shake your groove thing. One of the best artists today that can do it all. He's a great entertainer that knows his roots.

I taped most of the holes closed and that seems to be helping although there's still too much seed falling out.Secondly, the WRONG BOLTS were included that connect the tray to the feeder. Unbelievable. 9 parts: 4 bolts and 4 nuts and the tray and they couldn't even get the bolts right!

From there the point is made that God is more interested in a man's heart than his giftings. Chapter two devotes a section to listening to God and responding to His call.

I have found this book to be invaluable. The games are beneficial for teaching and reinforcing specific skills, and they are entertaining enough to keep kids interested. Most of all, the games really work! The games don't take much time or extreme effort, but they pay off extremely well. If you are the parent or teacher of young children, you will find yourself referring to this book again and again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Does Not Disappoint!","review":"Whenever I am at a bookstore or library I always look in the parenting and education sections for books that give ideas for activities to do at home with your kids. I am usually disappointed in them. They are often too complicated, too obvious, or seem too lack real value. I have been eyeing this book for several months on amazon and was hesitant to buy fearing it would be like all the other books of its kind. Boy am I glad I went ahead and ordered it! The activities are simple yet I would not have thought of them on my own. Most involve only a pencil and paper. These activities engage and excite my child. The author clearly and simply states the reasons behind all of her games. Another little gem in this book is the authors list of read aloud book recommendations in the back. It is a short list but seems to have some great recommendations which I had not heard of prior."},{"rating":"1","title":"good product","review":"Although some of the shells were broken off of the tiki torches upon delivery, they still were a great prop for our Halloween costumes this year."},{"rating":"2","title":"Yummy, delish, satisfies the sweet tooth","review":"These are amazingly flaky, deliciously sweet without being overly so, and just plain yummy. At only 60 calories each, you can indulge. The only complaint I have is that they mention how healthy they are because they don't have butter, cholesterol, eggs, or yeast.

The sound is really clear and the bass is really strong, just as advertized. Sometimes it can even be too much, so turning the s. woofer to \\"mid\\" is better. Even at a high volume the sound is still quite clear. There are plenty of preset configurations for the EQ and there's still the manual option, for those like me who sometimes don't like the preset settings. However, the system is not perfect. :) As mentioned before, it takes a while to open/switch CD's and there's no way to know if a tray already has a CD or not. If there's only one tray empty, but you don't know which, it can take a while to find which that empty tray. It's one of those things you \\"can live with,\\" however.

I think it is much better than the more recent 50th anniversary hardcover book, because the focus is so much more on the strip. From Beetle's college days, to his progression through the Army, some of these strips are so funny that you will laugh outloud.Mort keeps his comments short and to the point, preferring to let the strips do the talking. It shows the development of the major characters, those who didn't make it, and even some censored gags, which are great!If you are a fan of Beetle Bailey, or even just comics in general, this book is a goldmine, and well worth buying."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointment.","review":"This book delivers none of the promises you may expect from its title. I simply do not understand why the author has to spend such an enormous energy to point out the superiority of the isosceles stance over the \\"Weaver\\". Do you truly care? Have you bought the book to read a history of pistol technique (from the late 20th Century to Postmodern) or IPSC/USPSA champions, or, because you would like to improve your accuracy, speed and technique? There is no suggestion how to assess or measure your current level, deficiencies or faults (Would you know, just from reading this book, if you have trouble with your trigger pull or recoil flinch?) There is no useful advice how to improve any of your problems, at the end you are not much wiser than at the beginning.

The detail that is given in this book is very basic firearms handling skills. This book is more of a how to shoot for beginners then a how to better your shooting. This book did not cover anything that isn't in every other firearms handling book I have ever read, and the skills it goes over are the very same skills you would learn in a basic firearms class."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Book for Beginners","review":"Only complaint with book is waaaaaaaaaay too much time spent bashing the \\"weaver stance\\" and praising the \\"isosceles method\\".

Andy has obviously applied a monumental amount of thought and effort into this work. The astounding thing is that he has put the theories and techniques in a direct, concise manner that will greatly assist the reader. I've purchased several copies for like-minded/like-hobbied friends and they, too, have improved tremendously upon studying this material.In fact, I enjoyed the book so much that I enrolled in his class of the same title. EVERYTHING became even more lucid. He's highly intellectual (and it shows in this book), witty, full of energy and extremely precise. The result? I'm easily twice the shooter I was prior to taking his instruction.If you only read one book of this type in your life I cannot recommend this book any higher. Same for his Surgical Speed Shooting class. They are both simply outstanding.Thank you, Andy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book","review":"Not a lot of fluff or hype. Just good sound teaching.

Much of it dwells on the natural superiority of the isosceles stance over the Weaver, but there is a great deal more here as well. It would be nice if there were a further reading list, more resources for shooters, and more material in general. Still, if you carry or if you are just interested in fast, precise shooting, this book is a great read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Surgical Speed Shooting","review":"This is a basic nut and bolts book.

He seems more concerned about making his point with Weaver fans than in actually teaching anything. He makes many statements throughout that do not inspire confidence in his advice. The first rule of life is to be careful where you get advice, and that goes doubly true if your life will depend on it. While there are some good concepts here, there is nothing that is not explained better in other books.Save your money and buy something from Gabe Suarez instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"Surgical Speed Shooting","review":"Book in great condition as promised.

This throw is worth about $12.99 in a discount store, so I did get a bargain at $4.99.

It's cheaper to get a VCR for $30 that will last a year and just use that to rewind tapes. In viewing the other reviews I see that there is a high percentage of other users who have had the same issue with Kinyo breaking after a short time of use.

No matter how many times I've listened to it, I always hear something fresh musically and/or lyrically that I missed before. I gave it as a gift to people I care about, who loved it too. I hope her next one comes out before the holidays!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Hot as hell","review":"Count Bass D remains one of the most interesting hip hop artists around. His beats are slick and polished, but dont' draw from immediate hip hop influences: there is a definite jazz vibe throughout the entire record, not just from the drums but the melodic mechanisms Count employs. Thus, the record is fresh and smooth, extremely easy to listen to and a totally enjoyable musical experience.The organic feel really lends to Count's prominence as a songwriter and musician. The record does sound like something that a formerly-enrolled Juliard musician would make: uncanny timing and smooth chord changes that harken back to when musical formulas were capable of producing bravely new sounds. This album just kicks it to a new notch."},{"rating":"2","title":"don't sleep","review":"this is probably the surprise record of 2002. a straight 5/5. beats are solid and creative. lyrics are dope too. a mostly upbeat/heartfelt album. peep 'seven years', an ode to count's wife over a beautiful beautiful beat. the album is a true end to end burner, no tracks that need to be skipped. plenty diversity that always retains freshness.and the count is definitely in the right frame of mind, a musical frame of mind. take the intro track for instance... 'jussa playa'. in the commercial rap world, that would be player in the womanizing sense...but the count is talking about the piano. yet he manages to escape the conceptions of popular rap and still make and album that could (if they actually heard it) appeal to the mainstream as well as the underground, where it is obviously getting its just props. a top 5 of 2002 in my book."},{"rating":"2","title":"the best CD by the greatest hip hop producer you've never heard","review":"I never thought I'd like a hip hop artist more than Pete Rock, Common and Blackalicious, but \\"pound for pound,\\" Count Bass D is better than all of them.If you're a fan of great music and great hip hop, get Dwight Spitz. This is the best CD to date by this extraordinary artist. Trust me and the other reviewers and buy it ... and track down his other CDs, too."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent, Not Perfect","review":"I saw other reviews about scratching, misalignment/small corking, super absorbency. As I was highly motivated by absorbency and style, we bought them and love them for those reasons. They are sandstone (which is why they absorb) - they look smooth but have a rough, sandy quality on the edges and will scratch (tested on inconspicuous area). For the most part, they will not be moved around (even with 5 young kids) so we're not worried about scratching/dropping. The corking is off center on every one displaying a lack of details, but that is not visible and again, primary use is my home office desk and absorbency is key. I'd say the choice is between scratching/protecting furniture or absorbency. Style is amazing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Coasters","review":"These are great coasters. The picture on Amazon is very descriptive of the product.The weight of the coaster keeps it in place and will not stick to the bottom of a wet glass."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed!","review":"I am very disappointed. I should have purchased the plain ones. These do not absorb as the plain ones did."},{"rating":"2","title":"Allbery is a people's poet","review":"One glimpses an amazing inner life in Walking Distance, a dark sense of humor--the real, somber music of midwestern childhood. One of my favorite lines: \\"Back then I prayed nights out of the same superstition that kept me from using the coffee table Bible as a coaster...\\" These are stories as well as poems, songs which resonate with and retrieve forgotten smirkings and smiles at the constant, odd, beautiful sadness of life. Excellent!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Incredible Book","review":"This book was one of the best books I read all summer. I couldn't put it down and finished it in one sitting. I love the way Tracy writes. He doesn't fill up the pages with a lot of detail, just enough so you could actually find the places he does describe in the Colchester, VT area. I can't wait for the next book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not Just For Twain Fans","review":"Mark Twain took a trip around the world in a Steamship and came back with a collection of his observations. FOLLOWING THE EQUATOR is a must for Romantics, idealists, adventurers, and especialy Parrotheads. Twain paid attention to details and allows us to experiance that time period around the globe. Through Twain's eyes and mind you will see the various cultures, governments and exotic adventures that he comes accross. For those lovers of Mark Twain's works, you will not be dissapointed. He is hilarious, oppinionated and very entertaining. Just like a long journey, the book has a few slow spots. Over all, you won't won't to put it down. FOLLOWING THE EQUATOR will leave you entertained with a wealth of thoughts on history, philosophy, sociology and just good old adventure."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the money","review":"I purchased one of these rewinders because I wanted one that was good and would last. The first one I got died in a couple of weeks under mild use. I returned it and got a second one. It seems to work well, but isn't very fast. I wonder how long this one will last. Considering that this is a very expensive rewinder I expect much better an wish that I had just gone with the cheapest one available as it would probably be better."},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT BUY","review":"This was a terrific buy, on sale! We've gone through so many video rewinders with four kids. This one is very heavy duty."},{"rating":"2","title":"video re-winder","review":"The Kinyo rewinder works very well. It is used in a school library and gets a lot of use. So far it is much better quality than our last one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Smooth, Quiet and Efficient","review":"So far so good. Rewound a dozen tapes the first day, and found it to be very smooth and quiet, with no evidence of uneven winding present on most of the cheaper ones I have owned in the past. 4 stars only because it is a \\"1-way\\" rewinder. Why can't Kinyo, or any other manufacturer for that matter, produce a heavy duty 2-way rewinder? This product looks exactly like the ones you see at the mom and pop video stores. It appears to be of \\"commercial grade\\" quality."},{"rating":"1","title":"You don't always get what you pay for!","review":"I thought I'd \\"splurge\\" and spend the extra bucks to get a heavy duty machine. I've always bought the little $10 models, which last only 3-4 years at best. This Kinyo Commercial rewinder was broken right out of the box. Dead. Nada. What a disappointment. On the bright side, though, Amazon has the best return policy in the world. What a company!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great little work horse","review":"I bought this rewinder over two years ago, almost three, to save the built in rewinder in my television VCR. I use it daily, twice a day to rewind tapings that I have done from the night before and then again, after I have watched them. It have haver failed me. Works great each and every time. Put tape in when I start to make the bed. By the time I'm tucking in the bedspread, the rewind is complete and ready to pop back into the VCR. Would highly recommend this reliable rewinder."}]`),D={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:C},data(){return{visibleCount:6,poemsData:x,isLoading:!1}},computed:{visiblePoems(){return this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(o=>setTimeout(o,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=6,this.isLoading=!1}}},B={class:"card-container"},O=["disabled"],M={key:0},N={key:1};function W(o,e,n,u,r,s){const c=w("PoemCard");return a(),i("section",null,[e[1]||(e[1]=t("div",{class:"top-banner"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🎉 Your SNAP 🥳")])],-1)),t("div",B,[(a(!0),i(f,null,y(s.visiblePoems,(h,m)=>(a(),p(c,{key:m,poem:h},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),s.hasMorePoems?(a(),i("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",disabled:r.isLoading,onClick:e[0]||(e[0]=(...h)=>s.loadMore&&s.loadMore(...h))},[r.isLoading?(a(),i("span",N,"Loading...")):(a(),i("span",M,"See more"))],8,O)):b("",!0)])}const H=d(D,[["render",W],["__scopeId","data-v-800feb41"]]),P=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"guide/23.md","filePath":"guide/23.md"}'),R={name:"guide/23.md"},G=Object.assign(R,{setup(o){return(e,n)=>(a(),i("div",null,[v(H)]))}});export{P as __pageData,G as default};
