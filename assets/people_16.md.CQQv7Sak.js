Looks like it has a serious design flaw: almost every time when you print something theprinter cleans its ink cartridges. Even if you print a plain black and white document it cleans ALL its cartridges which takes 3 to 5 minutes. Needless to say that it's extremely frustrating to wait for a few minutes to have a one page document printed.Furthermore, this unnecessary cleaning of cartridges forces you to replace them quite often. And the cartridges are not cheap!Another design flaw, in my view, is that after the printer runs out of color ink you cannot print black and white documents. Although I used this printer for less than a year, I am so frustrated with it that I am going to get rid of it and buy a new one, most certainly not a Brother brand."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing on the durability","review":"Purchased this item about 18 months ago. Printhead went out on the black making it useless unless we change the color on every document to colors other than black. The printhead was $1$$ plus shipping $$$, and I elected not to purchase these items. Instead I opted for a new printer (HP the psc 2210).What makes me really upset with these manufactures is that they are clearly making it impossible to consider repairing the product and creating so much waste for our landfills. Two years for a life time on this item isn't what I thought I was purchasing, and knowing that I'm contributing to global polution doesn't help matters either :("},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh, Brother!","review":"\\"Piece of junk\\" is too kind!We have easily spent more on ink cartridges than we did on the printer. We have yet to print one ream (500 pages) but we have replaced the black ink cartridges about 10 times, and they cost [$$] each. Maybe wedon't print often enough and the ink dries out, but I'm avoid printing to save on ink."},{"rating":"1","title":"Will never buy Brother again.","review":"I had the printer exchanged by Brother a week after I got it. It's been trouble all along with the ink consumption and now the printheads are no good. The yield on the ink cartridge is too low for it's price. Tricking the ink sensor eye by using black electrical tape helps but may shorten the life of the print heads.Very disapointed at Brother for putting out such low quality."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another BAD Brother...","review":"Has anyone tried to get Brother to fix theirs, since this an obvious bad printhead and defective to the core? I doubt they will, but I asked them to pay for it anyway. Haven't heard back. Ours worked great while it worked, I do a lot of old genealogy pictures, etc., and it worked fine, and printed the pictures back out in good quality, didn't really fax, my girl printed lots of color pictures, and they seemed okay too, but now with the black line of doom, I don't think too much of it and no service center near us."},{"rating":"1","title":"If I could give it zero stars, I would.","review":"The Brother MFC9200c is a piece of junk. Sure, the thing cleans the heads almost every time I print; everyones had that problem with the attendant time and ink wasting that involves. And, yes, the ink cartridges are a rip. However, there even more problems:I just tried connecting, via USB2, to my two-and-a-half year old laptop which uses the XP OS. First, Brother makes you do back flips to connect via USB. Second, older versions of XP don't support Brothers MFCs. Also, you can't load them directly from the bundled CD. There may be a patch somewhere, but I won't bother looking for it (besides, it's likely to make my computer crash or lock-up.)Brother is second rate, the follower in both technology and, often, price, behind HP. Basically just a, \\"me, too, me, too\\", company. I'll spend the $175 (about half of what I paidn for the MFC9200c) and get the HP5510."},{"rating":"1","title":"Being Sent Back","review":"Looks good, but very poor quality printing, took ages to set up using windows me, and then the scanner didn't work at all. USB set-up didn't work either. Swapped it for another make which was set up and working properly in under 30 minutes. I think it definately has problems under windows ME."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do NOT buy this!","review":"The ink usage of this printer is outrageous. I have bought at least 20 black ink cartridges so far, some of them I put in right out of the package and it told me 'Black ink is out'.This happened to me the first time around and I contacted Brother, who send me a new printer. This one did about 20 pages in the first month or so (I don't print that much), then it told me the Black ink was out again. The next cartridge, once again right out of the package, told me 'Black ink is out' too. I tried several more, some printed for a little bit before giving me the dreaded message again, some didn't print out of the package. This even happened with genuine Brother cartridges (at $20 a piece)!I finally gave in and am trashing it. I have ordered the CANON PIXMA MP780 instead. Will never buy Brother again!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a long-lasting printer","review":"I've had the same experience as several others. My printheads are all causing horizontal lines on the pages I print and the cost to fix will be over one hundred dollars (I suspect the printheads all need replacing). I've had this MFC for a little over 2 years. I don't print to it often, so it has to clean the ink cartridges every time, which takes several minutes. I also have to replace the cartridges quite often. Unfortunately, the Brother printers are the only ones I can get through my work program. Otherwise, I would definitely get something other than a Brother printer. I've used Epson and HP laser printers and love them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Misrepresentation by Brother","review":"Potential buyers with WIN 2000 systems should be aware that the CD ROM software that comes with this unit is not compatible. You can download updated software from their web site, but no WIN 2000 compatible software is yet available for the PhotoCpture Center, one of the unit's main new features. Buyers are supposed to keep checking the Microsoft web site for it. All of this in spite of the fact that the unit container and even this site declares it fully WIN2000 compatible. This is a misrepresentation of this unit's capabilities. In addition, buyers who need technical support from Brother will have to wait two weeks or more for help. They are swamped, because many people have difficulty with downloaded software installation as compared with the normal automated CD-ROM process."},{"rating":"1","title":"This unit not Windows ME compatible","review":"I can't rate all of the functions since the only thing I could do with this machine was stand-alone copy. It performed very well and very quickly, and also collates. I tried to install the drivers and software on my brand new Dell Dimension 4100 computer which came with Windows ME and after trying to restart the computer, Windows would hang up. I have spent over 5 hours on the phone with the Brother support people trying to resolve the problem, and they finally referred it back to their software unit. After waiting for 2 weeks and getting no response after several more phone calls, I returned the unit and gave up. I bought this unit because I wanted all the features, but it just won't work with Windows ME at this time."},{"rating":"1","title":"This unit should be recalled by the manufacturer ! ! !","review":"The manufacturer knows this is a horrible product and should recall and replace them. Ours needs a new print head after VERY little use over the past few years. As the other people stated, it is extremely expensive to have the printhead replaced. Consumables are outrageously expensive too. HP is the way to go. Stay far away from Brother products."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good water filter","review":"This unit was easy to setup and works well. The water taste changed for the better and the smell of the water is changed. I use this in conjuction with a brita water filter. I try not to buy bottled water and the combination of the brita and water guardian help in reducing the number of disposable plastic bottles. Considering bottled water quality is questionable and water quality locally is good, using local tap water to satisfy thirst is considerably cheaper using this beefy filter.In terms of water filtration, it is difficult for a laymen to tell the difference between filters but using the filter definitely reduces oder and changes taste.The reason for the 4 is like the previous reviewer, I had one of the attachments that diverts water fail on me. I will have to try and call them to get that fix, but overall water quality is improved."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hand Tool won't open housing unit to change filter","review":"This is my 2nd multi-pure. The stainless steel ones were much better. The Hand Tool won't open housing unit to change filter. It's supposed to fit into these grooves to form a tight seal and nudge the unit open but the hand tool is too loose and the knobs just slide right out of the grooves. Basically, I just bought a $70.00 filter replacement and I can't open the unit. Incredibly frustrating. Bad design like this makes me wanna go postal."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fast delivery, product as advertised","review":"This battery arrived in very quickly. It ia as advertised.

Best tracks: Pure Pleasure Seeker, Remain The Same, Time Is Now, Mother, Sing It Back. Enjoy it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A True Classic","review":"Moloko are one of the most original and experimental dance acts out there and this is, no doubt, very evident on this landmark album. Roisin Murphy's voice is breathtaking, full of emotion, and texture which makes her one of pop's and dance music's most interesting personalities. Many of the songs here are difficult at first, but work very well as an entire album. \\"Things To Make and Do\\" is definately for more creative listeners, so if pop and pop only is your kind of bag, then this probably won't go over too well with you. \\"The Time is Now\\" is the standout track here, which, in my opinion, is one of the best dance records composed in the last decade (Mixmag magazine readers agree). What's even better is that this CD is full of lyrical depth as well, which is a rare thing for dance records, but let's not forget that dance is only part of what is Moloko. The inclusion of club favorite \\"Sing It Back\\" is a definite plus. I can't wait 'till the next album."},{"rating":"2","title":"A really cracking album.","review":"The most interesting and arresting thing about this band is their quirky creativeness. The songs here are an odd and ambient collection (forever the soundtrack to a marevellous Greek holiday for me now!) Each track has it's own distinct style and personality and yet each is catchy, infectiously melodic and lyricaly, just the right side of sane.Murphy's voice is full of range and surprise, it can be harmonious and completely shock at once.Really great and different stuff, a delightful break from the mainstream, I defy you to find any bands doing similair stuff!Highlight tracks are the beaty and heady, \\"Bring it Back\\" and the deliciously insightful \\"Absent Minded Freinds\\", a wry look at modern relationships."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very touching, helpful and moving book!!!!!!!!!!!","review":"This book moved me to tears. Mrs. Vanderveen is a very talented writer. She explores the many emotions a grieving parent goes through- even the ones most people are afraid to acknowledge.

The story is childish, the characters are shallow and promiscuous seemingly obsesessed with having it off with each other as quickly as possible.After putting up with the mushy idiocy of the main characters Shane & Rebecca, the advent of the good time souls \\"Josh and Giffen\\" was just too much - this book is now in the bin where it belongs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Find Something Else To Learn Clairvoyance","review":"I see there are some highly positive reviews.Honestly, I cannot understand why.

Where are the exercises and instructions you promised me Panchadasi?!This book is as far from an experimental manual as far could be.He gives only the shortest of instructions, as if in a passing manner.He may be good at using the abilities, but he certainly is lousy at teaching them.Skip this book.

It was a AURORA AS701X-MS which failed last week, original cost, about $50.00. I just opened the Fellowes PS60C-2 which I ordered from AMAZON.COM and was so impressed with it, within the first 60 seconds of unpacking (heavier and more ruggedly built than the AURORA) and use, that I felt compelled to write this review. The first thing I did was to feed it 8 pages, the max stated capacity. It chewed it up without even straining. The AURORA was rated for 7 sheets max but strained with even 4! I consider this to be an excellent shredder for home or maybe even light business use. If you think that paper shredders for home use are expensive, check out some business shredders, several thousand $$ is not uncommon."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as \\"heavy duty\\" as you think!","review":"You would expect a $150 shredder to at least be able to do the job expected. My shredder was not even 2 years old when it gave up. All I used it for was occasional old bill shredding. I can certainly say that the machine was not abused: I avoided staples, even though it supposedly can handle them. So after less than 2 years, one of the gears simply broke, rendering the machine unusable. I don't think I would by another expensive shredder from Fellowes. The cheap ones may last the same amount of time, but at least I am not out $150!"},{"rating":"2","title":"good and bad","review":"With all the news about potential ways to have your identity stolen, I finally decided to get a shredder. During my investigation, I realized that the only kind to buy is a cross cut. Strip shredders simply don't seem anywhere near as secure. The Fellowes PS60C-2 works like a charm. I've only had it a few weeks and discovered two problems. First, the shredder is heavy enough to be awkward removing to empty the supplied container. It also completely covers the opening making it necessary to either purchase another can for bulkier trash and items not needing obliteration or reaching under the desk to \`carefully' lift it off to gain access to the can. The instructions say the cutters should be oiled once a month. The company could have included a small tube of oil to get started. I am, by the way, very happy with my purchase and really do feel more comfortable when I shred old bank statements, etc. instead of tearing them into little pieces."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can't get it to work","review":"I am envious of the all the people who were even able to get this model to work.

Yes, we have oiled it per instructions. Every once in a while it will work (10% of the time?) and we don't know why; the next time we go to use it, the red LED light is back on and it won't operate. It's been a nightmare.I would never recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Junk","review":"After a little more than a year this piece of junk broke down.....customer service said it was the gears and wanted about $25 for a repair kit (includes outrageous postage).

We oil the blades once a month and it still doesn't perform. The machine never took 7 sheets like it is supposed to. We have in the end been only able to shred one sheet at a time. one at a time still doesn't work well. The clear window is great to see when full. However, we use a trash bag. When you pull the trash bag out the window rips it. We have to be very careful each time. When you take the top off the shredded mess always goes everywhere. The top part is heavy hard to use. A good purchase for $40 and under. Not a good purchase for the listed price."},{"rating":"1","title":"DO NOT BUY THIS SHREDDER!","review":"I bought this shredder to replace a Xerox model that I had that recently stopped working. I believe this one was at least twice as expensive as the Xerox; however, it is inferior in at least two respects. First, even though I believe it is purported to be\\"heavy duty\\", it labors more and has more problems shredding the same amount of paper as compared to the Xerox. Second, it doesn't shred the paper as finely as the Xerox did - what comes out are strips about 2 inches long - it is not a crosscut shredder.The point is there is no reason to buy this model as there are are cheaper models available that perform better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buy it from someone else","review":"Amazon.com makes the shipping cost hard to calculate.The cost will be very high."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shred?

When I contacted the company about the warranty and about suggestions as to why it just STOPPED, literally, they never responded to my requests (via E-mail_, and unfortunately I was never able to make contact with a live body via telecommunications.Bottom line, I would not purchase again, and at present have not replaced the shredder. I'm almost convinced that if you don't spend a fortune on a shredder they are just a waste of good money. : ("},{"rating":"2","title":"Good unit","review":"While not perfect this is a good unit. As other reviewers have said if you shred for too long (20 minutes or so) it will shut itself down and then you need to unplug it and let it cool off.

I have been using it just about six months on a regular basis, any thing with sensitive information is on its diet!

The dings and dents may have been from the horrible packaging but aside from that, they still appeared to have been used. Also, the description stated they operate at 45 PSI, this is not true. Each gun has \\"Max PSI 20\\" etched in on the side. When it came to spraying, I could not get it to spray properly. The PSI might be the issue, I didn't notice the \\"Max PSI 20\\" until after I gave up.

This hasn't been released in the uk yet so i bought it in advance and glad i did. The best of the bunch are \\"I want to with you\\" which is a great opener with a good upbeat pop/rocky sound to it - simular to a michelle branch track i would say. \\"Something's gotta give\\" is very catchy to sing-a-long to as is \\"I got it bad\\".Her vocals also are used better on this album, as i was disapointed before that such a mature distinctive voice on a young woman was not used to her advantage.

Like the title reflects, it's a failed attempt by her to make a mark on her own. Sure, she has a voice but the songs she does are \\"HO-HUM\\" at best. There will NEVER be another \\"BLUE\\" and she knows it. The reason that got her recognized so much is because she sounded so much like the late great Patsy Cline. Singing Patsy Cline hits NOT hers!

I dont categorise music that much as many others here and everywhere, like \\"is it real Country or not\\", who cares--only 2 kinds of music--good and bad and this is very good! Many different stylings which keep us from getting bored, as with other artists albums that put you to sleep or bore you after one or two listens--or you start skipping songs more and more with some albums also!

Her voice has really matured, resulting in an even better LeAnn. She can no longer be viewed as a \\"little girl\\" but rather a young woman.I have most of LeAnn's albums and was happy to add this to my country music collection. \\"Nothin bout love makes sense\\", and \\"I want to with you\\" are sure to make an impact on everyone who listens. The entire album is great, but those two are my favorites thus far. If you like LeAnn pick up this CD you'll be glad you did."},{"rating":"2","title":"Leeann sounds great on this woman","review":"I love this CD. Leeann Rimes has always had a great voice, but the lyrics in her songs are more mature now. All of the songs on This Woman are awesome. My favorite track on this album is Probably Wouldn't Be This Way. It is a beautiful song about moving on with your life after someone you love dies. Leeann sings this song with such feeling and emotion. I love this song. Something's Gotta Give is an excellent song about waiting and hoping for the right person to come into your life. I think a lot of people can relate to the lyrics of this song. I also like the song I Want To with You. This is a very fun song that Leeann sings with a lot of energy. Some People is a very pretty song about feeling so fortunate about having someone in your life you can love and trust. You Take Me Home is another standout song on this CD. This track is about how someone can make you feel so comfortable and at home. Leeann sounds great on this woman. I highly recommend this CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"I LOVE LEANNE","review":"Finally, a LeAnne Rimes album I can listen to all the way through without hitting the skip button. I was really looking forward to her last album (Twisted Angel). I liked it, but some of the songs were just so boring. Even her beautiful voice could not improve them. This one is pure country (not that I am a country music fanatic) and it is wonderful. \\"With You\\" is my personal fave and I can't stop listening to it. \\"Some People\\" is another great one. As is \\"I Want To With You\\". \\"It Probably Wouldn't Be That Way\\" is yet another great ballad. This one is a keeper!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Pop-Country and more","review":"Leann goes back to her country roots a bit in this album. Which I must admit disapointed me a bit. But, her voice lives up to all expectations. The album isn't a compilation of sound-a-like tunes either. There's a great Bonnie Rait style track, I Got it Bad, mixed in with a variety of country styles and cross over tunes. If you like pop-country or are a Leann Rimes fan you'll enjoy this album.After having listened to this album a while, I really think that vocally she is stronger then ever. It also feels like she's finally found some peace in her life and its coming through in the music."},{"rating":"1","title":"You Call This Country?","review":"This is your typical country cd. About 2 good songs and the rest are not worth hearing. Luckily, I did'nt pay full price for this one. Too bad for Leann. She has a nice voice, but it is wasted on this weak material Those who like this stuff don't like real country music. I don't think those people, or Leann herself, would know a real country song if it bit them in the butt. If anyone knows of a female country singer who can actually sing a real country song, please let me know. Please, no Shania Or Faith Hill. Those gals are selling sex, not music. I don't care how a singer looks. Should'nt the focus be on the singer's VOICE instead? Don't show me another pretty face or more cleavege. You HEAR music, you don't SEE it on the radio."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sticking to her true country roots","review":"LeAnn sure has came back to Country music..this album is the bomb! I think it is better than any of her other previous albums. My favorites are Something's Gotta Give, Won't Be Lonely Long, Nothin' Bout Love, Probably Wouldn't be this way, The Weight Of Love, okay okay, I thought I could name a few but I couldnt..the whole album is amazing! I am so glad Le is sticking to her true country roots and giving her fans a true country album. I traveled almost 1 hour at 7am just to get her cd..I can't put it down, its that good! Thank You LeAnn for this amazing album and for your lovely voice and beautiful soul!"},{"rating":"2","title":"'This Woman' is all grown up!","review":"This is by far the best cd that Leann has done. I adore this cd from start to finish. This album is wonderful and I would recommend it to everyone I know and already have to some. It is a perfect mix of ballads along with upbeat songs with no track fillers. Every single song is single worthy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Am I listening to the same album?","review":"I am not sure I am listening to the same tracks as the other reviewers, but I keep hoping LeAnn will someday feel \\"it\\" again. This CD is a continuance of the modern country pop that has lots of everything but feeling. Remember the first time you heard \\"Blue\\"? You thought, I have to meet this woman, then you found out she was 13! What was in that song was feeling(and of course LeAnn's voice) Later, \\"These Arms of Mine\\"( I may be the only one that has heard this song) had the feeling again. It may take a few divorces and soap opera like situations for LeAnn to feel it all the way, but when she does the music industry may just stop for a while and be amazed. It is in there and it will come out someday........slickrick"},{"rating":"2","title":"Definitive record for Rimes","review":"Now I'm not much of a country music listener. I don't listen to any guys because I find that they all sound about the same, but certain females --like Shania Twain and Faith Hill-- catch my hear now and then; LeAnn Rimes is such. Her Grammy-winning performance of \\"Blue\\" at the tender age of 13 certainly garnered her attention, but it has been her great taste in music that has kept her at the forefront on the country music industry. Her powerful chops don't get much better than on This Woman, her 2005 record that brought back the return of country to Miss Rimes' repitoire. \\"Nothin' 'Bout Love Makes Sense\\" is surely the best country song to come along is a LONG time; its simplistic, summertime-like chords make this a definite No. 1. Other songs that standout are \\"I Want To With You\\" and \\"Something's Gotta Give.\\" Sure, these songs may sound a little pop-ish at times, but that's not the point: The point is that our little LeAnn has definitely grown into This Woman."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Cd from leann rimes as off yet.","review":"i always really liked leann rimes voice, but unfortunatly i never really liked any of her former cd's(i own 2 of them). none of her song was especialy good, or appealing to me... but still i really liked her voice. and with this cd she finally has some songs that i like! from beginning to end, she sings her way through one great song after another.... and she has sorta grown into the songs she sings as well. there is not ONE track on this album that i don't like. they all seem to have a good quality or two to them... the song \\"Probably Wouldn't Be This Way\\" almost moves me to tears, not only is the song beautiful in and of it self, but the way she sings it is perfect. BRILIANT!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Tremendous Voice, Tremendous Album","review":"LeAnn has put together a sound that is like no other on the radio with this album. Strong country roots are apparant throughout the production, but elevated by and integrated with blues, southern rock, and hints of R/B and pop. Her voice has matured so much over the years, adding even more depth and power to an already phenomonal talent. This IS by far her best album. Buy it guys!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This Woman Rocks!!!!","review":"This album is amazing all the songs are so good.If you like Leann you will definently love this album.Here voice is amazing on this album so pure and powerful and just plain beautiful.

Barbara Delinksky once wrote a book called \\" A Woman's Place\\" and it was excellent. It was about a successful businesswoman's attempt to regain custody from her whiney, jealous ex-husband. It was gritty and real and showed the prejudice against a woman who wants a career and children. Then along comes this piece of pointless fluff \\" For My Daughters.\\" It might as well have the Harlequin symbol on it, for it was just as mindless and stupid as one of those trashy love novels. Three daughters travel to their mother's recently purchased summer home and there they either find - or rekindle - true love. Zero points for originality, zero points for dialogue which at times is laughable, and zero points for an unrealistic, sugar-coated plot.

A pretty bold claim (I know), but I recently read BB King's autobiography, in which he states that this is his favorite album. After checking it out, I can see why he says this: the album is very sparse, relative to his other albums. Mostly, it's recorded with a backing combo of just bass, drums and piano (and very occasional backing horns) and the result is that it's the true \\"essence\\" of BB King, just him and Lucille with the backing band. On most of his other albums, the production is much more \\"layered,\\" with a heavy dose of a \\"big band\\" sound, and you just don't get to hear the man himself and see what he can do when he really stretches out on his guitar. This album is a real rarity and expresses the true essence of his art--if you like BB King, then this is an absolute must-have album."},{"rating":"1","title":"wrong game geniuses!","review":"I'm sorry, but you say the game is Who Framed Roger Rabbit, but you show a pic of a completely different game!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best","review":"This is definetly one of the best Barney Adventures ever created.

Not exactly physically abusive, although he does shake the heroine once when he's upset, but definitely verbally and emotionally abusive. And the heroine falls in love with him the first time he storms into a room accusing her of being a deceitful, lying baggage.What's that all about? I can't stomach romances where the man is a jerk and the woman loves him anyway. How's that romantic?

For example the author fails to provide proper information on the basic gas welding set-up. He starts with opening the valves and skips to lighting the torch, completely by-passing the installation of the regulators and properly leak checking the complete OFW system (bottle valves, regulators, lines and torches), not to mention the importance of blowing out the talc new hoses contain. This is just the OFW side of the book and there isn't enough space here to cover the MIG/TIG side.Wanting to learn to weld?

It taught me several things and removed some mis-information that I had from limited experience. It removed false information I had gleaned from experienced welders. If you are learning to weld it is great.If you have no experience whatsoever, you may want a very basic book so you learn how to turn the welder on or set up a gas welder. This book is a must-have."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent for beginner but error in describing Alclad.","review":"p.47, top left picture and section 'Aluminum Oxide'. All aluminum surfaces will oxidize unless protected by a film or chemical treatment. Alclad material has had a layer of some other alloy mechanically bonded to the surface of the core alloy. The layer varies from 1.5% to 15% of total thickness depending on the particular core alloy and product. The clad layer should not be removed as weldability of the product depends on the core alloy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I expected!!","review":"This book does cover all types of welding processes but shows absolutly nothing on the techniques.

It has a lot of mis-information, incomplete information and half truths.It has plans for some pretty poorly engineered trailers and other devices. After seeing his diary of a project toward the end of the book as a filler I realized that this was the same Finch who wrote the old Corvair book in the 70's and also had a project diary in the end as a filler.

The author covers all the essentials and does it in a manner that keeps you interested. Safety is of prime importance and this is emphasized throughout the book. I received my copy two weeks ago and have been through it twice, it will become a regular reference for my use. Mr. Finch repeatedly mentions the importance of mastering Gas Welding, or at least becoming comfortable with gas welding, before going on to other types welding. This is important and can not be stressed too much. With gas welding he points out, heat, heat, heat and control of heat is all important. Another important factor for any weldor, as pointed out throughout the book is Practice. You can not go wrong with this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"weak at best","review":"I think the book spends a lot of time telling what the author has accomplished as a welder, and little time talking about how to weld.

He claims, for example, that the Bearded Vulture is incapable of carrying tortoises aloft (which it does regularly), and that the Asian Black Vulture is the largest vulture in Africa (it is the second smallest, out of nine species). I find it disturbing (if not surprising) that the Sierra Club would fund such a poorly researched and blatantly inaccurate volume.

It's defense of marriage is not well explained or justified, and it may build up to unrealistic expectations from one's partner or even a sense of hopelessness to the realizations of the out most human experience of love and sexuality. From my point of view, it seems a bit conservative and does not provide much help to those seeking to get a closer and true understanding of who we are, as individuals and as partners."},{"rating":"2","title":"saved me","review":"This book helped me and my husband deal with the most difficult time in our lives.

There are absolutely no advantages, whatsoever. It's financially risky and, quite frankly, who wants to wake up to the same ugly mug each morning. 55% of all marriages end in divorce. The actuarial risk tables and statistical analysis don't lie. If you don't get married you really don't have to worry about these issues since being monogamous is not natural anyway. Moreover, it's pointless."},{"rating":"1","title":"Blames the unoffending partner","review":"While this book does a good job of letting you know that ALL of the feelings that you are having about your cheating partner are valid and other people have them too, this book goes on to ask you \\"what did YOU do to contribute to your partner's infidelity?\\"I found this to be rediculous because all I ever did was trust him, obviously to my own dismay. This book doesn't really give you the tools to try to forgive and learn to trust again. It basically says to decide if you want the relationship and then suck it up and let the past be the past.In my own assessment, if we don't learn from history, we are doomed to repeat it. The past cannot just be left to be the past. It needs to be forgiven, but NOT forgotten.

Nor does she understand the great health risks placed on the victimized partners in this age of AIDS and other awfully stds."},{"rating":"2","title":"You must buy this book if one of you has been unfaithful","review":"It is almost as if this book was written for my wife and I. She has been having an affair for the best part of a year and I have known about it for most of the time. I could not understand why she would not stop. Now I know why, and understand that it was not my fault. I have learned that I am not worhtless or useless or unattractive. I also recognised how my behaviour had changed while squirming with anguish and despair, and how to get my life back on track. You will relate so much to what this book has to say and it will help you come to terms with your situation, make some decisions about what you want from the future, and plan how to get your partner back - if that is what you want. I sent a copy to my wife and she has come back to me. The turning point was reading sections of the book to her over the phone. I cannot recommend it to you enough."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not my favorite","review":"I was not impressed by the advice in this book.I think no two affairs are the same, neither are all waywards or all betrayed spouses.Her approach seemed to be very one size fits all.Maybe it will help some people but it doesn't help all.The old adage of bad marriage=affair needs to be looked at again.Sometimes there are seriously messed up people that have affairs and fixing the 'broken marriage' will NOT fix them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disagree with main premise","review":"I read this as the betrayed spouse at the request of my husband (his counselor recommended it). I completely disagree with the author's statement that both partners must take the appropriate responsibility for the affair. I had absolutely nothing to do with the affair my husband choose to have. I do take 50% responsibility for the state of the marriage prior to the affair, but in no way am I responsible for my husband choosing to drop his pants with anonther (married) woman. I have been in the same marriage as my husband and I choose not to break my vows, why would I shoulder any responsibilty for the poor choice he made? Because of the author's opinion on \\"sharing the blame\\" I found it difficult to finish the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Psychologically horrifying","review":"What Dr. Spring describes as \\"normal\\" is traumatic stress. And as a matter of hard, cold fact, a substantial proportion of victims of infidelity continue to suffer PTSD symptoms--emotional numbness, autonomic hyperarousal, nightmares and other sleep disturbances, consequent disruption of social functioning, and more -- for years. This is \\"normal\\" only in the sense that it is normal to suffer damage from trauma.Telling you that your post-traumatic symptoms are \\"normal\\" strikes me as the crassest sort of pandering."},{"rating":"2","title":"A comprehensive self help book!","review":"It's really comprehensive.

I suggest taking this book back, getting a refund and seeking real counseling or a better book."},{"rating":"1","title":"For the woman","review":"I am a man and there are very few books directed at men who were cheated on by their wives.

It had not progressed to a physical act yet, but he was making plans to leave me for her. I promised my mother I would give him a second chance and so we entered counseling. This book was recommended by our phsychologist. I found many references and tips in this book that were \\"ah, ha\\" moments. Many things in the book related to our circumstances, and some didn't. But overall both my husband and I found it a useful and valuable tool during our healing process."},{"rating":"2","title":"excellent reading if you want to fix the damage","review":"My wife and I both read this book after I had an affair, the information and advice are very good and very accurate to how we were both feeling.

I wandered if I was being too \\"whatever\\". I hated and loved her. I wanted to kill/ignore him. I admired/despised myself for how I was handeling it. What is the normal response to such a revelation? After the Affair told me exactly how and what I was feeling and also told me that these things were normal. The book helped a lot. We are still together, but only physically. Emotionally, we have a long way to go. Because of my wife's abuse as a child, she is struggeling with who she is and what she wants. This book explains a lot about this as well. The other part about these reviews was that I could e-mail other readers and ask questions and discuss their experiences. My wife also read it, and it helped her to understand how I felt as well as what she was feeling.

Rosario Dawson sucks and should play britney spears, not Mimi. I gave the original 5 stars and this one. OMG. Mimi should be EDGY not GLITZY. I feel bad that Daphne Rubin Vega had to watch her awesome part be ruined by Rosario Dawson's \\"valley girl\\" voice. As for the original cast, especially Wilson Jermaine, their voices almost matured too much.So in the movie recording, Angel does not sound sweet anymore.

Aside from Seasons of Love, the album is farily lackluster. Although the singers do a good job and their voices are decent enough to get by, it's not enough to bring the songs up to snuff. I'm fairly disappointed because I was really looking forward to buying this soundtrack. The tunes are boring and the lyrics are neither innovative nor expressive enough. I don't know if anyone would be willing to buy this whole soundtrack just to get one song. Hoepfully, a single will be released if it hasn't been already.For all of you Rent fans out there I'm sorry. I had to be honest!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This is the most AMAZING cd/soundtrack EVER!!!","review":"Okay so I'm a renthead already, but honestly this is BETTER in my opinion than even the Original Broadway Cast recording!!

This has a much edgier pumped up rock tone than the OBC recoding, and words simply cannot describe it, its just one of those things you need to hear :) The vocals are as near flawless as it is possible to get- and even the two newbies who werent in the OBC, rosario dawson as mimi and tracie thoms and joanne, are incredible!! Honestly, I could go on talking about this forever but instead I am simply going to say that I recommend this cd to anyone and everyone who loves, or even just likes, amazing rock music and to anyone who really appreciates over-all great music!

I still love this show and I love this recording because it gives a new perspective. My only dissapointment is that the music seems to have lost its harder edge, it is still a rock musical but it is just not as rough around the edges as it was. The cast is wonderful though and I was surprised to like Traci and Rosarios' preformances.

You know, the good ones. With that said, I loved the way this film translated to the big screen and now, as a Rent-head I can watch it whenever I can.

I just hope the movie is not as weak as this offereing. Just never takes off. The original Broadway recording has spark and fire. This one sizzles every now and then. The vocals (with a notable exception) and the muscians are very good, but they just don't soar. It is like they are holding back. The pacing is also a little slower. The biggest distraction in this cd are the vocals of Anthony Rapp. This guy can sing, but do we really have to hear him gulp for air before every phrase? After a few listens I just couldn't stand it. Usually they will edit that out of a recording. Can't figure out why this got through or why he doesn't have better breath control by this stage of his career.Love the music, love the show, but am really dissappointed with this cd.

Overall I must own for musical fans."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent -- much better than the stage play","review":"Four and a half stars. The singers absolutely shine. The production is superb -- really, they should have done so much more on the original. It actually sounds like ROCK music where appropriate, instead of show music with a few rock trappings, and show music where appropriate. Also, the vocal parts are brought out better and much easier to hear. I have new respect. And it's not a \\"Seasons of Love\\"-fest. I was so afraid they were going to beat what is probably the best song to death in the movie. Thank God they had some restraint.One problem: autotune on some voices, which was really obvious, even when I was watching the movie. They did this on the original cast album, but I was hoping they wouldn't do it here. Oh well. That hardly spoils what is otherwise a fantastic recording. If you like the original, pick this up."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great job","review":"All who were involved in this cd should be so happy and proud - it is a great adaptation of the OBC musical. The arrangements are more powerful and will probably translate better on film than the original recording - stage and film are different mediums.Some criticism: it has lost some power at great moments; some of the performers sound very tired, and Rosario Dawson's vocals are definitely altered and mixed. \\"Christmas Bells\\" is terribly missed, but songs like \\"What You Own\\" and \\"Rent are awesome. Anthony and Adam sound great together.Tracie Thoms and Jesse Martin are as good as gold - \\"Sante Fe\\" is so charming, and anything that Thoms sings sounds wonderful.Definitely worth the purchase - just different than the OBC for Broadway."},{"rating":"2","title":"Review for Petals of Life: A Survivor's Writings by Candice M. Martin","review":"Petals of Life: A Survivor's Writings by Candice M. Martin, is a beautifully presented collection of poetry in rhythmic form covering many important facets of life. Through her poetry we not only see the effects of abuse, fear, and insecurity, we are also inspired by the love, trust, risk, faith, and hope.Often there is one special poem that stands out, but many in her collection touched me deep. \\"Heart Whispers\\", is definitely full of desire and joy of love seen in her poem, \\"Love's Rejoice\\".It is through her abuse, and pain we understand; through her love, faith and triumphs we find hope. She graciously shares her life's journey providing hope for those who strive to survive, and brings awareness to others. This is an important read which I highly recommend."},{"rating":"2","title":"Must Have","review":"Very touching and hard to put down. Mrs. Martin's words stir up many emotions, truly touching the reader. I wish this writer much success in the future and am looking forward to reading her future writings. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A girls's book: plain and simple!","review":"I do not recommend this book for families that have concerns about their child being exposed to stories about pagan gods. It is a safe read for young girls other than that concern. Only one part in the book was predictable and a bit dramatic, but it is still a good story about a 13 year-old girl who finds a mystery surrounding her family while she is on holiday in Sweden.This book first caught my eye because I once owned a Gotland pony and a Gotland...I won't spoil the book for the reader!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Don't read this review, just press \\"order\\"","review":"With this CD, I received it as a birthday gift from my mom, and although I had the import Reprise CD already, I had to be objective and reason that this CD must be specialIt was.I can't believe that I'd become so fond of a collection with fewer tracks and only a few additional new tracks that I didn't already have.My personal recomendation is that you buy it. Yes, you will tell me, another marketing thing, and, I will tell you \\"may be\\" but, at least this one is great.The songs are perfect - Immenso Sogno, tutto sei per me, All or Nothing, and Did You Ever, the added songs are superb, though I would have included That's Amore and Bohemian Rhapsody from the original Reprise. I cannot find any complaint with this CD.So, what are you waiting for? Stop reading this useless review and press the ORDER button"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great new singer of this century","review":"Like so many other Watson fans who will buy this CD, I have all of his recordings, but I am always wanting more of this exciting singer. This is a singer that immediately catches your attention and when you listen, you can't get enough of him, whether he's singing pop or classical.Reprise has new Watson packaging, and a new arrangement of songs for Russell making each song his own. Example: All Or Nothing and The Living Years. Pretty much ditto for the others.The result is a wonderful album and maybe the best yet for Watson. Put this wonderful CD on the player, put your feet up, and be reminded why he is one of the great new singers of this century."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst vocal recording I've bought","review":"I'd like to vent my disappointment and frustration here, for I have in this album the very worst vocal recording that I've ever bought! The singing is unspeakably ugly and the performances are anti-musical. I can honestly think of no positive attribute to this recording."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a tenor","review":"It's misleading of Russell Watson and his record company to claim that he is a \\"tenor\\". I've listened to this cd and has come to the easy conclusion that Watson is neither a tenor nor a geniune classical singer.The reasons? Watson's narrow voice range and the small size of his voice (he can't perform without amplification) renders him merely a crooner instead of a real classical tenor. Besides, he doesn't have much flair in performance, too, for his renditions are all musically clumsily to the extreme.If what is represented in this joyless recording is real classical singing, then even a piece of ordinary plastic can be considered as 999 karat gold!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Non-competitive","review":"This album is not competitive at all in the cross-over market.When singers like Bocelli, Safina, Frangoulis and Groban can offer better vocal qualities and more charming interpretations, Watson is just like a bull in the china shop in this kind of music. Such insensitive singing destroys the songs that he attempts to sing. Besides, Watson doesn't even have all the notes for such songs.A bad recording which should never have been released."},{"rating":"1","title":"None of the tracks work","review":"I am afraid this album really is quite worthless. None of the tracks work at all. Not only is the singing itself bad. There is a general lack of musicianship in the performances, which are also boring and uncommunicative. To be honest, I think this album is a complete failure."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst album of the year","review":"This must surely be the worst album of the year. The singing is just so bad! There is also a total absence of interpretation. Terrible recording."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst of the 3","review":"This is the worst of the 3 albums that Russell Watson has released so far. It appears that the performances of Watson has gone from bad to worse. Even the voice itself has become much weaker. I can't imagine how he will far if he releases yet another recording."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't live up to the hype","review":"Having heard such a lot about Russell Watson over the past year, I bought this new recording once it was released. Imagine my great disappointment when I discovered that the singing is bad. Actually, very bad! The sub-quality performances here certainly do not live up to all the hype heaped on the singer, which I now understand is just a marketing ploy and the words by die-hard but musically barely rational fans. I will not recommend this recording to others."},{"rating":"1","title":"A substandard recording","review":"There can be no doubt that this is a substandard recording. Russell Watson can't even sing properly - he suffers from pitch problems and is unable to sustain any long phrase. Some of his vocal gimmicks are contrary to the music as well as good taste.His brand of crude and vulgar singing does not appeal to me at all. Worse, his interpretations are similarly defective and unsavory.Definitely a recording to avoid."},{"rating":"1","title":"wasted effort","review":"I was reading the reviews of this CD and agree with both the 5 star and the 1 star. Watson is a truly remarkable and gifted singer. I loved his \\"The Voice\\" and was looking forward to enjoying this album also. Unfortunatly it was not to be for 2 reasons.Reason #1 - His diction coach needs to be fired. NO ONE rolls their R's like that unless they are trying to learn how to roll the r. Josh Groban figured it out with almost flawless diction. Listen to Granada sung by Placido Domingo to understand what I mean when compared to Watson.Reason #2 - After the diction coach has packed up the producer needs to go. I felt that many of the songs were over produced. By that I mean that some felt that they were movie preludes. Star Wars, The Magnificent Seven, etc. The production of an song or album is suppose to add to the music not take away from itRussell, lose the anchors that dragged this CD down and go back to a previous incarnation. I will carefully preview the next CD before I buy it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow! Wow! Wow!","review":"Wow! Wow! Wow! And I recommend it to all Russell Watson fans seeking 60 minutes of glorious music. You won't be disappointed. This CD ....and the voice!...exceptional. This man has it. Everyone who buys this Cd will realize it too."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst recording that I've heard","review":"I can only give this album a single star as this is the worst album that I've heard. The singing is absolutely unacceptable. Very bad. The singing cannot even produce an even sound. Appalling!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst cd I've ever heard","review":"Having listened to well over a thousand recordings, many of which being vocal recordings, I must say that this is by far the worst that I've ever come across.Nothing here is right: the voice, the technique, the style are all bad or inadequate. There is almost a total absence of musicianship. In fact, I found the singing annoying or even disgusting from a musical perspective.Not recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"This album deserves more than 5 stars","review":"I just love listening to Russell sing. Never before have I heard such great talent from any singer. He just brings the music alive. Fantastic control when he sings opera and great switch of voice when singing pop. Thumbs up."},{"rating":"2","title":"Every track worth listening to","review":"There isn't one track that's not worth listening to. You can't say that about most of the CDs you listen to. For me the song \\"Core \`ngrato\\" is worth the price of admission. If you've never heard Russell Watson, here's your chance, and you get to hear about this singer everyone's raving about."},{"rating":"1","title":"No talent, no voice, no technique, no encore, no reprise.","review":"Obviously, a lot of the reviewers who gave this album five stars don't have very good musical taste. Why settle for Russell if other tenors out there have the most creamy and delectable voices accompanied by the most gorgeous musical techniques? This album was recorded in bad taste, and Watson gives the blandest renditions of some of the world's most wonderful arias. The man should stick to boyband pop. He doesn't have the kind of vocal beauty or talent to tackle something as grand as opera. Of course, his fans simply were taken by his airhead looks and not his voice."},{"rating":"1","title":"None of the tracks is good","review":"To be honest, none of the tracks on this cd is good. In every case, Russell Watson's precarious singing and monotonous delivery disappoint. I think this singer should really take more lessons in singing before turning out such substandard stuff, for this is artistic irresponsible."},{"rating":"1","title":"Musically very substandard","review":"There is almost nothing to praise about this recording. Musically, it is bad. Very bad, actually. Russell Watson has failed to do the music justice, and his strained renditions are unpleasant. He also doesn't seem to know what he is singing, for his delivery is monotonous. One of the worst recordings that I've ever heard."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boooooooo","review":"I am 18 years old attending a music Conservatory and I can sing this reperatoire better .... not to mention the scores of others who can and have recorded it. Someone explain to me why you listen to this... Its tragic.It is some of the most nasal singing that I have ever heard. Quick, high breaths lead to a strangled and worbling sound. This is confounded by sdome of the loudest and most bombastic orchestration that I have ever heard. Neaopolotan songs are turned into Wagnerian clipps.The most pathetic is an attempts at the arias... very strangles and very weak. There is, however, a solid voice at the core and the odd thrilling high note.Russell Watson is a pop singer, his classical voice is nasal and uncomfortable...."},{"rating":"1","title":"Appalling singing","review":"This is definitely the worst vocal recording that I've ever bought. Russell Watson's voice is not too pleasant. Unfortunately, his total lack of singing skills renders her performances a complete farce. None of the track here is satisfactory from a musical viewpoint.I will give this one star."},{"rating":"1","title":"An unworthy reprise","review":"Having given us 2 very badly sung album, Russell Watson now makes an unworthy repirse with this new recording. The singing here is, unfortunately, even worse than before. It seems that Watson's vocalism has actually declined over the past 2 years instead of improving.A forgettable album by an untalented singer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrifyingly bad","review":"The worst singing I've ever heard is embodied in this recording. Russell Watson just don't have the voice and emotional intensity for almost all the music that he has chosen to sing. The result is hoarse vocalism and uninvolving performances.A thoroughly bad recording."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not real tenor singing","review":"I'm afraid what is featured here is not real tenor singing. The voice of Russell Watson is too small to be a classical singer. His voice range is too narrow and his top notes too precarious to be called a tenor. Besides, there're other obvious flaws like a shortness of breath, suspicious intonation, unclean attack.As a vocal recording, this is far from satisfactory. In fact, it merely let one knows how not to sing and how much harm a lack of technique and musicianship can do to the music.I can only give this recording at most one star."},{"rating":"2","title":"bravo watson","review":"Watson is just spectacular.There is no other singer like him out there. A thought for those who hated this album......didn't you listen to the samples before buying the cd????...DUH....I think its really dumb to just buy it and then regret later, and give miserable one star reviews. To me, Russell has matured as an opera singer and the added bonus of course is his talent in singing pop at the same time. A truly magnificent singer and I'm very sure he will go very far. Can't wait for his next album. A highly recommended cd to buy regardless of age."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just the Best","review":"Seeing all the great performers in the past for many a year only two come to mind as perfection Judy Garland & Russell Watson - both could blow U away with talent but Russell took it to the top in the concerts I've seen him perform.With this CD, I can relive his live performances. As in his live concerts, I experience a performance I will never forget - one of a total control over everyone with a hypnotic and unforgettable experience. JUST THE BEST."},{"rating":"2","title":"high quality","review":"this is a very high quality album despite what the one star reviewver said....in my personal opinion, russell has matured as an opera singer, and his ability to change from classical to popo is an added bonus...the selection of songs in the album is a bit limited, but the quality is there...and i highly recommend it to anyone who wants to hear cross-over music....a truly deserved 5 star review.."},{"rating":"2","title":"RUSSELL IS FOREVER, AND FOR ALL","review":"This is a great album to add to your collection for all music lovers and fans looking for bright new singers.YOUNG PEOPLE WHO DON'T KNOW RUSSELL'S CAREER CAN DISCOVER THIS FANTASTIC SHOWMAN WHO SHOCKS HIS AUDIENCE EVERY TIME HE'S ON STAGE.RUSSELL IS FOREVER, AND FOR ALL."},{"rating":"1","title":"A complete musical farce","review":"I'm amazed that the singing on this recording is so bad. Russell Watson, clearly an amateur, cannot even give decent performance of even the simplest music on this album. Instead, his excruciatingly effortful delivery and his unmusical responses make this recording a complete musical farce. I won't be recommending this recording to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ugly Singing","review":"I hate the singing on this album. It's just so ugly! The performances are unmusical. In fact, almost anti-musical as the singer merely belts out everything at high volume without any sense of phrasing and style.Very crude performances. Unworthy to be released."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unmusical recording","review":"I'm afraid Russell Watson only offers the looks but not much substance in his singing. This is an unmusical recording in the sense that the performances are not up to vocal standard the the renditions are musically distorting and also charmless. I don't like it at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can't recommend to others","review":"I can't recommend this cd to others. The singing is just too bad. Russell Watson's singing is clumsy and unmusical. He fails to deliver the essence of the music. Such a kind of singing is very disappointing, and even annoying.I think I've already over-evaluated this cd by giving it one star."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst singing that I've ever heard","review":"This is certainly the worst singing that I've ever heard. Russell Watson cannot even sustain a note smoothly. Much of the singing is unacceptably rough and ill-formed.I don't like this cd at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"No good at all","review":"I'm mystified by the praise accorded to this album. To my ears, Russell Watson's singing is very coarse and unrefined. He has trouble in hitting some of the notes (both high and low) and to maintain a phrase. He glosses over some of the more intricate parts of the music and doesn't attempt to inflect the words or to create any sense of a coherent interpretation.To me, Watson's performances fall so far short of the mark that they cannot be recommended as mature music interpretations. I will award this album only one star."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do no like it","review":"I do not like the singing on this cd. It is so vulgar and coarse. No charm whatsoever.I will give it a single star."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't find it at all good","review":"I'm disappointed by this album. First of all, the selection of music isn't that wise. Secondly, the performance of Russell Watson is plainly unsatisfactory - he is unable to infuse a sense of life into the music.Frankly, I have little interest in listening to this album again. I certainly won't recommend it to other people."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sending shivers down my spine","review":"Russell Watson's singing often send shivers down my spine. The reason is that his vocalism is so haphazard and insecure that I'm afraid his cracking every time he approaches those high notes. I think Watson himself also senses his own technical shortcomings and his top notes are always approached tentatively, often accompanied with a most ugly switch of resonance position.I'm afraid most pop singers (and also members of decent school choirs) are able to singing with more security and artistry than what one hears on this recording."},{"rating":"1","title":"Uncontestably bad","review":"Just what kind of singing is this?This recording is uncontestably bad. The singer, who doesn't have the requisite technique to perform the songs chosen for this recording, embarrasses himself all the way through the music. He also glosses over a lot of music details, including difficult passages which he no doubt cannot negotiate, making his performances a virtual travesty of the original.This kind of recording shouldn't be released at full price."},{"rating":"2","title":"This man deserves your attention","review":"Russell Watson's performance on this CD proves time and time again that he is fast becoming a great classical singer. I have listened to many male singers and this you man truly deserves your attention!From the first song he sings, \\"Santa Lucia\\", to the very last song, \\"Recondita armonia\\", he captured my undivided attention with the majesty of his voice, his artistry, and poise. This CD is a must-have for all fans who love Russell. His performance on this CD proves that he is indeed the \\"people's tenor\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"I like this album","review":"The one star reviewer can say anything he or she likes but in my frankest opinion, this is the best album ever by Russell. There is nothing wrong with the selection of tracks and I am certain Russell's voice complements them all. A well worth album to purchase."},{"rating":"1","title":"Recording that deserves no marks","review":"This terrible recording surely deserves no marks.Russell Watson's performances here are abysmally bad, whether in terms of pure vocalism or interpretation.I certainly won't recommend such a poorly produced cd to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Watson's singing continues to decline","review":"I think it is quite obvious - Russell Watson's singing in on the decline. Not that he has shown impeccable technique or musicianship in his first recording. In fact, his singing is already quite disappointing in \\"The Voice\\". However, in this newest album, his performances have become musically most appalling! None of the songs here are even adequately performed. The sound that emerges from the singer's throat is consistently abrasive and unmusical.As a vocal recording, this really is terrible."},{"rating":"1","title":"A musical disaster","review":"As this is an audio recording, I'll only judge this product through the sound that I hear from playing it. Handsome faces play no partly in the assessment whatsoever.So, what did I hear on this recording? Sad to report, I hear a hour of appalling singing and bland performances. Russell Watson, who claims to be a tenor, is evidently not one. His voice doesn't have the amplitude and range for a true tenor. Besides, his technique is so fallible that people who're familiar with the music will worry for him at every turn of the phrase. Unfortunately, such worries are often justified for the number of vocal blunders that Watson commits is legion.I won't recommend this substandard recording to anyone. After all, there're much better cross-over vocal albums in the market. It is not necessary to waste one's money on such a bad product, unless one wants to hear how badly Watson's singing can be."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not recommended","review":"There are just too many problems with this CD for me to recommend it to others.The singing of Russell Watson is terribly substandard. Not only is his singing stressful and ugly, he probably doesn't know how to interpret the different kinds of music shoved on him by his record producers. As the result, the delivery is effortful to the extreme, robbing the music of its charm and effect.This recording isn't up to par whether in terms of singing or interpretation."},{"rating":"1","title":"A musical failure","review":"Honestly, I think this album is a musical failure. None of the tracks are properly or even competently sung. In many cases, Russell Watson has simplified the music and ignored the dynamics. Unsatisfactory."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poorly sung performances, not recommended","review":"No matter what standard one uses to judge the performances in this cd, there can only be one conclusion, that these are poorly-sung performances. The singer, who hasn't got much voice and is very deficient in technique, isn't able to do any justice to the music.I won't recommend this cd to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Appalling singing","review":"The singing on this album is appalling! Russell Watson cannot even hold a note properly and securely. His performances are mannered and emotionally contrived. They're also technically very defective.Absolutely horrifying musically!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Singing with a bad technique","review":"The only thing I can hear on this album is bad singing. Russell Watson's technique is obviously bad. In fact, it's so bad that he cannot deliver any of the songs with conviction. The performances are lifeless and monotonous, too. I will give it only one star."},{"rating":"2","title":"just plain beautiful","review":"1st., I would like to lodge a complaint.My name is Marjorie Moore, and I am from Downey Ca., but someone has attached Lisa Niles name with my add. and she is understandably upset. Please correct this. Thank youRussell watson has no compitition as far as I can tell.I play his music, then play the same music by someone else , and his is so superior there is no comparisonThis new album is no exception- it is the best that music can be."},{"rating":"2","title":"Essential Watson CD","review":"We now encounter Watson on his USA Reprise CD with his interpretations of the great classical songs such as Core \`ngrato, Santa Lucia, The Pearl Fisher's Duet and La danza. The Voice is as grand as ever, maybe even stronger, less vulnerable.If Watson invested his heart and voice completely in these songs, he has even done more so in the very moving Did You Ever. This album is not a bad album by Watson standards (and a GREAT album by any other standard). The songs on this CD has given Watson something to chew on, and he sounds absolutely great throughout.The orchestrations are especially pleasing, and this album, as in all his Cds, will keep you listening to every single track unlike most CDs you buy.This is an essential Watson CD, well worth a listen."},{"rating":"2","title":"Russell is just sensational","review":"What a voice!!This cd tops it all. My personal favourite is immenso sogno. There is just something in his voice that really touches one's soul. In addition, this album shows Russell's maturity in the music industry since he did co-write some of the songs. He truly deserves the title king of cross-over music. There is certainly no one like Russell. A first-class cd and I highly recommend it to anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"No longer strictly a jazz fan, Watson made me change","review":"Usually I do not like this kind of music. However, after listening to clips of \\"Core \`ngrato\\" and \\"The Living Years\\", I must say that I have slightly changed my mind. It is not so much the much the music in itself that makes this album great; it is Russell Watson's wonderful vocal ability. He also brings a sense of intensity and emotional load to every song that is quite rare. I will definitely buy another album to listen to songs other than the jazz, and easy-listening pop that I'm into."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is an appetizer!","review":"Every track here is special! There are some new songs here that I've never heard before but after hearing Watson sing, it seems I've heard these songs forever.Go for it! The only thing is, this is just an appetizer, and you may find yourself buying all of Watson's CDs for a full course!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A memorable listening experience","review":"I strongly believe that for every emotion or experience or love-related situation you can be in, there is a Watson song that could explain your feelings perfectly. That's saying something, especially since he's singing Italian and classical music too. At this time, mine is \\"Core \`ngrato\\". Listen to it, you'll know how I feel.I love all of the orchestral arrangements. NO song do they fit better than \\"The Pearl Fishers' Duet\\". The deep, beautiful strings really create the sensation of emotion and love.In summary, everything including the cover art (my favorite picture) works. Buy if you're looking for a memorable listening experience."},{"rating":"2","title":"Watson has done it again","review":"Another masterpiece by Russell. He just gets better and better. Great selection of hits and that voice....just blows me away. My personal favourite is tutto sei per me. Nothing beats Russell and I'm really looking forward to cd number 4."},{"rating":"2","title":"Watson is all class. Spectacular CD!","review":"Watson is all class. The man can belt out any type of tune, and put his stamp of authenticity to any recording. The one that does \\"it\\" for me is \\"The Pearl Fishers' Duet\\".Very dramatic, emotional and beautiful. You feel as if your walking with the crowd and the goddess appears before you.Spectacular!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Watson's puts his soul in his Songs","review":"I have always been a fan of Watson. I have listened to him through the years. This album is the best compilation about his most powerful performances.Each of his Cds, including this Reprise album, he has had the freedom to do what He does best: Just put his soul in His songs.I believe no one can hear this album and not feel touched by Russell's inmense talent."},{"rating":"2","title":"Impressive","review":"Bravo to Russell for yet another job well done. This album takes one to another dimension. When Russell sings opera, he has such a rich voice, and when he switches to pop, he is able to sing with that smooth and sexy voice. Now that's what I call talent."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sensational piece of work start to finish","review":"This CD has Watson revisiting songs he had recorded earlier on the import Reprise CD. He has added four new songs on this CD, replacing That's Amore, Ave Maria, Questa o quella, Nothing Sacred, I don't Know How I Got By, among others. The import Reprise was released about a year ago and although many think it's his best album yet, the sales has not been close to his Encore or Voice sales.Many of my friends have this CD and have worn out their copies. Now we have the USA Reprise and it is a sensational piece of work start to finish. He is in superb voice and seems intent on giving Decca the best he has to give.His wonderful rendition and the warmth that oozes out as he sings Immenso Sogno, Tuttosei per me and All or Nothing tells a lot about the measure of the man who is known for his dedication to worthwhile causes such as Kristy's Francis House and WAFUNIF. Watson is a talented singer with the highest moral standards"},{"rating":"2","title":"Listening to Watson, another enjoyable day","review":"I grew up with my mother's Russell Watson records. Somehow, they were the only ones that survived all of our moves from England to the USA and became a link with home. Even now, after being on my own this past year, hearing Watson's rich tenor voice and whatever pop voice he chooses to sing, transports me to evenings at home when I was in England.Quiet evenings, no TV available, filled with Watson's voice and, another enjoyable day, Conducive to thinking, and feeling, and remembering. This album is no exception. It's a shortened version of his original Reprise CD and has some newer pieces, such as All or Nothing. But it's a gem... beguiling, warming, lyrical and haunting.There's nothing like Watson for a long, quiet evening at home, alone or with friends, and complete with a friendly glass of amber liquid."},{"rating":"2","title":"5 Stars...Always for Watson!!!","review":"Of course I gave it 5 Stars......it's WATSON, for God's sake! And even if it is a rehash, of the original Reprise CD, it's still a beautiful collection of the \\"Voice's\\" work.My only regret is that he didn't keep \\"That's Amore\\" on this CD. I miss hearing his wonderful and smooth voice that made me just sigh like a teenager. Well, we can't have everything."},{"rating":"2","title":"Watson at his best","review":"Luckily, I've got my own precious copy of my favorite Watson album, but I urge you to order this USA copy now. It is Russell Watson at his very best. The music is grand and sweeping, but also intimate and understated when they need to be.In the added song, Did You Ever, Watson will sweep you off your feet with his moving rendition of this beautiful song. \\"The Pearl Fisher's Duet\\" and \\"Core'ngrato\\" are so fresh, and Russell is so majestic, we easily forget the original versions of these classics. Now they are Russell's songs. The same is true for \\"the Living Years\\".The entire album is beautiful and exquisitely crafted, with Watson in top-notch voice. Oh this is glorious! Get it before your opportunity wanes and sinks out of sight"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not satisfactory","review":"I don't find this album to be at all satisfactory. The singing is very bad, as the singer has a severely defective technique, and the musical arrangements are tasteless and overdone.A most unmusical recording."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not enjoyable at all","review":"I find this cd to be not enjoyable at all. The singing is, as some have commented, very bad. The singer's performances are amateurish to the extreme and none of the songs here are adequately done. I think the singer should take some more basic singing lessons before turning out another substandard album."},{"rating":"1","title":"No good at all","review":"I've heard a lot of words about the singer, Russell Watson. However, I'm completely disappointed by his singing in this album. His performances are technically substandard and also charmless. I'm bored by his singing. Even my teenage son has expressed disgust at such poor singing!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst vocal album I've ever heard","review":"As the title suggests, I'm extremely disappointed by this album. The singing is of a very low standard. The performances lack charm. Everything is done in a monotonous and unimaginative manner.This certainly is singing at its worst!"},{"rating":"1","title":"From bad to worse","review":"I've listened to all 3 of Russell Watson's albums. His performances have gone from bad to worse. This latest recording features Watson in excruciatingly bad voice. He cannot attain an even tone and fail to sustain phrases consistently. Such a kind of bad singing shouldn't have been released commercially."},{"rating":"1","title":"Acutely disappointed by this cd","review":"I'm very disappointed by what I heard on this cd. After read all those positive commentaries here, I expected that Russell Watson must be a fabulous singer. The truth is that his singing is much worse than the crooning of most people at the karaoke!Indeed, Watson's fails both as regards technical matters and interpretation. His singing is rough and inaccurate and the performances are charmless and stolid.Can't imagine a bigger disappointment from a vocal recording."},{"rating":"1","title":"An album with little value","review":"This is a shame. I don't understand why a amateur singer with little voice can be signed up to release an album which contains music that is totally beyond his abilities.Watson's weak voice, which gives lie to the fact that he is a classical singer or a tenor, fails to do any justice to the music. Besides, his performances are boring and colorless, without any sense of life in them.In my opinion, these performances completely misrepresents the music, and give a reductionist and distorted view of the music. In fact, much sublime music is dumbed down by such a cavalier and unprofessional approach.One can only view such a kind of ill-considered and inartistic venture with scorn."},{"rating":"1","title":"Woefully inadequate performances","review":"Some people may find Russell Watson's singing to be terrifc; I just found it terrible!As can be plainly heard on this cd, Russell Watson's poorly trained (untrained?) voice cannot cope with the demands of the music. In many cases, he has to resort to breaking up long phrases in order to survive. His high notes are a trial every time, and he misses out on many of the more subtle elements of the music. In fact, even the timbre of Watson's voice isn't at all pleasant and he doesn't appear to be a very sensitive artist.As a result, his woefully inadequate performances fail to bring any pleasure to me. In fact, this cd contains some of the worst singing that I've ever heard.I cannot recommend such a recording to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst vocal release that I've ever bought","review":"This recording comes as a great disappointment. After all those good things that I've heard about Russell Watson, I'm shocked to discover that this poorly sung album is actually the worst vocal release that I've ever bought!Russell Watson doesn't have a beautiful voice at all. On the contrary, his voice is small in size, limited in range and abrasive sounding. He has little breath control and has to cut the phrases brutally to suit his limited technique.Watson also has no eye for detail, for the many subtle elements of the music and text elude him totally. In treating the vocal lines as mere tunes, he reduces some great music into mere melodies for a crude hour of karaoke.His performances are utterly charmless. I've never encountered a more uncommunicative singing before whether live or on recordings.All in all, an appalling release of little music value."},{"rating":"2","title":"Russell Watson 101","review":"This is a great introduction to Russell's work. Everytime I play it, friends say with enthusiasm: \\"Who is that\\"? The selections are fabulous, showcasing his outstanding (unsurpassed) classical interpretations (with some very classic pop tunes - The Living Years, my favorite and also some wonderful semi-classical songs - \\"tutto sei per me\\", \\"All or Nothing\\", and \\"Did You Ever\\".The arrangements on this album, as usual for Russell's career, are classics, better than anything around today and some of the best for the past.This is a must buy for music lovers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful","review":"Russell never fails in making beautiful music with that voice of his. I have all his albums and I must say this tops them all. The selection of tracks suits his singing style and this album depicts the maturity of his voice throught the years. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Simply no good","review":"I don't like this recording at all. The singing is simply no good. Watson's voice is weak and trembly, and his performances are boring. I regret buying this release."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor singing","review":"There's no doubt that the singer on this album is poor. Russell Watson fails to do justice to the music. In some cases, he can't even sing the notes properly.This is an album of little artistic value."},{"rating":"1","title":"From bad to worse","review":"It is sad and disappoiting to see that a performer has declined rather than matured. Unfortunately, this happens with Russell Watson, whose singing in the latest album is even worse than the previous 2 releases, which are, honestly speaking, already very bad.There has been a clear decline in both the quality or the voice as well as the manner of singing. Although some of the music in this album isn't too difficult, Watson still botches the job. None of the tracks is at all pleasing to the ear, in fact.Why can't the singer make some improvement, no matter how little it may be, before embarking on another recording (and money earning) venture?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor singing, bad performances","review":"There is little doubt that the singing on this album is of poor quality. Russell Watson's limited vocal and emotional range renders his performances to be technically deficient and charmless. These kind of performances won't appeal to any who have even the slightest experience in music appreciation, for there're lots and lots of similar albums out there which are much more satisfactory."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ugly singing","review":"I'm disappointed by this cd. The singing here is simply ugly. There's no sense of style and no trace of a musical mind in operation. Everywhere is just plain loud and unsubtle singing. No shouting.It's depressing to hear good music being trashed like that."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unacceptably bad","review":"Just what kind of album is this?Although it's meant to be a sort of cross-over album, it doesn't mean that the singing can be that bad! On the contrary, these cross-overs numbers should be delivered with the kind of technical assurance and interpretative charm that are entirely missing here.I can only say that this album is a complete failure. It is diappointing that a major recording company can release an album that is of such low quality."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't like it at all","review":"I'll just be short. I don't like this cd at all. The singing is terrible. Poor technique, worn voice, bad musicianship. The performances are lifeless and boring.Not recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unsatisfactory","review":"This cd can in no way be regarded as a satisfactory recording. Russell Watson's main asset lies in his looks instead of his voice, which is not only not of top quality, but is actually constricted and abrasive sounding. His performances are immature in the sense that they don't form a coherent interpretation. Rather they're the desperate sound of a person whose mind is focussed mainly on vocal survival. No doubt the performances here are so unsatisfactory and unmusical."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unrepresentative of classical singing","review":"It is laughable that people can consider Russell Watson to have been singing opera when he hasn't even performed an opera on the stage. In fact, he isn't able to perform classical vocal music without amplification, which immediately exposes the fact that Mr Watson isn't neither a tenor nor a competent classical singer.The only thing that he is doing here is to trace the \\"tunes\\" of some classical songs. Unfortunately, he can't even do this well - his singing is hoarse and coarse and there's little by way of interpretation. Even if we disregard all the markings in the original score (which Watson is, of course, incapable of realising with his severely limited vocal means), his singing is still extremely unsubtle.In all, a low point in the history of vocal recordings. An album to forget."},{"rating":"2","title":"CD is AWESOME!","review":"This CD is AWESOME! It's an excellent mix of the music we love to hear! This collections of songs doesn't miss a beat - and may be one of the best Russell CD yet!This CD has a terrific list of selections ranging from Santa Lucia to All Or Nothing. Totally recommend you add this one to your collection."},{"rating":"1","title":"Frangoulis is much better","review":"I think Frangoulis is a much better alternative to Russell Watson, whose substandard singing on this album is simply not appealing enough for a cross-over album.Frankly, I don't like this cd at all, principally because of the poor standard of performances."},{"rating":"1","title":"Musically substandard and uninspiring","review":"This album is a disappointment. The singing is, honestly, not satisfactory. Russell Watson's vocal technique and performing experience are both inadequate, making the performances here to be very much substandard ones.Unfortunately, Watson is unable to provide any sense of freshness to the songs either. As a result, this album becomes a bore.One star only."},{"rating":"1","title":"Forced and unnatural singing","review":"I actually felt some discomfort when listening to this album.Russell Watson is not only a crude belter, his forced and unnatural way of singing is very unpleasant indeed.I don't think I'll ever buy another recording by him."},{"rating":"1","title":"Way below expectations","review":"Having regard to all the hype that surrounds Russell Watson, this recording is way below expectations. The singing of Mr Watson on this cd is monotonous, unfeeling and technically rudimentary. The singer is further unable to convey the different kind of emotions of each song. Such generalised performances are, to be honest, a bore."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"Reprise\\" is no Prize","review":"A very poor CD both in choice of music and voice quality. Mr. Watson's voice sounds strained and tired in many of the songs. I was very disappointed and sorry that I purchased \\"Reprise\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cannot recommend this one","review":"I'm relatively undemanding as far as music appreciation is concerned. However, I really cannot recommend this recording to anyone, as the quality is so bad that I myself can't bear listening to it again.Russell Watson's voice is not appealing at all. However, what is most offensive is his plain bad singing. Many in the karaokes can do a better job than him.Definitely substandard."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poorly-produced recording","review":"This is no good. The music selection is unimagative and the musical arrangements are soupy and tasteless.Worst of all is the singer of Russell Watson. Technique defective and charmless. The performances are uncommunicative and screechy. Not pleasant at all.Don't know why such an album can get released."},{"rating":"1","title":"A parody of tenor singing","review":"I can't help wondering if Russell Watson is a real tenor. After listening to this cd, my greatest impression is that, what I've heard is a kind of parody of tenor singing. It's very eccentric indeed, like a boy whose vocal cords haven't fully develop trying to imitate genuine tenor singing. The result is grotesque and not at all pleasing. I don't think I'll listen to such and awkward recording for many times...."},{"rating":"1","title":"Undeserved reprise","review":"Given that Russell Watson has sung so badly in his first 2 albums, he shouldn't have been allowed to reprise his appalling singing. Unfortunately, he is allowed to indulge in his ill-considered whims and here comes another album.Needless to say, the singing is atrocious. In fact, it's worse than his previous two albums, as both the quality of his voice and his singing skills have suffered a further decline.I can only say that this album is a good illustration of how bad singing can be these days."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor and unimaginative singing","review":"This recording is really bad. The singing is poor and unimagination, thus illustrating clearly the technique defects and lack of experience on the part of the singer, Russell Watson.There are many classical and cross-over artists out there who sing much better than Watson. Many look better than him, too. I don't think this substandard recording is competitive at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Really bad singing","review":"The standard of singing in this album is appallingly bad! I can't imagine a worse-sung vocal recording that this one. It is now clear that Russell Watson, who can't even produce a smooth sound on any note, isn't a talented singer. He is certainly not up to the task here, producing masses of ugly sounds.I think I've over-rated it by giving this album one star."},{"rating":"1","title":"The singing is appalling","review":"I really don't wanna be too harsh on this recording as Russell Watson isn't a real tenor and one cannot judge by an exacting standard.Yes, after listening to this album for a few times, with my anger mounting after each playback, I must say that the performances here are absolutely appalling.Honestly, I've never listened to such unmusical and inaccurate performances in my entire life. Not only is the singer unable to differentiate between the different music style required of him in each song, his emotional responses can only be said to be frigid.The last straw came when I heard that the singer cannot even sing the notes properly, and has to cheat all the time by cutting up the phrases into meaningless small segments. How unmusical and ruining the effect is!No, I won't recommend this album to anyone who loves music."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can't be compared to Bocelli, Safina, Groban and Frangoulis","review":"I think Russell Watson's performances cannot be compared to those by Bocelli, Safina, Groban and Frangoulis.The reason? The above 4 singers all have a more beautiful voice, a stronger technique, more communicative power and interpretative flair. By contrast, Watson's singing is like the coarse sounds emitted by a robot. No feeling at all! And he committed countless vocal blunders along the way.Not an enjoyable recording at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor singing destroys the music","review":"I love the music in this cd, which makes me even more angry that such fine music has been destroyed by such incompetent singer as offered here by Russell Watson.Watson bellows and screams with his coarse voice, and he doesn't know how to phrase at all, chopping up everything into small and meaningless bits. He pays little or no attention to details and he doesn't seem to be aware of the meaning of the lyrics.Such ghastly performances should never have been released on cd."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst of the three","review":"Russell Watson has so far produced 3 albums, and this certainly is the worst of the 3.Watson simply cannot even sing competently. There's much musical \\"cheating\\" involved. Phrases are chopped up, note values unobserved. His voice continues to deteriorate in quality and the high notes, which he can barely reach, sounds awful.Watson's singing lacks any kind of musical style. The performances are unidiomatic and generalised in expression. Very uncommunicative.I can't give this poorly-produced album more than 1 star."},{"rating":"2","title":"As it is in Heaven","review":"Beautiful! Mr.Watson shows how a crossover album is meant to be. His voice is the definition of the season: soothing, passionate, warm and loving. Best gift we received this year."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best","review":"I never knew who Russell Watson really was until I saw a brief appearance of him on the Bravo Network. He sang a Broadway melody in that performance and I never forgot it.I finally made the move to buy one of his CDs and I don't regret it. I own just a few so I am very particular on what CDs to purchase. Watson just has an amazing voice. He has a true talent for singing and performing. He is one of the best."},{"rating":"2","title":"what talent!","review":"I was never a fan of opera, but when i first heard russell sing on \\"good morning Australia\\", I rushed out to get his album, \\"encore\\", and the rest was history.

This is his third album, second made for USA. Russell's beautiful voice ranges from pop and ballads to opera. \\"Reprise\\" is a must have for anyone who enjoys romantic songs. You will love it, and want to get his other CD's as well. You will not be disappointed!!! Russell has a fresh new tenor sound. A must have CD!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Purest Voice around","review":"Russell Watson has topped his two previous recordings. He has the most beautiful, pure voice I have ever heard. I am not normally an opera fan, but he is so much more than that, and he has me addicted! The Voice, Encore, and Reprise are wonderful, and more than worth it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing Russell Should Get His Due","review":"This is one of Russell's best CD's. Time and again, I'm amazed by this man's interpretive skills of the classical and pop songbook, though the pop songs he chooses here are less known but no less rewarding. Though he sings only 13 tracks on this CD, each song is wonderful to listen to and his voice and the orchestra are a musical marriage made in heaven.When is Russell Watson gonna get his due respect and recognition in the music industry here in the USA? It's time to give this man the accolades he deserves as he receives in England and Australia with the uniformly excellent work he's recorded in all of his Cds."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best album to-date","review":"At long last a new CD from Watson, probably Watson's best album to date. Watson has an unbelievable voice and a unique artistry that defies description. Imagine taking the collective vocal power of Mario Lanza, Howard Keel, Pavarotti, etc., adding a dash of Sting and a pinch of Dean Martin - and several splashes of Neil Diamond - and you might just begin to understand why he is one the greatest versatile singers of all time (...or close to it).This CD is a great introduction to The Watson Experience, with lush arrangements and top-notch production making it both contemporary and timeless at the same time. The CD is just great."},{"rating":"2","title":"Humanizing and substantial, an awakening read.","review":"The Daiquiri Girls is an intimate exploration of the lives of four women facing the torrent of fear and self-loathing so prevalent in contemporary society. While the characters themselves represent a somewhat typical mixture of alcoholism and helplessness, Graham's narratives move us into a fresh perspective on the process of empowerment. As the characters awaken to the reality of their surroundings, a similar awakening presents itself to the reader as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Item","review":"This product is excellent.

However when I went back to the store 1 week later and saw a crib set up in this beautiful bedding and felt how thick and soft this set is I loved it and was surprised that the blanket had no satin on this and was very well made.

It looked like my only option was to send the whole thing back and get a replacement. I called Broan to see what they would say. First, within 10 seconds of making the call, I was connected directly to an English-speaking customer service person with a Wisconsin accent. I explained the situation and without hesitation, she offered to send me a new set of filters at no cost to me. Good luck finding that kind of customer service these days.

My previous fan did not duct to the exterior, which makes it essentially useless, so my main objective was to correct that. If I were buying a range hood again, I would not purchase one designed for either ducted or non-ducted use. There is a little plastic piece to cover the opening on top of the hood if you are ducting to outside, but it's not particularly effective. As a result, some air ends up recirculating right back into the kitchen. Not so great. I guess I could put tape over the opening, but who wants that? Next time I'd at least get a model designed only for exterior ducting. The hood looks nice enough. Still, function over form for me, hence only 2 stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poorly constructed","review":"This hood looks good, but the quality control is lacking. It arrived without the parts bag which entailed a trip to Home Depot for extra parts for installation. The fan also makes a ting, ting, ting sound on low and a TING, TING, TING sound on high.

I am a specialist Art teacher and I very occassionally refer to the book for 'early finisher' activities. But, as a book that claims 'how to teach art to children' it is severely lacking and I did not find any of the 96 projects inspirational.

It is nicely arranged by formal art elements with clear, concise directions. While it has worthwhile classroom activities, those concise directions can be a bit thin for most teachers that don't have any art background, unless they are the more motivated type that will do some deeper study into the art elements and principles covered in the National Visual Arts Standards. The one other problem is in the examples pictured in the book, which are obviously done by an adult, and not very imaginative uses of the lessons. Real-live kids would give far better effort than is pictured throughout the text.Overall, this is a nice resource for the classroom teacher."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excelent!","review":"This book is excelent for teachers any grade.

Not very appealing, even to a Goddess-loving gal like myself."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disappointing!","review":"I was extremely disappointed in this book. The book contained only 25 pictures, all of which were 90% black on white!! This left very little room for coloring on ANY of the pictures. Many of the pics were nudes (doesn't leave much for the imagination)! I will never buy this type book again and I suggest others don't either!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Just take the walk. Ignore the pretention.","review":"You've heard of vanity press. Well this is a vanity film. Fritjof Capra fresh off of the success of his books, The Tao of Physics and the The Turning Point decided to make a film and his brother obliged him. The result is a pretentious mess if you don't go along for the walk and listen. I first saw this movie because Russ Ackoff the noted management guru recommended it. But even Russ felt he had to apologize for the pretentiousness of the film. When you go for the walk, you are presented with general systems theory which is probably one of the best things you could learn. It helps you understand the interrelationships of your subject rather than just memorizing words. It is called general systems because it applies to everything. Has anything useful come out of the study of systems? Yes, you are using it right now. It's called the internet. So take the walk and listen and learn."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hope for the future","review":"Remember when Sting sang about Russians loving their children to?

However I feel Mind Walk fails to really do these ideas any good by not fully using the film medium to it's fullest.I understand that not every film is a narrative drama with a real plot, good dialogue and interesting events. But Mind Walk is a bore visually. There's too much telling and not enough showing. I would've loved to have seen more visuals on what these people were discussing.Though the characters have interesting backgrounds they are hard to relate to in that they spend more time talking about ideas and less about themselves. How can an audience relate to this?"},{"rating":"1","title":"A left wing diatribe cloaked in systems thinking language","review":"An avid systems thinking reader, I happened upon this movie. I looked forward to what looked like an interesting view of things. What I got instead was a diatribe of left wing propaganda, cloaked in educational language, in order to fool any undergraduate student into thinking something unique had been visited upon their mind.This movie, and the authors book \\"Turning Point\\" are nothing more than a phony liberal view of the planet as mother God, and we as simple minded cretins who inhabit it.Lucky for me Amazon has a wonderful return policy."},{"rating":"2","title":"My Stroll with Mrs. Andre","review":"Philosophically similar to My Dinner with Andre and with a likewise simplistic set-up, this movie explores some of lifes deeper meanings with real understanding. It's quite an investment for the attention-span, but worth it as far as I'm concerned. Until Alan Watts comes back and makes a movie, it's not likely to get any better than this."},{"rating":"2","title":"NOT FOR THE WEAK OF MIND!!!!!","review":"I first saw this movie in it's original release. It is one of the very few productions that I can say had a lasting impact on my view of the world and my surroundings. It is, however, a rather Esoteric offering and, probably, one of the most intellectual movies ever produced.For those who would like their concepts of \\"Reality\\" challenged, and expanded, this is the movie you MUST see!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Why?","review":"I was offended by this movie when it was show to my by a professor at my university. My professor seemed to think that it was one of the greatest social commentaries of all time. It is nothing but a political perspective that hides behind the notion of being intellectual by trying to address \\"important\\" world issues. The perspective of this movie is more that skewed, it's ridiculous."},{"rating":"1","title":"Political cliches that insult your intelligence","review":"Never have I seen so many cliches strung together in a pompous dialogue that leads nowhere and questions nothing that hasn't been questioned a zillion times before. Had the three artificial characters not been suspended in one of the most charming settings on earth, no one would survive through 10 minutes of it. How ironic that the castle itself (Mont St. Michel) is a staple of western civilization -- something the film tries to tear down with its stale, repetitive dialogue. If you're interested in the castle, rent a tourism video instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"This video is NOT by Liv Ullmann","review":"Liv Ullmann stars in the film but the screen play is by none other than Fritjof Capra i.e., author of Tao of Physics,Uncommon Wisdom,The Turning Point, Web of Life etc...

The film is ok but read the book Uncommon Wisdom and then The Turning Point.

Watch it, it is a must!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A mind gripping dialogue that opens minds...","review":"Mind Walk is an expansive work that grows with each viewing. Line by line, scene by scene Capra successfully opens ones eyes to a systems thinking approach of looking at anything and gaining new insight. The beauty lies within the casting of three major and unlikely characters. A poet that has exited the materialistic and self centered \\"I\\" world of the United States, an unsuccessful presidential candidate who is licking his wounds, and a brilliant scientist that has been disheartened by the reality that her R&D efforts have been applied to military applications. The film is in essence a serendipitous dialogue between the three that challenges the division of the mechanistic / reductionist and opens the door to the realm of an interconnected and linked reality. This film is not for the weary, but aleart and listen closely. For if you do, you will return to again and again to continue the openning of your own eyes."},{"rating":"2","title":"VHS MindWalk (1991)","review":"It's a crying shame that MindWalk is not on DVD by now. Oh well...but at least there are copies available for purchase. The film is brilliantly directed and acted. The plot takes you through history, from the Middle Ages to the present, as seen through 3 characters of diverse background. What I enjoy about the presentation is its timely philosophy, especially in the arena of global preservation. There is enquiry and query here that will treat as much as it enchants. A great addition to anyone's philosphical/historical visual library."},{"rating":"2","title":"WARNING: May become highly addictive","review":"Metric's LIVE IT OUT is much better than its predecessor for many reasons - harder, cleaner production value, more mature songwriting - but what I think the biggest improvement is, is the music itself. On OWU, there were lots of great ideas but the songs never got far enough off the ground to really take off. Thankfully LIVE IT OUT fixes this. Every song seems to have a purpose and they all seem to be more than one-dimensional. A prime example would be EMPTY; a soft indie acoustic song ala Sarah Harmer until it literally crumbles away to nothing and then a wall of crunching guitars come in. Very cool.LIO may not be album of the year but it does contain a few contenders for single of the year. I am expecting pitchfork to name POSTER OF A GIRL their top single for 2005. An homage to early new wave and bloody brilliant. Other standout tracks are the title-track LIVE IT OUT, POLICE AND THE PRIVATE, and GLASS CEILING."},{"rating":"2","title":"Speedy alternative rhythms","review":"This album is similar to Fantasies and Old World Underground, I have all three in a playlist that I listen to when I need a burst of energy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Pop Album of 05","review":"For this album, Metric are a pop band with loud guitars. Nothing too hard to digest, and solid melodies at the heart of everything. It's just not the sort of pop that sells a lot of singles at the moment...If you like The Cardigans and Ladytron, this will probably be of interest. Fans of Spiderbait's entire output (from pop to rock) are also likely to like this.If loud guitars turn you off but the rest of this description sounds appealing, try finding Metric's \\"Grow Up and Blow Away\\" album.The song with the biggest fluffy pop single potential is \\"Poster of a Girl\\".

Setting the alarm is somewhat \\"not easy to do\\" as you have to flip it around to see the switches and buttons.Other than that it's flat and easy to transport should I need to travel.I'm alright with this clock...

It will wake anyone up, not only in the bed, but probably in the room. It is so violent, that it is actually difficult to hold while it's vibrating. It would be perfect, if the manufacturer had thought to make the vibration intensity adjustable, but they didn't think that far ahead.If you have tremendous difficulty waking up, this will probably work for you. In fact, I think that this would wake up someone in a coma.Another big problem is that it is quite difficult to turn the alarm off. There is a cumbersome sliding switch on the side that you aren't going to want to wrestle with when you're trying to wake up, and the clock is very thin and high, so you will likely knock it over, regularly, while trying to turn it off."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent","review":"Excellent book showing some of the trials and tribulations of being a pastor.

Plenty of spaces to hang various feeders (8 hooks provided).4. Screws into ground from 18 to 24 inches.5. Has not been defeated by coons.Cons:1. Can see where rust may be a problem.2. A little expensive.3. Assembly instructions are poorly worded and illustrated.3.

It's a lot of fun to listen to, and the reggae bands do it with much respect to the original artists. The covers are reminiscent of the originals, but still different enough.

Basically you have an Irish narrator telling different tales of Irish folklore. He does so in a jovial manner with a brisk Irish accent.Meanwhile, all we see on the screen are shots of countryside, castles, and occasional revelers in a pub or somewhere.Although the stories are interesting, the scenery is lovely, and the music is enchanting, none of it really seems to fit together. And it definitely is not conducive to an enjoyable DVD watching experience.I agree with the reviewer who said a book of photography and a CD of stories would have served the same purpose, and probably would have been more enjoyable becuase you could control which pictures to look at when you wanted. This DVD is really not worth watching unless you're very very interested in Irish folklore and have nowhere else to go to hear stories."},{"rating":"1","title":"Screen protector sucks","review":"I bought this thinking the screen protector was built into the case so that when I pulled out the iPod to view movies I would have a clearer screen. In fact the screen protector is a little gummed piece of plastic that picked up a cat hair before I could put it in place and had bubbles I could not get out. Also the case is so tight I can't see the screen protector lasting more than a week or two. As if that weren't enough it's too thin to offer more than minimal protection. There are large openings on the bottom and back that seem to defeat the purpose of having a case. I returned this and got an Agent 18 VideoShield Kit instead. Not only does it provide much better screen (and overall) protection, it has an adjustable viewing angle."},{"rating":"2","title":"great case","review":"the case is sleek, stylish and protects my video ipod. it also doubles as a stand if you want to sit it on your desk."},{"rating":"1","title":"BEYOND EXPIRED!","review":"great book if you still own an Atari or Commodore. nothing in the book applies to modern computers of 2004"},{"rating":"1","title":"Dragovitch sways and swaggers","review":"Detective Milo Dragovitch sways and swaggers through James Crumley's \\"Dancing Bear\\" bracing himself with snorts of coke and shots of peppermint schnapps.

It's up to the reader to make a number of leaps of faith to keep things moving. For instance, Milo seems to know instinctively when he is being tailed but how me knows is never quite clear.

The protagonist - a young woman - makes a nice change from the bearded, middle-aged male that so often is the 'star' of yoga stories. Through the chapters of the book, the storylines cover a) specific directions on how to relate to a yoga practice, b) commentaries on the Yoga Sutras of Master Patanjali, and c) how the practice of yoga actually can transform the world around you, from a prison to a school and beyond.Like some other reviewers mention, the story is at first glance a bit simple, this is just the outer layer of a very rich and illuminating book.One of the nicest things about it is that it describes yoga without reference to any specific God or religion, in simple and compelling terms that us modern people can probably accept and deal with.

What is most relevant is the argument made by the professor (Walter Matthau) who advises the military leaders. It is exactly what we are hearing today by our government...\\"We gotta get them before they get us!\\" He advises the military to not recall the errant bombers, but to let them destroy Russia because he believes the Communists want world domination and its either them or us who must ultimately perish in the conflict.

But what a fantastic movie, full of drama and suspense. I'll never forget the reaction when the first plane is shot down, and the man who reminds them \\"That wer'e not at a football match\\" There are so many powerful scenes throughout the movie, too many to list here.

His \\"winnable limited nuclear war\\" speech to the generals is truly insane and brilliant, all at the same time. Fonda and Hagman do well as two men trying to avert apocalypse, and Fritz Weaver's debut is a sad and disturbing examination of a wounded soul. Frank Overton is great as General Bogan, and Dan O'Herlihey is quite brilliant as a general with impending doom written all over his dreams.No music, no soundtrack, no special effects, stark black-and-white camera work...all these serve to intensify the gloom.

Sidney Lumet was one of those \\"serious\\" old Hollywood directors who took on \\"important\\" themes and is revered for it now - but to me his work often comes off as quite wooden and by-the-book.

Unless you are REALLY into this type of movie (Pseudo-Soviet 1960's warfare) it is just not worth the watch. The end, though, is rewarding. It's as though the director gives you compensation for sitting through the movie by handing you an ending that is real, dramatic, timely (1962, pre-Kennedy Assassination New York), and most of all, satisfying. Just like the end of The Omen, the end leaves so much spectulation about the future (the flashing images gave me nightmares about New York's demise, just like Damien's apparent bonding with the President in The Omen!). You want to know what happens next, what the country does, how the American people react, but you are happy nonetheless that the end so elequantly is slammed to you.

With repeated use of pulling/pushing, the bands of course shrink/narrow in diameter and will eventually slip through the zip ties. Makes for exciting times depending on what your doing.

I also detested the smell - to me it smelled like rotten eggs. Not surprising, given that one of the ingredients happens to be Egg Protein Oil.Perhaps the product would be better suited to more coarse and dry hair types (or hair that is protein-starved), but I do not recommend this product for persons of my hair type - very wavy to loose curls with hair that is medium in thickness, and not really too dry.What bothered me more than the oiliness of the product - I could have just used less - was the smell which kept me even from reusing the bottle."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty Good for Kinky-Curly Hair","review":"This gave a pretty good definition to my kinky-curly hair.

The supporting characters are unbelievably cast in the roles they play. Whether embarked on a revolutionary action or a complex theft, the characters seem incapable of gathering for either purpose and seem terribly sloppy for a group self-proclaiming themselves as careful and skilled. For example, throughout the book Simpson glances in his car mirror to see either an Opel or a Peuguet following the group; the bad guys never notice. Several times Simpson litters Turkey with cigarette packages filled with notes for Turkish authorities, which are picked up by the men in the trailing cars; the bad guys never notice and the Turkish folks always pick up the littered notes.

After reading through so many of these types of books, I have become quite selective about which book is good and which is not. For a solid read on Mormonism, pick up Letters to a Mormon Elder by James White or any Bill McKeever literature."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Must Read for all Mormons","review":"I am astounded that I have been a Mormon my entire life, yet never questioned any Mormon doctrine. This book has opened my eyes. I am thankful for the author who put much of his time into research to clarify what was brought up in his book. My life has changed and I believe I have found the Christian God and I will be forgiven for my sins without all the conditions the Mormon religion held over my head. If there are any Mormons out there who are courageous enough to read this book, I ask that you keep an open mind.

The famous cupcakes, even though I followed the recipe exactly and consider myself an fairly experienced baker, were heavy and mouthy. I served them at a birthday and everyone was just suffering through them.I tried again with another cupcake recipe last night-- the result was okay when they were warm and then dried up, resulting in dry, grainy revolting cakes. I told a friend about this, and he said, well of course they don't want to really share the famous recipe for cupcakes. So sad, but so true with this book.I agree with the professional baker review that this book is dissapointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"Bought this book after returning from NY & having had the cupcakes and the Chocolate cake.I followed the recipe letter for letter and the chocolate cupcakes and the vanilla buttercream icingwould have been better from a Duncan Hines box.

The cupcakes were hard to swallow they were so heavy and oily and the icing almost made my teeth fall out. NO ONE liked them.

What we don't get is the opening theme song, original end credits, and I have a feeling original music (though I guess I'll never know since this will probably be the only release in this format.) At least the \\"chapters\\" are labeled with the original episode titles. I know this sounds nit-picky and in the vein of the \\"complainers\\" of the ill done reissues of the Original Star Wars trilogy on DVD, but come on. What is the purpose of releasing an old saturday morning cartoon, almost certainly because the fans demanded it for nostalgia purposes, and then heavily editing it so that it has almost no feel of how it originally aired?"},{"rating":"1","title":"DON'T BUY THIS DVD","review":"Not because of a hate for Ewoks. I love the Ewoks & the droids. This IS NOT the cartoon that was on Saturday mornings in the 1980's. This is a few of the episodes badly put together to make a film that has four or five plots.

The exam is real tricky - its the only one I have ever failed on first try - miserably! No book can prepare you for the Architectures exam fully but this book gets very close. I guess if you have a few years experience in data modelling you can pass with just this book. but if like me you have very little experience in data base design and data modelling, you definitely need something else. I bought and read the Data Modelling book by Lawrence Sanders after I failed this exam. That is a little book that fills in all the gaps! After reading these two book, anyone can pass this exam. Oh, one other thing you most likely will need is the Transcender sample tests. This exam is unlike the othe Microsoft exams and without the Transcenders it will be a shock the first time you do it and that may cause you to fail. So invest in the Transcender sample tests for this exam and you will be glad you did. Good luck!"},{"rating":"1","title":"No book will help you with this exam ... period!","review":"Having read the book and taken (and passed) the exam, I can honestly say that NO BOOK will help you with this exam. Like the reviewer below me says, the exam is all case studies - multiple choice questions are only a small part of it. You need to be a combination busines analyst / technical architect / DBA to pass this exam. I give this book two stars only because it's the best one out there, but it really won't help you at all. If you're serious about passing, get the Transcender Exam (or the free Transcender Demo) - it's identical in structure to the real exam and the questions are amazingly similar.

It was disappointing because there was really nothing new for me. I've heard of the ideas of connectivity and the science backing it up so this film was rather dull. The film talks little about whats wrong with the world and how to change it and instead talks a lot about life's purpose or the way we should be living life. There were also very few scientific examples and its mostly just what a few famous people said and that must be the correct way of thinking or behaving. And thats what really ruined it for me. The only parts I liked was when the film maker was talking about his life experiences, what he went through and why he changed. Overall, I would not recommend this documentary because it was rather unexciting, uninspiring and very few facts."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't expect inspiration.","review":"I love reading and watching movies on spirituality.

A video that will make you think.","review":"I found this video based on it being a best seller in Documentary videos. I thought it sounded interesting and that I could show it to my students in Economics. I was not disappointed and found the overall questions in it to be thought provoking and challenged the thinking of my students. If you want a video for an Econ. class or anything in social studies, this video is perfect as it will get your students to think about their own lives and habits, the history of our nation and other countries as well as put a real life questions in front of you. What does it all mean? Are we better off living like we do in Rat Race 101 and keeping up with the Jones, or is there a different road we can travel down to make the world a better place?

Dennis Prager has a much better, broader concept of what the components of happiness actually are.Happiness Is a Serious Problem: A Human Nature Repair ManualI do agree with the observation that there is more to life than the physical, but, for example, the illustration of cutting a dog into pieces and reassembling it and not having it \\"work\\" was inane.

None of its claims have been validated with reliable research. HeartMath actually runs counter to modern physiology. \\"I Am\\" argues that because of this \\"scientifically proven\\" physical heart-to-heart connection between humans, it is in our \\"self-interest\\" to feed the starving.

When his lawyer, his divorce was casually mentioned, although he showed very little emotion, the meter on the yougurt bacteria shot through the roof!This tells us that everything that happens on this planet is instantly communicated to everyone else through the collective consciousness here. That means when there is a war going on anywhere, we are all affected by the terror and gruesomeness of it. Also, whenever we pray or love, that too, gets communicated out there.Thoughts are things and have power. Words coupled with emotion are the most powerful tools we have!

I have to admit, I purchased this item because of how cute it's packaging came and the promises it wielded. The truth is, this item is HEAVY and it does NOT fit most bras. It pokes out of bras either the underside or it comes up over the bra.

I just don't want my ID showing up here.Yes, I've purchased these, and these inserts are ok, but they are too expensive. You can get virtually the same product in a flesh color for about one third the price of this product. The SAME product. Only thing different is the box they are delivered in and the color.

I have owned silicone inserts in the past, and was attracted to the more natural shape of these (I previously had \\"cutlets\\" that were pretty lumpy-looking). However, within a couple of weeks, the silicone inside became distorted. The actual casing wrinkled--they looked like giant translucent raisins. Additionally, they gave my skin a rash. One of them ripped open after a few months, and I was forced to throw them away. I would honestly rather have the $13 cheap jobs that lasted for months until they mysteriously went missing (I have sisters; it happens). These were a constant battle, always becoming distorted and clumpy-looking. I would NOT recommend these to anybody. Save your money; I only got a few weeks' worth of legitimately functional use from these. Go for a more practical product."},{"rating":"1","title":"a LITTLE lift","review":"If you want just a little lift, buy these. If you need a bigger lift (like me...I am a small B) purchase the Original Looks Silicone Breast Enhancer Bra Inserts. I was disappointed in these - they are clear so although they are politically correct boobs in a box, they will match no-one's skin tone in the unfortunate event that they slip up and become visible. My biggest complaint was the size though - I just needed something that would fill me out, and this only caused gap-age in my B cup.I also (unfortunately) purchased the \\"cupcakes\\" and they seem to do the exact same thing as these, so don't bother with both; they don't appear to change the look of the cup-size or shape any differently (at least not for smaller cup sizes)."},{"rating":"2","title":"good boobie","review":"I LOVE this boob....I only use one, because I'm uneven, and I just wanted my shirts to hang on me like a normal person. And it works!!One stipulation: If I wear it against my skin all day, I stink to high heaven by the time I come home from work. The plastic on my skin seems to make me sweat and stink like I never have before. Gag. So... after washing it with bleach so it doesn't smell, I tried putting it inside a thin little sock before inserting it in the bra. No more smell, and still completely comfortable. I use it every day (the sock can be changed, of course) and I'm excited to buy clothes where I'm not trying to hide my \\"variety of size\\" anymore. Thanks!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Love the Boob Job in a Box","review":"This is a great product and althought it might sound excessive I wear them everyday. One of my \\"boobs\\" was not sealed as well as the other around the edges and it makes it a little less comfortable to wear, but it still works fine. I will be buying new ones to replace the damaged one. Also, I wash them sometimes with simple soap and water. They are super for anyone who wants a lift or for anyone who might not be perfectly even in both breasts. For women with very large breasts, if you use these, you might find that they aren't quite wide enough. All in all though, these inserts are suubtle and easy to hide, and they can be placed in different areas of the bra to enhance your breasts in different ways. They are comfortable on the skin, they stay in place - even if you are moving around alot - and can even be used while swimming. My favorite thing is that they look and feel (to you and anyone who might be touching) like real boobs."},{"rating":"1","title":"take outs","review":"they didn't quite live up to the hype, but they \\"help\\" a bit.

Its about a guy who lives with his mother and many sisters. They keep bugging him to get married since they are fed up of taking care of their 43 year old brother.

If you were actually in high school then, I imagine the book would be a treasure to you. If you were not around during this period it gives you a good idea of what it was like in 1964. Because the book is literally divided into 365 days (chapters), it seemed very disjointed compared to a \\"normal\\" novel. Though it reads quickly, mainly because the seventeen year old's perspectives don't contain much deep, thought provoking material, it was still too long. I read about 10 months worth, then found myself skimming to the end to just get it over with, so I could start a book that might be more exhilarating."},{"rating":"1","title":"Are we still true?","review":"Be true to your school is an account of the events of one boy's life in 1964. Many people don't think that there are many similarities of 1964 and 2001, but after reading this, I do. Alcohol was a problem then and has developed, I feel, into even more of a problem. Relationships, school, friends, family and even athletics all have strong similarities. This book was interesting to read mainly because it was from a guy's perspective.

I enjoyed reading this book. Being a teenager, I can really relate to it and even at any age you can. He deals with alcohol, girls, and most important school. \\"You can relate to the pressure that other people put on Bob thoug out the book.\\" For example in the book the upperclassmen are drinking so Bob things that is a good idea because they are.While in the year 1964 Bob has to deal with friends, his job, and rlationships with others. \\"He explains the troubles of high school, concerning relationsips, friends, and his first job.\\" This book makes teenagrs, those who have been a teenager, and those who havent became a teenager see what a teenager does and think.

However, my little hummers did not share these opinions, and have snubbed this new feeder in favor of their older feeder. Having three voracious hummers dueling over this lone feeder, I had hoped this new one, with it's many stations, would make everyone happy. But alas, the squawking of these tiny birds was enough to make me drive (in the car!!!) to the hardware store in search of a viable replacement. After summing up the many designs displayed on the shelves, I finally picked one, hoping my feathered friends would like it enough to feed upon it. Lo and behold, after moving it around the yard a bit, I seemed to have struck the perfect combination of the old feeder, and the newer one. Finally, everyone is happy and there is much less squawking, but now I have this extra feeder....."},{"rating":"2","title":"and the hummingbirds love it too.","review":"I've had several hummingbird feeders over the past few years. They've either been pretty and leak or just too ugly. This has been a reasonable compromise. I prefer the colorful glass designs and this is plastic. I bought a similar unit at the local hardware store and it started fading immediately. This one has held it's color.The design does suffer from tilting as the contents shift to the side the birds use the most. So if your OCD and will be bothered by the slight lean, keep looking.It does not leak and cleaning and refilling are the easiest of any design I've seen.The real test is the birds. They love this feeder and even show a slight bias over the cheaper, simliar product that's started to fade."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not-so-cheap knock-off","review":"This feeder is a cheaply made (but not cheap!) knock-off of the Aspects Hummzinger, a much more durable feeder without the yellow parts that can attract attract bees. After problems with Perky Pet feeders, I now use only all-red feeders and find that it doesn't take new birds more than a few seconds to learn where the holes are (hummingbirds are a lot smarter than you think). For the same money or less you can get a feeder that's more durable, even easier to clean, less likely to attract bees, and made by a company that doesn't crank out cheap knock-offs or exploit you and the birds by marketing chemical-laced \\"instant nectar.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice feeder, but not the best for hanging","review":"The feeder is nice, and the design makes it a breeze to clean.One issue is that the way it's made causes it to hang crooked, the nectar will move to one side and it will sit skewed, so there will only be nectar in one side, and the hummers aren't heavy enough to tilt it back so they have to move around to the lower side where the nectar is. Otherwise it is a nice feeder.It has a spot underneath to mount on top of a pole, and that wouold probably work best for this feeder as long as you don't have ant problems."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perky Pet always makes a good product","review":"Really, you couldn't ask for a more functional or more durable group of products than the line of Perky Pet hummingbird feeders. This saucer-shaped feeder has a built in ant moat. Very smart. Cleaning it fully is a breeze because the red top snaps off like a food container. Drawbacks? It is harder to see the contents from across the room, and it spills easier than the bottle-shape feeders during filling and placing. We like it very much!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Tilts and spills","review":"I had high hopes for this design, ants, air pressure not forcing out liquid and nice looking. But... the feeder liquid and design of the tray cause the whole thing to tilt and spill solution. When tilted the birds can get food only from the lower side of the tray.The only way to solve this is with a large weight hanging down from the center like a long candle stuck in the bottom. That puts the center of gravity lower and pulls it back to a horizontal position. Thus two stars because you can fix it but only two stars as it shouldn't work this way!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Ant proof hummingbird feeder","review":"Great hummingbird feeder, easy to clean and fill, the only one that has stopped the ants!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Quality","review":"I ordered two of these as gifts and each had a single broken perch.

Most of which is in the first half of the book which tells of his hardships, heroes that have inspired him, his triumphs, and the mental motivation that got him through it all.

The author hits on several good points with regard to identifying and understanding critical behavior on the part of men. Unfortunately, she then concludes that there's little or no hope that a marriage with such a partner can be salvaged. After reading this book, I can't help but wonder how many marriages it has ruined, which could have been saved. Marriage is a wonderful and precious union between two persons. When problems arise, we need to identify them, and then work to fix them. The answer isn't to assign blame, and then cut and run!

It provides another viewpoint to the Allied histories of the war. There seems to be an obvious bias which is also present in many if not most of the Allied histories. Viewed in the context of contrary histories of the same battles, many points can be clarified.The 12th SS was a fabulous division of fighting men. I see many training and doctrinal attributes that were used in the Marine Corps when I joined. When viewed in a strictly historical perspective of fighting quality and ability there are few formations that can compare with with the 12th SS. I highly recommend these volumes to historians as well as gamers modeling the battles this division was engaged in."},{"rating":"2","title":"Chilling","review":"It's amazing to say the least what the 12th SS accomplished and got away with during ww2. They were called fanatics, even criminals and in some cases they were both but of all things said, one thing remains constant and true.

The only thing it has going for it is that the visuals can be starkly beautiful at times, even if the aesthetic that the movie is striving for is not very original. Of course it is entirely possible that I just don't \\"get\\" the movie, but as a whole, I found the movie to be weak and boring. Save your time and your cash."},{"rating":"1","title":"NORTHFORK DVD","review":"DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY OF TIME WITH THIS FILM..IT WAS ONE OF THE WORST I'VE SEEN IN A LONG TIME...THANK YOU"},{"rating":"1","title":"Dump This Movie Into The Reservoir!","review":"This is the worst movie I have seen in many, many years. It starts out with many promising elements: an interesting premise, an appealing cinematographic style, and some very decent acting talent. Unfortunately, it slides rather quickly into an inexplicably deep and wide abyss of boredom from which there is no hope of escape.The main culprit here is the awful script, which has absolutely no redeeming quality. Additionally, the director obviously has no idea of what he is actually trying to get across to the audience. And the costumes look like leftovers from Pee-Wee's Playhouse. All in all, it is dreadfully bad."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terribly slow, mostly incomprehensible, and strange","review":"The story is about government workers attempting to evacuate a few last hold-outs before their town and valley are flooded by a new man-made lake made for the purpose of generating power. Evidently it is to be about loss and change, death and rebirth. It is steeped in religious imagery and connotations of an after-life. This theme has potential, but it falls flat in this film. It is extremely slow, mostly dull, and generally incomprehensible. Some scenes were semi-interesting but they were short and few and far between. It's a shame because with this theme and the competent acting of Nick Nolte and James Woods, the film makers could have done a lot, but here it fails miserably.The cinematograpy was at times interesting and beautiful but even that got old after a while."},{"rating":"1","title":"Vacuous Vapidity","review":"I love cinema -- in all it's forms -- but this movie had me crawling in my seat.Just because a film has muted colors, stark high contrast photography, unfolds at a glacial pace, and has minimalist acting does NOT make it a masterpiece.This film is all style, but NO heart -- it is emotionally vacuous -- empty!You have \\"Men in Black\\", echoes of \\"Blade Runner\\" episodic quirkyness like \\"Pulp Fiction\\", but none of the charm and soul of say \\"Wings of Desire\\" or even \\"City of Angels\\".A sterile, vapid, desolate, black-hole of a movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Put down the typewriter and step away","review":"The Polish brothers got a little too cute with this story. The movie was just a collection of images that were thrown together. Save your money on this one, folks."},{"rating":"1","title":"Did you see \\"Neighbors?\\"....","review":"I watched this last night and felt extremely disappointed that I had by the end. I had seen a coming attraction while watching another DVD and put it at the top of my Netflix que. As soon as it came, we watched it. My girlfriend fell asleep before it was half way through. I wished I had.Just like \\"Neighbors,\\" all the good parts of the movie seemed to be in the coming attraction."},{"rating":"1","title":"The worst movie I have ever seen","review":"This is truly the worst movie I have ever seen. It transitions in and out of some bizarre dream state and offers nothing to engage the viewer (except for some interesting cinematography).I typically trust film critics' tastes, however they were severely off the mark with this film. It upsets me to think that I have wasted my time and money.View at your own risk!"},{"rating":"1","title":"OK the dog on stilts was cool","review":"but thats about it Dont get me wrong I try to get into these weirded out movies like \\"Brazil\\" where everything can be a metaphor for something else. Like when your talking to someone and they mention the big mac they had yesterday when an obese person walks by but its gotta MAKE SOME SENSE! C'mon folks 'Northfork' made none it was just a trippy flashback of times when the directors played with LSD in college. And the joke HAHAHAHAHAH. We've all heard it 'God says I already sent a boat and a helicopter dummy' did that have to be such a drawn out scene? No but it was because they were short on dialogue. It started out on paper as something that couldve been special but winded up with everyone being happy with Noltes, Woods, Hannah and Edwards performances which were well acted out pieces of insanity. 2 stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"ZZZZZZZZZZzzzzzzzz","review":"Beautiful cinematography and music as well as a cast of well known actors, this movie has it all...except that it is painfully boring. I fell asleep several times and could not stay interested no matter how hard I tried. The editing between scenes was very fragmented and the story moved sooooooo slowly. I did not enjoy this one very much at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Couldn't get into it!","review":"I rented this DVD because I have met the mother of the two young men who produced the film and find her work very good. I couldn't make head or tails out of this film, even after running it several times. I had to resort to reading the film jacket to find out the intention of the producers. If this was to be a representation of regional art and writing, it misses its mark."},{"rating":"1","title":"A movie about nothing, except it isn't funny.","review":"This film has some interesting features: It is visually stunning, due to the spectacular Montana landscape and excellent cinematography. The actors are quite good, especially Nick Nolte and Darryl Hannah. Hannah's acting skills are improving as she ages.Otherwise, the plot is vacuous and the script ludicrous, so much so that I would have given it zero stars if Amazon allowed it. It was painful to see good actors trying to make something out of the incoherent script.Lots of people like this movie, so I hate to dismiss it completely. But I just couldn't get involved in it, and I get involved in movies - even TV commercials - very easily. There was something forced and not genuine about it, as though the Polish Brothers are taking themselves too seriously. They might make better films if they remembered that the first goal of movie-making is to entertain."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pointless","review":"This movie was a crap-sandwich.If movies are meant to entertain, this one could be classified as torturous. Between struggling not to nod off and trying figure out what in the world the \\"angels\\" were doing, the ending could not come soon enough.This is the only review I've written on a movie on Amazon, so I feel pretty strongly about it. Very poor... I would place it in the same category as \\"Knockaround Guys\\", \\"Ronin\\", and \\"The Yards\\". Just pointless, pseudo-intellectual rubbish."},{"rating":"1","title":"A little dialogue might have helped","review":"Like some of the other reviewers, I normally like films that are quirky. This one however seemed to be different just for the sake of being different. It had very little entertainment value. Perhaps the photography and cinematography will appeal to some. There is very little dialogue and very little that made me want to keep watching. Maybe I just didn't get it."},{"rating":"1","title":"SOMEBODY CALL GHOSTBUSTERS!","review":"I feel like I've been strapped to a chair and forced to watch an entire season of TV's \\"Touched By An Angel\\". What fluffy goody-good nonsense this film is. Bumbling eccentric angels have to be one of the thinnest fictional devices ever revealed in the movies and this group make Casper the Friendly Ghost look like a Dicken's spirit. I sat there waiting for this film to click into gear for quite some time until it became apparent this movie is a watershed of indifference concerning the afterlife in a small dying American town soon to be turned into a lake. As if the dumb angels weren't enough, we have worldly government agents in black trenchcoats and a Christ-like child looking for his wings which is much less compelling than Peter Pan looking for his shadow. Writer, director, and star, The Polish Brothers ought to row, row, row their boat in any other direction."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mushroom Therapy","review":"Psychotropic drugs don't come close to the kind of trip this film gives you. I found it bizarre and a bit creepy at the same time. I managed to sit through the entire film, hoping for redemption of it's weird storyline, but it never came. I doubt I'll watch it again. Two stars because of two stars: Nick Nolte and James Woods."},{"rating":"1","title":"Absolutely Terrible","review":"This is not only the silliest but also the most meaningless move I've ever watched. It's not worth what you pay for it, so just don't buy it because you'll be sadly disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"hauntingly brilliant","review":"People looking for a night of mindless entertainment won't find it here. This is a thinking person's film, and one that people either love or hate. I first saw the movie with a group of six friends. Four of us thought it was one of the best films we'd ever seen, the other two thought it was a huge waste of time.Northfork is best described as Touched By an Angel mixed with Fargo and a touch of Field of Dreams. It has a slow but compelling storyline that requires close attention in order to truly comprehend."},{"rating":"1","title":"Strange for Strange's sake","review":"My wife and I dislike the \\"typical\\" popcorn fluff movies that come out of Hollywood these days, preferring instead something that makes you think about your own life's experiences and such.Having said that, you might think we would have liked NORTHFORK, unfortunately this is one of those \\"artsy-fartsy\\" type movies where the writers and directors go out of their way to be strange just for the sake of being strange without really ever putting anything to celluloid that draws you in or is memorable.I must confess, we tried watching this movie 3 times and never got further than 50 minutes or so into it.... just couldn't stand it anymore.Feel like getting introspective and deep ?Go sit outside late tonight and stare up at the stars pondering the origins and meaning of life... you will probably find this to be more entertaining passage of 2 hours of your life."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a lot of wasted effort","review":"It is very clear a lot of energy was expended on making this movie. What a shame it was to so little end. Having seen the very intriguing preview when I bought another Paramount Classics release, I hastened to buy this DVD. Talk about the preview making a silk purse out of a feature length sow's ear. The most disappointing thing about the film was how emotionally and intellectually facile it was. The Polish Brothers seem to be technically adept but intellectually stunted. Having watched the awesomely rivetting \\"In The Mood For Love\\" just the night before, I had a benchmark to measure this movie against. ITMFL proves that technical skill, measured pacing, unconventional narrative and emotional and intellectual depth can go together. The only one the Polish Brothers managed out of these was the technical skill. Beware the preview. It's promise is not met in the movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Absolutely the worst movie I have ever sat through, no exception!!!","review":"This movie is pointless, bizarre , inane, and totally without merit. I guess you would have to be as weird as the script writer to understand this movie. I thought I had broad tastes in movies and story lines, but this one just escaped me.......... James Woods, Nick Nolte, shame on you!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful - not even a fun bad movie - this SUCKED","review":"I like a lot of bad movies. I like a lot of quirky movies which are rejected by the mainstream. I love alegories, symbolism and the like.BUT THIS MOVIE SUCKED - it was so so so so bad. How was this movie made. Are they all on drugs? - That was two hours of my life which I will never get back; furthermore I feel like the $4.00 spent to rent the movie was stolen from me... man did this movie suck!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I have never given just one star...","review":"I want my 100 minutes back. I am normally very open-minded and receptive to offbeat, quirky films. It is a rare film in which I can find nothing positive to say. Welcome. After the first hour and fifteen minutes of trying to be open-minded, a growing sense of anger enveloped me that there simply was no hope that this film would be comprehensible in the least. One would need to be on a double dose of a severely hallucinogenic, mind-altering drug to find any sense in this absolutely pointless pile of cinematic excrement. Pay no heed to the description on the box. You have been warned."},{"rating":"1","title":"New Age","review":"I (unfortunately) was seduced by the jacket presentation of the DVD. Between dreams and dark reality, the film finds it difficult to take the course. Some sensitive images avoid the viewer from being engulfed by waves of fatigue.A film truly boring and fake due to its seduction by the New Age."},{"rating":"1","title":"Portmeirion Holly and Ivy incividual salad bowls","review":"I really like the Portmeirion Holly and the IVY dinnerware, and have very satisfied with previous purchases, but this time what I ordered was not what I received. Instead of the 2 sets of the fruit salad bowls, which I ordered, the company sent cereal bowls. The cereal bowls aren't as expensive as the fruit salad bowls. I was required to pay the return postage. These are heavy duty dinnerware, and first I paid postage to have them sent to me and then paid postage to return them. It was their mistake at my expense. Most companies I have dealt with would not charge for return postage if it was their mistake, or would at least replace it with the correct product. I put one star because I got ripped off, but it really should have been no stars. I would say take caution, Order at your own risk and/or expense."},{"rating":"2","title":"Don Camillo","review":"Don Camillo est le prete d'un charmant village.

I am teaching my young children piano and using this series. They are well-priced as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent for kids and adults","review":"I used the older version of this book when I was a child and it was excellent. Easy to read and understand. Perfect for learning to play the piano if you want to go at your own pace. I had a private instructor as well but the book was the key to my lessons. I have almost the entire collection but they are a bit out-dated so I plan to buy the new ones soon for my own review, and also so I can teach my kids to play when they are old enough. I loved the John W. Schaum series. Note: These books aren't really theory based so if you intend to teach yourself, you'll also need a book to really teach you the basics (Tip: I used the AB Guide to music theory by Eric Taylor, it's alittle difficult to find now though), once you master the theory, you'll be on your way to playing tons of songs. Fun fun fun!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"You can't judge a book by its cover...","review":"Except here....this books cover is the most stunning photograph, The Lone Cypress with the Pacific Ocean as a backdrop, but the insides are as good as the cover...maybe better.

If you want any Almanac info forget this book. If you want a book about Golf at Pebble Beach this is not your book.

I give it 3 stars in regards to my enjoyment of the album, of which I'm just lukewarm, but they get an extra star for bringing something new to the mix."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bosch sanding fence","review":"Normal easy ordering and quick receipt from Amazon. The fence is as described and very servicable. The rating was reduced to 4 star because the instructions are not clear for mounting and no quality illustration or picture available to assist in proper assembly. For someone not mechanically inclined the first assembly or two maybe a little challenging but the fence does work well once properly assembled."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor quality for Bosch","review":"This fence appears to be flimsy. I use the term \\"appears to be\\" for good reason--it was packed with no instructions (and none are available from Bosch's web site or by phoning or emailing). Based on the illustration I can infer that the bolt packed with my unit is too short for its intended use. Even if it assembled correctly, there's only one attachment point and that would probably be too inaccurate for precision work--I can do just as well freehand. Altogether not up to Bosch's normally fine standards. This one is going back.PS: I love the 1274DVS belt sander, and have used it for years.PPS: after a week I finally was sent the instruction sheet. Too late--my need for this part has passed, and all my other points still stand (see above.)"},{"rating":"2","title":"A ROMANTIC ENDING!!!!^_^ well sorta .......","review":"I bought this series not to long ago. I thought this dvd was the best out of the whole series. THIS MOVIE IS NOT FOR YOUNG VIEWERS!!!!!! After watching this I thought this should be rated 18+. I thought this dvd was the most entertaining, enjoyable, and hysterical out of the whole series. The ending wasnt who I expected but it ended how i hoped it would. In this dvd, they actually find out who the sister is and who the stranger was. After they find out who the real sister is and who the stranger was, things started to get weird. After that, it starts to get sad but the ending makes up for it."},{"rating":"1","title":"I was disappointed","review":"This, and all of the \\"Music for...\\" series consist mostly of 1940's 'old-timey' recordings transferred to CD, with very little (if any) remastering.

I went to a local store and bought a 40' cord that was in fact 40' long and worked fine."},{"rating":"2","title":"Durable","review":"Finding quality extension cords that can endure the elements and still maintain its functionality is getting harder and harder these days. Trust me there are a lot of posers with high ticket prices out on the store shelves. These low grade cords pop up on the radar especially during the holidays. For me, these Coleman Cable 40 foot 16/3 extension cords has proven to be a winner. I especially like the heavy duty molding on both the plugs and connectors. After over twelve months continuous duty in both our front and back yards, the vinyl covering has maintained its color very well. Unlike the light weights out there, I've found absolutely no peeling or breeches in the seal. That says it all for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent product, better than expected..","review":"I had purchased a gas power generator, so I was looking for cords to run thru the house in case of emergency.

A ton of fun to watch and worth every penny!","review":"Sure, the early videos are super-cheesy. They are, nonetheless, really fun to watch. And in case we've all forgotten how things used to be...ALL videos from 1978 look like that. The songs are still all great, as is much of the live footage. In particular, \\"Clowntime is Over\\" from a show called The Tube is mesmerizing.But the thing that really sets this video collection apart is the excellent commentary by Elvis. The stories he tells about the videos are smart, funny--really interesting behind-the-scenes tidbits. The commentary enhances the experience of watching the videos by an enormous amount--it was fascinating stuff. I watched the entire DVD in one sitting--I was riveted. And by the way, I really appreciate that Elvis doesn't say too much. He doesn't just blather on and on, as if often the case with these things. It's nice that you can listen to the commentary and still enjoy the videos.Buy this DVD right now!

We could be more happy with this item: light and very effective. It has a blue plastic on one side, and light canvas cloth on the other side (great as it provided a grip on our hardwood floor and didn't slide around once we were painting). The blue plastic was effective, no leakages to other side and we found the width was perfect as it caught all our splatter from using a roller and brush.

The print size being such that a senor may find it difficult to read.Third, The soft back binding is holding up very well.The translator does a great job using the Latin basically, backing it up by the French. When he has a difficult time of translating the nuance from Latin, he gives you the French translation as a foot note. Reason being that when Calvin translated his own writing into French, he inserted or added some French. Seeing as how I know neither, Latin or French, I thought I would use Thumpers wisdom from the movie \\"Bambi\\", 'that if you can't say something good about somebody don't say nothing at all'."},{"rating":"1","title":"Concerned","review":"I don't own this edition.

At St. John's College, however, I've encountered many of my fellow students who have purchased this edition because of its price and quality at first glance. I admit that the price is amazing for such a large volume, but the editing is poor. The first printing of this edition has a glaring typo on the binding: the INSTITIUTES of the Christian Religion.

I realize that this book was written for the Christian family, but not one of the reviews even mentions how explicitly Christian it is. In my view that is an oversight, this is a book that has two equally strong themes, the promises a Daddy makes and the promises that Christians believe Jesus made. It will be a wonderful fit for many home libraries, but not ours."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for small spaces","review":"Excellent for college dorm rooms where space is limited.

What a horrible design, what a horrible unit. You can make it work and fit two of the Closet maid foldable cloth drawers inside this unit with a short shelf space left for a book or something, but even then the two openings for the drawers are different sizes, look stupid, not uniform and the whole thing is super flimsy throughout! It would have been just as easy to design and manufacture a unit that takes 3 of the Closetmaid fabric drawers that they always sell right next to this unit, but instead somebody just decided to screw it all up. What a waste of my money and time, gotta pack up the whole mess and return it to the store."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing!","review":"I loved all of the DVD's.

I purchased and read this book hoping for some insight which would help me prepare for my daughter's IEP. I wish I had spent the time reading this book organizing my closets or on some worthy endeavor as I feel that the time I spent reading was wasted. I found this book to oversimplify the necessary elements of an IEP and of the IDEA. For parents who have never been through an IEP, this will not give them much assistance. I much prefer the Wrightslaw publications, as they are much more thorough and better outline the children's rights."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I found this book was overrated and lumpy. I found more concise and useful information in WrightsLaw. This book talks about a non-existent world of school administrators, and impractical and misleading sunny little paragraphs about what to do, like they will actually work. The brief sojourn into methodology is glaringly misinformed, ignoring 40 years of Applied Behavioral Analysis, OT, Speech and other therapies with a dismissive paragraph about Lovaas Method vs. TEACCH. This book is long-winded other places where a tactful editor could have made it a lot easier to read and understand. The best part was the index of common phrases, the cute case examples about kids and the list of other books to read. Some of the copy came off as insulting too, like parents are slow-witted and need help in understanding everything, so speak slowly. Wished I'd spent the money on something else."},{"rating":"2","title":"great book","review":"This book really opened my eyes on marital intimacy. I new that sex was supposed to be a special thing between you and your spouse, but I had no idea how much more it could be.

My husband was raised by faithful (closed minded, shy and prudish) parents. They never, not once, spoke to him about sex and because of that and the \\"humility\\" (huge self esteem issues) they instilled in him, he is very shy and uncomfortable in the bedroom. This book talks so much about personal purity being the way to greater intimacy- we have intimacy, we have a great fun, we talk to each other and serve one another.... I need a book to teach us how to reverse all the psychological damage that is so common within Mormon families... this isn't it.This book talks about intimacy in the sense of kindness and service, it does not touch much on passion (ie. sex)."},{"rating":"1","title":"I guess this book is ok if you want to know about intimacy","review":"For those of you who want to buy this book and you think by intimacy, the title is alluding to sex, you're wrong it's not. Very few things, like 2 or 3 can be found in this book about the church's view on marital sex. Those 2 or 3 things couldn't be farther apart from each other or more vague. If you really want to know what the church thinks and you can't wait until right before you get married, ask a couple who was married in the temple or some one who has received instruction about such matters from a bishop or someone like that."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Watchband","review":"This band is great fits well on a big guys wrist with some room to expand very comfortable and durable"},{"rating":"2","title":"It is by Hal Leonard - of course it is a guitar tab book","review":"What were these other reviewers thinking?

Here are just a few:First, in some cases it actually sticks closer to the book, such as in the fact that Mary's parents actually die of cholera in India rather than an earthquake.Also, this edition seems to be much more accessible to children, and not just by the fact that it is animated. Catchy songs encourage children to sing along and thus engage with the film more than they would with another movie version. That, and the animals are given a larger role, such as that as the robin and Darjeeling the cat, which is also more fun to watch if not 100% accurate.Overall, I much prefer this version over the other, although they are both lovely to watch. Again, it's more geared towards kids than the other one, but it's also more easy to get the flow of as the simple plot points are made more clear than in the live-action movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Review","review":"The book was in superb condition.

They are concerned, compassionate ,brillant individuals. This book draws conclusions about them based on superficial evidence. For example one claim is made that medicines did not work over a four week period. Anticonvulsants take many weeks to adjust in the system. Doctors guide patients carefully through that adjustment. To summarily dismiss doctors because of the erroneous or misguided testimony of a few patients is morally wrong.There is no easy cure for the many causes of epilepsy . I can relate to the author's frustrations but to dismiss the care of the best minds devoted to the health of their patients is irresponsible.I wish I could get my money back. There is no value to the remedies discussed in this book.

First it is interesting to read about the differences between women living in India, a group of people that a western gaze tends to homogenize.

I reviewed her first compilation of Tin Pan Alley and American Songbook songs and this cd carries on its strengths and weaknesses. Strenghs: it's got lots of ukulele, is wonderfully produced with lots of variety and never overpowers her passable playing. There are lots of fun old songs that go well with ukulele.(I have methodically gone through both cd's working up songs for our ukulele club....) Weaknesses: her voice. I do not mean to be unkind but it is that of an older woman who has lost whatever chops she may have had. That's a minor issue for the quality of tune selection, her enthusiasm and the quality of the studio musicians--reminds me of what Nelson Riddle did for the trio of Linda Ronstadt American Songbook albums."},{"rating":"2","title":"Something Else","review":"Something Else, that is for sure!There are some cracking tracks on this album, the finest I have heard from this genre in a long time and look forward to more, much more from Celine!Toe tapping fun and her banjo playing is the best I have heard in years!

The premise sounds a bit pretentious and cheesey but the filmakers somehow never seem to over-do the stories. They attempt to tell the stories of a few of the 186 survivors left in San Francisco. The film brings up more than a few philsophical debates that the survivors encounter. Look for a great acting turn from Myth Buster's Adam Savage. Most of the acting is great and the filmakers convey a sense of desolation in SF with out a huge CG budget. Probably one of the best movies I have purchased from Amazon. I hope that the writer/director/cinematography team can get a project with a much bigger budget."},{"rating":"2","title":"A very interesting documentary style look at a post-apocalyptic world","review":"This movie is very interesting to watch, and the characters bring a nice glimpse into the changed world, although some tend to sometimes sound as if they were in a Sociology discussion group in a coffee shop. The makers of this film appear to have done their homework in that there is a good attention to detail of how the characters would probably be living after such an event. It is worth watching for those, like myself, who are fans of the post-apocalyptic genre. Another minor drawback is that a small few of the characters, especially those who were existing in a less civilized manner, appeared to be very clean-shaven and not too far removed from a barber shop. Overall the film is definitely worth a watch."},{"rating":"2","title":"Monkey King Jasmine Green Tea","review":"I share an interest in Chinese theatre with a friend and bought this as a birthday gift for her."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Cure For Insomnia","review":"A third grader could have written this movie better.

She was one of those singers that was so unique that she transcended many popular genres.No better example of her skill can be found than on \\"It Looks Like Snow\\". She tackled the blues (\\"Girlish Ways\\"), the torch song (\\"Teach Me Tonight\\"), an anthem (\\"Have Mercy on Me\\"), a somber ballad (\\"Don't Bring Me Down\\"), and funk (\\"Shaky Ground\\"). These and the other five tracks show a versatility that is scarce in the music biz.Perhaps, it was her singular talent that made her impossible to \\"pigeonhole\\" or program in the radio formats of the day.Thankfully, modern audiences are a little more diverse and are likely to be more appreciative of this lost 70's wonder.I highly recommended this bit of \\"frozen precipitation\\" for one's music library."},{"rating":"1","title":"audio quality issues","review":"Good collection; sound is rotten.

Our Internet connection is through Direcway/Hughes satellite and a router won't work with it. A hub/switch and a wireless access point is required instead. Setup for the WPN802 was fairly straight forward using the enclosed paper Installation Guide. Configuring the desktop computer to communicate with the WPN802's IP address was all that was really necessary. After that the WPN802 was connected to the hub/switch and we were ready to go wireless.Netgear also provides a thorough manual on disk that provides additional information for more complicated setups.

The current $20 rebate also helps."},{"rating":"1","title":"Range inferior and setup harder than Linksys","review":"I had a Linksys SRX but wanted a second access point to complete coverage in house. The linksys was an older model and one complaint was that it would randomly power off i think mostly after power outages. I put this netgear product in the same location and got half the bars on each of the multiple laptops that i use in the same location i used the linksys. I changed the position of the access point every which way possible. The linkys has better range by far. Also the setup requires that you plug it into a computer and change IP settings and then after its set up any setting changes will require that you take it off your router, change ip settings etc etc. not impossible but far less easy than the linksys set up and a much bigger pain managing it after installation."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works well, but the instructions are a bit lacking","review":"I needed to buy a new wireless access point because the Link Sys I had... well... stank.

I've had it a few weeks now and I have not needed to reboot it one time.So, why the four stars? I only wish they had put as much thought into the instructions as they did the access point. In a lot of the steps, they only tell you to do things without actually telling you how to do them. I needed to use Google to do some of the steps like changing my IP address. It also doesn't give you a lot of help on the security set up, but luckily I have done that part before and I just set it to look like my old one.All in all, it is a good little access point, they just need to put some more effort into their instructions."},{"rating":"2","title":"This doll is a beauty","review":"I really loved this doll she look just like Martina Mcbride although Mattel used the regular Barbie face mold they did a great job and I was please to see that she has the normal headsize not the big head like the other Barbies from the cali line I hope Mattel keep making beautifull dolls like this one, and stop making those ugly big headed dolls keep the myscene apart from the regular barbie line."},{"rating":"1","title":"Angry Customer/ 0 STARS!!!!!","review":"I would love to rate this book.

I find this product thaws frozen milk VERY quickly. Perhaps we're using it differently? I always fill it up with water and let the milk sit for a couple of minutes. Maybe I have fewer ounces of milk frozen? My bags usually have about 6 ounes.After using it for a while I realize I could probably get the same results by filling any small plastic container with water and putting a lid on it, but then I wouldn't have the nifty thermometer sticker.Worth the price!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Useful but not necessary","review":"While the concept of this device is great, and it works quite well, it really isn't a necessary addition to the baby arsenal.

It says top shelf dishwasher safe, but after running it through the the temperature sticker started coming off and the top 'cap' no longer held in place. One of the benefits of this over a bowl is that the lid keeps the bottle being warmed from floating out of the water. This helps the bottle warm faster since all of the milk is submerged. We tried contacting Firt Years to get the top replaced and were told they were not able to and to return it to the store. Surprised at the hassle and the warmer now serves limited purpose."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting","review":"This is a compilation of stories from a few who were wrongly convicted and later exonerated. The stories are extremely interesting and are transcribed from interviews. The most interesting aspect was the appendix, which was full of additional information on topics related to prison, wrongful convictions, and compensation (or lack thereof) for exonerees. Definitely gets one thinking about \\"justice\\" and includes plenty of information for thinking deeply about and discussing the U.S. justice system and state of prisons."},{"rating":"1","title":"Chapin sprayer","review":"quality seemed pretty good when first tested although pump seemed flimsy. I used the sprayer about 5 times and during the next use the tank wouldnt hold air because the pressure release valve broke. Air was escaping with only 2 pumps through the valve which is only supposed to release air when twisted clockwise or when pulled up. When inspecting the tank I saw a small washer at the bottom of the tank which I am sure was part of the valve and cause of the problem. I only used water with this no harsh chemicals or anything. I am sending back and getting a full refund.

Unfortunately there is no more updated edition of these authors."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great with good set of headphones","review":"Not much for being musical (melodious), but then that would not fit the definition of \\"dub\\". Dub consists mostly of reggae-like beat (percussion, bass, etc) with good measures of musical sounds (reverbs, echos, synthesizer, instruments, whatever, etc), and voices mixed in. A \\"performance\\" in this case is very much a free-form creation at the mixing desk.What make this one great, even for non-dub fans, is the sonic excellence in the tracks. Each is unique in itself. The sounds run the whole gamut - from bass notes that can be felt more than heard, to saxophone or flute solos, to human voices, to tingling cymbal highs, all recorded in great fidelity. The sum makes this album great for testing out a good set of headphones.Also, there is absolutely no chance you will fall asleep listening to this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"COULD HAVE BEEN BETTER","review":"This CD could have been better if the company that produced it could've been a little more selective in the song listings.

The good songs are:\\"Cherokee\\" by Charlie Barnet\\"Begin The Beguine\\" by Artie Shaw\\"Don't Be That Way\\" by Benny Goodman\\"Lonely Melody\\" by Paul Whiteman\\"Opus One\\" by Tommy DorseyThe other songs (however) are pretty lousy. If only they had selected another Glenn Miller song, than that would've been nice, but \\"Song Of The Volga Boatmen\\" is NOT one of his BETTER SONGS. Same thing with Tommy Dorsey's \\"Opus One\\" and Charlie Barnet's \\"Cherokee.\\" But nonetheless, who cares?If they come out with another volume in this series, I hope theirs better songs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful","review":"I\`m chilean civil engineer student, and bought this book to understand some english technical words.

The approach is questionable and the content not very informative, I fear. Even worse the book lacks many technical and functional groupware basics (workflow management, knowledge management, meeting systems etc.), not to mention enterprise issues: Business benefits? Deployment expenses? Costs of ownership? Methods for groupware evaluation? Unbiased market analysis? Unfortunately all not in this book. The book (220 text-pages) is an introduction into personal computer networks and internet/intranet technologies (190 pages) with some very basic aspects of how connected systems help people better cooperate (30 pages). It is about a lot of things (mostly Microsoft things, that is), but not about groupware.

Although the book is quite pleasant, I cannot imagine myself as a child connecting with any bit of it. According to Hubbard, one should hug an elephant if it steps on your bicycle. \\"You Forgive\\" commands the text, and, obviously it was an accident, as the elephant is shedding a single tear. This seems another of those \\"picture books for parents\\" we always wish we had a separate shelf for. Buy it if you have the new age parents who need such affirmations.

This album has everything a true music fan craves. First, Sattie's voice is nothing short of angelic. How she hits and holds some of those notes, I'll never understand. This gal can sing.The lyrics are awesome. Without music the words stand alone as beautiful poetry. They instigate deep thinking and contemplations of pain and loss, acceptance and forgiveness, and ultimately, peace and hope.The music behind the voice is solid and very original. In addition to the wonderful acoustic guitar, there are selections featuring haunting cello and groovy electric guitar. The drumming is exceptional.This is the rare album that you don't skip through to hear that one good song. Every song is very good and flows easily to the next. This is the right stuff.The folks in Chico, California are impatiently waiting for Sattie to tour."},{"rating":"1","title":"may not play in computer/quizas no toca en tu computadora","review":"this supposedly has copy protection and will not play on a CD-ROM drive (like in your computer).

CD2: Ummm","review":"OK, I hope this review is a little more comprehensive then the last one. I thought CD 1 was excellent. As expected, there is no cheesy trance (a standing tradition of Global Underground and the Boxed Boys), just good stuff here. CD 2 is great at first, but gets kinda boring and lost in the middle. It doesn't hold up to the standards of the first CD. That leaves the question: Should I buy it? Well, there are better GUs out there, but this one is... good and would buy it anyway. It would be a safe bet for you to buy them all. It's all good."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfection!","review":"When I first started listening to trance, I was totally into Oakenfold. I really dug his sound, but he seemed to get too artsy at times. I've listened to alot of trance since then. And out of all the albums that I own, I can say that without a doubt that this and Dave's Buenos Aires albums are the best that I've heard yet. Seaman keeps the trance banging without stop and when it does slow down, he does it at exactly the right times. Both CD's are good, but I think that the second one is a little bit better. Both CD's end perfectly. Seaman's track selection couldn't be better and his mixing skills are up there with Digweed's. This album is so good that by the time you get to about the sixth or seventh track on each CD, you'll be extremely joyous to learn that their are still another five or six tracks left to explore. Great album. A must for any fan of electronic music."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring and comercial set!","review":"I'm very disappointed with this set, definitively all the tracks are very comercial trance and boring, strange to be a GU CD,nothing to do with the Global underground quality sets, if you like the comercial trance buy it.Definitivamente para los que les gusta el trance burdo y comercial este es un buen CD, mas nada que ver con las maravillas que habiamos escuchado como por ejemplo Ibiza de Sasha o Moscu de Deep Dish, creo que es muy el estilo de Seaman ya que se asemeja mucho al set de Buenos Aires."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too little for the title","review":"This book does contain a few nuggets, but falls severely short of Jerry's wisdom. Most of the one-liners are catchy, sometimes introspective, sometimes humorous, but for those who have not read enough interviews with the man, to take this little book as a summation of the man's wisdom would be folly. Jerry had so much more to say (and he did) about things like life than this book contains. Someone who doesn't know any better and bases his/her opinion of the man's influence on millions of lives on this book will end up being disappointed and ultimately dismissive of the man's greatness. For true insights into the man's wisdom, read his interviews! Read \\"Garcia\\" by the editors of Rolling Stone! Please! and besides, i don't believe this book was cooked up by David Gans.

That doesn't like a pop-style record to me....and I think perhaps the last reviewer missed the point of \\"Supersede\\" entirely. Personally, I think it's a great idea for a song.

You'll definitely be sweating, but there's overall too much extra coordination required for this video (and I'm apparently normally coordinated). You're literally going around and around your step in weird ways that are not necessary at some points. And not easy to figure out when your back is to your tv. And I would definitely not recommend this for anyone with problem knees/ankles. Although the intensity is not a problem, the moves are. The woman on the left (who seems to be competing for air time) choreographed the 2nd segment, which explains Kathy's prompting problems there. The first segment is somewhat better.Overall, get another step video by Kathy Smith. Not this one, unless you're looking for a new cheerleading routine."},{"rating":"2","title":"WOW!!!","review":"This video has 2 major segments. You'll start with a short 14 minute progressive interval step sequence which is very easy to follow (although you may need to slow it down if you are a beginner). It starts gently and then increases in intensity through about a 4 minute peak of lunges, then cooldown slightly and start 4 minutes of arm weights. This progression then repeats (with different moves) for the second major segment. Then there is a series of 100 sit ups (20 of each type) and then a few moves to work on your back. Then there's a stretch.This is a great workout! I have never been so sweaty and felt so good in my life!I would recommend this video to anyone who is in decent cardiovascular health who wants to work out to their maximum capacity."},{"rating":"1","title":"BETTER BE FAST ON YOUR FEET!!!","review":"I have been running regularly for the past 6 months, so with winter here, I thought I could use a good cardio workout. I already own ULTIMATE PILATES and LIFT WEIGHTS TO LOSE WEIGHT 2 from Kathy Smith and I truely enjoy them. As for FAT BURNING BEAKTHROUGH, my mistake was not reading all the reviews before purchasing it.I agree with customers who said the step routine was very complicated. I have tried it many times, and still miss quite a few steps. There comes a point where I just can't follow anymore, and my heart rate goes down. The camera angles make it difficult sometimes to see the leg work, and those who don't have a step at home will not always see the lady on the right of their screen who is the only one without a step.I do like the weight lifting and ab section though, which I combine with other workouts or pop in after a run.I would love to find a good and relatively simple cardio workout either from Kathy Smith or another fitness expert. Any suggestions?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good workout for those who need something new","review":"This was surprisingly tough; not that any of Kathy's videos are exceptionally \\"easy\\", but her choreography is generally not very complicated, which is why I like her videos.

The steps are tricky - but I just hopped along anyway and kept the same intensity and I was definitely sore the next day!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun and Effective","review":"This tape is fantastic! The \\"waves\\" bring my heart rate up gradually, and I love the weightlifting mixed in with the cardio workout. The first few times through, I thought this workout was too intense, but now that I do it frequently, it's an excellent workout. I can really tell my overall fitness has improved - now when I do my other tapes that used to be really challenging, I sail right through. It's fun to see progress!The choreography is very fun with good variety and interesting moves. As a novice stepper, it was a great way to get started."},{"rating":"1","title":"Only for Kathy Smith's fans","review":"This is my first (probably last) Kathy Smith's video, but I workout everyday, so all the time I look for new workouts not to be board doing the same routines over and over.I bought this video with great expectations after reading the reviews. It was exactly what I was looking for: 50 minutes workout, hi energy, fun...When I actually tried it I found it to be very frustrating: the instructions are not clear and sometimes misleading, the choreography is too complicated to follow at home - she turns around all the time, so if I do what she does I find myself with my back to the TV, and this is the point when she makes a change in the move ... moreover, if I follow her exactly I find I do twice the same side. I tried doing the workout several times, because I liked the music etc - but thanks, I stay with Gilead, Karen Voight and even my old Jane FondaBottom line: If you know and love Kathy's style than you will probably love this one as well, otherwise - don't touch it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good aerobic tape but modulation needed with Kathy's voice","review":"I think this is a good exertional aerobic tape. Kathy's voice though is particularly annoying, she tends to be high pitched at times. The girls seem to have their own agenda, vying to be seen for their own needs. I would recommend Gin Miller's Intense Moves, she's great, she's tireless, voice is perfect and inspirational, her crew seems to be more down to earth."},{"rating":"1","title":"GIve this one a miss","review":"Don't bother with this one unless you are a 20 year old aerobics instructor. It's simply too fast, too confusing and too annoying. After working out with Kathy's \\"Step Workout\\" (which is excellent), I thought I could trust her to put together enjoyable workouts that don't make normal people feel like klutzes. Sure, the Fat Burning Breakthrough got my heart rate up, along with my blood pressure as I realized there is virtually no way anyone but a professional dancer can follow this routine. Add in camera angles that make in difficult to see what anyone is doing, and this video is a bust."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Dancy","review":"If you prefer athletic routines that focus on getting the job done, you will not like this tape.

This one however, did not work for me. The problem is that the footwork is very complicated. I admit that I'm not the most coordinated person in the world, but I can usually keep up well enough to keep exercising. With this video, I got so confused with all the turns, side steps and step-ups at awkward angles, that I couldn't keep up with what they were doing. It was very frustrating. If you are looking for a good workout with relatively simple footwork (like me), this one isn't for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Kathy Rules!","review":"I have all of Kathy's other step tapes and I love this one the aboslute best!! I'm not the most coordinated person in the world, but it only took me a week to get the entire routine down. If you've done any of her tapes prior to this one, you will recognize a number of the moves. They are not that difficult to learn.I don't think of it as dancey, but I can see how others might think so. Personally that's what I LIKE about it. Like I said, I'm not the most coordinated person and being able to do this work out tape was a challenge and a triumph.Zone three in both segments is killer, but they're my favorite parts of the work out. Especially the second one. By the end I'm dripping sweat but for me a work out isn't a good one unless I drink almost all my bottle of water and I do with this one.If you want a work out that is interesting, challenging and works your body like nothing else, this is the tape for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"I love Kathy Smith","review":"This is a great workout and its outdoors, which is a nice change of pace from the livingroom. The moves are a little complicated towards the end (turns, leg twirls, etc.) so I opt to leave them out and adapt my own style instead.

Juan Luis Guerra is credited with making Bachata into something special, giving it poetry and majesty. Well Monchy and Alexandra have taken Bachata to new heights. I think the title song Hoja en Blanco is probably the best Bachata song ever recorded. Heart wrenching lyrics, dueling vocals culminating in a wonderful harmonization, and fabulous melody make this song a standout. The other highlight of the CD is a remake of Mana's En el Muelle de San Blas. Note that the last track Volvere is not the same song the DLG (Dark Latin Groove) recorded as a remake of Wilfrido Vargas' Volvere. It's a completely different song.Granted, you'll probably be sick of Bachata after a full CD of it, but all of these songs are great and do wonders as part of any party or listening mix."},{"rating":"2","title":"Blown Away!!","review":"This cd has just blown me away, I am very struck over it,Its so Romantic and I have found a few songs that really are into a personal problem i am dealing with..I Love Hoja en Blanco ..I bought the cd for that song,But after hearing the whole cd ..Wow i can say there are Lots of songs on the I relate to and have made this cd #1 on my list..I play it practicaly 24/7.......

The Firesign Theatre was THE comedy team in the 70's. Combining thoughtful observations with unbridled hilarity, Firesign Theatre made sense in a perhaps too serious culture. This product was my personal favorite, and repeated listening still brings out nuances in the recording. In this, there seems to be a life review for one George Tirebiter, at least he looks like the main charactor. 'Dave Casmin' plays Porgie Tirebiter in the mini-episode of \\"High School Madness\\". At least it appears that way as we rollercoaster our way through the various scenarios. You have to see for yourself on the most outrageous ride of your life.

Worse, the CD case was shattered when I received it, though Amazon thoughtfully included another broken CD case that combined made a semi-functional case. I've read on the firesign newsgroup that at least one other person received a broken case from another retailer, so I suspect that the fault likes with Evangenline Records.I just had to turn this off because the distortion was so bad.

Author Charles Higham is somewhat notorious for his more controversial biographies such as the one on Errol Flynn but this one on Davis has it's feet on the ground (although his allegations that Joan Crawford lusted after Davis were quite shocking to many back then and denied by some). It was also the first book on Davis that punctured her carefully constructed image as a serene grande dame of films off the screen and the first to write of her romances with Howard Hughes and William Wyler. Even with opening the door on some aspects of Davis' life, he is fairly respectful and seems to admire her courage and strength. Davis herself did not knock the book which should say something.

For one thing, (big pet peeve), The author is simply not careful with dates, and therefore one worries that he's not careful with other information as well. For example, observant readers will love Bette's 13-month-long pregnancy with daughter BD Hyman.The book was published in 1981, and so is pre-Bette's strokes and mastectomy, and pre \\"My Mother's Keeper\\".Not a bad read, but there are many others, written a little more carefully and covering Bette's entire life, which are more worth the reader's time."},{"rating":"1","title":"DO NOT BUY","review":"I was searching for some classical music at an online music store, and I came across the \\"Cantanti Collection.\\" They are so horrible that I don't see how they have their own CD.

There is one unreleased track which wasn't butchered by Taime, called \\"Blood\\". It sounds like a mix between \\"Nonstop to Nowhere\\" and \\"Body Thief\\" (if that's possible).

A great read!"},{"rating":"2","title":"What May Prevent Us from Going to Light ?","review":"A must-read book to everyone interested in what may prevent us from going to light after our death.The rescue stories reveal what makes us gravitate back to earth in afterlife; in other words, what may keep us in state of limbo between the worlds.This is more than a good book because of its sincerity. It comes from the author, John Brooker's compassion toward souls in limbo. He had endured rescue work that brings no fame or money in decades, and it says it all.In this book, you will find no judgments, rudeness, or cynicism -- only wish to help and an honest account of a person who knows what he is writing about."},{"rating":"1","title":"Grave errors","review":"Although the novel wasn't bad, there are 2 glaring errors that caused me to give it only one star. First of all, the final chapter (#28) was out of sequence. It belonged somewhere around chapter 20 or there abouts. A really stupid error. The second thing that bothered me is the Epilogue. Usually in an epilogue, the author ties up any loose ends and perhaps throws in some background info about what happened after the events in the book. This the author did. However, he specifically mentions that the leading General in the book, General Scherer met with an author by the name of Lucas in 1977 to help him write the history of the battle of Cholm. This is absurd, since the general died in an auto accident in 1955!!! And the author should have known this since Siege was published in 2003! A big disappointment."},{"rating":"2","title":"GEO.

I don't know if it's a new color, but it's a soft, muted color that goes well with other colors and looks good behind the glass in my kitchen cabinet.The glaze is cadmium and lead free. The plate goes from the freezer to the refrigerator to the microwave or oven and is dishwasher safe, making it the perfect plate for me. I'm buying them in many different colors to replace some 7-year old plates that have some cracking in the glaze and are no longer available to purchase. They're now delegated to be saucers for plants.I find the 9\\" luncheon plates to be the best size for most meals, especially if you enjoy using extra salad and/or bread plates.

(It was labeled as \\"used\\", but it was brand new.)I loaded up the trough w/ hi temp caulk so the water can't collect there.

Indeed, the book is an excellent reference for those who are already EXTREMELY well-versed in the subject and/or are looking to branch out into more detail and abstraction. For the rest of us, however, this book is ENTIRELY unsuitable--even, I daresay, for the \\"advanced undergraduate\\" this book purports to aim itself at.

This organizer is sturdy, but made from the same standard cardboard material most expandable files are made from. The \\"leather\\" design printed on the front and back isn't even slightly convincing or attractive. Very deceptive advertising.I found the organizer to be much too narrow, to hold much of anything, let alone it's advertised 900+ sheets of paper. The pockets are not large enough to hold a file folder so I'm always fishing around the bottom for loose papers. The open top is convenient, but the size and construction make it a fairly disposable item. Doesn't really work for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"High Quality Expandable Folder","review":"This is a high-quality folder with the pockets labeled by month. The pocket dividers are also sturdy which means they shouldn't tear just from getting things out of the folder.

While you can't stuff a whole bunch of paper into each section and smaller sheets would be hard to retrieve, this will definitely accommodate the letter-size statements I'm using it for.

But there are minor points that the buyer might want to know.No flap on top. Smead makes a selling point out of this! But I think most people want a flap - you can always cut it off it you don't need it.A little sloppy on the cosmetics. The paper lining the front and back is glued on and some of the edges look like they might be peeling. This would have NO effect on the organizer as a whole - just looks a little sloppy and I might have that one bad apple in the batch.It IS very strong. The tyvex panels in front and back are overkill. Nice. I think the parts that wear the most (side panels) are reasonably strong.

What remains to be seen is how the thickened, reinforced panels cope with daily use.I like this expanding file for several reasons. After getting this I pulled the accordion edges apart, gently, but firmly, to see how much they could expand. And expand they did. Which means this file can potentially hold hundreds of papers. The twelve indexed separators are a useful utility to help organize stuff you put into it.This is paper, all the way. Paper reinforced with more paper at places. How long this will last with the regular wear and tear accompanying regular use I don't know. I have my own strategy of reinforcing the edges with tape though.This file does not have a cover or a strap or hook or flap that would allow me to cover the top, either completely or partially. One would have been useful, but since it's not there, it's a negative, small one however."},{"rating":"1","title":"This documentary is a Disgrace~","review":"HRH the Prince William of Wales is a very interesting person, but this movie only talks about him.

Having to do with his schooling, his family (very interesting), his hobbies, and we know there is alot of footage on the Prince, but the person directing and producing this documentary clearly planned on making a quickly done, low-budget film, and he succeeded, but he/she also succeeded in producing a cheaply done film."},{"rating":"1","title":"Completely Awful!","review":"Do not waste your money on something many girls already know of this teen heartthrob.

This well-written book is full of great information and is, in my opinion, a must add to any serious collection. Is the book perfect ?? No, some people won't like how pretentious mr. Douglas can be at time, however nobody can deny that mr. Douglas is one of the most respected and credible True Crime author in the world, and because of that I think we should go beyond these flaws.So if, like me, True crimes/Criminology is more than a passion for you, then buy this book, and for less than 10$ you won't regret it. :)"},{"rating":"1","title":"ME, ME, ME, and MORE ABOUT ME!!","review":"I found that his first book, MINDHUNTER, was a phenomenal piece of reading. For the novice criminalist, I would venture to say that it could possibly serve as an astute guide to introductory profiling.

It was deafening the decibel level of his own horn-blowing. :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Anatomy of Motive","review":"I enjoyed this book as it is a primer for aspiring forensic psychologists. This book is aimed at the interested public who don't know a lot about forensic or criminal psychology. Douglas with the help of Olshaker draw upon their experience to draw you into the book with lurid stories of crimes however the actual psychology and motives of theses crimes do tend to take a back-seat. Which is what you would expect from a pop psychology book.

Of some interest is the warning signs to look for in others that may spell potential trouble."},{"rating":"2","title":"John Douglas' best book yet.","review":"I've read almost all of John Douglas' book and this is my favorite by far. Though it suffers from redundancy at points, merely repeating the same stories he's told in all of his other books, it is undoubtedly the most clearly written.

It takes a look inside the mind of evil and hate. Douglas tries to make sense of why people do the horrible things people do. He never condones them, he just tries to find out why the acts were committed so that we may prevent them in the future.

However, all of his books are essentially the same theme; just formatted in a different fashion. I know that John Douglas is concerned about putting felons away. He's also a businessman who realizes that he can also make a couple of bucks on the side selling books about this subject. It's going to be interesting to see what the next book is about. By the way, I'm sure I'll read it"},{"rating":"1","title":"Short on substance, long on purile descriptions.","review":"The book is not without insightful comments and stories regarding the nature and motives behind certain criminal acts. However the last half of the book deals primarily with mass murderers and spree killers. These portions are simply lurid and disturbing as opposed to earlier more technical sections dealing with serial killers. One wonders why the editors at Scribners did not push for more meaningful analysis in the later parts of the book. It seems as if a project well started was rushed to completion.Douglas is somewhat self-promoting which gets in the way of his credibility at times."},{"rating":"2","title":"John Douglas - Mindhunter","review":"Having read all the Douglas et al books I have to say that I find his work fascinating, though it lacks the psychological insight of someone like Paul Britton, a British forensic psychologist (author of \\"The Jigsaw Man\\" Corgi,1997; and \\"Picking Up The Pieces\\" Corgi, 2000). I have heard Douglas described as arrogant - but given his expertise, his compassion for the victims, and his desire to amass as much information on signature killers (Bob Keppel's description) in order to attempt to understand and try to head them off - I have to agree that some of the arrogance is deserved. The books are full of detail about the horrendous cruelty that we seem to see and hear so much of, the terrible pain of the victim's families and, thankfully, attempts to understand and explain what motivates these predators. Overall his books are a must for anyone who is interested in why, rather than how, these monsters prey on us. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting but has some weaknesses","review":"If you are a student of criminal psychology or work in law enforcement, I wouldn't recommend this book (or Doulgas' \\"Mindhunter\\")as a study guide. I'm new to the subject, so it was an interesting read for me. However, Douglas has his flaws as a writer,in many cases jumping from one subject to the next for no apparent reason, and at first I thought his tone was a bit too conversational. However, once I forgave those flaws.. I found this book and \\"Mindhunter\\" fun to read (altho the books are very similar, no need to read both).After finishing both I felt as though I had just spent an evening with Douglas at a divy bar somewhere listening to his fascinating war stories.

BUYER BEWARE! IT IS NOTHING LIKE THE IMAGE SHOWN! I am beyond disappointed & honestly would like my money back. The ring I got was blackened, very poorly crafted, bent, dented, cracked, scratched, crooked & looked like it had been burnt to a crisp before it was sent to me (which is to say besides being mostly black all over, there is a coating of rough black substance quite like hardened soot on it).I've had some bad purchases before but this is by far the worst. Sometimes variations in the expectation of an online order are tolerable like size or color....maybe even design and style but this looked like they beat the crap out of it deliberatly before they sent it to me.

In this book Lestrade goes undercover to investigate the deaths of elderly veterans who belonged to the same army regiment. His disguises include other investigators at Scotland Yard, as well as an orthodox rabbi, and his case has him traversing the country into every corner of the countryside.There's plenty to like about these mysteries, and I enjoyed this one. Though they are based on the Inspector Lestrade character in the Sherlock Holmes books, Holmes and Watson are very marginal to this book, even more so than they were in the first in the series. It is Lestrade who is the center of London investigations. This is not a series for those who take their Holmes seriously. Trow takes plenty of liberties, and the main attraction for me is their humorous writing, not their adherence to Conan Doyle's canon."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great product","review":"These are great!

It looks promising, but only time will tell.For those of you with nothing to compare it to, get past the camo.

They add about 10 degrees of warmth to a sleeping bag with tucked inside and are really cool when you need to cover up in the summer.

On this album, Marshall delves deeper into his love of Brazilian jazz, exploring the work of avantnik multi-instrumentalist Hermeto Pascoal, one of the most original and more challenging modern Brazilian jazz players. On the whole, I would say this set is far less \\"out there\\" than most of Pascoal's own albums, but the interplay between mandolinist Marshall and pianist Jovino Santos Neto reveals a strong intuitive link, both between the performers and the music they're tackling.

Not only has the film aged, but so have we all. All those who can no longer grasp the point of this film - leave them alone. They'll never get it. But if you - like me - have lived long enough to see your radicalism shrivel into conformism, to see your youthful ideals replaced with middle-aged complaisance, or to see your teenaged sweetheart inflate into someone else's frowzy wife (just as you yourself grew into someone's frowzy husband), then \\"Vanishing Point\\" will seem like a dirge. It makes you wonder why we all didn't drive our Dodges headlong into a bulldozer. But, then again, the highway is still there. . . ."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mopar Power","review":"I first viewed this movie in the early seventies and was most impressed by the powerful Dodge Challenger and Charger from the film. Mopars from that era were pretty scarce out here back then. The storyline was a bit sketchy in places, but the car chase scenes were good, I am pleased that they didn't destroy genuine musclecars. One of my friends was until this movie a one-eyed Ford man, he converted to Mopars and has stayed with them since. The 90's remake of the movie has a better ending, it doesn't leave you with the stunned empty feeling that the original does."},{"rating":"2","title":"vanishing point","review":"To correct those who were mistaken the Challenger was a 426 HEMI with a hemi crashbox 4spd with a pistol grip shifter. Now on to the movie. This movie more or less is a easy rider in a car.The driver has given up on societal norms and finds peace the only way he can, behind the wheel. I myself have enjoyed watching this movie over and over again. The only part I didn't like was the destruction of a muscle car like the Challenger. For those of you that live for the thrill of the chase there is none better than this movie and Bullit."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must see film for car buffs","review":"Every time I watch this film it gets better.

Watch it more that once."},{"rating":"2","title":"Charlotte Rampling appears at last!!!!","review":"In the mid seventies my father insisted that my family see this film with him, and in '84 Vanishing Point was the first film that I discussed with the man who would become my husband of over twenty years (a '71 Challenger driver/owner). How many times we watched it on Beta, stopping, rewinding, analysing, in a basement apartment in Normal, Illinois, while the snow mounded up against the frozen windows.There was an article in a Mopar Magazine in the early '90's that talked about the two sequences with Charlotte Rampling that had been cut from US distribution. I am still hoping someday to see the one with her in the black hat, where she hisses at Kowalksi and becomes the malevolent spectre of his imminent death. Until then, I am happy to have at last the hitchhiker scene. It adds a darkness and a texture that enhances the end of the film. I am sorry that it was cut. The Sarafian commentary adds a lot too. Finally! It is a good thing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Alter Ego","review":"I saw Vanishing Point for the first time at a drive-in back in 1977. I've seen the movie many times since. I was even fortunate enough to be given the soundtrack to the movie. Overtly, the movie doesn't appear to have much of a plot (just another car chase movie). It may have something to do with the amount of editing that was done. I read somewhere that a significant desert scene was cut from the original. To truely appreciate this movie, the viewer must assume the persona of Kowalski, which by loose definition is having nothing else in life to lose. What sets this movie apart is Kowalski's attitude. He knows that he is in a \\"no-win\\", \\"no-way-out\\" situation. But rather than meekly surrendering to defeat, Kowalski decides that freedom is worth paying the ultimate price."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great car chase flick!","review":"I enjoyed this high octane trip down memory lane, not so much the sudden stop at the end. But you knew Kowalski would never surrender."},{"rating":"2","title":"Vanishing Point, the first movie","review":"Hard to find campy classic explores drug, race, hippy scenes. We must have seen it 10 times when it played in the early 70's. Still watch it every six months or so. Two quick nude scenes were racy in the 70's, but pretty tame now. Characters well developed, car chase scenes excellent for the pre-digital era (when they actually had to do the stunts). Too bad it is a little pricey, but worth the money if you remember it from when it showed in theaters."},{"rating":"2","title":"Vanishing Point Of View...","review":"What more could you want from a movie?? Car chases! Explosions! Nudity! Oh My!! Kowalski (Barry Neuman) is the ultimate anti-hero in this tale of rebellion for no apparent reason. The blind, mysterious \\"Super Soul (The Late-Great Cleavon Little)\\" is Kowalski's guiding light and biggest fan. Roaring through the desert on speed (in that car, that beautiful car), Kowalski becomes public enemy number one to hordes of cops, while becoming a folk hero to the outcasts who embrace him.

I didn't realize that the movie was going to have random naked lady scenes, and my being a lady made it kind of awkward and embarrassing to watch. Especially where this girl rides around naked on her motorcycle for 20 minutes and isn't shy about her body. So I can't recommend it because not only was the movie a little confusing, but I just don't like any kind of porn."},{"rating":"2","title":"Is it Blu-Ray, or is it 426 Hemi?!","review":"The film has already been reviewed. It's a classic. It's a muscle car movie. It's a great period piece of the 1970s American Southwest. And the Blu-Ray brings it all to life in stunning detail, vivid color, and visceral sound. It's a beautiful thing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mesmerizing!","review":"The less said the better. Grab a few beers and hang on for a wild ride. Those old, awesome Dodge 440 Challenger R/Ts are legendary for a good reason. See why in this completely CGI-free, truly real masterpiece. It makes most of the current crop of CGI enhanced movies look, well, kinda ridiculous. This is gritty, visceral reality, as near as can be captured on film. When you see that 440 R/T doing 130 down the highway, IT IS, believe it.I've loved this movie for years and NOTHING I've seen since compares with its car chase content. Not BULLITT, Not RONIN, Not GONE IN 60 SECONDS. About the closest match are the old 500 HP Killer B cars of World Rally Competition, banned for years as too lethal for public safety. The storyline is contrived, but who cares. Where is Vanishing Point II? I wish."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great movie,set the bar.","review":"This was a great movie that stayed in my mind for days! This was my first time watching it. I can now see that this was the film from which all chase movies modeled themselves afterwards. Especially, the chase scenes in the Mad Max movies. No CGI like today.However, my only complaint is that the story really felt like it was riding the exhaust of Easy Rider. Almost same themes and premise."},{"rating":"2","title":"Long Live Mopars","review":"Finally saw this Mopar cult classic tonight - E for Excellent E-Body. That Challenger took all the abuse Kowalski gave it - one complaint was when he started it in the desert, the sound didn't match a Chrysler starter.

There is a Vanishing Point fan club you can find it at the club founder's home page www.monumental.com/kowalski/vpoint.html check it out its a great page Im fan member Jim Kowalski. there are lots of great things I could say many allready mentioned. I read that Cary Lofton the stunt man chose the Challenger because of it great horsepower handling accleration etc. I think he made a great choice because there are many great muscle cars from back then equally fast and the stunts could have been good with any of them. But the Challenger is perfect for Kowalski Because of its name Kowalski challenges to get from Denver to SanFransisco in 15hrs. he challenges the government. He challenges the bulldozers etc. I think VP should have been nominated for an oscar bacause if their going to nominate Thelma and Louise which is a copy of vp and not as good.

These movies are perfect for fans of either one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Existential car chase film","review":"Three films in one: existential art film, car chase exploitation fare, counterculture political statement.I prefer its existential aspects, which hold up best. It may have been a great car chase film for its time, but special effects stunt technology has long since surpassed it. And its counterculture aspects, while historially interesting, are dated. But it remains thought-provoking in its existential philosophizing.Big question, which remains unanswered: Why does he decide to speed across the American west? No easy answers. The bet is just his excuse. And why the ending? (I won't include a spoiler, but it's surprising and intriguing).Film has a great soundtrack. Years ago, it was released on CD in Brazil, and there was reputed to be a limited European CD Club edition. Now out of print, used copies sometimes go for [a lot of money]Entertaining, historically interesting, and thought-provoking."},{"rating":"2","title":"So great it hurts","review":"They don't make movies like this anymore.

I liked it because I've always liked cars and I liked muscle cars like the Dodge Challenger (love the 2008-09 model). Years later, I recorded the movie off of television on VHS, but the quality was so-so. I finally bought the DVD and I really like it. I loved the bonus features like the various movie trailers for the film and the directors commentary by Richard Sarafian. As a video producer and digital filmmaker, the movie still works for me. I did not outgrow it. Although, I think the drug use is a bit much, I understand how the experiences of the Kowalski anti-hero character would lead him to such behavior. Of note is the Super Soul character brilliantly brought to life by Cleavon Little. Vanishing Point is a great action car chase film, a wonderful exercise in filmmaking and a great look back at how films used to be made before the glitz and glitter of Hollywood CGI."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Car Chase Master","review":"For all of you car fanatics out there, especially Mopar fans, this is a movie you should not miss. The movie leaves a lot to the imagination, with little spoken words. The soundtrack just compliments this even more. Barry Newman does an incredible job as Kowlaski, a former race car driver hopped up on speed, driving his 70 Dodge Challenger from Denver to Cisco California in 12 hours. There is just one thing that I cannot figure out: is the Challenger a 440 or a Hemi car? If you are a die hard Mopar fan, you may be able to answer this one!

We all watched together and I cried seeing my son's watching just like when they were little.Please buy, you will not regret it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A great movie!","review":"This movie seems nothing like Star Wars, but if you think about it, they use lasers and blasters, the boy is named Mace, and the Ewoks are in it.

He has been watching the \\"real\\" movies with my husband sitting next to him covering his eyes at the scary parts. I wanted something Star Wars that he could watch without having to worry about that. These are still a bit darker than I would have liked. The 1st movie of the two has at least a redeeming plotline. But I was disturbed by the death of three of the main family members at the beginning of the 2nd movie. It doesn't seem to have disturbed my son, but it bothered me as being a bit unneccesary for a young person's film. My son seems to enjoy both films a lot and has watched them both a few times each. He likes the 1st one featuring the older brother best. Anyway, they may not be on the same caliber of the \\"real\\" movies, but for my son they work just fine."},{"rating":"2","title":"Star Wars Ewok Adventures - Caravan of Courage (aka The Ewok Adventure) / The Battle for Endor","review":"My favorite movie from when I was little."},{"rating":"2","title":"Flashback!!","review":"I bought this movie for my two young children when they were 3 and 4.

Even with the lousy effects and poor acting, they are wonderful family classics that harken to a time when we all believed in other galaxies inhabitated by three-fingered space teddy bears...Anyway, I grew up watching the Ewoks and it just completes the whole Star Wars saga. To answer a few questions:The Ewok advetures are set between episodes 5 and 6 of the Star wars trilogy. There are no actors from the Star Wars series in either movie.

The ONLY extra features are boring audition tapes of the houseguests to be and the DVD set is of very poor quality. There are no scene selection or language options, nor is there subtitling. The episodes themselves appear exactly as they did on TV, with language and nudity censored. No deleted scenes (these people were taped 24/7, I'm sure they could have come up with SOMETHING), NOTHING! This DVD set seemed to me like a bootleg someone burned at home. The packaging is also terrible.The set is worth having if only to relive this great season, but if you are a DVD buff and look forward to those features prominantly found in DVD box sets, you will be sorely disappointed. Absolutely nothing new of any worth to see."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where are the rest?","review":"What good is a DVD set with only the first 4 episodes?

She can climb up and it's low enough that she can slide down herself without me worrying she'll hurt herself if she falls off. It is in my yard and the wind has blown it over and it's still together and sturdy. The periscope works well which I wondered about. Overall a good choice for a small child."},{"rating":"2","title":"He loves it!","review":"My (almost) 2 year old grandson loves it!!

I would recommend this slide for all my friends."},{"rating":"2","title":"Treehouse recommended.","review":"My granddaughter is 15 months old today and we just got the Treehouse. She loves it.

My granddaughter has some trouble climbing it because of the steepness but overall, it is a great toy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Weeee!","review":"My daughter is pretty adventurous.

I purchased this treehouse to go inside our apartment for our daughter when she turned one year old because she has always been a climber. She is now 18 months old and has loved it ever since she got it. We have it placed near a window so she can stand on the platform and look outside.

I would recommand this product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for Toddlers","review":"Our daughter loves to climb on the furniture, bed or anything else she can swing her leg onto, so I thought this would be good for her. She's 1-yr old and mastered the stairs and slide within a few hours of being introduced to it. She spends a lot of time with it, so it's turned out to be a great purchase. It still requires supervision, because little ones can fall out of the open areas inside the treehouse or hit their noggins on the periscope. Our daughter skips at least one of the steps when climbing up, so we have to keep an eye on that, too.Very sturdy & durable, so far. Husband assembled it with little to no problems."},{"rating":"2","title":"FANTASTIC!","review":"My 19 month old daughter LOVES this slide/treehouse combo! she got it yesterday and has not stopped sliding since!VERY affordable and SUPER easy to assemble!

She was not quite walking, but could climb up into the treehouse on her own. She loves sitting up there with some stuffed animals or toys to push down the slide. The side rails make it safe for her to move around on the elevated platform.The slide is good for young children, but probably would be too short and slow when they get a little older (2-3 years). At age 1, the periscope isn't getting much use and is mostly in the way, but it looks cute.Our daughter is able to fit the treehouse fully assembled through her doorways inside during the winter months which means it will get a lot of use year round."},{"rating":"1","title":"toddler climber too small","review":"We bought this for our one year old granddaughter. She may be on the tall side but she already is too tall to stand on the top landing and it was supposed to be for 18 months to 3 years.

The reviews were pretty good but I am dissapointed that she won't be able to play on it for very long."},{"rating":"1","title":"2 year old too tall already","review":"We didn't get to really try this toy out for more than one afternoon, as my 34\\" tall 2 year old was entirely too big for it. She didn't even have to use the stairs to get in to it. She couldn't stand under the top and look through the periscope, and she didn't have enough room to turn around to use the slide to get down. I think a better age range would be 18 mo to 2 or 3 years. We returned it and ordered a slide for the yard instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what they say it is","review":"We ordered it for our son that was 18 months old it said it was for a child 1-1/2 to 5 years old.once we put it together he could not stand up in it the space from floor to the roof was not tall enough for him to stand in.We shiped it back for credit."},{"rating":"2","title":"Spirit Lifter","review":"We have in our midst a combination Kin Hubbard, Will Rogers, and Andy Rooney.

The CD has virtually no artwork or information, There aren't even any track listings (the only two tracks listed in the sleeve refer to mistakes from their last album's linear notes). And yet, the sound is awesome. Varying from far off, velvet tunneled acoustic pieces to straight out stoner/psychedelic tracks that hark back to Pink Floyd's MEDDLE days, the progression of songs keeps you locked in. The heavy bass lines are layed out like thick chunks of candy, sweet as can be.

It has never reappeared in print since.The Singing Ringing Tree is a classic fairy tale of the same calibre as other popular Grimm tales... but somehow forgotten and thankfully unchanged by Disney.The 1956 movie is of course primitive in its technological aspects when considering todays special effects. However, it is true to the storyline; has wonderful costumes and colourful sets; and very little dialogue to confuse the tale.***PS*** For customers in countries other than US and CanadaThis DVD is available as a UK export through the Amazon.de site.If anyone wishes to read the children's picture book by the same name (retold by Selina Hastings, 1988), it is also available through Amazon.com... however, it is severely lacking in the magic portrayed in the movie and original tale."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not good.","review":"I found the art work in this book to be sub-standard and wish that I had seen it before purchasing.

Theoretically, I am all for the \\"Love and Accept the Body Nature Gives You\\" school of thought, and this book certainly portrays women (wimmin? wimmyn? womyn? Whatever!) who are not conventionally attractive. Me, I prefer secondary sexual characteristics in my wymmin. I like curves; bosoms and hips, graceful hands and feet, feminine faces.The womyen and ghoddesses in this coloring book are all rather lumpy and mannish, with big square hands and big galumphing feet, and I don't care for them at all.

Just smiling more, trying to make more conversation / get to know them, and do whatever I could think of for them.I also think this book could be applied to life in general. It's about all kinds of relationships, even if it's focused on business relationships. Exceeding people's expectations can enhance any kind of relationship, and there's also a wonderful lesson on conflict resolution in the book.I'm sure the book is especially helpful for those working in retail, and I will be looking for a similar book on the restaurant industry because I'm sure that profiling customers in a restaurant is different from profiling customers of a high-end clothing store.

Three calls later I am just sending it to them.Again and I reiterate, DO NOT BUY THIS CAMERA!"},{"rating":"2","title":"olympus 760","review":"Great point and shoot, but didn't realize it did not have a viewfinder.

I have had to pick it up, turn it over and readjust it twice (quite a process as it's very heavy) in less than two months because my housekeeper bumped it somewhat when she was dusting near it. Not what I expected at this price point. I figured it would be as sturdy as the one in my doctor's office (which is a different brand but same design). I would not purchase this brand of scale again."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great Scale for the Price","review":"Size, shape and functionality are all great. The lack of a set of wheels is mildly inconvenient, but I bought this one because it was the least expensive of the consumer style physician's scale. Repeats weights perfectly. The only flaw was a manufacturing one. The fasteners that hold part of the unit together thread into sheet metal, rather than a hex nut and it looks like it could strip out very easily. Other than that, I would recommend it to anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Heavy Duty Plus!!!!","review":"I received My Doctor scale today. I just can't believe I got a first quality doctors scale like this for this price. I thought I was going to get another little short version of a doctor's scale. That's what I was replacing. This one stands about five foot tall. This is three times more heavy duty then I was expecting.This went together in six screws. I expect this will last more than a lifetime.I would give this more then five stars if I could!My husband says he can describe this scale simpler. \\"Ya-hoo\\"!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"excellence all the way around","review":"This is the second review I submitted, but am glad to do it again.

Seems sturdy enough.BUT it's horribly Inaccurate. The one I received weighs light by almost 10 lbs per hundred out of the box. Verified margin using free weights and electronic scales and multiple tests. Very minor changes in weight placement shift the measured weight by several lbs. The position of your arms is enough to swing the measurement a few lbs. Move your arm forward a few inches and weight goes up move it back and it goes down.Completely useless to get any level of accuracy with.You can probably just guess your weight and get the same accuracy."},{"rating":"2","title":"the girl in the brown paper wrapper","review":"As a massive consumer of Crime Fiction, I am happy to say that this, my first foray into the writings of McDonald has proved most pleasurable.

This may be not a typical B. Dearie album, wich means, you will not find a Jazz Combo. Those who are jazz buffs should start by somewhere else. But for those who enjoy traditional vocal Pop, will find these recordings very rewarding. The arrangements are a little contained, but very well designed by the master Russ Garcia, who respected the \\"light\\" voice of the performer, giving a non-obstructive orchestral dressing, in other words, lots of vibraphone and woodwinds. It sounds very nice. Plus, aside of the overrercorded songs like \\" Guys and Dolls\\", you will find some other tunes that are almost rare like Porter's \\"The Physician\\" and Rodger's \\"Too Good For...\\" . And even if you say \\"not her best\\" due to the bright of other recordings of her, it deserves at least four stars for its contents."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Mixed Bouquet of Blossoms","review":"Blossom Dearie has a voice that you will either like of dislike--part ingenue and part little girl. This collection has some real gems in it--her rendition of Life Upon the Wicked Stage from Showboat is delightful. Unfortinately other songs struck me as dull and listless. It is that kind of voice--at times you are drawn to it and at other times you just wonder what you are doing listening."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad (as in \\"The Opposite of Good\\"","review":"For those who can read and have, therefore, read Lovecraft's short story \\"The Color Out of Space\\" (not a short novel as described in the ad) you will notice from the description that this is not a faithful adaptation. Instead (as with so many of these) it is taking a Lovecraft story, having it re-written by a much less talented and inventive writer, and then putting the resultant mess on film.If you admire H. P. Lovecraft's work, don't buy this. You'd be better off buying the Boris Karloff, Nick Adams version 1965's DIE, MONSTER, DIE which, at least, comes closer to capturing the brooding horror of Lovecraft's style than THIS."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pure entertainment!","review":"Graham Greene used to divide his novels into two categories, \\"serious\\"novels and \\"entertainments\\". The Lestrade novels of J M Trow are definitely in the \\"entertainment\\" category. This one is first in what is a very welcome reprinting of the Lestrade series. The plot is fantastic (as in 'unbelievable') and wanders all over the country, but that doesn't matter because it is richly comical, full of in-jokes that make you feel good when you recognise them, witty puns (and some vile ones too), and a host of historical characters both real and fictional. It is a joy to read.And later volumes in the series just get better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Atmospheric but Limited","review":"The idea of writing a series of books built around the not-so-bumbling Inspector Lestrade is somewhat clever, but MJ Trow never quite figures out how to built a mystery. There is almost no way we could ever guess the identity of the murderer as the book is full of red herrings. The atmosphere of Victorian England is recreated nicely but almost none of the characters come to life and ther are too many famous people romaing around to give the book any focus.There's just barely enough here to make me perhaps try another in the series on a lazy sumer day, but not for a while."},{"rating":"1","title":"Average Regardless of the Band's Talents.","review":"As a fan of Funk/R&B it is sad for me to write a less than positive review of an SOS album but I am forced to do so. \\"Too\\" is an average album made worse by the extremely preachy tone of a couple of tracks. Producing excellent music with controversial messages was the recipe for some of the greatest albums in music history. In contrast when those messages are transmitted with average music it makes them more inflamatory (Preachy) than thought provoking. One of the highlights of the album for me was \\"Do It Now\\" is little more than a remix of \\"Take Your Time\\" which is somewhat disappointing. I do not recommend purchasing this album unless you are a die hard SOS band fan."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I purchased this CD sight unseen/sound unheard. I previously purchased \\"winter blues\\" without having seen or heard it and found it to be very good. I thought \\"Harlem Nocturne\\" was another new CD by Edgar. It isn't. It is a collection of material recorded in the early 1960s while apparently performing in clubs. The sound quality is fine, both instrumentals and voice, what disappoints me is the songs. I own at least 7 of Edgar's releases (at least 6 CDs and 1 album) and none of the songs on this collection sounds like an Edgar Winter song to me. The only value I find in this release is as a historical document."},{"rating":"1","title":"Deceived","review":"I had gotten one other copyof this book in hard cover through Amazoin and expected that this copy would be the same quality.

A no holds barred look at women without being intimidated by the Book that holds their stories. And, is it not amusing, that the cover image of Rebecca looks almost exactly like Monica Lewinsky although the story that most resembles Monica's is actually Delilah's.

I bought this recording on LP when it was first released and was ecstatic when it was rereleased on CD. Together with George Benson, this recording highlights both players' unique stylings and talents. One of my favorite cuts next to the title track is Jimmy's rendition of Herb Alpert's \\"This Guy's In Love With You.\\" Soft and sultry, this instrumental version lets you fully appreciate Alpert's composition without the cheesy vocal track of the original version. Smith's exceptional technique on the Hammond B3 come to life on all tracks, and Benson's guitar work is unmatched. This is a MUST HAVE if you enjoy either of these phenomenal artists."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect for smaller decks","review":"All you need for smaller snowblower for deck use where longer cord is not necessary based on power draw and simply tangles you up"},{"rating":"2","title":"Couldn't find a hi-vis/low temp extension cord locally","review":"I bought my husband an electric Toro Snow Shovel for Christmas.

I'd heard a low temp extension cord would remain flexible in cold weather but I couldn't find one locally. Like I said, we live in \\"the sticks\\" and there's not much hardward store pickings in this area so I ordered it from Amazon at a very reasonable price.

When I read the book, I was happy to discover that it reads much like Scott's own personality. He is a regular guy, with simple needs, yet he has exceptional ambition. The stories in Rivers Changing let the reader follow along with Scott's adventures easily. He finds himself in several predicaments which adds some suspense and humor to the book. The book is suitable for any age (there is a smattering of swearing), and with luck, this fun story just may encourage the reader to take his or her own adventure."},{"rating":"1","title":"Only if you're bored","review":"This movie has some good things going for it. I like the concept of monsters you can see on camera but not with the naked eye and there was some good atmosphere. And Melissa Pursely looks good naked.

Dorff, who is a great actor though you'd never know it by the movies he's in, hasn't been in anything remotely good since the original Blade in 1998. Slater's career has gone downhill over the years, pretty much by taking part in some flop projects. Both actors sleepwalk through their roles in this latest video game to screen adaptation from director Uwe Boll, the same guy who brought us another video game adaptation, the incredibly bad House of the Dead. Alone in the Dark isn't much better, with a story so non-existant that you'll be scratching your head wondering what's going on before you pray for everyone to get killed. Tara Reid is also on board as the smart girl, and as previous reviewers mentioned, we know she's smart because she wears glasses. There isn't one redeeming factor about Alone in the Dark, and if you subjected yourself to the travesty of House of the Dead, then you know what to expect here."},{"rating":"1","title":"Incoherent plot with laughable dialogue.","review":"The acting in this movie stinks, laughably. Even Tara Reid can't save this film. What, Reid's a scientist because she puts on glasses? She looks more like a gym trainer. Is Christian Slater any smarter?The direction is almost as bad as some Ed Wood movies. The movie may have had a science fiction plot, but the film hardly explored any part of its plot. The film is not only bad, it's sometimes boring, only stimulated by the amusement to scriptlines horridly carried out and meaningless action. Mostly, this film incriminates its director.I give this movie two stars out of five. This film at least had some visuals.

This was a game first....Lions Gate = Baloney!","review":"Christian Slater, Stephen Dorff, and Tara Reid star in this mess of a film that starts off with an eye-chart explaining the parts of the movie that they did'nt have enough cash to film. I guess the young, male targets of this \\"film\\" were supposed to see Tara Reid in a skimpy outfit, go \\"ooooh..\\" and not laugh at her awful acting and the stupid script.Slater need a new agent, he is in yet another dog of a film - he is a fairly good actor who can do alot of the physical stuff required for this movie in a convincing manner.Halfway through all the explosions and carnage I started looking at my watch - \\"GAME OVER\\"! The saddest thing about this debacle is that this movie had alot of potential to be good.

This film definitely will challenge \\"Plan 9 From Outer Space\\" as the worst horror movie ever made. The biggest difference between the movie and video game is the reset button. I kept looking for one in the theatre. You'd expect second rate acting from Tara Reid but not Christian Slater or Stephen Dorff. The love scene, if you could call it one (I don't remember any love scenes in the game)has successfully set lovemaking back 1000 years.

It's so bad, I threw it away, after having spent 20 dollars on it. There's no one that I could give it to, and it's so bad, I didn't even want to donate it to the library. Save your money, don't even bother renting it. It's a shame, because the concept of the movie could have been amazing in the hands of a better director. As far as the acting, even the worst actors can be magic on the screen if the directors and producers know what they are doing, but if the production team stinks, even some of the best actors in Hollywood will seem off their mark. DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME OR MONEY ON THIS!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Gee, what an exciting movie!!....NOT!!","review":"This movie was extremely boring. I did not even get into watching it from the beginning. Did not get my attention. Throughout the movie kept popping in to see what was going on and needless to say it was still boring!

I can forgive a lot, but I do demand that the plot hold together in the most basic ways. And what happened at the end?? It made no sense at all.

I am at a loss to find a single good thing to say about this film. I have to admit I rented this because the cover actually looks interesting, and the storyline described on the blurb seemed like my kind of thing. Some name actors in it....so how bad could it be. Well I have to tell you, this might have been the worst movie I ever saw. I can sit through any movie once, but halfway through this one I started reading the TV Guide. The story makes no sense, the acting is horrible, and the direction is the worst I have ever seen. It is almost as if he were just putting in random shots with no sense of flow or style. One minute it is like the Matrix, then it is Alien, then it is something else. Don't even give this a try, it is unwatchable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Alone in the Dark rocked","review":"I was excited that this movie was finally realsed and as I was watching there were some good special FX in the movie and at times it was just like the video game. This movie is worth buying if your fans of any of the actors in it. And like me if you are a huge Daniel Cudmore fan (Colossus form X-men 2) this movie is worth seeing he has more lines and he is always with Stephan Dorff's chracter."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boy, was this awful!","review":"This is a bad movie. A very bad movie. There are no words in which I can express how horrible that movie is."},{"rating":"1","title":"WOW","review":"I recently watched The Cave. That was by far one of the worst movies I had ever seen. Until tonight. Tonight, I watched, or rather, suffered through Alone in the Dark. Seriously, mistakes were made in this movie that I have never seen in any movie before. The fact that an actress was supposed to be dead & sat up before they cut to the next scene was just hilarious. I actually had to rewind it & watch it 3 or 4 times to make sure I wasn't seeing things. But despite my disbeleif, that's how hilariously cheap this movie is. I watch old, low budget horror movies for comedic value. But I mean REALLY low budget, like Ankle Biters.......or Black Roses, but considering this movie has 3 name actors, and a fair bit of decent CGI work in it, I though I would at least be able to take it seriously.........I laughed in disbelief through the entire second half of this pathetic movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Crap with a capital c","review":"Please tell me this script wasn't written by an adult!

First there was monsters then there was zombies. Then the end was terrible I had no Idea what monsters were at the end of alone in stupid land.- The over use of Slow motion in the first 25 min. of the movie.- Terrible acting.(P.s: Christian Slater is terrible, and Terra Reid bad too.)- Terrible Plot. It was so confusing the whole time.- Terrible over all movie. Its a so called a so Action flick. Man I tell you what. Its so bad that its funny.If you love crappy action/horror/videogame/ Movies the buy it just for the laugh.- The Movie Guy"},{"rating":"2","title":"I don't get it...","review":"Okay, so I received this movie for free, and with little knowledge of its storyline or any other pre-existing hype. Perhaps had I paid to see it in a theater, with expectations that it be truly frightening, or something other than what it is, I may feel differently. Still, I really don't understand why it's received such low reviews from the majority. For its genre, I think its a decently entertaining production. Would I buy it? For $5.00 or less, yes. Will I watch it again, probably as I know others who will likely enjoy it. My advice? If you're a Sci-Fi/Horror fan, who counts the SyFy channel(formerly SciFi) among your favorites, then listen not to the reviews and try to watch it without expectations. You may be pleasantly surprised."},{"rating":"1","title":"A sad sad video game...er...movie...","review":"I think I remember playing the game for like maybe a day, got pretty bored with it. But this movie. This movie. It should have not tainted a game like this one did. The acting wasn't bad. The special effects weren't that bad. But the story, the story tried so hard to be like Resident Evil meets H. P. Lovecraft. While that would be interesting, this movie, wasn't. It was just sad. Boring. Nothing new. No true experience. I've seen this type of movie a thousand times. The movie was too busy, the director and storyteller was trying to throw at the audiance too much stuff, too many ideas, it wasn't confusing, it was just so busy that it was not focused at one movie point that moves to the next movie point, like clear crisp chapters...In the end, the movie was too busy and in the end, boring. If you wish to see it, wait til the unrated (we all know its going to come out this way) version."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another disaster.","review":"I cannot say enough how bad this movie is. The only reason it got one star was the Amazon doesn't have zero stars. his is just a bad movie. It's not even a good bad movie, nor is it fun to watch. The underlying premiss is interesting, in a six-grade sort of way, and from it one would expect an Indian Jones style, two-fisted adventure. Two worlds exist, one good, one evil. An ancient civilization once opened the gate between these two worlds before, and was wiped out. Now, the key has been shattered (why not destroyed? They never destroy these things!) and sent to the four corners of the earth. Now, take everything that's ever been neat, exciting, fun, and interesting from an Indiana Jones-style movie and flush it down the toile ta few times. Plunge it out, and slap it on some film with some inept acting and inaine pacing. Set that on fire and there you go, Alone in the Dark. What a waste."},{"rating":"1","title":"EDITING JOB","review":"You can tell the editors of this movie wanted out of this crap movie as fast as possible. There is a scene where the asian cop chick dies because of some monster thing bites her leg or her ass. One of the guys tells Stephan Dorff \\"come on she's gone\\" and you can actually see her get up, thinking the scene is over. HILARIOUS!!! They didn't even bother finishing the editing job. This movie will make Slater, Reid , and Dorff seriously consider sucking on the end of a gun barrel and pulling."},{"rating":"1","title":"crap","review":"Things blew up, there was blood and aliens or something...fortunately, Tara Reid remained scantily clad for the majority of this film...other than that I have no idea what the point of this movie was.

Do something more constructive with your money. Buy your girl something nice, take your mom out to lunch. Whatever you choose, i'm sure it will go towards something a little more worthwhile than this. 'Nuff said...Christ."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your time and your money ...","review":"QUICK THOUGHTSI've always thought that Christian Slater was a good actor who always got stuck in bad movies and this movie is no exception. He does the best he can with the script he was given, but still it is a movie based on a video game that should have stayed a video game. The acting is sub-par, the script unbelievable (which may explain the acting) and just not really an entertaining movie. So my recommendation is that you save your hard earned money (and an hour and a half of your life) for another movie.QUICK SYNOPSISEdward Carnby (Christian Slater) is a paranormal investigator and ex-member of a government run paranormal response team called 713. He has recently recovered an artifact that is the key to opening a door to dark and evil world. There are powers that be that would like to get a hold of this artifact and sends his monsters to retrieve it. Ed must find a way to stay alive and keep the creatures from behind the door from coming into our world."},{"rating":"1","title":"LEAVE ME ALONE AND AS FAR AWAY FROM THIS MOVIE AS POSSIBLE","review":"For some strange reason I thought Uwe Boll had directed some decent stuff. After looking him up I saw he had directed \\"House Of The Dead\\" Which was almost as unwatchable as this train wreck of a movie. First of all, Tara Reid is as annoying as usual in her role as archaeologist Aline Cedrac. Perhaps if she took off her top it would have made the movie a bit more watchable. Chrisitian Slater is an excellent actor. He does a fine job here as well. How he got sucked in to this role must have been the result of losing a bet.. The special effects were decent (nothing really new). It has a very noisy speed metal sountrack which really grates on you after a while. This movie is a complete waste of time. Go sit in a dark closet during a thunderstorm. It will work much better for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Urghh.. awful","review":"1.5 starsI only picked up this DVD because I like Slater. But man, disaster is too mild a word for this movie. Acting [except Slater] is bad. Script is bad. Plot is average to bad. Editing is bad. Special effects are nothing to speak about.And I thought I had a pretty high tolerance level for cheap actions. Urghh..Don't buy it. You can rent it and put in on while you are cleaning the house or something.. just to be able to say how awful it is."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst movie ever","review":"I've bought this movie for mistake, on Italian edition there isn't Boll's name anywhere on the cover. if I remembered it was his I'd have left it on the shelf. Now I own it and so at least I watched it. I know wiser and funnier things to do to spend an evening, like play who's strongest between my head and a concrete wall, or bungieless jumping, or playing russain roulette with an automatic gun... Amazon should give also NEGATIVE numbers of stars for the rating just for things like this.Usually movies taken from comics or videogames are appreciated largely by fans of the original, here I fell Alone in the Dark fans are on the front line against this rape of a good franchise."},{"rating":"1","title":"DO NOT LOOK UPON THE FACE OF CHAOS UNSPEAKABLE HORROR...","review":"I feel the darkness closing in upon me. I don't know what crossed the threshold, but I know one thing: Uwe Boll is a hack. I feel that my life essence, my IQ was sapped by this movie. Something was taken away from me which I shall never get back. How can the powers of Hollywood allow this blasphemy to continue? How can one man, the sub-mundane and putrid lack of talent named UWE relentlessly assault our senses? I implore you to not subject yourself and your loved ones to this unspeakable wretch of a movie. DO NOT LOOK INTO THIS DARKNESS AND HOPE TO FEEL WHOLE IN THE MORNING! YOG SOGGATH, WE PRAY TO THE END OF DAYS! CTHULU is a brighter spark upon humanity than this fowl tripe of a movie.

After the recent spate of bad horror films (Like WHITE NOISE, DARKNESS), I didn't have high hopes for this Uwe Boll mess, so I was mildly entertained by the movie's complex if indecipherable plot, the really bad acting from Christian Slater, Tara Reid and Stephen Dorff, and the typically adequate CGI effects. The movie doesn't really make a whole lot of sense and it's apocalyptic ending is a downer to say the least. But with my expectations low and my Frito Scoops in hand, I found myself remembering those mindless fifties horror movies and I wasn't too upset when it was over."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible","review":"While RESIDENT EVIL and TOMB RAIDER were pretty good successes at bringing the video game to the big screen...... HOUSE OF THE DEAD and now ALONE IN THE DARK are failures.......... however... this film ALONE IN THE DARK is he worst failure as it has ZERO redemming features and must be an attempt to bring some new version of the ALONE IN THE DARK game to the movie screen because the ALONE IN THE DARK game I played on my PC years ago (ten years maybe ?) had no resemblance to this plot line.This movie adaption of ALONE IN THE DARK seemed like a mish-mash of Alien, Matrix, Invasion of Body Snatchers, Starship Troopers, a bad Zombie movie and Predator all attempted to be stirred into the same pot to magically come out a masterpiece.Instead it's a terrible mess of a movie.Seriously.... DO NOT spend 2 hours of your life on this movie..... do something else instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Garbage!","review":"In just 3 months, Uwe Boll's mega-turkey makes it to video. Be prepared for bad acting, bad CGI, bad dialogue, bad editing and just plain smelliness. Boll is a blight to the cinema and video game industries respectively.

It wasn't the story or the acting. I think it was my deep desire to see Christian Slater and/or Tara Ried get ripped apart by the creatures. In addition the a washed up slater and the always brilliant Tara Reid (joking) there was a special laughable appearence by Stephen Dorff. The overacting was abundant and everything else was severely lacking. The only positive about this film was the creatures themselves.

If you want to be smart, wear glasses and carry a clipboard. Tara Reid did that in the movie and apparently props like that can replace acting ability. Christian Slater....well lets just say that \\"Heathers\\" was 15 years ago and his schtik is more worn out than the wasteband from Kirstie Alleys Pantyhose.

I would ignore the 5 star comments on this page. I based my interest off those comments to go see the movie. They had to of been made up comments or people with bad taste in movies.

He has no sense of direction, hell, he can't even properly adapt a video game, take House of The Dead for example. He also is adapting more video games, which I think is stupid, and damaging to the Video Game industry. Hell, He probably won't stop churning out crap. Christian Slater, what the hell happend?

The ending music by Nightwish, \\"I Wish I Had An Angel.\\" Fun over-the-top Goth musicNow for the bad.

If you check the background to many, this is the only review on their record. Meaning, they were probably invented just to give this movie a ratings boost because the studio or someone probably realized that EVERYONE gave this film an average of about 1 1/2.

I saw this concert when it was originally broadcast on PBS and the DVD is so much better, especially if you have surround sound. The bonus JT videos reminded me of why they are never seen om MTV or VH1!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This is what DVD and Dolby Digital was created for!","review":"This is a no brainer ... a must have for anyone who even casually likes JT. The clarity and digital sound add enormously to the listening and viewing pleasure that you will receive. After watching this DVD you will be playing all of your old JT tracks again!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"very good, great music..like the acoustic guitar work","review":"It was our first DVD ...it may be the best...I dont think it gets any better than this DVD..James Taylor is fantastic..."},{"rating":"2","title":"My First DVD Purchase, a brilliant choice!","review":"This is the first DVD I've bought. The sound and picture quality is so clear. As for the content one word...Brilliant."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Video","review":"This video is exactly what I wanted to hear from James Taylor. There is really no performance I can say was bad. I would recommend this to anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"a MUST HAVE for any JT fan!","review":"This is a fabulous concert! It's like having JT in your home! The songs are a wonderful mix of old and new...What a delight JT is! It's such a pleasure watching him do what he loves and is so good at... I could watch this everyday! Do yourself a favor and treat yourself to JT at the Beacon!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money","review":"The sound was horrible very hard to listen to. Kept trying to adjust my equipment but it did nothing. Does James Taylor no justice."},{"rating":"1","title":"i got bored...","review":"Man, is this guy boring!I bought this dvd for all the great reviews, but was very disappointed. My mind dwelled off after two songs, and at number four I was doing something else. Sorry folks!"},{"rating":"2","title":"JTat his best","review":"I found this DVD to be a wonderfully nostalgic and technically competent listening experience.JT gives his normal bashful and understated performance with a few interesting, if not challenging, titbits as in Belfast to Boston, a haunting overview of the carnage of religious intolerance and its inevitable consequences.Although a 'must buy' for JTphiles I tend to agree with a previous critic who comments on the lack of direct,close-up shots of JT and particularly his playing action. Those of us who play the guitar would dearly love to see more of his finger action and chord selection. But hey!this still remains a great DVD which I for one will listen to time and again,and again,and again,and again........"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent to the max","review":"As a Taylorphile I have to say that this DVD is absolutely beautiful, no wonderful, no it's beyond wonderful. The delivery was quicker than was stated. Best money I have spent in years. If it was just a CD it would be worth it. With the video it's fantastic. And no I am not James's mother."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Great music DVD - a must for all music DVD collections","review":"A single word - fabulous! James Taylor is one of favorite singer/songwriters who greatly influenced my early musical upbringing...this DVD is such a priceless gem that warms your heart with its tremendous sound, even though it wasn't in DTS, and the awesome display of lights and colors, even though it wasn't widescreen...this DVD is a definite must buy for all music fans whether or not you are a Taylor fan...JT's voice is such a once-in-a-lifetime piece of Americana that we are all lucky that our generation has witnessed such magical performances. This is one DVD that everyone can watch, young and old alike...his music is a celebration of emotions and the worthy musicians backing him were equally impressive...the sound and the video are all first rate..."},{"rating":"2","title":"There are a lot of songs that the tape cut.","review":"JT is my all-time favorite singer. He knows how to make music, even though he's not a big rock person. He's still good. Not bad for a 51-year-old, (no offense) he turned 51 on March 12. That's not important, though the thought had occured to me. His next album should be released sometime soon this year, but I don't know when."},{"rating":"1","title":"wake me up when it is over...","review":"If someone had put this together as a mixed tape, it would have got one listen and then wound up on the floor of my car. What separates a great compilation from a snooze-fest is song placement. A great compilation takes you on a ride - it builds and blends and makes you want to hear more. This does none of that - the songs jerk back and forth with no continuity or vision and it is annoying. I sold this after trying to listen to both disks a few times with no luck. I know there were individual gems, but the CDs overall were too much dreck to wade through."},{"rating":"2","title":"They used to call it Rock-a-billy","review":"This two CD set is precious ! This is the raw stuff that alternative-country-rock-blues-small bar bands are made of.If you love good stuff...country with plenty of guts and blood and beer, pedal steel twang, good hard driving bass lines, then buy this NOW. Excellent mixes back and forth between slow and fast. Altogether, very well put together."},{"rating":"1","title":"4 should be more","review":"There are only four actual songs on this release. Unless you must have all of the out-takes (why?), skip it--because that's what you'll be doing every time you play it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Must Read for Any Property Owner","review":"This concise and thoroughly documented book, based on decades of experience, contains a wealth of valuable information and practical strategies to avoid environmental litigation in an increasingly litigous world. Written with remarkable clarity, numerous illustrative examples, more than a touch of perspective, and even well-aimed humor, this book is completely accessible to the non-specialist property owner. Takes you by the hand and leads you step-by-step through every aspect you need to know. The Index and Appendices alone are worth the price of admission. The best introductory book of its kind on the market."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor support","review":"Very disappointed in this purchase. The bra has no spport base at all. It is Longlined so helps bring in the waist."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it!","review":"I really love this product! It's comfortable, light, and airy. At first when I tried it on I was worried it might be uncomfortable, but once I had everything all situated, it wasn't as bad as I thought. Now I can wear tight fitting tops without feeling self conscious about my muffin top. It's even comfy after long-term use. It even helps support the back and forces you to sit up straighter which is great given I have pretty bad posture. I would totally recommend this product to anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brings in the waist, but that's about all.","review":"This bra is fantastic for wearing under vintage clothing, when you're going for that bullet bra look. It brings in the waist and provides that lovely rib-cage shaping so vital for 50s \\"new look\\" dresses. However, it offers very little in the way of cup support and nothing in the way of the kind of cup molding that is common with modern brassieres. This means that the wear one can get from this undergarment is very limited, particularly for small-busted ladies."},{"rating":"2","title":"The ABC Herbal - great book!","review":"After my 7 month old caught his 3rd cold, I opened The ABC Herbal to see what I could find to help my little guy stay well. I read it in one sitting and couldn't believe I hadn't taken the time to read it before then. It is a wonderful book that gives you some basic information about how herbs work, then gives you remedies and sources for herbs suitable for children. Although the book is geared for treatment of children, the concepts are universal and can be applied to adults, as well. This book is an excellent resource, and I would recommend it to anyone looking for alternative ways to get well and stay healthy (children and adults!)"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Must Have for any Parent","review":"This is a must have for any parent interested in taking charge of their children's health. I am a mother of a 2 year old and have used this since before my son was born. Mr. Horne carefully explains how to prevent as well as treat current illnesses. He has scientific knowledge to backup what he says, but does not way the text down with medical jargon. He is an excellent teacher and practices what he preaches. This is an excellent book to start out on if you are unfamiliar with the natural health field or if you are an expert. JUST GET IT, you will love it! He makes so much common sense that you will wonder why you didn't think of some of the stuff yourself. I refer to his books constantly and wouldn't travel or be without this one!"},{"rating":"2","title":"outstanding","review":"One of my best finds of 2007. I first saw these guys on Austin City Limits, and was immediately hooked by their music and their charm (not a common commodity in today's music scene). This release is an outstanding value, with 3 CD's and a DVD. The sound quality is excellent for a live recording. As should be expected from Cafe Tacuba, the music is eclectic, ranging from punk to Mexican folk, to riffs borrowed from Stevie Wonder and James Brown, and featuring selections from all their CD's, as well as some non-LP tracks, including (the essential) Dejate Caer. And the DVD documents their infectious enthusiasm, the obvious delight they take in playing, and the adoration of their fans. Try them: you too will be won over."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good deal","review":"This cd was a great one. If you've ever seen Cafe Tacvba perform live you know how it is....the band...the people...the music. This cd brings out that vibe. Plus, its a great deal. You get three cds and one dvd for one low price."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow.","review":"So, I saw these amazing guys at the Gibson Amphitheatre on July 3rd (although at the time I had only known one song of theirs and was really there for Kinky), as soon as the show started for them, I decided to stay, I mean- why would I be a punk and leave? There must have been a reason why the thousands of fans showed up, paid the price, and showed energy. That's exactly what you get in the audio/dvd. You get the energy, (not as much in the DVD since the cinematographic qualities are not what one would expect from this amazing band), but get over it. They have purposely made it easy for you to be a part of something that was really special to them, their 15th anniversary. If you complain, then you're just a whiny person who just doesn't get that they did this FOR YOU. SO YOU COULD ENJOY IT with yourself or others. The selection of songs is impeccable and I hope they come back to LA very very soon.ORALE THIS IS THE BEST THING EVER."},{"rating":"1","title":"DO NOT BUY THIS ITEM!!!!","review":"This lunch box is VERY small and poorly made.

The result is the implicit use of Verilog states which in effect results in unmanagable Verilog spaghetti code. Having a background in both hardware design and software consulting the Verilog code in the book is terrible. It can be compared to a jumble of assembly language without any comments of structure - sure, if you know the background of the design (i.e. the ASM charts) you might see why the code might work but the Verilog code by itself is not readable!If you do some research you'll quickly see that ASM charts are not widely used these days. Most engineers in the industry are using well defined moore state machines because they are easy to understand and maps very well to case statements in Verilog.I will now skim through the rest of the book to see if there might be some content NOT related to ASM charts that might be worth picking up..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Review for Experienced Administrators","review":"Focused on the topics you need to know. I easily passed both exams using only this book as a study guide. If you know what you're doing, this is a excellent guide to organize and review the details.

I am a college teacher. I have been using this book as my primary textbook for a Solaris course. Keep in mind that the course do not specifically prepare for SCSA exams. It is just a solaris course.My feeling is that the book is acceptable as an introductory book on solaris.From the feedback of my students, if you have a lot of hands-on experience you might pass part I exam by using this book.

I have over six years of work experience with Unix (4 years of Solaris). I carefully studied everything from Chapter 1 to Chapter 12. Unfortunately, I failed the Part One Exam badly. So, I know it from the first hand experience that Chapters 1 to 12 are useless for Part One Exam.Maybe, just maybe, the rest of the chapters are useful for Part Two Exam.

When I got it in the mail, I could not put it down. I finished reading it one night! It takes you through the humble beginnings of Philomena and Philip Lynott. My God it was quite a challenge for both of them. Thank God Philomena and Philip had an amazing family who got them through the difficult times. I was amazed at how determined Phil was at achieving his goal at making Thin Lizzy a success. He inspired me to follow my dream of being an actress. Eventhough Phil was so talented he was also human and fell prey to drugs. I appreciated this book's honesty in dealing with the problems he had.I will always be his bigest fan in Chicago!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Value","review":"Similar wires sell for much more at local hardware stores, so for $40 this is a great value.

The 100' Extension Cord is rated at 13amps and the blower is rated at 15amps, so the cord may or may not handle the load of this blower.

It is like a mauve version of orange, a creamy, unremarkable shade. In other respects these 19-ounce bowls are great average portion-sized for soups and stews and hot and cold cereals. All the bowls I ordered from Amazon were packed extremely well, and on all but one the color glazing was perfect and extended all around to the base (a scarlet bowl was missing a small fingernail-size bit on one part near the base.

The kit is still a value for what it contains, and the one thing that it does contain that you must have is the class \\"text\\". When considering if you wish to purchase the kit from your local craft store or from Amazon keep in mind that many of these reviews are VERY dated and the prices that they reference at the local craft stores are long since gone. The frequently mentioned price of $19.99 is gone! The kit is $34.95 at all the local Michael's stores in the St. Louis area. Even if you use a 40% off coupon it will bring it down to about $21 dollars.

The first muffler purchased through Auto Zone store had unbelievable inferior and incomplete welding between the exhaust pipes and the muffler body and therefore had to be returned. The second Walker muffler purchased through Amazon.com had a good welding job, but disgustingly did not fit at all and had to be substantially modified before it could be installed into the vehicle. The quality control at Walker leaves a lot to be desired ."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent information for the investigator","review":"This book was well written, and detatiled.

The Constitution was NOT based on biblical thinking and theology, but is secular. The principle of \\"Freedom of Religion\\" should explain this.The fact that Glenn Beck picked this title to promote his line of thought should be enough to wake people up.There are Constitution commentaries that are much more accurate and realistic. Recall that most of our founders were slave owners: a system over which a war was fought, and at which time some of the constitution was changed.In fact, The United States changes after the economic institution of slavery was abolished. The thoughts, therefore, of slave owners have to be questioned.

If you want to see, in the Founders own words what THEY said they meant when they wrote the Constitution, then this is the book you need.

Ever since the breakup of one of Christian music's premier alternative rock/emo bands, fans have followed the member's careers closely, hoping for a reunion album. While that hasn't happened yet, Aaron Sprinkle (former lead guitarist for the aforementioned band) has at least found a great way to pass the time. From beginning to end, this album is an incredible musical journey, and Aaron Srinkle is just the one to tell it, his sensitive and mature voice gliding throughout the tracks like a fifth instrument. Melding elements of jazz, rock, and a little blues at time, this album is the perfect one for a lazy day. My favorite highlights are the beautiful acoustic guitar of Genevieve, and the title track, The Kindest Days.

I live in Florida so I wanted to read this author who writes about a pet sitter on Siesta Key. I read two of her books and found them both the same; a pet sitter who somehow finds dead people at the homes she visits. And to make it worse, the pet sitter ends up in the center of the investigation.

Onward Dixie Hemingway!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Mystery & cats are a great combination","review":"Comparative behavior of cats and dogs is an added bonus to this Florida-based mystery. Although I figured out the killer early, I was tempted to change my mind with many of the red herrings. The pet sitter has odd hours, use of a dog's sense of smell, and access to empty homes which are plausible reasons to discover a crime scene and clues. Her characters are flawed and sympathetic for the most part. I look forward to the next Dixie Hemingway mystery."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good first book mystery","review":"This is the first book in a new mystery series by Blaize Clement.

I made it halfway through the book before I decided I could take no more. I can only think that the author had a horrible experience with her own mother and family and friends to write women so vilely. If not, then she is simply taking cheap shots. Either way is sad.I won't be buying and/or reading any more of her works again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Confusing","review":"I abandoned this book (and author) with no regrets.Reason #1: Apparently the main character has some sort of big bad in her background that caused her to leave the police force and become a pet-sitter. There were hints and occasional surface explanations, but nothing that explained much. If this is to be a defining aspect of why the main character is who she is, then explain it - don't make me extrapolate.Reason #2: Weird writing style. Do I really care about cat anuses (mentioned more than once) or that the 'blessed air conditioning' made someone's nipples hard? Do I care that a medical professional had hairy knuckles and so by extension probably had a hairy back? What does this have to do with the price of eggs in Cincinnati?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing tripe","review":"Sorry, but I can't find anything particularly redeeming about this book.

This books reads well, it's an actual novel, it just has plenty of sex in it. Which is good. Most of it rings very true, and not like a silly fantasy. The writer is saying something here: about relationships between men and women, about loneliness, and about lust. The style is also spare and precise, kind of like Raymond Carver (in a way).Would I recommend this book to my friends? Yes I would."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just another smut offering","review":"Sorry, but I don't see any real merit to this book.

It can easily handle being used by an electric mower. However, the cord wrap memory is a pain in the *ss.

Same goes when you have to wrap it up, it tangles in on itself."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tough, durable, plug shape only problem.","review":"This cord is excellent, tough, durable, and priced well.

The equipment seems to fit better to a round shape. The plug fits put it takes some adjusting to plug it in."},{"rating":"2","title":"High quality extension","review":"This is a high quality indoor/outdoor extension cord. Note that this cord is 12 gauge/3 conductor wire which allows use of things like a power blower(my use) at greater distances from the outlet.You can get by with thinner wire like 14/3 if you are using lower power devices or devices with out motors or heaters. I would recommend checking with the manufacturer of the equipment you want to use if you are unsure about the power requirements of your device.The trade off is that this cord is heavy and a little harder to handle particularly if it is cold.

It actually is worse than my old and much lighter 100' cord. I am not sure of the size but it weighs substantially less than the Coleman - it is 20+ years old. I wanted to use this for my air compressor. While the smaller wire will run it the Coleman will not - so I spent more money for the larger wire and the extra weight to haul around and it will not do the job. Bummer. I should return it but after paying the freight and all the hassle it is not worth it. Probably will not be buying Coleman products for a while."},{"rating":"2","title":"15 amps out to100 feet - plus a great price","review":"This is a heavy cord and is rated for outside. I am using it to connect my RV to my house current. It performs perfectly. I like the feature that lights up a little LED at the female end to let you know you have power to the plug. The rating is 15 A, 125 V, and 1875 W. For 12 guage, that is about as good as it gets. It is water resistent as an outdoor cord must be. An added plus, Amazon is a lot less expensive than the local big box store for the exact same cord.

The \\"prophecy\\" is simply a fictional device that threads together various generations of characters through the various novelletes of the book.Which brings me to what I dislike about the book, it is a collection of shorter stories, with a new cast of characters in each. We become engaged with the characters, only to be with them a short while before their scenes end and we move to another century. And there are few happy endings for most of the characters, some of whom simply have their short hour upon the stage before slipping into the past tense of the next character's genealogy.However, the book is a fast-paced read and I enjoy the tour through history. I will follow the series with interest."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why \\"An Alternative History?\\"","review":"I have finally finished the Emperor, book 1. I really do not understand why this is called an \\"alternative\\" history book.It seems that it follows history as we know it, except for the women who produces the first and then second prophecy.It was a wonderful insight to Roman Britain, some interesting characters that are not totally developed, but that was all.I was anxious to see if the second book would actually take us to a different history, but on reading the reviews, it seems not.Now, I will not continue with the series. It just wasn't what I wanted or expected."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing like his previous work.","review":"If you're a fan of Stephen Baxter's earlier work I don't recommend this one. Science fiction writer turned to alternate history rarely works well, this is no exception.I bought this just because it was the only book of his I didn't have at the time. I've had it for months and unfortunately just cannot finish it, It bores me too much. I have given up on it a few times but I keep trying again because I loved his other books so much. Sorry Mr Baxter, this book is most disappointing. I'll give this whole series a miss and wait for the next one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Alternate History","review":"I'm rather disappointed in this book. I do not see how this is an alternate history story, there's no change in history, other than the prophecy. To be a successful alternate history, we need to see how the history diverges, either through the eyes of someone that knows the original history, or by actually doing what is set forth in the prophecy. Something that didn't happen in this book. Huge passages are nothing but exposition. I kept waiting for an epiphany that never happened. This is not alternate history, and hardly science fiction. If it belongs anywhere, it's the historical fiction section. The description of life between 4 BC and 337 AD is quite good, but with the tons of exposition, if this wasn't submitted by a \\"successful\\" author, I doubt it would have made it past the first reader."},{"rating":"1","title":"More rubbish from this formerly promising novelist","review":"I have completely turned 180 degrees from being a fan of Baxtor to absolutely loathing the garbage he's been writing in recent years. He had a good run early on, but has totally lost touch with his base. I loved Ring, The Time Ships, Flux, all the way up to Vacuum Diagrams, which seems to have been a turning point in his career--for the worst. This novel, like all of his recent work, suffers from very weak character development, a highly suspect plot, way too many personal motivations injected into the story, questionable and outdated physics (such as his refusal to give up the preposterous multiverse theory, which Hawking refutes), and his obsession with explicit sexual scenes (a sure sign of a writer's demise).

This really is an essential for any true TLC fan, TLC were simply one of the biggest groups of the 90's. Their albums, especially CrazySexyCool set modern standards for the music industry and paved the way for Destiny's Child.

It is a 50 foot, 10/3 cable with a standard 115vac plug on one end and tri-source on the other. There is an an LED power indicator light on the trisource plug end. I needed a lower resistance 10/3 cable (as compared to 12/3 or 16/3)to power a 115 volt mig welder as recommended by the equipment manufacturer. I wanted a cable that provided a standard 15 amp plug instead of the 20 amp version of plug that most 10/3 cables are fitted with.

I was totally unprepared to find that the cologne I received was bad--as in rancid, past its prime, and not useable. I contacted Amazon and learned too late that by policy, frangrances are not returnable. Amazon kindly offered to give me a $10 credit, but I am still out money. It is a no-win situation for me and for Amazon (they didn't really cause the problem). In the future, I will be very aware of return policies and leary of buying fragrance online.

Beefheart fans are serious, and I have no issue with recordings/performances that are not top notch being released, but I do have an issue with record labels (this time Morpheus) releasing an expensive ($35) double CD that could fit on one CD with about four minutes to spare. I feel I have been had. Some of the previous releases from this label have been quite good (one even boasted \\"over 72 minutes playing time -- almost a double record\\"), but this is clearly a case of a label knowing that fans can, and will be soaked. To top it off, something as monumental as his last concert should have extensive liner notes, but they are virtually non-existent. Get it together Morpheus!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the glass used to master it","review":"The fact of the matter is that this is a bootleg and a poorly mastered one at that. Ozit has mastered this all from inferior mp3s sourced from high gen tapes that have been circulating among Beefheart collectors for years.The show itself is a great show and although a lower gen mastering in HD isn't going to necessarily improve the fidelity of this audience recording. I still can't recommend this to anyone but completists who wish to collect every single release.This is definitely not a good place to start if you are looking to check out the music of Captain Beefheart.

This book is so simple and basic that it really doesnt cover anything except that you couldnt find on the internet with a few keystrokes. I was very disappointed in the writer and her views on how to home educate. Her views actually give amunition to those against homeschooling. Her views on homeschooling are more for keeping your children at home to teach them values rather than to concentrate on educating them.

Jim Stewart was a good soldier, a good cop, a good friend, and a good writer but he is most importantly a great family man who made some tough choices in his life that he will second guess, I imagine, for his lifetime.

Here is your book. It's a story about a man's love of country, fellow soldiers and a Vietnamese girl and of tragedy. As a Viet Nam vet I can relate to this book as I'm sure many other vets can.

I like these, and have a very hard time finding them locally, but I am not willing to pay over $6 for a can of tuna. I can't imagine anyone being willing to pay so much.I do love this size of the Bumblebee tuna medleys. It's easy to use this size can as a base for a small meal, or as the base for a snack, with cheese and crackers, or a piece of fruit.

I relished every minute of this CD. Since I first heard it, I've probably listened to it well over twenty five times.The only way to describe the experience is metaphor. It's like the feeling you get five minutes into an amazing movie. You know you are in for something special, something you've never seen before. The mix of spirituality and modernism is perfect. It leaves you feeling haunted. Perhaps the lyrics are given added meaning by the fact that they are mostly in Hindi, and indecipherable to this listener.

First of all this isn't even close to being heavier than Meshuggah, Extol doesn't have a comparable guitar tone to Meshuggah (see Chaosphere for an example of sheer heaviness). I don't think the reviewer who wrote what you see above has ever heard Theory In Practice if he doesn't think they're heavier or more technical.

You should get it."},{"rating":"2","title":"quality technical extreme metal","review":"Extol is a progressive death metal outfit from Norway. Their latest offering, \\"Undeceived,\\" shows a marked improvement from their debut \\"Burial,\\" which suffered from poor production. The music is highly technical metal with a melodic edge, with some of the off-beat stop-and-start riffing characteristic of Opeth's last two albums. It is not as chaotic as the music of bands like Theory in Practice and Cryptopsy, and even features strings and doom sections a la My Dying Bride. The vocals are rather harsh; they sound electronically modified at times. There are also clean vocals, performed by one of the guitarists, which are very self-confident and well-done. The diversity of this album, which should be evident from my description, sometimes gets in the way of comprehending the whole, but it also provides food for thought for many listens. No technical death metal fan should be disappointed with this release."},{"rating":"2","title":"Where do they stop?","review":"Extol have outdone themselves once again. Undecieved surpasses all previous work. This album mixes so many genres of music into a metal orchestration it's almost impossible to describe. Very progressive, very black, very death, very good. The production is excellent. Nothing was overlooked in the studio. The lyrics, as always reflect their strong ties to Christianity and are very positive, regardless of your religious affiliation or lack there of. Ole Borud really shines in this album by composing most of the music and writing the majority of the lyrics. Fans of his early work with Shaliach will eat this up. Brutal and beautiful. Undeceived fits nicely into any metal fan's collection.El Kabong gives it five head-bangs!"},{"rating":"2","title":"THE BEST...","review":"This is the best christian extreme metal cd ever.

Whenever you hear these boys from i think Sweden jam it is so awesome. I bought their CD for the song Ember but found most of their songs thrilling. I heard a rumor that some of the guitarists studied music at a classical school of music. Well anyways they sound musical instead of just vociferous random screaming this sounds great. I would recommend this to anyone over the age of 15 and under the age of 33 because it is really good!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing","review":"This is a very heavy album. Fast and techinical, strings are even used in a few songs to keep the melodies intact. Although extremely heavy, the songs are still beautiful, and are distinctly different from the previous songs. Ole sings with clean vocals for part of a few songs, while Christopher screams with such passion and intensity. The drumming is amazing, guitar work is amazing, every thins is amazing. This is one of my five favorite albums ever."},{"rating":"2","title":"Could've used a better middle section.","review":"Although this album is definately worth the buy, I felt myself drifting away from the album after Time Stands Still.

However, I have only listened to this CD once, and will listen again and may get a better listen. However, for the first time around, I only really enjoyed those 4 songs. But still, overall, this CD was great death/gothic Christian music if you've been having trouble finding some. \\"Undeceived\\" literally scared me when the lead singer's voice kicked in.

Because of the shape of the spout, it's pretty much impossible to get any leverage to push them back together.

The novel combines elements of flashbacks, and suspense to create a good novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Book Vixon's Ever Written","review":"I have to say, this is one of the worst books Joan Lowery Nixon has ever written. Ever. It focused far into the change in personal relationships which yes, would be important but no, are not the makings for any kind of thriller. The entire book was sadly predictable and the most boring read I've had in years.The ending was horribly rushed. I know at least five people under 14 who could've easily written this book and made it more interesting.I've repeatedly heard it called a page-turner, but the only reason I kept turning pages was because I hoped the next chapter might actually hook me, like many of Nixon's other books.I'm sure that for most, it would have been an excelent read, but I was hoping for something with suspence when I picked this book up off of the shelves."},{"rating":"2","title":"Review of The Other Side of Dark","review":"In this book, The main character, Stacy, wakes up after being in a coma for four years.

Stacey is an easy character to understand and you sympathize with her as she remembers more bits and pieces of her mother's murder. She is simple and likeable.

He validates his beliefs with case studies and testimonials from experts in their respected areas. Kling begins each chapter with a very thorough overview of the section.Don't let the size of the book intimidate you; the material is well prepared and easy to read. My advice is to pick and choose chapters and sections within those topics that are of interest to you. Keep in mind that a lot of the material in the book is \\"out dated\\", which caused me some cognitive frustration. The book was written in 1996 and I surmise from the preface that it was conceived in the early '90's. Topic titles are revenant to Computerization and Controversy but the case studies are only useful as a historical prospective.JCalhoun"},{"rating":"2","title":"Computerization and Controversy","review":"With the dawn of the Information Age waning and social, economic and political changes underway, Robert Kling's anthology adds form and character to the futurist, anthropological debate of what will happen to us now.In an impressive and hefty volume, Kling et.al. questions the ramifications of eight areas of human interaction; areas as varied as privacy, social control, human relationships, work, and human interaction. In this examination, Kling provides a depth of discussion that will overwhelm the technology neophyte. For those in the industry or for the more advanced casual user, this volume will fill in holes of knowledge that guarantee to stimulate deeper appreciation for the changes underway in our society."},{"rating":"2","title":"womanly art of breastfeeding","review":"This book is back to basics info on breast feeding.

I bought it because my sound card blew out. The only thing I didn't like about the product itself is that you cannot use a 1/8 splitter. I have 2 sets of speakers that I had plugged in with my regular sound card using a Radioshack 1/8 splitter. When you plug the splitter into the device, only one set of speakers will work. Other than that, the product is great and a real life saver if your sound card blows.The main issue I have with the company is that I bought the product and a few days later there was a $2 price drop. I emailed the company and asked for the difference and I never got a response. By law in the state of Michigan, if you buy something within 30 days and the price drops, you have the right to receive the lower price.

The first one i received was really annoying. Any slight touch would make it turn off and then back on. Luckily, this one has not been giving me any problems.

The nail in the coffin was the freeze that occured every time I quit the game. I had to shut the computer off manually each time I played the game.

For any booklover, that aspect alone is worth the price of admission for this one. Hornby then continues with a wonderful essay discussing what he's read, veering off on tangents that are somehow more than tangential.

Fortunately, as always, Nick Hornby manages to make his intelligent writing seem casual, simple even, and not once will you feel confused or horrifyingly under-read, which is quite a feat. The beauty behind the book is that Hornby makes fun of his white robe-wearing employers and his expected audience constantly, even in the title of the collection. As for the reviews themselves, they are more like well-written and hilarious of his literary trials and tribulations than mundane pros and cons found in so many other reviewers' styles.

There are some really cool tracks, like the first one, but it seems like this cd slips into a \\"deiselboyesque\\" style for the majority. Maybe DB is trying to win back the \\"hardcore d'n'b fans\\" with this album, which is chock full of super hype d'n'b (which isn't quite my fav) that's kind of repetitive. This is QUITE a departure from the \\"ambient jungle\\" and even the harder tracks that I loved in Shades of Technology. To be honest I'm really starting to like these more hype tracks.

If you want to run around and kill things, this is not the game for you. Deus Ex is game that requires planning, stealth and patience. Combat is often brief and deadly, unless you have positioned yourself to surprise your opponents.The sound and graphics are very good, but many areas are dark. The Biomods which give you certain advantages in the game end up being of little use due to their high energy drain and a lack of energy cells (plus, unlike clips in the guns, the energy cells do not automatically load when they run out).My biggest complaint has to be the combat. I don't mind combat being dangerous, but if they are going to make it that way, it should be true for both sides. When I sneek up behind a guard and pop him in the back of the head, that should be it. He shouldn't be spinning around and firing at me with his SMG. Other than that, I've been having a good time with the game."},{"rating":"2","title":"this game has really bad problems","review":"I bought this game and found it to be a big let down. This game is a step backwards in technology. The Graphics arent even good for a PS2 game let alone Xbox.

The AI is one of the worst ever. The bad guys basically just stand there and let you shoot them. Halo and Knights of the old Republic are so far beyond anything this game attempts to be good at.

This game completely scraps the RPG elements and great things it had going for it from the first. They dumbed the game down, changing the inventory, having unified ammo--Yes, that means that the pistol uses the same ammo as the flamethrower. Other than the storyline, there is no similarities from the original. Not only is the point system gone, locational damage gone, there is pathetic AI, blocky, tiny levels, cartoonish characters and various other bad graphical effects. This game fails in comparison from the first, so if you are looking for more of the good ole same style game play from Deus Ex, play through Deus Ex again. Or you could wait a week until this game end up in the bargin bin. A complete disapointment and failure in game design.

While the publisher lists ages 4-8 as the targeted reading level, I found with our library groups at school that our 9-11 year olds were very interested in it as well.

Not unless they make two critical changes back to the way things used to be:1. Eliminate the new \\"Activation Feature.\\" Unless you only ever use one computer, this makes things a royal pain.2. Provide a means to back up the state software download. I now apparently have to keep TurboTax forever loaded on my computer if I ever want to access the online state software again.This doesn't even address the spyware they've added this year.

Their system charged me again, even though it is very clear that any rejected return is refiled at no cost.

Much to my surprise, my CD-RW suddenly quit working, and after hours of research, phone calls, assistance from friends, etc, the root cause was found to be the C-Dilla services which were installed without my knowlege, and running in the background. Fortunately, Windows XP system rollback removed the offending software without a trace, except for some hidden sectors on my hard drive which are not accessed if the C-Dilla software is not installed.

After Turbotax installation, my computer's sound has been locking up. The authentication will present some problems if you change major hardware components or you decide to get a new computer. Intuit's support team was not much help. I've decide to switch to TaxCut which can import last year's TurboTax files and TaxCut is a much better value anyway.Update: I used Turbotax Deluxe 2006 and TaxCut 2006. Intuit has made improvements since the 2002 version and it runs without a glitch on my WinXP machine. I rate TurboTax 2006 4 stars out of 5.

Terrible mistake. There are so many bugs with the programs that unless you are a trained tax professional (such as myself) you would not be able to catch them. For example, education credits for NYS does not always flow directly onto the State Return. You have manually enter in the credit instead of the program automatically populating from the worksheet.

After 45 minutes of downloading on a 56K modem I gave up. The software itself seems to work well and I've used it in the past, but because of the hassles I will not use it again. Don't buy it.

The State portion was broken. I was unable to complete the questioning becuase there was a loop in the questions, it kept taking me back to a particular spot and removing data that I had entered. I spent hours online with their (slow and terrible) tech support people and finally just filed on paper. What a disaster. Their solution would be for me to TOTALLY start over in federal as well and see if I could repeat it again. What a crummy idea? They are aware that this is a bug, but have no intention of fixing it.

Just because some people pirate software doesn't mean they should take it out on the rest of us.

The software automatically assumes bank interests is Mass bank interests and doesn't give instructions on how to ommit non-mass-residency dividends and interest.

As a shareholder, I of course support the companies efforts to combat piracy, but not at the expense of paying customers.

We've been using it for years and have been very happy with it. But, apparently the company that provides TurboTax (Intuit) has decided that us shiftless customers are not to be trusted, we could be pirating their software. So Intuit has implemented an 'activation' scheme to protect their software. So far the \\"protection' has worked great. It has prevented us from using the software at all. After 4 calls to the \\"customer service\\" department, and a lot of time on hold, we still have not been able to get it activated. Yesterday on the 4th call, Intuit finally admitted they were \\"having problems\\" with the activation process, after initially implying it was \\"user error\\".

The only time I got into the program was when I initally installed it and paid for it with my credit card. Even though I was given the correct key number and order number on 3 occasions by 3 different TT reps., I can no longer use it. The online help is a joke (long and tedious to get help), especially in light of the software program changes for 2002. Intuit and their software developers did not think of the consumers on this one. Too bad a great program was brought down to a less-than-adequate level."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your money","review":"I recently purchased TurboTax deluxe 2002. It now requires a activation code to tie it to your computer. This feature did not work over the internet. I had to use the phone. The software focuses too much on trying to sell other services. Every few questions tries to get you to sign up for a service or more software. Finally the internet updates and filing did not work because I have a firewall. Intuit's solution was to disable my firewall and NAT software because they only work in a very restrictive network environment.

If you are running DSL or cable and have a simple router installed you are simply out of luck if you want to get updates. In my home configuration that means I have to either physically move machines, load my dsl providers lame software and do the update in an unprotected fashion. Of course none of this is documented!

Be warned."},{"rating":"1","title":"How Intuit can resolve this issue (but won't)","review":"Here's how Intuit can protect its TurboTax intellectual property and still keep loyal users happy: Rather than allowing activation on one computer, allow it on three. This should provide \\"fair use\\" opportunity for most users -- they can install it on desktop, notebook and that new desktop they get for Christmas, say -- while preventing unsanctioned installations far and wide. But I'm not optimistic that Intuit, whose software is bogged down with cross-sell/up-sell solicitations, can overcome its greedhead inclinations and do anything so customer-minded. So maybe I'll have to try TaxCut next year. A pity ... I really liked TurboTax, otherwise."},{"rating":"1","title":"No more TurboTax for me","review":"Too bad the lowest rating you can put is still 1 star; this product deserves 0 star.

The real headache I have with the software is that it installs a background task that runs all the time whether you running turbo tax or not. And it does not uninstall when you uninstall turbo tax. It clutters your root directory by creating a director called C_DILLA (sounds like a virus name to me)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very much agree--Impossible to get at previous year's taxes","review":"Very much agree with the negative reviews here--the activation scheme makes archiving dependent on keeping paper forms. Want to look at the last couple years worth of forms--tough--you'd better keep all previous software because they won't read data from beyond last year and Intuit will tell you to hike to blazes.

I have contacted Intuit support and I was told that if I (1) buy a new computer (2) want to print from work (3) my computer crashes (4) any other reason I can't get my pc to print, I will have to buy a new license from Intuit. It sounds like they've decided to license personal finance software like an Operating System from Microsoft. I really don't understand that mentality.

Unfortunately, this year's version has played havoc with some of my startup services even when it's not running. It's installed some version of [a program] that is sending encrypted packets to Intuit, and when I've used another program to rip out the [program], the main program quits running. When I went to re-install it, it wouldn't activate without wanting me to re-register. I've been waiting on hold for 45 minutes waiting for customer support, and am still holding as I write this. This used to be the top of the heap for tax prep software, but I'm afraid that I'll have to purchase one of the other prep packages to do my taxes this year.

I'll be returning my copy of TT-2002 tomorrow to Intuit's San Diego returns warehouse.I guess I will also consider migrating off Quicken to Money 2003 since that comes packaged with TaxCut has received very good reviews.

Simple problem, or so I thought, until I reviewed the FAQ's on the TT website.

Not this year. I hated the 'tacky' advertisements placed throughout the product. It takes long enough to do my taxes now, I shouldn't have to waste time saying 'no' to an array of additional Intuit product offerings. Last year was easy with respect to the state program. The first state was free with TurboTax. Just download it. This year you have to pay for the state and then ask them for the money back. Was totally unable to register TurboTax. Every time I tried to register the product it kept telling me the server was down. I finally gave up. TurboTax couldn't find last year's return so I had to find it manually. Also, the tree structure is different from last year so I had to tailor my backup process to find this year's files. Next year it's Tax Cut for me.

I called to complain; Intuit told me to remove the CDilla directory. DO NOT do this! Now my computer won't boot and Intuit can't help me. I may have to reinstall Windows to use my computer again.

Not unless they make two critical changes back to the way things used to be:1. Eliminate the new \\"Activation Feature.\\" Unless you only ever use one computer, this makes things a royal pain.2. Enable saving of the state download. Apparently, I need to keep TurboTax '02 loaded on my computer if I ever want to use the state software again.This doesn't even address the spyware.

It's annoying but, in the end, it's the American way.What I DO care about is this SafeCast / C-Dilla garbage. Not only does it install without notice, it installs surreptitiously by installing into a hidden folder. Then, it runs as a system process which is automatically launched at start up independently of TurboTax. And it's not uninstalled when TurboTax is uninstalled.The process uses \\"only\\" 1 MB of RAM. That's not much, of course, until EVERY software vendor in the world decides to follow suit by using \\"their own\\" 1 MB of MY RAM.

Maybe (if I am lucky) they will give me a new activation code if this happens before April 15. But I have all my Tax SW installed on my PC back to 1990. I am sure that in a year or more there is NO WAY they will give me a new activation code if my HD crashes.

It seems that Intuit did not learn the lesson of the copy protection wars of the 1980s: customers rebel at restrictive protection, especially when one or more vendors offer similar non-protected products.

I d/l the state and got it free. I've used Quicken and Turbo Tax software for the last 5 years; no more. I probably won't change computers, so I don't have that problem, rather it's just the idea of it. Apparently Intuit doesn't trust us. If there were not competing software such as H&R; Block's Tax Cut (I think it was Kiplinger's a few years ago), I would probably do it by hand. I think Intuit has entered the Microsoft mindset (We own the world, they've got to buy from us).

This slightly improves thesituation since if you change computers afterOctober 15th you can install the software again.But it really is too bad that you can't have it onyour notebook and desktop, or your home and workmachines.It isn't a program I'd choose to buy any more due toMacrovision and what C-Dilla installs in the hiddenarea of your hard drive.Very sad that a clueless product manager can do to suchdamage to a once fine company.

I've never given the program to other people or allowed them to use my computer/software to do their returns. I bought TT Home & Business 2002 last week and installed it as usual. I later noticed the folder c:\\\\C_DILLA and deleted it. When I reran TT it made me activate it again and the folder reappeared. Now since searching Google Groups I have found two services running in the background on my W2K system. I've also learned that C_DILLA has written data to my harddrive that cannot be removed without reformatting. I had no warning that this trojan horse was going to be installed on my machine, or I would not have installed it in the first place.I am returning TT tomorrow and buying TaxCut. Intuit has lost a dedicated customer since 1996. I'm sure H&R; Block (owners of TaxCut) are thrilled to death at Intuit's stupidity."},{"rating":"1","title":"Switch to Tax Cut","review":"This used to be the Gold standard for Tax software before the folks at Intuit got greedy. I believe that you ought to pay for any software that you use, but on the other hand, companies ought to be up front with customers when they put sneaky spy programs on your computer.Intuit violated this cardinal rule when it placed Cdilla on all copies of Turbotax. This program reports back to the servers at headquarters so that you can't load a copy of TurboTax at home and at work. They did not even put an uninstaller on the disk. When word got out about this program the company then put an uninstaller on their servers.Switch to TaxCut!!They don't have anything like this on their disks."},{"rating":"1","title":"2003 - No Better than 2002!","review":"Turbo Tax was good last year.

However (yup, you guessed it) - my laptop BOMBED. I mean, BOMBED. Everything was wiped out. I can't say what killed it, but it was dead.In the course of putting the software on my desktop computer (since the laptop was useless), I ran into problems as I'd already activated the turbotax software. I contacted intuit, and they said I had to buy my federal and all three states again. I told them that I understand one copy, one license, however, this event was a bit extreme. After 1/2 hour of arguing, I got my federal. Then another 1/2 hour of fighting to get the states.The product itself is decent (I've used it for the last 3 years), but I will never use this product again. It was way too much stress (not to mention countless hours of trying to get all the AOL icons and programs out of my computer).NEVER AGAIN."},{"rating":"1","title":"Scumbags","review":"Beware....you WILL NOT get your refund.

I should have. It's as bad as they say and worse. I have bought a copy to TT every year for as long as I can remember doing my taxes but this is the last year I buy TT. In fact, I am so mad that I will never buy any Intuit product again. As a software developer, I do understand the desire of protecting IP. But putting spyware that significantly affects the functioning of your computer is not a solution. TT causes all users except for the user who installed TT on my home XP system to crash when connecting to the internet (workaround: disable c-dilla through the services console before connecting). It is a tremendous headache and I don't even want to think about trying to get a look at my taxes in the future when I have a different machine. I will just print several hard copies, uninstall, and throw the software in the trash where it belongs."},{"rating":"1","title":"I won't buy this product again","review":"I have bought this product for five years running, but won't buy it again.

Not only is activation a bad idea to begin with, but power-users will almost certainly be caught in a bind as they upgrade systems and reinstall software.I also wish that Intuit would finally come around and create a multiplatform app (Java?) or at least look into supporting Linux.

Intuit has made it extremely difficult to use the 2002 versions of their Turbo Tax. In an effort to save themselves from piraters, they are going to run off their yearly user base and they know it. They are almost refusing to support and if you have XP, leave TurboTax alone. For some reason it seems to be causing major start up errors in XP. I have had to reinstall XP (3) times, each caused by the direct installation of TurboTax."},{"rating":"1","title":"Intuit lost a 7 year customer","review":"Horrible.

This year will be my last for two reasons: (1) Navigation. The index is terrible. Chances are if you need to jump back to a specific section (Home Office Summary, for example), be prepared to be dropped off 10 or so questions before it. Worse still, these questions are important, and even though you've already answered them they don't default to your last answer. Very frustrating. (2) Activation. Of all the years I've purchased TurboTax, I've never \\"cheated\\", \\"shared\\", \\"borrowed\\", etc. I don't like the idea that I can't use a piece of software that I bought on any machine I choose. Sadly I think activation is here to stay, arriving on more products by the release.

The tie down system doesn't work well. The bottom has runners molded into it, but is also has some pockets molded in. The pockets don't help it slide. If you are able to load it into your vehicle with the deer tied in it, it does keep blood and stuff contained very well."},{"rating":"1","title":"too specialized","review":"Spanish Plus was produced with the same high production quality as the first three levels of Pimsleur spanish, but the reason i can only give it two stars is that it is much too centered around the publishing industry rather than the general conversation paterns of the first three levels. Also i was expecting more generalized coverage of the subjunctive tenses consdering how important they are in spanish as in other romance languages. The future tense could have been introduced also. It can be expressed with the verb \\"ir\\" but understanding it will be difficult without practice. In a nutshell, not enough new general material was introduced and too much time spent on a very narrow area. As happy as i was with the levels I, II, and III, i regret purhasing this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"No lo recomiendo","review":"I can't be as kind as some of the other reviewers. This course is just awful. The packaging says \\"At the completion of this course, you will be able to speak and understand Spanish at an advanced level\\". But this is not true at all. The main focus of this 10-unit course is on conversations related to the publishing industry. There are many words that you are asked to repeat, which were already introduced in the Pimsleur beginner-level courses. How many times do you need to repeat \\"Vivo en Estados Unidos\\" before you understand it? Also, I can't imagine why the designers of this course think it's useful, at an advanced level (or any level for that matter), to repeat place names such as \\"Montevideo, Uruguay\\" using a Spanish accent. This course may give you the opportunity to practice some of the Spanish you've already learned in earlier courses, but you will learn very little that's useful in the real world, unless you're planning to become an editor, or to write and publish a novel."},{"rating":"2","title":"Above-average compilation, with some enjoyable plus-factors","review":"Anybody buying this CD in expectation of standard performances of the standard arias is in for a surprise. Yes, the end of act one of \\"Boheme\\" which begins the CD, is the enjoyable experience it always is in the hands of Freni and the young Pavarotti. But you also have performances of some of the less-well-known arias, such as \\"Senza Mamma\\" from \\"Suor Angelica,\\" and performances by singers under-represented on other discs, such as Italian tenor Bruno Prevedi and the talented Afro-American soprano Leona Mitchell. Plus, for the finale, you have \\"Nessun Dorma\\" sung by...Giuseppe DiStefano, in a solid performance recorded at the end of his career.In short, it may be the music (and that nice cover photo of the Met) that prompts you to buy this CD, but it's the performances that will keep you coming back for more."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Helpful and Insightful","review":"I think that Ms. Sokolow does a fantastic job.

There is a good deal of Cantonese comedy and some \\"gross-out\\" humor, but I would not consider it a \\"comedy\\". The night fight inside the General's home is one of the most fantastic and creative sequences ever filmed. The opponents are fighting over a box, and must fight in total silence. The final fight between Liu and Lo Lieh is incredible and perhaps even tops the final fight in \\"Master Killer\\". Don't be dismayed or distracted by bad dubbing; concentrate on the amazing techniques displayed. Fast forward through the leper island sequence, it's pointless, and doesn't even factor in the idea that the opponenents are LEPERS whom one should probably not touch.

Even the scenes that are supposed to be ~shocking!~ drag and appear staged as all hell. Also, where the hell is the black metal? Long story short, BMV disappointed me in every way I can think of.

If you like the more mature humor of Moonlighting, Life on Mars (UK version especially) and New Tricks, then you will likely find Vexed to be less appealing.

This, however, seems completely unfocused and corny. Jeremy's voice, which was fine on How It Feels... has gone up one octave and is very obnoxious. Also, the brilliant lyrics of the other albums, especially Diary and Lp2 have turned into some cheesy, blatently preachy Christian gobledegook. Not only has Jeremy declined, but the prog rock of How It Feels... deteriorated into U2 power chord territory most likely due to the lack of a bass player.Jeremy, William, and Nate(!) have formed a new band. I believe this band will be able to create great albums like the original Sunny Day Real Estate did. If you are new to Sunny Day Real Estate, I would get the albums is chronological order, with Diary being your first album.

Some highlights, the infectious \\"Television\\", the plantive \\"Pain Song\\", and the excellent title track. While not their best, \\"The Rising Tide\\" is still a great album, and a welcome break from the manufactured music currently being churned out by the music industry.

I can't help but fall in love with almost every Sunny Day song I hear. Tracks to check out on this album would be \\"Killed By an Angel\\" and \\"Rain Song\\" they are my favorites and give a good sample of what you can expect on the rest of the album.

How It Feels To Be Something On was not great but this new release is quite simply bad. Maybe I'm stuck in the past but is there anyone else out there that misses the SDRE sound of the first two CD's like I do? These new songs are boring, even tedious, and what's up with Enigk's voice?

If you like progressive rock then you'll like this, butfor fans of music then The Rising Tide is a huge disappointment. Songs involve excessive vocal effects, dull drumming and their previous emotion through music has been foresaken for mainstream ideals and acceptance. \\"One\\" is the only highlight - if the other songs were like this then the record could have been a classic.

If you are a new sdre fan, I'd suggest you not purchase this album and go out and get diary, their best album. LP2 is also an excellent album, and so is HIFTBSO. You can see the progression from HIFTBSO to the rising tide, but in my opinion it is a decline. HIFTBSO is soft and beautiful music, especially compared to the earlier louder sdre in diary and LP2. However, in the rising tide, the music is soft, but it isn't beautiful. It is sappy, the lyrics are contrived, and the music all around just isn't so great. I can't stand most of the tracks on this cd. I used to like the ocean and rain song, but those are now unbearable to listen to. If you are a new sdre fan, go get their old stuff."},{"rating":"2","title":"Quite simply, a classic!","review":"It would not be in the best interest of anyone to compare this album to Sunny Day's earlier works or to perseverate on its relevence to emo-culture for the simple fact that it stands alone as a classic. Unpretentious, introspective and accessible each track poetic and visceral with Jeremy's voice at the helm; a beckon of light shinning on dark shores of the subconsious.

I can understand that some people don't like their new direction. It's obvious that they have changed since the earlier albums. But I don't see the change as something bad.

My family here in the US cooks very differently from my family still in Italy and I think she pays homage to both kinds of cooking.

I don't understand how the review writers can't see the value of little people being exposed to great writers of poetry! He is neither depressed or put off, but intrigued.

It represents one of five films for which she received an Oscar nomination with two wins (\\"Butterfield 8\\" and \\"Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?\\").

Of course life is hard there and people are being killed. One scene shows women talking about the Americans shooting outside of the mosque and coming into the women's prayer area. I feel their pain as I watch, but overall I found the movie to be a bit disjointed. You get brief scenes of American military making plans for the election process, scenes of UN election supervisors, and you follow a doctor/candidate throughout his country. There is no narration. The movie just keeps flipping from one scene to another. If a person doesn't know much about the war or war's effects on people, perhaps this is worthwhile.

It's pretty good if you're looking for a bag that can carry the camera, a filter, and maybe an extra battery, and you have an external bag (backpack, etc) that has other things you need to keep the camera safe from. It's really not that great (despite the shoulder strap) as a stand alone bag to carry the camera around in. The zipper makes it difficult to get the camera out for rapid shooting, and the strap itself is rather cumbersome to deal with since the camera's own strap doesn't really fit in the bag.All that being said, it's only $13, and it works great if you plan on stuffing your camera in a full backpack or luggage and need some assurance that it won't contract rapid camera death syndrome."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too small for standard SLR with standard zoom lens","review":"I was pretty excited about getting a SLR camera case for less than $20.

I guess it could have fit with a 50mm fixed lens but I think it is pretty rare these days to have a SLR for regular use without some sort of zoom.If you use a zoom lens and have a standard size SLR it will not fit and therefore, do not waste your time or money on this otherwise acceptable product."},{"rating":"1","title":"broken","review":"I bought this product after reading MULTIPLE reviews for my Canon Rebel XSI.

To that end, this works great. My Sony a300 fits in great, with 18-200 lens attached. There is room in the lid for an extra battery and memory card, which is nice. The holster has just enough padding that I feel safe putting it in my larger bag. I threw away the shoulder straps that came with it, but this made a problem: The Sony neck strap does not easily fit inside, because it has to bunch up. To solve this, I cut a hole near the seam/hinge, so that I can push the strap through. This will leave the holster open to moisture a little more, but works better for me. I'd like to see a redesign that accomplishes the same idea."},{"rating":"2","title":"NICE PRICE FOR A NICE CASE","review":"Opteka SLR & DSLR Camera Short Zoom Holster Case w/Adjustable Shoulder StrapThis is a nice case for the price that I paid for it.

This case will fit most compact DSLRs with their kit lens well, but it's not the best made case I've seen. It is stiff, so it will protect your camera from drops and such, but it is a little tight on my Canon T1i, and could use a little more interior space.

Video quality is fuzzy when a DVD is upconverted to 1080i. Honestly, it looks best when the DVD player outputs 480p, and the upconversion is done by the TV.Then, after 3 days of use, the unit froze and locked a DVD inside.

I assumed the unit was off balance (never had this happen with a DVD player before, despite working in a pawnshop for 10 years and handling thousands of different DVD players). The balance problem ended up being remedied by placing a small object on the right side of the player. This unit seems to have been designed to be sitting on an absolute perfectly flat surface and since mine was very slightly uneven, it caused problems. Even after eliminating the buzz saw nice, the player froze several times through two different DVDs. It's going back to Costco tonight. Please do yourself a favor and consider a different player. It's a shame to see Toshiba DVD players turning sour like this....they used to make such great players for the money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great DVD Player","review":"I just purchased this unit today and I must say I'm most impressed. It is a whole lot of box for such a small package. A real added bonus was the HDMI cable that came with the unit. Combined with a very easy to use remote control makes it an easy choice. I purchased mine at Costco for $79.00 and change. Personally, I don't think a better player can be found for the money. Based upon my previous experience with other units I would say that this Toshiba compares with units that cost twice as much.

The word is a compound of \`only' and \`begotten'. Their choice of cutting out the concept of begotten comes from a theological view point not.

I was not sure what to expect from this DVD since the other Nutcracker DVD recordings were more recent (this one dates back to 1978), yet the Bolshoi is world famous. As it turns out, the performance itself is great. The sound quality is good and the picture quality is typical for color recordings from the seventies: the screen is permanently covered by a slight blue haze. Also, every five minutes or so the sound stalls for a split second. Moral of the story: if you're looking for something nice for the kids then you are better off buying George Balanchine's Nutcracker. If you are looking for a great classical performance by the Bolshoi Theatre and don't mind the slightly inferior picture quality and the periodically stalling sound then this DVD is for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terribly filmed","review":"I agree that this is a dismal DVD. The original filming is much of the problem, with the performance either not properly staged for film or the director having no idea how to capture ballet. Much of the time the feet of the performers are lopped off, and the overall effect is claustrophobic. Whatever was done to (supposedly) make this 5.1 Dolby wasn't beneficial. Oddly, quite frequently there is a silent momentary hiccup in the disc."},{"rating":"1","title":"A disgraceful release of a legendary performance","review":"First of all, the low rating is entirely for this particular DVD issue, NOT for the performance.The legendary Maximova-Vasiliev/Bolshoi \\"Nutcracker\\" has seen various VHS and now DVD releases over the years. This is undoubtedly one of the worst I ever came across. The editing is simply a disgrace. In the first Act white spots start appearing all over the screen and on a couple of places entire seconds of footage are missing. The sound has never been much to write home about and nothing has been attempted to improve it for this DVD. (Don't believe it is dolby surround, as the cover pretends.)

Part I, entitled: \\"Gog Magog Hills,\\" shows Barrett in a field named after the title while experiencing his first trip. Part II, entitled: \\"Abbey Road Studios,\\" shows Pink Floyd after just having signed their first recording contract with EMI Records outside Abbey Road Studios in April of 1967. Interesting footage, but not very well done. I would only recommend this to die-hard Pink Floyd fans."},{"rating":"2","title":"For Die Hard Pink Floyd or Syd Barrett Fans only","review":"This is a great piece of history, and is now available on DVD is a cool footage with syd and some kids running around doing shrooms and stuff, but that's not the important part, the important part is that here's the footage of pink floyd after signing there first contratc with EMI and that's history, the music is excellent although is not pf music, but if you have 10 bucks lying around pick them up and buy it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Does Nothing To Remember Syd Barrett, The Musician","review":"This fifteen minute homemade film of former Pink Floyd songwriter (1965-68) Syd Barrett taking mushrooms and other drugs is absolutely degrading. Instead of remembering Syd as a brilliant songwriter and musician, it instead elevates his reputation as a reclusive drug addict. Syd was once a bright musician, with a lot of great ideas, and a brilliancy when it came to songwriting. But sadly he turned to drugs, and it severely damaged his mental health. Barrett has even made it clear through relatives and \\"representatives\\" that he does not want this part of his past flaunted by anyone or any company, and for good reason. This \\"document\\" is an insult to Roger Keith Barrett, the person. Drug addiction is a sad thing, but exploiting it on camera and releasing it to the public for their viewing pleasure is absolutely degrading."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible","review":"This DVD is horrible, Discusting & very disrespectful to Mr.Barrett.

If you are interested in finding out more about Barrett DO NOT buy this DVD. It is mildly interesting in catching Barrett in a home movie with no professional cajoling or directing but taking it for what it is it is about as enterteining as watching your neighbor's home movie of them in a dasiy field with no sound.

I see it as lesson about potential and how drugs undermine that potential.Yes, I feel sorry for SYD but the fact remains, he did it to himself. There is so little footage on the Crazy Diamond, that I for one would buy anything containing more footage. The quality of the images are first rate and I only wish it was longer.This man should be left alone, I agree. But from I read, he sure could use the money, so buy it and help out old SYD. He has to be getting a cut of these sales. If not, let's hook him up with a good US lawyer. He hasn't uttered a public word in 30 years and yet here we are, still hovering over a talent so rich, we're still hungry for it. This disc speaks to that and to his early self gererated demise. This disc is a lesson that drugs can burn out your star, no matter how brightly it shines."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it!","review":"My child did a Hermie music program at his church school.

It was not quite what I expected after hearing some things from The (newly formed I gather) Entrance Band. Low-fi four track compositions, usually just one or two guitars and a vocal with some sparse percussion. Authentic rhythm/blues and country/western inspired. Reminds me of early smog in the overall tenor and delivery and there is something definitely psychedelic lurking beneath it. The liner notes credit all but a few songs as inspirations from other works. Very good overall and makes me want to hear more.

Here is an honest, beautifully photographed reconstruction of a true - if exaggerated - story of a real-life mountain man, John Johnston, who became a legend in his own lifetime. So, for that matter, did old-timers like 'Bear Claw' Chris Lapp, Del Gue, Swan and others. They all lived. They're all here and they're all honestly portrayed."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great classic","review":"For any Robert Redford fan, this DVD is a must-have.

Redford at his best."},{"rating":"2","title":"Should Be A Part Of Every Serious Collection","review":"This movie is a masterpiece, in my opinion. Definitely one of Redford's best efforts.It's kind of a guy movie in that it involves survival, and man against the elements mentality, but it has elements of a love story as well!I first saw this movie the year it came out (early seventies), and I'd guess that I've watched it at least 20 times since then. It never gets old or outdated.This one should be a part of every serious collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"great Robert Redford film","review":"I was just a kid when this came out in theaters. I thought it was a great film then and think it is a good film now. The film gives you a sense of what it was like to be alone out against the elements. A feel for what it was like to be a mountain man. It may not be 100% accurate but it was very entertaining movie to see."},{"rating":"2","title":"ROUGHING IT","review":"As a lone wolf who dislikes civilization, Redford has a personal triumph in his playing the title role. Johnson moves to the unforgiving Rockies; he can barely stay alive until an old trapper he meets (Will Geer) takes him under his wing. For a year, Johnson learns all the basic neccessities of staying alive in the wilderness, and he eventually goes off on his own. Marauding Indians wipe out a settlement in which only a mother and son survive; Johnson buries the dead and adopts the boy! A later tribe of Indians turn out to be friendly and when they discover their enemy scalps in Redford's possession, he turns out to be their hero and is hailed as a Great Warrior....... Based on a real-life person; the acting of Redford is brilliant in every respect while the photography of wild Utah is breathtaking. Well-directed, the movie was an enormous hit when it was originally released theatrically in 1972; it grossed over 22 million dollars."},{"rating":"2","title":"Jeremiah Johnson","review":"I really loved this movie and I would recommend it to anyone. It came before the date required and in the quality stated."},{"rating":"2","title":"Jeremiah Johnson","review":"The scenery in this movie is spectacular. The story line seemed a bit disjointed at times, but overall it is worth the time to view it. The history of this time period is always interesting. Somehow I never really connected with any of the characters. But as I said at the beginning, the scenery is beautiful."},{"rating":"2","title":"A musket in the hands of a frozen corpse","review":"As truly american films go, there is always a hero which blazes the trail of the unknown. Robert Redford plays a man sick and tired of city life and (much like Dances With Wolves) finds himself alone in a ravaging frontier. He meets wild men in winter with skins on their back's, wild men in summer that have shaved their heads to keep their scalp, and a crazy woman that has lost all she has and taken upon with pitty. As humorous in stuggle as it is heartbreaking, Jeremiah Johnson stands tall with cinema's American Heroes. It can be listed with the \\"Lone Man\\" movies such as Rob Roy, Brave Heart, Dances With Wolves, and Last of the Mohican's. If you appreciate these mentioned films then you will most definately enjoy it. When he looses everything, and fight's alone against Braves one at a time, you will cheer his strength, and laugh at his attempts. Jeremiah Johnson starts as a person not befitting a meal for a Griz, but in the end becomes a legend."},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic Pioneer","review":"One of the best pictures Robert Redford has made. Far better than \\"Dances with Wolfs\\" about telling the story of the pain for both pioneers and indians when America was growing after the Civil War. Redford becomes a mountain man after being taken under the wing of Will Geer. A little comedy but overall a drama that shows the hardships of the times. Great supporting cast and direction, excellent locations, and good music make this well worth seeing. The price is very reasonable and the DVD is well worth owning."},{"rating":"2","title":"widescreen, scenic, but not too accurate, still a story","review":"One side is full screen, one side widescreen 2.35:1Lotsa unreal matters that a \\"flatlander\\" might think correct but trying to catch a fish walking in cold water is a fine way to freeze your feet and die shortly afterwards.Snow is real, so's the mountain scenery. A bit of a story rather loosely based on \\"Liver-eatin Johnson\\" but still a story especially for those aint never seen real snow, mountains, streams, hunting, trapping, bow and arrow, old black powder guns, horses, and such other lost in history. An America almost gone.

Filmed in Utah, the scenery is breath-taking (I now understand why Robert Redford loves that state so much).Jeremiah Johnson is a self-made frontier-man who sets about to live his life in the seclusion of the mountains. Along the way he has to deal with Indians (sometimes friendly, sometimes not), the elements (living in MI, I can't fathom someone spending the whole winter outdoors!) and wild animals. On top of all that he needs to fend for himself and get everything he needs to survive.For outdoorsmen, this movie is a must-have. For the rest of us (like me!) it is an enjoyable venture into a different age & time. It centers around the interaction of the white man with the native American, and sometimes the results were tragically disastrous."},{"rating":"2","title":"Jeremiah - powerfully unlucky","review":"Robert Redford's Jeremiah Johnson attracts a fair poultice of misfortune and trouble as he meanders across, through and around his mountain fastness. Redford's performance is convincing but why the heck did Johnson agree to go with the army contingent and put the lives of his own family at such risk? It just doesn't add up. Was the movie pure escapism or did it have a deeper meaning. The former, I think and better for it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Jeremiah Johnson","review":"Excellent movie. it just happened to be on T V and my boy friend never saw it. He liked it so...I purchased it for him."},{"rating":"2","title":"Jeremiah Johnson","review":"A great movie, will watch it over and over! Wish they would make more like this!

I've seen a lot of movies that are weird and/or very disturbing, and this is definitely no exception. However, this movie was just, to put it plainly , a boring 90 minutes of film. It's one thing to make a controversial film if it is riveting or even somewhat interesting, but this was just a bad movie. And I hate to say that because I think Chloe Sevigny is a great actress and very underrated. And I won't even say she should've avoided this project, because it did seem to have potential. But to me, all the shock value and weirdness seemed to be there just for the sake of being weird, and that's just dumb. Overall, I was disappointed in this film."},{"rating":"1","title":"gummo","review":"weired movie, funny parts but this is the kind of movie you watch only when your high; \\"crazy thing is\\", i dont get high. wasnt the best movie!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I'm from Xenia, and it ain't nothin like this","review":"The way the film portrays Xenia makes it look like the whole town is like this. I know for a fact that it is not. While the town is not the greatest out there, it was a pretty decent place to grow up in. The producer of this one probably sniffed a little too much glue himself. Visit the place before you submit a 5-star review and you'll see that this film is way off track."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overblown crap","review":"I'm from a little town in Ohio and it's pieces of crap like this getting out into the mainstream that give the whole place a bad name. Yeah we have our share of poor white trash just like every other town in the U.S (and I'm sure plenty of towns overseas have em too). But what we and most every other town has is plain folks trying to get by. What the @!*&!!! Even the poorest white trash wouldn't whore out their mentally handicapped child. We may not have multimillion dollar homes and prance around in expensive cars but what we do have is pride. Yeah we tend to do stupid stuff and gravitate to shows like COPS but I can throw out a few Hollywood names that would make even the most idiotic repeat offender say\\"Damn they's stupid.\\" I did my duty as a servicemember to defend the rights of these filmakers to @#$* out any piece of crap they want...just don't advertise that you made this in any of the little Ohio towns I know."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stinker","review":"Whew. I though I liked weird movies until I saw this junk. You've got to really be so completely opened minded to enjoy this film that your brains fall out. Want to see an \\"art\\" film that makes no sense? Then watch any David Lynch film. At least with Lynch at the helm you can feel the talent behind the camera. Not with Gummo, though. This is junk posing as art. It's a wonder so many have been suckered into to believing this crap has any deep meaning or significance."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ack","review":"I started watching \\"Gummo\\" because of Linda Manz. I loved her in \\"Days of Heaven\\". I got about 15 minutes into and turned it off. I had to. I was...what's the word I'm looking for?... Ah, yes, I was disgusted. I find no redeeming value in watching this movie. None.There's sick and twisted that's great(like any of the Romero zombie flicks). There's weird and disturbing that's great(like any of the Jodorowsky flicks).Then there's \\"Gummo\\". The title makes me think of gum stuck to the bottom of my shoe. Which makes me think of dog turd stuck to the bottom of my shoe. Which leads right back to \\"Gummo\\".I usually don't write bad reviews about movies because they are all subjective. But I had to say something about this horrible movie. And plead with people to pass this one by. Life is too short to watch crappy movies. If you want to see a \\"bad\\" movie try \\"Plan 9 from Outer Space\\", \\"Manos, the Hands of Fate\\", or any of the MST3K fare."},{"rating":"2","title":"NARROW MINDED NAYSAYERS SHOULD STICK W/ RAMBO!","review":"Gummo, a flower holding enough wine to quench the thirst of those who desire, crass creativity. Many egotist demote this masterful piece, with illregard to their lack of attention span for art. Gummo can be takein on many different levels so if you fancy your self open minded, and can look at \\"ART\\" in a conseptuous way, and you dont get distracted when your short attention span has to look at more than the face in front of you, you will love Korine and his work."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not much reason to watch this film...","review":"Lots of weridos performing outlandish acts in this film.
