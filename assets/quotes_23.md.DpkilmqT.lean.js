I like the way that Ms. Rawn gives you an overview of the characters. I became attached to the characters since the beginning of this book. I don't however like the way that she skips what happens in 6 years or how Ms. Rawn doesn't focus on the dragons very much. This is a good fantasy book, I think there is a little realism to this. it is a people book and good overall. There are just a couple of things that i would change if i was her but other than this is very good and pretty well writen. You can see what's happening as if it's happening right in front of you. I enjoyed this book and plan to finish the series"},{"rating":"2","title":"My ALL-TIME Favorite!","review":"I have to say that this is the finest fantasy series I have ever read. The characters, the world they live in and everything about the books are very well developed and the writting is so detailed you can see, smell, taste and feel everything Melanie Rawn describes in them. The plot is complex and interesting, yet easy to follow, and my only complaint about the series is that there were only six books. I hope to see more in the series in the future!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful!","review":"The characters are realistic- you love some, hate others, and share their emotions. You can actually cry at some points."},{"rating":"2","title":"READ THESE BOOKS!!!!","review":"I first happened on Melanie Rawn books about 10 years ago, attracted to the covers of course. I have not put them down since. I've searched far and wide for everything with her name on it. I've even started an eGroup for her.Her characters and plots are incomparible, her sense of humour is fantastic. I've caught myself laughing out loud and bawling my head off when reading her books. You can actually picture the characters in your mind, become them, and feel their emotions, she explains them so well.If you read no other book in your life, read this one...I have...about 10 times!Happy readingDallas Dale"},{"rating":"2","title":"Dragon Prince Series is a good book.","review":"I like reading the Dragon Prince series. It's not as bad as some commented earlier but it was not as \\"excellent\\" as others thought. The series doesn't deal with just one hero. I've noticed that many sci/fantasy books deals with one hero that saves the whole world or a group. Each having a specialty that save their race or the world. I like the way Rawn doesn't make just one hero."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring and overly simple","review":"This makes the third book in a week I started and could not finish. Now, I hate not finishing books, and this recent spell is not a commont on me, but on my choice of reading material.Basically, this is boring and repative and nothing is left for the reader to learn on their own. The author writes as if for a six year old child who needs everything, even the stated emotions of the characters, explained to them. And the characters have no personality among them and act weirdly in ways I can only assume the author thinks reader should see as leadership or something like that. Even though everyone doubts him, the second the main character becomes a prince every action he takes is perfect and wise! All women are desirable and perfectly suited to their husbands! You can see where I'm going. This book just is not worth reading to me.I give up. Two stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"thoroughly terrible","review":"i don't want to waste too many words in reviewing this book. reading it already took too much of my time as it is, hours i will never get back. how any \\"author\\" could write this and publish it instead of keeping it on a comp a home for her own sick pleasure and hope to get away with it is beyond me. it did not contain an insightful view of humanity--just a very delusional, bitter one, perhaps due to childhood traumas. not worth Whelan's effort."},{"rating":"1","title":"If my man slept with someone else, He would be GONE!!!","review":"I was really enjoying this book until the husband fathered a child with someone else and then the wife just accepted it and kept going on and on and on about how this was \\"their child\\". BLECHH. NO woman would put up with that kind of behavior from their spouse!!! I really enjoyed some of Melanie Rawn's other works, but this one incident from her female hero just made me mad, I will not even finish the book now and do not plan on finishing the series. There are better books with stronger female protagonists!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Be careful!","review":"I am a very strong and fast reader, but I couldn't sit through the whole book. I had to skip a few chapters. Here's my summary: It's a romance novel with some dragons and gore. If you like hot sweaty romance then this is a good book for you. I personally didn't care for it AT ALL. There are many VERY, VERY, VERY, VERY, VERY inappropriate parts for a kid under the age of 14. My advice: Read it yourself or take my word for it before you buy it for a young teen or preteen. It is around 600 pages so you better be a good reader. I hope this helps you."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best mix of Fantasy and Romance ever!","review":"I love Fantasy. And this series mixes romance with that. I can't believe how well they blend together!

It ranks in my personal top 5.Having a B.A. in English Literature, I demand a lot of the books I read: Dragon Prince exceeded my high standards. The characters were compelling, the plot well crafted, the world was unique, and the relationships between characters drove the story. A final testamony: I introduced my future fiance to fantasy with this book as a birthday present, and it hooked her too."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful, if a bit slow at times.","review":"Rawn has done a wonderful job of telling the story of Prince Rohan cominginto his own.

Way to go Ms. Rawn!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Captures my attention from page 1","review":"Dragon Prince, by Melanie Rawn is honestly the best book I've ever read. I found the best aspect of the book was the development of the characters. As time progresses, Rohan and Soined, the main characters, adapt to each other and their surroundings like nothing I've ever seen before. This book is definetly a 'must have'."},{"rating":"1","title":"Different Opinions!","review":"After reading the countless glowing reviews this book received and the numerous negative reviews, I felt I had to add my two cents. Rawn is a gifted writer but I found the book could only be described as boring. While new magical methods are introduced the good guy, bad guy, formula got tiring. The lapses in between action was almost unbearable. I did finish the book and move onto the other novels in the series but was unable to finish any of them. The reviewers that claim this is the best book ever written might want to read other Epic Fantasies (Jordan, Tolkein, Herbert) before awarding this book with that title.The extreme difference of opinions contained in the 109 reviews this book received only go to show you the vast range of likes and dislikes the general public can have. Read this book if you have plenty of time on your hand but if you like mature well thought out charaterization try Kay, Jordan or Martin."},{"rating":"2","title":"Magic and Romance, who could want more.","review":"I've read the complete series.

After we received them and started playing with them, I noticed that each one has a small squirt hole in it. Squirt toys are not mold resistant. When toys allow water in, but cannot totally dry out, it is the perfect breeding ground for mold. And why would I want my children bathing with mold? Total false advertising. Completely disappointing and a waste of money."},{"rating":"1","title":"more trouble than they're worth","review":"They do not stay together if you move the chain of them the least little bit.

Rock solid reliability, Does everything you ask of it, longer range than any competing project.However, they have a serious problem with physical design.-- of my three PW+II's, two of them have broken hotshoe feet. The foot is made with a seam in the middle, and both times, the foot has broken right along that seam. Partially, that's because they use plastic for the feet, and partially, because their plastic feet are thinner than say, the ones on my actual flashes, but mainly, it's because of that seam-- I've never seen anything like it on any other hotshoe mountable device.I'm fortunate that only one of my PW's needs to be mounted on camera, and that the others are hung off studio lights, but now I worry that the third one could go at any time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Multi channel is a good thing","review":"This unit has been very dependable for me. Only time I have issues is when there's another photographer in the proximity that also has the Pocket Wizards and we're on the same channel. His transmitter will fire my flash units.

As with all the pocket Wizard equipment I have I am very happy with it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pocket Wizard 2","review":"I have been using this for about 3 months now and I believe its one of the best transmitter out there. You can use it both as a receiver or transmitter. The range is superior at 1600 ft, which means you can shoot around corners if need be. It is a bit bulky compared to the \\"Cactus\\" or \\"MicroSync\\" ones, but this one doesnt miss fire. I love it, once you go with this, you now have the best!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it, but some problems with 580EX II.","review":"I did many tests with 580EX II and 430EX II. The 430 fired every time from up to 120 feet (didn't try any further than that). The 580 was less predictable. It fired 100% from within 20 feet, but beyond that I had to mess with the position of the transmitter to get it to fire. Putting the recevier 8 feet away from the 580 with a PC extension cable didn't help much."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Product","review":"What a great product. I've waited a long time for Pocket Wizard to come out. You have know idea how troublesome it is to have a cord being dragged around with you all the time, to get you're flash or meter reading. I believe that this product was made by Minolta, but I'm not sure. But, it's a great receiver. The only issue I had with this product, was the cost. Quit expensive, for what you get. Thank goodness there was a rebate on Amazon."},{"rating":"1","title":"Broken","review":"These things are great when they work. But mine was sent broken! And I have had so many break over the years. Customer service isn't all that great either.

As a multi-function flash-sync remote & camera trigger remote it just works. Haven't had reason to test it's claimed 1600ft range but I'm sure it does exactly what it says on the tin.My only slight gripe is with the price. Unless you're fortunate enough to have gear with a compatible receiver built in, you're going to need at least two of these puppies - and at $200 a pop, that starts to get a little pricey for what it is! If you can afford it, however, it does what it does flawlessly."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect addition!","review":"After reading the reviews I bought 3 of the PocketWizard for my studio umbrellas and don't regret getting them. After struggling with long cords and sometimes people or I trip on them and they get disconnected during a photo shoot can get very annoying. I have a cheaper brand and they stopped working after 4 sessions with my umbrella - I got what I paid for. You pay more for the PocketWizard but they are worth it.

I just think every strobist should check the Cybersyncs. I've owned them for about a year already and performance is flawless...with NO misfires...for a fraction of the price of a PW. It's a no brainer really. They're tiny, cheap, and 100% functional. Why waste your hard earned money on these PW units??

If I knew anything about sync cables, I'd have known that was wrong, but I trusted them. Ordered one. Wrong cable. The correct cable is miniphone to miniphone.

Boys love to draw these things. In art, they need to really see and notice detail, and they have to persevere until they get it right. In reading, they have to do the art skills, and follow directions. Since it's non-fiction, it fits in with today's education trends.

So far, this is the one I liked the least. The main character, Eve Duncan, is the most annoying \\"heroine\\" I have ever come across. She is so obsessed with the daughter she lost that she can't get on with her life. Yes, bad things happen, but eventually you get over it. Well, Eve doesn't. I was so disappointed with this book that I will definitely not read the rest of the series because I honestly don't care what happens. On the upside, the other characters and the plot were good. If Eve had been different, this book could have been great, but as is... it just isn't worth it. Iris Johansen is usually a great author and I would highly recommend her book The Ugly Duckling instead of this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"How did this book get published?","review":"This is the first Johansen book I've read, but it will be the last.

I am an avid reader and particulary like the attention to detail in Ms. Johansen's books. I find the content to be fresh and always unique! \\"Face of Deception\\" was her best work yet and I cannot wait to read the sequel. The story line is gripping and I finished the book in one sitting just to see how it would end. I would highly recommend this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"I couldn't put it down.....","review":"Iris Johansen grabbed me from the first page with her newest thriller. The plot was intriguing and kept me turning the pages in eager anticipation of the next scene. I've read all of her contemporary romantic suspense novels and found this one to be more entertaining than the others, despite the lack of a true love story. I had empathy for her heroine and feel that Ms. Johansen did a good job of portraying the damage poor parenting, poor environment, and devestating personal trauma can do to a person. To have allowed her heroine to become fully normal in her relationships during the course of this story would have been very unrealistic. As for the story line, stranger things have happened in many governments--why couldn't it happen in ours?

I got involved with her character and IJ spent many pages developing Eve. But the suspense storyline got rather far fetch and the way the suspense ended was very abrupt & uninspired. But the worst part about this \\"romantic suspense\\" is that there is no romance and I found the characters of the two male leads to be very superficial. At the end of the book, I felt cheated out of half the book. It seemed to me that she was saving the second half of this book to sell as a sequel.

Logan neglects to tell her that there are powerful people who are determined to keep the skull's true identity a secret at any cost. Soon Eve's life is in danger and she isn't very happy about it.

You have to care about what happens to Eve, Logan and Joe and I didn't."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring!","review":"I was really anxious to get this book home and start reading. The story outline on the back cover made the book seem very interesting.But I could never get into it. And night after night I tried.The main character lacked a solid personality it was hard to get to know her in fact all the character's where kind of incomplete. This story was missing alot.And I was really looking forward to Iris Johansen because she has so many books on the market.I'm just not sure I will give anymore a try, at least not at full price!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fell in love with this series..........","review":"My first ever Eve Duncan series... and I fell in love. After reading this book, I absolutely had to collect ALL of her books. Iris Johansen did an amazing job with these books. Each one I have read, I've fallen in love with, and can read again and again and again. The twists, the surprises, the mysteries, the unexpected moments, I love them all... I have a habit of falling asleep while reading, but NOT with this series... I just couldn't put the book down. Read EVERYWHERE and EVERY chance I had. Can wait to finish reading her other books in the Eve Duncan saga!!! I must have every single one of them!!! :)And that Joe Quinn character, man, the kinda guy I imagine him to be, would love to meet him in person!

These books inspire me a great deal."},{"rating":"2","title":"a real page turner....","review":"i'll admit, once i found out the real plot of the novel half way through the book, i thought it was very far fetched BUT i couldn't put it down because i had to find out how they were going to get out of it. the characters are interesting and a very interesting combination. if you like this one, be sure to read the next book 'the killing game.'"},{"rating":"1","title":"Eve Duncan irritated me.","review":"This was my first book by Iris Johansen. I enjoyed the book, as I usually do when I choose a book. The plot, with it's many twists, was a little hard to foresee, but I kept in mind that it was \\"non-fiction.\\" There is no doubt we are clueless as to what really goes on behind the scenes in Washington, and this does offer a new idea, or at least to. I did enjoy the story line. Insofar as the characters go, the thought of Fiske was conceivable, as was Margaret, Sandra, etc... even Logan. My biggest problem was in regards to Eve. The more I read the more I began to doubt her character. She became irritating and unbelievable. For such a strong and educated person, her judgements and reasonings were pathetic and weak. If Ms Johansen issues a sequel. I will not read it nor recommend it. However after reading the other comments, I will purchase another Johansen novel and see......"},{"rating":"1","title":"good plot, but irritating!","review":"Nice plot twists. But the pacing was soooo sloooow! If she cut 10 percent from the book it would have flowed much better. I was ready to throw the book away because it was so slow with repetitive descriptions of \\"hurry it up lady\\" and thoroughly unlikeable characters. If there's no one to root for, what's the point?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Far-fetched","review":"I was so disappointed in this book. Johansen is a favorite author, but she went off the deep end with this one. The characters were not likeable, the plot was far-fetched, the pacing was slow and overdramatic. In short, a big \\"thumbs down\\" on this one. She needs to go back to her roots to discover her writing again. Please, do not make this one into a sequel!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A huge disappointment.","review":"Iris Johansen has jumped into the arena of ludicrous conspiracy theories with a novel that constitutes neither a thriller or romantic suspense. It's just plain nutty, going beyond the realm of credibility into something that had me exclaiming out loud in disbelief. Common sense tells one that nothing in her plot could ever happen in real life. I know it's fiction, but unless it's science fiction, I like a little dose of reality in a plot. I sure didn't get any in this book. I used to be a big fan of Ms. Johansen, but her last three books have really strained my fondness for her writing. Suffice it to say I'll be spending my money elsewhere from now on."},{"rating":"2","title":"WOW!!!","review":"This was my first book by Iris Johansen and boy was I impressed.

I agree some of the book left me hanging (why did Joe marry Diane?), but I read for entertainment. Catch my attention? she certainly does and as the plots could seem far-fetched if you really think about them and todays world they really could happen.

None of the characters are particularly compelling. I never felt a real connection between Eve and Logan or Joe. Disappointing. I won't pick up the 2nd installment of the Eve Duncan series."},{"rating":"1","title":"Couldn't even get through it.","review":"I must agree that \\"The Face of Deception\\" is riddled with incredibly contrived literary devices. My favorite such literary device, however, was the \\"chilling end-of-chapter one-liner,\\" which was so self-consciously overused as to make for great comedy. You know the type of one-liner I mean; they usually occur when the dramatic action is rolling happily along, and then the protagonist insists on thinking something short, silly, and incredibly awkward, such as (in the case of this book) \\"It was hard to equate a savior with a killer.\\" (I am paraphrasing.) Or something as trite as \\"If only they had enought time.\\" (Paraphrasing again.)In such cases, one can almost imagine a director calling out \\"Aaaaand, cut!\\" Indeed, Iris, it is difficult to equate a savior with a killer; but it also hard to equate a forced chapter ending with a believable character, and this is one of the major problems of this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"The book suffers from plonking predictablility.","review":"\\"No,\\" she said.Logan narrowed his gaze at her.Eve stiffened.Margaret left the room to take care of something.Joe stood protectively over Eve while managing to dangerously intimidate Logan.\\"Yes, you will,\\" Logan said.Eve stiffened.That about sums it up, folks."},{"rating":"2","title":"no words can describe the exitement","review":"the excitement was so overwhelming that i can't face the truth that i have finish reading it. no one will ever want to miss the experience of reading it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not so Great","review":"The storyline was interesting and likeable. However, Eve Duncan was not. She was self-centered, whiny, and annoying. Throughout the entire book I kept saying how much I disliked her. There wasn't much depth to the other characters either which made it hard to connect with them as well. It's a decent book, but would not recommend to someone who wants to feel what the characters feel and experience what they do."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Excellent Suprise - Move over Reichs and Cornwell","review":"I have finished reading Reichs' Brennan novels and Cornwell's Scarpetta novels. I was looking for another medico-forensic suspense writier. I stumbled upon Iris Johansen's Eve Duncan series. WOW. Face of Deception was SUPERB!!. This is literally a book which can be read cover to cover with no breaks. Realistic twists and turns at every chapeter. There is just the right amount of action combined with forensics combined with character development. Eve Duncan is a modern day hero; overcoming her own realistic life obstacles to become who she is, damaged but intriging and determined. A billionaire (puppet-master), a president, a couple dead presidents, a first lady or should I say first-rate manipulator (killer, skilled hitmen and Eve, a woman looking for her deceased child. Iris Johansen put all these characters together in a first rate novel. Step aside Reichs and Cornwell he comes the new leader of the pack. GREAT GREAT book."},{"rating":"2","title":"New favorite writer!!","review":"This is not your typical plot!

To compare her to Patricia Cornwell (as one reviewer did) is an insult to Patricia Cornwell. I felt like the chapters should have been titled by their intention, the lack of craft was so obvious. \\"In this chapter I'll use other characters to describe the main character.\\" Ever heard of show don't tell?

She gets worse. Her characters have lost their excitment, and I do not consider this a Romantic Suspence. I always bought everything she wrote but not anymore."},{"rating":"1","title":"Main character is too negative and one dimensional","review":"Although Iris Johanson is a good writer with an interesting storyline, she fails to make the main character very likeable. Eve Duncan is sarcastic, bitter and quite negative. I would have enjoyed the book more if Eve had shown a kind side to her personality. She is very one dimensional and this makes the story less interesting."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great information","review":"Interesting, thorough.

Certainly not bad, some tracks were very nice. Unfortunately, a good deal of them are too action-oriented for my liking, or simply boring. The best piece of music from the film, the beautifully haunting female chorus played over the spider pit scene (best part of the movie!), is sadly nowhere to be found on this disc.

Howard's score is very effective, lending just the right touches, but nothing really stands out. I was sorry to learn that one of my favorite cues in the movie isn't on the soundtrack CD, but that is such a common thing nowadays. Overall, it's another effective score from Mr. Howard."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic!","review":"This is such a fantastic score!

Please, save your money, it's not worth it at all. All it does is to quote from all 14 Fleming's amazing novels, so you would be much better off reading the original novels than reading this book.This book, by no means, will add to knowledge regarding Bond universe, so, if you want to know more about James Bond, if you are really interested in getting deeper into it, and know more about both the literary and the screen hero, buy JAMES BOND - THE LEGACY, written by Bruce Scivalli, the same one who's responsible in putting the extras on the DVDs together.

What will happen when the worldwide computer intelligence exceeds the worldwide human brainpower?While the author is probably not techno-geek enough to make the technology perfect, the suspense, the human failings, and the ultimate reality he paints raise questions that concern us all.I read this book when it first came out, and have watched the bookshelves in vain for further writing from this author.

I slogged through about four of the stories, plus just the first few pages of about three others, and then gave up and returned this to the library. All of the stories were dismally boring and pointless. They reminded me of the stuff English teachers make you read -- loads and loads of descriptive detail, but NOTHING happens. I'm sorry, call me a philistine, but I like something with a plot or at least some sort of \\"arc\\" or character development -- not reading two pages devoted to how a character puts cream and sugar in his coffee.

Jaffe's unflinching yet non-judgemental treatment of the sadistic details is both disturbing and thought provoking. The concept of a \\"Docufiction\\" is to fictionalize real events and people, often giving a clearer view into the chaotic mind of the killer than any book-length factual account could.Although Jaffe employs many different formats; dialog, monologue, talk show transcript, there is still a pronounced completeness to the book.

Well this book opens with a superb job in filling in those blanks and building the background of the characters for their ill fated journey.It was especially nice to see how a displaced captain and crew, once believed to be lost, deal with their new surroundings including aged families, new technologies, and wars resolved. Also placing their (the crewmates that is) mindset into the timeline of Jean-Luc Picard and his crew.It also built up the role of what a real Star Fleet 'Hero' is, not the typical outlandish missions Kirk or Picard carved out in history, but an older man, trying to prove himself out of sheer loyalty to his crew and uniform.The interaction of the Klingon plotlines was done exceptionally well, and was very amusing at times.A great novel wishing this was made into a tv episode!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The entertaining first voyage of the Enterprise-E","review":"Diane Carey continues her tremendous writing success in the Star Trek universe with this exciting and original novel. The story chronicles the maiden voyage of the newest Federation flagship, the U.S.S. Enterprise-E, as it proceeds under the command of not Jean-Luc Picard, but Morgan Bateson, the captain who traveled with his crew forward into the 24th century. Carey uses great detail in defining the characters of the novel, including Picard who is contemplating his future in Starfleet, and Bateson who is considering his role in an entirely different century. Plenty of action and epic space battles exist throughout the novel to complement the strong plot and characterization. With Ship of the Line, Diane Carey creates yet another worthy addition to the Star Trek universe."},{"rating":"1","title":"Diane Carey should've taken more time to write this book!","review":"The story itself was okay, with some interesting details. The events of \\"First Contact,\\" \\"Cause and Effect,\\" and the original series episodes were well told. Unfortunatlely, it juggled too many stories and had some really annoying incongruities with regard to the movies and series. First, Klingons don't live quite so long, so Bateson's enemy probably wouldn't be alive after all this time. Second, didn't anybody PROOFREAD this book!? I can understand the occasional misspelling of a big word, but \\"Alfa 177\\"!? I think if the author had taken more time to get down some of the small details and have somebody proofread her book, it would have come out much better. The story is good, it just needs to focus on one or two of the big storylines."},{"rating":"1","title":"One big dissapointment","review":"This was the first Diane Carey book I'd ever read and I was shocked.The book got absolutely nowhere, the characters were boringly portrayed and, at times, seemed to act very much out of character.The novel is filled with over-simplification, clichés and stereotypes, while it gives us the usual Klingon-animal Human-God type of message.About 85% of the book is made up by completely irrelevant and poorly paced scenes that don't contain any entertainment or artistic deapht.But it DID portray an interesting time on the TNG timeline and is maybe worth one read if you have time and can find it from a public library. But don't by it. Thats all I have to say about this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"way too much ship nostalgia","review":"The dedication to old navy ships was way too hokey.

She chooses prevocative characters, ideas and settings, and helps to fill in between the gap in the readers knowledge, before the events of Star Trek - First Contact. The problem is that she embraces too many concepts for her, relatively, short book. Her love for detail in her writing secomes to a need to shorten the text to her publishing requirements. What she actualy needed to do was to flesh out her ideas more, and add at least an extra two hundred pages to her novel. This woulds have helped stop the battles seeming rushed, the internal time-frame being evasive (just how long were the Klingons in Dishounor?), and her characterisations from being flimsy and conveniant. Perhaps she has become a little too used to writing four volume serials, or perhaps she should have done that here?"},{"rating":"1","title":"UGH!!! This book is not to be tossed lightly aside . . .","review":"but rather thrown with great force.The plot was far too boring with far too little happening in way too many pages. Carey spends way too much on minor characters not enough and not good enough time on the major characters and the plot just isn't that interesting.And let's be honest this novel simply isn't well written. The pace is completely off, character development is haphazard and bizarre, the dialogue leaves a lot to be considered and frankly the descriptions of people, places and situations are silly. None of the characters are likable - even Picard - my long time favorite - is distastefully trivial and absurd. This novel just isn't very good.

She drew together plots with Captain Bateman and his crew (from the TNG Episode \\"Cause and Effect,\\"), brought in the brand new Enterprise-E, tied in Scotty, the Gul that tortured Picard in \\"Chain of Command,\\", some previous-century Klingons, and - oh yes - a holodeck recreation of Kirk. And tribbles.The result is an alarmingly out-of-character mash of crossovers that leaves you feeling like you're reading a comedy, not a science fiction novel. The only thing that redeemed this book at all to me was the plight of Captain Bateman and his crew, stranded far ahead of their own timeline. They were interesting.

Because I saw Diane Carey as the author, I was -tobe honest- expecting a lot more. In the movie \\"First Contact\\" an at the end of \\"Generations\\" the part for Thenew ship being built was left out and D.

The Groove Coverage Mix was ok...., but the Filterheadz mix was worth skipping. It has an annoying beat and it ruins the good song we started out with.

As of now, I do not care for the Soho remix (#3) as I think it's the wrong sound for this song. The Supersonix remix (#4) starts out sounding like a Dr. Alban song, but is a bit too dreamy and never really picks up the pace. With that said, the Rudi Gouda Mono Roman Remix (#5) is the best mix of the three.

This significant imbalance is reflected both in the relative number of pages devoted to each of these subjects, and especially in the quality and quantity/depth of the suggested resources.While the book remains a valuable resource, a follow-up edition would benefit greatly from a thorough revision and expansion of the sections covering mathematics and the pure sciences (the coverage of physics is particularly weak, while the coverage of computer science/programming is absolutely abysmal).

When I first decided to homeschool, a friend let me read her copy. I knew that it was one of the few books that I wanted for my own! It is a book that I will refer to often in the future. If you are even considering homeschooling this is one of the books you should read."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best Guide for Home Schoolers","review":"I wanted to home school my kids this year and by chance found this book. I only wish I had had it a few years ago. It is probably the best book that a parent can use to home school their children. It helped me put together a curriculum based on the classical education. It definitely is a treasure and thank you to the Bauers for sharing all the information they have gleaned from their years of home schooling."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Superb Guide for Homeschooling Parents","review":"I have been homeschooling for almost 5 years now and I wish I would have read \\"The Well-Trained Mind\\" 5 years ago! It is an excellent book on how to homeschool. The authors make it so simple to understand and very clear on \\"How to do it\\". I am so looking forward to this year of homeschooling because of this book, I know it will be a much more organized, fun, and full of great books to learn from. I would encourage any parent, whether homeschooling or not, to get this book if you want to help enrich your children's lives with classical books and help them succeed acacdemically.~E.A. from ID"},{"rating":"2","title":"awesome - exhaustive","review":"This is a must have for everyone. It is like the homeschooler's Bible.I homeschooled my daughter for only one quarter, and used this along with the \\"Classical Conversations\\" syllabus & my daughter learned VOLUMES.

The book gives suggestions, study time recommendations and sources for what the authors consider the best homeschool products.

I got a copy from the library and wow! what a find! It really put the exciting but sometimes intimidating world of homeschooling into context. I really like the way the authors condense the information at the end of each section into useful bites of information. They also suggest schedules (now isn't that convenient when you're biting your nails wondering when to do what?).Although I won't call our style 100% classical homeschooling, this book does provide an excellent pathway for busy and confused moms like me. I guess the results speak for themselves -- my son who was a little perplexed by what his mom had in store for him every morning now thinks of each lesson as fun! I really owe that to this book. Can't wait to get a copy of my own."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great, motivating & informative!","review":"Not sure you want to homeschool? This is a great place to start.

I can't imagine a child being happy being taught so rigorously and will be isolated and overstressed with such intense hours of school. (A lot of public and private schools have the same problem) I don't trust the advice of teaching about all religions at such young ages. They need to be grounded in their own culture and religion first. I'd get a simpler construct of a classical education or you'll go nuts. Also, read John Taylor Gatto for guidance."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great","review":"I'm a young home schooling Mom, and I fell in love with this book immediately for it's practical advice and cheerful approach. I envision the Authors' family as people who work hard, love to learn good things, and have lots of fun too. That's what I want for my kids.I can only guess how much time and money The Well Trained Mind will save me by preventing me from buying the wrong books.

Like many of the other reviewers, I learned my multiplication and got excited about history from these songs years ago during Saturday morning cartoons. Not to mention the fact that my 11th grade History teacher let the whole class off the hook for a homework assignment when we were able to sing the Preamble of the Constitution.My two year old little girl loves to sing along and although she doesn't realize it yet, she's learning. Maybe someday when she's in High School she'll thank me for getting her Schoolhouse Rock."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun Songs + Nostalgia Value","review":"I certainly wouldn't know the preamble to the Constitution if it weren't for seeing \\"School House Rock\\" on Saturday Mornings. I guess it's a testament to these videos that I could sing it on demand, though I probably haven't heard it for 25 years. I'm sure nostalgia value is a big seller for parents who buy these. (Did anyone see the wonderful parody they did of \\"I'm Just A Bill\\" on The Simpsons? It was about adding a flag burning amendment to the Consitition: \\"They're a buch of damn hippies, and I want to defeat 'em. I want to make it legal for policemen to beat 'em. Oh I want to be a law someday!)Anyway, some people have questioned the idea of teaching something as complex as history by catchy songs. They're probably right, but that doesn't mean that these videos aren't worthwhile as far as they go. They're certainly a lot of fun!"},{"rating":"1","title":"No More Kings","review":"I don't think \\"No More Kings\\" was a very good cartoon. Even if it was directed toward little kids it still should have been more accurate. They skipped from the Pilgrims arriving in America to the colonists wanting to rebel without even mentioning the French and Indian War. They also were not very accurate at depicting the events. For instance, they showed the Boston Tea Party as people dumping tea off a dock, when they were really dressed as Indians on a boat. I understand they only have a limited amount of time, but if they depicted the events correctly they would have at least made the cartoon a little better."},{"rating":"2","title":"America does rock!","review":"I watched these mini-lessons when I was a pajama-wearing kid enjoying cartoons on Saturday morning. My favorite videos are the ones on the American Revolution and the Constitution. The videos are unashamedly patriotic and teach children to take pride in their American heritage. I recommend this video to anyone who wants their children to learn about and value their American identity."},{"rating":"2","title":"School House Rock, America Rock!","review":"Really greatly made. The singing and animations are a wonderful an effective teaching tool. In all simplicity the video was doen very nicely, and it has great appeal, I let my history teacher borrow it and she loved it. END"},{"rating":"1","title":"History rock Review","review":"\\"No More Kings,\\" the Schoolhouse rock cartoon is very insubstantial and partially incorrect. One reason for this is because there is some false information, particularly about why the pilgrims came to America, and what happened when they got there. Second, there is too big a jump in time. The cartoon goes from the pilgrims to the actual colonies, and some students may think that the colonies came right after the pilgrims. In addition to there being too big a gap of time, the cartoon needs more detail. After I read it and heard, I was asking myself why these events happened, and were there any other events. Lastly, besides having more detail about events, this cartoon needs more detail about certain people. I didn't see the names Squanto, George Washington, John Adams, mentioned anywhere. Please, do not buy this cartoon, the editors need to add information to it to make it complete and educational."},{"rating":"1","title":"No More Kings Review","review":"I read the lyrics to the cartoon, \\"No More Kings.\\" Most of the information was correct, but some wasn't. It's wonderful that your turning history into fun lyrics for children, it's just that it would be better if all the information was right. For example, there is a big time gap that confused me at first. The lyrics also say that, \\"They were missin' mother England\\" which they weren't. Another verse that was incorrect was when they said, \\"They planted corn you know.\\" It wasn't entirely wrong though. They did plant corn, just not by themselves, the Indians helped them. The line, \\"They hoped to find a better home\\" could've been more specific. It would've been better if it said that they hoped to live in the Americas because that's what they wanted. Overall, I think it could've been more accurate."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Children's Book ever","review":"My mom bought this book in 1956 for my sister and me. It remained a favorite from our childhood. I was a teacher and then a curriculum trainer and have since retired. However, I have never seen a book as excellent in content, vocabulary, and artwork as this story holds. Chee-Chee is a good little bird who helps Keeko, the little native scout. help the animals of the forest. Meany cat and his mother scare them and are mean to the other animals of the forest, but when Meany Cat falls into the river, Keeko coordinates his rescue with Father Moose. Fifty-five years later, I can remember the beautiful eyes of Mama Cat as tears well up in her eyes at the other creatures' thoughtfulness, winning her and Meany Cat over to different ways.

While the paper was for an International Economics class Veseth taught, I found many of the ideas presented in the book to be slightly different than those presented in the text we were using for the term paper. The differing viewpoints really made me think about what I was going to argue, and I feel pushed me to come with new ideas. I would recommend this book to any student of economics."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Read if over 40!","review":"After seeing all the 5 star ratings for this book, I did my best to find some redeeming value in this diatribe. I felt that I was constantly slapped in the face with the authors views that wanting to have a baby over the age of 40 was selfish and unfair to the child. I'd like to inform the narrow minded authors that at age 40 I'm a much better parent than I would ever have been in my 20's and 30's. I have just as much energy and a lot more patience! Not to mention that my parents at 65 are no where near the geriatric burdens that the authors predict for my children in the future. Parenting is challenging at any age, and to assume that someone under the age of 40 is any more prepared for the task is absurd. I want my money back!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Snarky Comments Against Older Mothers","review":"I was really looking forward to reading this book. However, I was really disappointed and disturbed by the bias that the authors have against older mothers. At times you hear a running theme about how older parents \\"will be feel out of the loop at school activities and functions\\" and how a radiologist friend snarked how these older moms are getting mammograms with young children in tow. Just who do they think egg donor recipients are? Are only younger women in their 30's the only ones who deserve to get egg donation. I thought they would be more objective."},{"rating":"1","title":"good info, bad editing","review":"This book contains some useful information but is so full of typographical and grammatical errors that I could not finish it. In some portions, there is at least one typographical, spelling, or grammatical error on every page; sometimes there are multiple errors on a single page.

Most of the tunes the band did have a hand in writing were done so with an \\"assist\\" from outside writers.

Don't artists subsist on the lifeblood of patrons, or \\"angels\\" as Reggio calls them in the interview at the end of K.?

If he wants to live, albeit a new identity, he is to be put on a seratin based experimental medicine to determine if violent people can be turned into compassionate, functional citizens, remove the evil tendencies and live a normal life.

Supported by a flawless screenplay, incredible baseball action, capable direction, and incredible performances, 61* shows what can be done with a little passion, patience, and attention to detail.The greatest theme in the film is that of the media, and how ignorant sports writers -- who have never played an inning in their lives -- could effect players' lives.Dealing with subject matter all baseball fans are familiar with, it was essential to craft a character-driven story in order to successfully exploit the most dramatic elements. In 61*, we do not see Mickey Mantle as Superman, nor do we see Maris a shy slugger from Fargo; what we do see is two strong men confronting their fears in the face of immense stress from families, fans, owners, the media, and the ghost of Babe Ruth. And they do this as ONLY Yankees could do."},{"rating":"2","title":"No Doubt the Best Baseball Movie Ever Made","review":"61* was an awesome baseball movie. It is enjoyable for everyone, not just for baseball fans. I first saw this movie when it premiered on HBO.

The only thing I know is that Mickey Mantle and Roger Maris were baseball players from a while ago, and that was it. Despite that, I LOVED this movie. It was interesting to see Maris and Mantle as best friends even though they were very different people and fans were constantly comparing one with the other (with Mantle always coming out on top). The actors who played them did excellent jobs. I could sympathize greatly with the characters. The plot was subtle but very compelling. And I'm glad to hear that Maris finally got the appreciation that was his due, even though it wasn't until after he died.

Thomas Jane as Mantle is great and shows the demons that caused Mantle to be who he was during his playing days.

I was quite young in 1961, when Mantle and Maris were contending to tie/beat Babe Ruth's record, but remember much of it. The acting in this is excellent, and Thomas Jane and Berry Pepper even look so much like Mantle and Maris. Billy Crystal did an amazing job on this movie, and his love of the game comes through loud and clear. The movie goes into what went on behind the scenes, and the courage that both men showed. Mantle was at the end of a brilliant career, and Maris was just coming into his own. Mantle fit into the New York sports scene, while Maris had different values. The struggles that both went through are caught with compassion and humor. Yes, this is a five star movie, and a must for any true baseball fan.

The patterns for practicing the techniques start with a simple garter stitch scarf and end with a fair isle child's sweater.Personally, I found the patterns to be just OK. I wish she had included more and in greater variety. The only other \\"con\\" is that some of the yarns she uses are not readily found in the US, e.g., Patons and Sirdar.

Curious why she doesn't lead the workout instead of the personal trainer. And, the music was all wrong. Too loud, overpowering the trainer's voice.

She cynically justifies and defends Hollywood's archaic and byzantine practices as if they were the result of some divine inevitability, rather than acknowledging the reality that they evolved by accident and that they serve no purpose.I agree wholeheartedly with the Reader who found her account self-serving. Obst is never wrong about anything.

As their only DVD, this doesn't offer a wide array of choices. The DVD is well laid out, and the insert seems to be a reprint of the Smell the Carcass CD. The live material is pretty interesting and actually not that bad as far as audio quality goes. I'd like to echo sentiments that the quality of the music videos was quite lacking. I'm not sure what the sources where, but it most certainly wasn't what I was expecting for quality on DVD.

The author superbly explains and documents the causes behind the on-going conflict between the Hebrews/Israelites and Moslems/Islam. The conflict has been going on for centuries, and the author provides sound references and proof for its causes using primarily only two chapters of one book of the Old Testament of the Bible. If you want to understand the conflict taking place in the Middle East (Israel) today, this book is a must read; in fact, without an understanding of this material, you cannot understand the conflict or its implications for the destiny of mankind."},{"rating":"2","title":"Chopped ice and a conversation piece","review":"Since we do not have a through the door ice dispenser with an automatic ice crusher, yet had a \\"pressing\\" need for crushed ice for our Mojitos I began a quest for a sturdy and effective ice crusher. After trying several of the plastic ones out there I found this one and am happy with it.The price was right, it looks good sitting on my bar shelf and, most importantly, it chops ice well. It is a little smaller than I expected but the hopper holds enough of my freezer's \\"half moon\\" cubes to fill a drink glass.If you are looking to crush ice for a food platter this is not your machine due to volume. It does require a bit of strength but jams are easily overcome by turning the crank in the opposite direction.One warning, the handle comes very close to the base so you do have to be careful not to catch a knuckle at the bottom of a turn."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is the DeQuincey you want","review":"If you are choosing between several editions of the -Opium Eater-, this one is the one you want.True, it does not have Alethea Hayter's introduction, like the Penguin edition has; that being a point in that one's favour. But here you -also- get the entire -Suspiria de Profundis-, which is in many ways more beautiful and interesting than the Opium Eater itself. -Levana and Our Ladies of Sorrow- must surely be the single greatest prose poem ever written in English.The -Suspiria- was intended as a sequel to the -Opium Eater-, and those who enjoy the one will want them both."},{"rating":"1","title":"very disappointing","review":"This was ordered as a Verbatim HP C4096A toner for an HP LaserJet printer.I just took it out last week, as I needed it.

But it spewed toner all over the inside of the printer, each page had streaks and printing from the document before.

Who possibly could believe Mickey Rourke as a tyrannical Greek king with a New York accent? It has only a vague and distant relationship to any actual Greek mythology, which is primarily used as a containing vehicle (with plenty of deformation of the original Greek legends) for as much bloodshed and non-stop graphic violence as they could squeeze into the movie. Probably the worst movie I've seen in the last five years. About the only positive things you can say about this movie is that the sets are sometimes quite visually spectacular, and the actress who plays the Oracle is genuinely hypnotic. Otherwise, the movie is absolute trash."},{"rating":"1","title":"kepp the volume down","review":"So will the film studio paid for speakers and amps damaged by some of the worst sub sonic noise heard in some time.

It seems way too stagey and costumey, and like the actors are obviously acting, and not very well, either.They way the \\"important\\" characters make big speeches every five minutes threatening someone with castration or whatever, trying to sound all deeply ominous and epic, it's just laughable.Lame movie, overall. If you're looking for something like Kingdom of Heaven or Braveheart or the recent Robin Hood, this movie is all wrong.It's \\"serious\\" but only in the way it takes itself WAY too seriously, and not because it's any good, or has any kind of non stupid story."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretty with nothing else","review":"Just boring.

It bears only a passing resemblence to any mythology I have ever read, and that passing resemblence is only because it uses some of the \\"gods\\" names and characters.

This aint it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boooooooooo","review":"This movie is just a bunch of fight scenes that try to look like 300, loosely tied together by a flimsy plot.

The story line had ups and downs. Some parts were pretty good while some parts left me thinking \\".......what?\\"Like everyone else said they combined the elements of a lot of other movies and jumbled them all together so much that I really didn't know what to think.Some of the fight scenes are pretty impressive but the actor roles could have been so much better. I know it's a movie but I can't imagine anyone using actors in their late 20s-early 30s to portray the gods, especially Zeus and Poseidon. Also along the \\"I know it's a movie but\\" lines. Making the titans look like human sized parkour practitioners fell very short of what I would like to see."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too much talking, and weird over acted action -_-","review":"dont buy it like i did ESpecially on 3D! not worth the money but worth renting it and that is all.

It is supposed to re-create the myth of Theseus, with Gods, the Minotaur, the magic bow, and the seeds of Athens. There is absolutely nothing interesting or original about it, just a spectacle that could have come off a production line.I was disappointed because I am always on the lookout for a good mythic film because my kids enjoy them. There is nothing about this to recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"noting close to 300","review":"The storyline was too simple, no surprises and not engrossing. The fight scenes were too short and did not show any real heroism. U just didnt fall in love with Thesaeus, although Cavil's acting was pretty good. There should have beeen more scenes to showcase the power of the bow. The gods are too weak, they got their butt kicked by the titans and have to run in the end. 300 with Gerard butler screaming \\" THIS IS SPARTA\\" still reigns as the one with the better plot. picture and action. Rent this movie to watch but dont buy it..."},{"rating":"1","title":"weak","review":"This movie reminds me of someone growing up on 300, Troy and Braveheart.

I was looking for an action flix to kick back with, this movie didn't make the cut."},{"rating":"1","title":"Immortality --- Soooo Boring","review":"After looking forward to this movie for some time I was really disappointed after watching. Nothing held my interest and there was so little fantasy in this fantasy it just crawled. And who decided Mickey Rourke should lead this film? As he claws his way through it in some of the most horrid costume design I've ever seen you want to run screaming from the TV.It seems the writers were given free run on rewriting mythology but then no one took advantage of it to make a decent film. You end up asking whose mythology is this? Why are the Titans stuck in a mountain? Why do the gods look like kids on their way to playschool? If they're immortal why are they dying in the end? Just one big IMMORTAL MISTAKE!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I was dazzled by the trailer for this movie and rushed out to buy it with the highest of expectations. Bottom line-if you've seen the trailer, you've seen the best that this movie has to offer. Good acting, pretty impressive visual feel (similarities with 300), but lacks a compelling storyline, little suspense. (Spoiler warning) I loved the scences in the trailer with Theseus using that awesome bow, unfortunately, he hardly uses it in the movie and doesn't even have it in his possession very long. There's not actually that much fighting, the choreography is quite similar to 300 and not nearly as impressive the second time around. Some excessive brutality, creulty that I didn't like-elicited a shock effect, but didn't really add any value to the story."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Potential","review":"I gave this movie 2 stars because, to my opinion, it had great potential, but again, the movie never took off. The story was pretty bland and the rendition of Olympus pretty scanty. I found the new version of Clash of the Titans, to be a much better movie for story line and effects. Think twice before purchasing. Watch it first and if you think it is worth a place in your movie library, then by all means, go ahead and buy it. I was glad, I bought a used cheaper copy. BTW, the film was way too dark. I do not enjoy darker colors. It is not the first time that films are to my opinion, ruined because of lack of proper color and light."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible, just terrible","review":"It has been a little while; well since \\"Priest\\" came out that I have written such a bad review. This movie was a complete waste of time and money, not only on my part; but on the parts of everyone who \\"acted\\" in it or had anything to do with its production. The characters were not sincere and I really think high school drama students could have done better. The whole thing seems to practically take place on the edge of a cliff in one part of the world or another, the costumes are silly, the Gods are always whining about something, and the special effects look like late 90s C G I. I couldn't even finish this whole movie, I shut it off with 15 minutes left to go; that's how bad it really was, I could not bring my self to sit there for 15 more minutes and spent the rest of the day wondering why I had watched the bulk of this thing in the first place."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save Your Money - Don't Bother","review":"You are not missing anything if you do not purchase or download this movie.

It was exactly what I expected, that is, only the last few minutes was actually worth watching. It was not as good as 300, but lets face it, 300 wasn't that good anyways. It pretty much starts out with a lame God-type-of-story, and everyone was preparing for some large scale battle. There are plenty of blood, not much sex, not enough action, and the storyline was just a fill-in, kinda like a video game. The action was great. The scenery was great, although probably not realistic. You can tell there's a lot of GCI that went into making this movie. That said, I think it is still worth watching at least once if you like action movies.

I can't remember ever being this bored in a movie in my entire life. 2 hours of lackluster story and action where choreographed men were jabbing each other with cheap sticks just to see 15 minutes of stunning visual effects and fighting.Not worth it. Don't buy this movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wow, now that was a bad movie","review":"I have to admit it has been a long time since I wasted 110 minutes of my life. It wasn't enough to have a plot that bounced around like a lottery ball, the bad acting, predictable story line, and really poor 3D effects topped it off.

Most of the scenes looked fake and unimpressive. The costume was too funny! I laughed a few times at the God's costume. It looked like they were going to some kind of holloween party LOL! Videophiles will hate this movie because of the bad black level, and I'm watching this on a calibrated display. I've watched countless movies and this is the only movie I had to adjust my screen's brightness. The scenes were way too dark . It looks like it was made in a cheap studio. Overall I give it a one star for terrible picture quality and bad storyline."},{"rating":"1","title":"Skip It.","review":"Bland as can be. Atrocious story build-up. The gods looked right out of 90210, no thrones, no gold, these guys were slumming it. Why in the hell is there an American (the guy from Blade) in this Greek myth?

Even the sad remake of Clash of the Titams was much better. I feel like I wasted two hours and four dollars for nothing. My time would have been better spent watching tv reruns on Amazon Prime than waiting for something redeeming to happen in this movie. If you want to see this, wait for it hit Amazon Prime or better yet, regular tv. You won't miss anything by waiting."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad","review":"Complete waste of $4 and an hour and a half of my time. Completely lacked a storyline, a greek mythology movie yet leading actress is Indian, you can go on and on about whats wrong with this movie. This movie was nothing like 300, which is a great movie, other then similar cgi fight scenes."},{"rating":"1","title":"May the Gods please smite this film","review":"I actually gave the film one star because the major fight scene near the end did involve some entertaining CGI. However, as for the rest of the film I would warn you to not waste your money. The movie seems to be pointless dribble spaced between several fight scenes. There is no building and expanding of the plot so the viewer is left feeling cold and basically non-invested in the films progress. The characters never develop and remain so one dimensional that if they were to turn sideways one would not be able to see them. in essence it was a gathering of uninteresting characters that lacked any significant background information, a jumpy story line and a few fight sequences of which I only found one actually worth really watching. If you have some money to throw away I would suggest that you find a homeless person to give it to rather than wasting it on this failed attempt at entertainment."},{"rating":"1","title":"This one will definitely clash with your wallet!","review":"This has to be almost as bad as \\"Clash of the Titans\\". A real snooze fest especially in the middle. You can tell that everything is fake. The only reason to watch this movie is for the hunky guys.

What were they thinking?!","review":"I could not even finish watching this sorry excuse for a movie that is supposed to be about Theseus. Theseus is my 3rd favorite greek hero and they ruined his entire image with this pitiful movie. The movie makes no sense. They say the are going to go somewhere and then BOOM! they r there. There is NO journey and the jump from scene to scene with no explanation. The Gods are horribly portrayed and the acting is weak. A slap in the face to mythology. Lastly, they give no background on anybody so you have absolutely NOOO emotional attachment to a single character.This movie is complete and total garbage."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a film you will remember","review":"This is another 300ish film only this time with the theme of greek myths, over the top acting, CGI to the 3rd power, and the been there done that feeling of every movie like this. The movie is cheesy mostly and delivers plenty of action but no story to drawn you into it hardly. It's more like watching cartoon violence, it shallow and over the top but you don't expect much from it because it's a cartoon. That is pretty much what this movie is. Oh well, it gave me something to do. Also it's too long."},{"rating":"1","title":"waste my money","review":"waste my $3.99. And i didnt like this movie at all. This director really needs to do some research on Greece Gods.

Honestly, if you want a movie about the Greek Gods, watch Wrath of the Titans as it's story is a bit more engaging. It also has much better actors and the fight scenes and settings themselves are much better.Do yourself a favor and watch this for free elsewhere, preferably while you're doing something else."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your time","review":"What a disappointment and waste of money. This movie was terrible, the previews literally showed the best part of the film.

Avoid this movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"God, awful movie.","review":"This movie really sucked. With such a cool title like \\"Immortals\\", how could the movie be bad?Well, for starters, the movie borrowed the names of Greek legends like Zeus, Athena, Theseus, Poseidon, but lost most (if not all) of the traditional Greek mythology that goes with the names. Namely, the movie makers took these famous names and made up their own stories completely, trying to give the movie modern appeal. What came out was a movie that kind of made sense but didn't have much meaning or depth. The battle scenes weren't interesting or intense. The story didn't draw me in. I felt no emotional connection/sympathy/empathy with the characters. Overall, it was a disappointment and predictably boring. The ending was a little confusing.While I was able to sit through and watch the whole movie, it was really lacking. I thought because it was made by the producers of 300 that the movie would have some interesting points...but overall it was a drag.

I would not have minded some of the violence if the plot or acting was any good. I find it sad that these roles are the only thing Mickey Rourke seems to get. My husband and I found it so boring that we shut it off halfway through. There have only been a few movies that we have shut off and not given a chance. We were really disappointed.

It has the same poor quality as \\"Murder in 3 Acts\\" and \\"Pearl Harbor\\" (the first and second, respectively, worst movies ever made): not only is it egregiously violent, its pretence to portraying any valid mythology is mythical itself. In the movie, I saw props and costumes more suited for ancient Rome than ancient Greece: did the director even ever open a PRIMER of ancient history???. Nor could I trace even one single incident to honest Greek mythology. The entire raison d'etre of the movie seems to be brutality, blood and violence--history and true Greek mythology be damned. I wouldn't let my dog watch this almost-worst of films."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty good flick","review":"I'd seen it before on DVD so I ordered a used copy of it in Bluray on Amazon. The disc was in perfect shape and the box showed minimal wear. There was definately quality for the buck with this purchase.

The only reason I gave it 4 instead of 5 stars is because I reserve 5 stars for movies like LOTR's (extended version) and complete (but good) computer generated movies like \\"Wall-e\\", \\"Kaena\\" and \\"Up\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not sure..","review":"I'm actually not even sure why this is on here.

It was a good movie (Action, Special effects and good story line). It's hard to say if you should 'own' or 'rent' it. I do 'own' it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disturbing and gory, but isn't that what ancient Greece was?","review":"I had really high hopes for this movie, yet i'm glad i didn't dump $30 to see this in IMAX, the movie is too disturbing, even for me... The only plus was the visual effects, which after seeing the movie at home in glorious FULL 3D was the finest display of HD digi-motion special effects i have ever seen. Really... If ur stomach can handle the gruesome violence, disturbing torture and suffering, then this film may interest u. Yet if u like the beauty and splendor that was also part of the Mediterranean ancient world, u may want to stay away from this one.Overall, \\"Immortals\\" left a bad taste in my mouth and i wouldn't buy it again..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not good","review":"I am a lover of all things mythological. I go into these types of movies not expecting Citizen Kane but a good \\"popcorn\\" flick.This movie was bad. The story was disjointed, the characters on dimensional, the fight scenes conventional. I could not wait for the movie to end.The story had potential but it was an epic swing and miss."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dark...","review":"Maybe we'd have enjoyed this movie more, if we actually could have seen more of it. As it was, our dvd was too dark to see even half of the movie on our big-screen tv. Was it like this for other people? Why waste time making a movie that cannot be viewed worth a damn?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"I wanted it to be good, but it isn't. This film is boring and the costumes look like they're from a Las Vegas show.

I regret seeing this!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Not a great film, but definitely watchable","review":"As long as you know what to expect, you'll be entertained by this movie. Read the reviews and decide if you want to see it is my advice. The movie is in line with my expectations, so I was very satisfied. 4 stars from me."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"Immortals\\"","review":"I recently watched this film and found the title misleading. Although the name of the movie is \\"Immortals\\", it is mostly about mortals. There is only about 3 minutes worth of immortal content in this film. The rest of the movie deals with the shame of being born a bastard."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful","review":"This movie was really terrible. I have to admit, I didn't exactly have high hopes, but the first scenes with the Delphic Oracle, especially when they were actually speaking Greek, raised my hopes, only to have them dashed when the myth of Theseus was completely slaughtered. Granted I am a Classics graduate student, and didn't really expect any kind of actual adherence to the mythology, but I expected it would at least be visually and narratively interesting to make up for that. But no. Again. Awful."},{"rating":"1","title":"Garbage movie, annoying ads","review":"This movie was pretty poor. Worse, Fox Sports has decided to overlay a delayed ad over their MLB page for this amazon page. Every time I try to click on a link I get sent here instead, then have to go back to the fox page, close the ad, and then click on the link I really wanted to read. I guess such a boring movie really needs to force people over to Amazon to have any hope of selling its blu rays, eh?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst adaptation of Greek mythology","review":"This is even worse than the Percy Jackson movie adaptation.The originalClash of the Titans (Keep Case Packaging)was the best adaptation of the Greek mythology.The worst is this movie.The director attempts to infuse a300to a mythological sense and fails utterly.First of all in mythology, Zeus is a bearded guy and older. Poseidon is bearded guy and with a trident. And Titans are imprisoned in Tartarus as bits and pieces. (Like Percy Jackson books).Iam giving it one star because the special effects are good."},{"rating":"1","title":"horribly abusive movie.","review":"I made the HUGE mistake of going to see this movie in the theater.

It seems to be a love-hate kind of flick for most. Enjoy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Action","review":"I enjoyed the splash of the Greek mythology injected with a lot of fight scenes.. Watched it twice in 2 days don't do that often.. It's worth it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing can save a movie if the story is bad","review":"Visually, it is very good. The colors are brilliant. The special effects are very good. If you do see it make sure it is blu-ray.The acting overall was quite good, I thought. I did like the acting of King Hyperion.What let it down for me was the story which I thought was terrible.So I would not see it again nor recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of time and money","review":"Terrible movie with about 5 minutes of good action and dialog. Much of the cinematography was dark and hard to see. Don't waste your money like I did!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Read THE KING MUST DIE and THE BULL FROM THE SEA instead!","review":"Basically this movie sucks! Henry Cavill is, as always, awesome. He makes an excellent Theseus, looks fabulous shirtless and can act. Micky O'Rouke is wonderful, impressively evil and scary. Luke Evans is good as Zeus. And the visuals, colors, composition, are excellent. But the story and dialogue are ridiculous. Why did they used the names of Theseus, Phaedra, etc., when those characters have over 2,000 years of their own powerful, meaningful legends, mythologies, books, poems, movies? And Steven Dorf, second billing, was out of place and looked bad next to the godlike Cavill, Theseus."},{"rating":"1","title":"Murky lighting prevents viewing","review":"This film is almost impossible to watch on Amazon Instant Video. The screen is so dark you cannot see the actors in more than half the scenes. I've heard that movies shot in 3D are dark and dingy, but this is ridiculous."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tedious assault on history","review":"The movie begins with a great deal of excitement and a sense of some ancient parable of forboding.Yet it then disintegrates into a series of gratuitous violent scenes. Mickey Rourke is good for that kindof action. Freida Pinto (of Slum Dog Millionaire fame) is a welcomed addition to the cast but not even she can save this script for scene after scene of murder and mayhem. A good film for an after-football game when you team lost. A good way to vent!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Crash of the tight ones","review":"Looks beautiful, but ridiculous dialogue and inane story. If you like greek mythology -- stay away. Names borrowed, but story has nothing to do with Theseus. Editing is a jumble of action sequences -- hard to discern who is doing what to whom. But it does indeed look gorgeous."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overrated","review":"If you want to see fighting by all means watch this move. The story line, which somewhat exists, is ok but holds little depth. If you are expecting a movie that has an on going plot this is not it. The storyline wasn't made to evolve you but just tells you what is going on."},{"rating":"1","title":"Someone who bought this thinking it would be like 300","review":"Not worth the money people! it wasn't the greatest storyline i've seen. The battle sequences were okay but not great. If you're gonna buy this film wait till the price goes to at least $10, that's honestly how low i value this film. I made the mistake of buying it without watching in theaters. Don't make the same mistake."},{"rating":"1","title":"movie is not immortal","review":"Let me start by saying the C.G.I. was great and the scenery they created was awesome, and the colors were outstanding. That being said the rest of the aspects of the movie were weak. The storyline was good, but presented poorly. The acting,except for Mickey Rourke as the evil king, was only passable. And come on!!!!!! Do we really need that much blood guts and gore to tell a story. I think Tarsem Singh did the movie a disservice by going over the top on the GORE. I would have rated the movie higher if the violence was left in with a lot less blood and guts."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ungodly","review":"I was not impressed by this movie. Yet another 300-type attempt with a little Clash of the Titans, but it just didn't excite or intrigue me. The effects were very good, but nowadays effects are mostly good all the time, so I'm no longer in unbelieving awe. I still love great effects in movies, don't get me wrong, but it's the norm now. Now I need good acting and story and characters. This seemed to be made just to show off extreme violence with gods and titans. That's it. At the end I felt nothing. In my favorite movies I'm looking for something profound to remember and talk about, and a reason to come back. Did not get it here. These movies that have tried to imitate 300's effects method still fall short of that movie. However, I did like Henry Cavill and Mickey Rourke's performances. This Zeus pissed me off though."},{"rating":"1","title":"Average Film","review":"A bit slow and the plot wasn't very interesting. Whenever the gods appeared it was more exciting; however, those moments were very very few and far between.The movie lacks any real emotion and comes across as your average film with lazy writing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just Awful!!!!!!","review":"I wish I had paid attention to the other reviews.... this was one of the worst movies I have EVER seen!!!

Don't Waste Your Time or Money","review":"Probably the worst story line for a movie in recent memory. The movie had some much potential but it failed so miserably I wouldn't watch it again even for free."},{"rating":"1","title":"Same Old Greek Hero Tale","review":"Same old Greek hero searches for magical \\"whatever\\" with help of the gods and while fighting an evil personage, also in search of the same magical \\"whatever\\", has been told in film for countless decades. Unfortunately the only thing that rescues this amongst the previous 100 identical renditions is that the CGI was a bit better than any of it's look-a-likes made but only prior to the '60s. Now that I think about it the green screen sets also looked cheap. Acting and dialogue were Saturday morning cartoon boring. Action scenes of a couple of sword and spear fights were as creative as mass produced store bought cookies - bland."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is not fair to the Greek Mythology","review":"This is my 1st review ever. Being a long time a lover of Greek Mythology, after all I was born and raised in Greece, and having watched Troy and 300 which I would have rated 3.0 each, this is probably the worst attempt to capture a very significant tale. They took a few scripts and made it as boring as possible. It offends us as a nation to deal with manic depressive tendencies by the producers, completely irrelevant to amazing scripts, bringing and promoting such an atrocity as the Immortals.Thank you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretty, but dumb. Pretty dumb.","review":"What an incredible let down!The shiny special effects glimmered and shimmered - but any semblance of a good story was totally missing. This was a movie I watched while travelling. I think staring at the back of the seat in front of me would have had more plot."},{"rating":"1","title":"WORST MOVIE I HAVE EVER SEEN","review":"This movie got to be the worst movie about Greek Mythology Heroes. Wow, such a piece of trash. I don't understand how people can give this movie more than two stars on the reviews. Nothing in this movie can compare to other movies like: 300 or Clash of the Titans. Bad story, bad castings, bad lighting... I regret to rent this movie from the REDBOX."},{"rating":"1","title":"Could have been much better","review":"I liked this move only slightly better when it was called Clash of the Titans. This was simply not good. It had poor story telling, bad editing and weak action. Not much going for it at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Predictable and Putrid","review":"Watch the first 10 minutes and you know the rest. It's utterly canned, copied, shallow, and formulaic: a brutal, insulting, jingoistic hero-beats-villain-and-gets-girl gorefest with indecipherable dialogue, improbable fight scenes, gaping plot gaps, and lousy lighting (worse than Meek's Cutoff, and that's saying something) that makes numerous scenes unwatchable. Even the casting is distractingly bad. Even the love scene is botched. This one is a true rotter. However, the DVD is quite smooth and round and might be useful for skipping on water."},{"rating":"1","title":"No plot, doesnt make any sense,terrible movie overall","review":"Was not expecting a great movie, just a simple action movie. Even though I knew the movie was bad based on the reviews I've read before watching the movie, I could not imagine it was going to be so bad. Terrible movie overall.Do not get fooled by the trailer of the movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is a 4 Beer Movie","review":"You need to drink at least 4 beers for this movie to be entertaining.

The movie was edited so dark that I never really knew what was going on -- I basically had to listen to the movie to try and get some grip on the storyline. It literally was not a viewable movie.Speaking of storyline, where was it? There were so many loose-ends, no character progression, and what little of either was scattered across the movie had no logical foreshadowing or climax to begin with. I'm a pretty big history buff, I know the story of Theseus and while I won't compare anything to the original myths - If you don't know the story, you probably won't understand WTF is going on. At All."},{"rating":"2","title":"No glitches!","review":"For action and adventure this movie has some great scenes and it will keep you glued to the screen! recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Superb Special Effects!!","review":"This was a really great movie with wonderful special effects!!!

I could not have been more bored with this trite attempt at re-duxing a new 300. It was trying to be way too \\"artsy\\" in the graphics department without a fully developed and intelligible script.

This movie took a wrong turn from the moment the narrator begins speaking. The storyline is unclear about what the Titans were doing in this. Its always about the Titans being the secret to everything, but these Titans were just something new and stupid. There isn't much character development and even fight scenes were pathetic. At one point the soldiers are smiling when Thesis is giving a horrible, typical speech about going to face the stronger enemy. This was as bad as bolly-woods attempts on war movies.

You get the feeling that whoever wrote the script knew absolutely nothing about the story they were trying to tell. Just making it up as they went along. This is just another in a line of movies lately , 300, Clash of the titans, and Avatar that take a great story and butcher it. The trend today in movies seems to be all mindless action and visuals. but little story. When all someone can say about a movie is that it \\"looks good\\", then it's a movie to avoid. I suppose it has appeal to those who aren't very discriminating in their tastes. But anyone who wants a movie that's deeper than a piece of paper should avoid it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A well done fantasy movie...","review":"Key word here people is fantasy, some people get angry it doesn't follow so closely with Greek mythology as we know it, or that some cinematic scenes mimic 300.

And the prospect of looking at Henry Cavill for two hours seemed like a nice Sunday afternoon indulgence. But, oooh, Stinky McStinkerson. All the chiseled yumminess in the world couldn't save this thing from itself. The storyline and script felt like a random paste-up from the bottom of someone's hamster cage (a purpose for which the copy was infinitely better suited). Even if the story was a little more coherent, it would be impossible to tell with the horrible sound editing. Between the ridiculous masks and some digitally forced stage depth, big chunks of dialogue seemed to be lodged in the rock walls. What a mess."},{"rating":"1","title":"Zero stars","review":"This, unfortunately, is a complete and utter waste of time.

He had wanted to make the 300 film but Zach Snyder beat him to it. They are apparently friends, so no big whoop: Tarsem made The Fall instead, an incredible film. This time he works with a straightforward narrative: Theseus wants to kill Hyperion. Great set pieces move things along briskly, culminating in an epic battle at Mt Tartarus. Not between Theseus and Hyperion, though that is well done too. The battle between Olympians (the eponymous immortals) and Titans has to be seen. The things Zeus can do with a chain got me up off my theater seat cheering like I was at the super bowl -and I hate football.

Proceeding through the stories of three generations of women, details of life ranging from chewing caribou skins to soften them to broken ski-doos (snowmobiles) and unexpectedly melting ice emerge. This is a unique multi-generational portrait of the last century of Inuit life. A quick-read, this is highly recommended!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Pull your head back, hold your hands high, shake your body!","review":"I was fortunate enough to catch Saxon's U.S. Unleash the Beast tour in March 1998. It was seven hours' round-trip in the car, but absolutely worth it.Saxon was never nearly as big in the United States as they were in Great Britain. You'll get 30 seconds into the 2001 W:O:A concert and wonder why. No one does straight-ahead heavy metal better than these guys. Plenty beyond the concert to delve into, as well--videos, interviews, a well-done booklet, and even some home movies.This is a true fan's package, marvelously and lovingly done. My highest recommendation!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Definately worth the wait","review":"I've been waiting for a Saxon set with some of the newer songs for years now, and I am thankful to finally have it. The set list is a couple songs short, but still impressive none the less. Bottom line is Saxon deserves to be held in the same respect as PRIEST, AC/DC, MAIDEN, OZZY, as well as the other power house hard rock/metal bands that are much more popular. It's a shame these guys haven't received the same following. I definately look forward to any new Saxon material, they rock like it should be rocked! With all that said. Biff sounds great, he's still breaking Mic's with his voice. Guitars, Quinn and Scarratt are on point, their sound is perfect, chops are huge, riffs thunderous. Nibbs on bass, he's all over the place and doesn't miss a thing. Fritz Randow on the drums, you gotta be kidding me, where did this guy come from? Very Heavy, Very impressive! Buy it now and enjoy!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Tight, Professional, Well Filmed, Well Recorded, Well Performed","review":"God, how I wish all metal concert DVD's were filmed like this. Bravo to the cameramen and soundmen. I'm envious of the people who attended this concert - and that's how a concert DVD should leave you - wishing you'd been there. This was a lot of fun to watch. I was physically shaking my fist in the air and chanting along with the crowd. The interaction with the crowd was great and shows one of the reasons why Saxon has such a loyal fan base. They love and respect their fans. Thanks, Saxon, for this DVD! America was infinitely stupid for not embracing you way back when. We lost out on some awesome concerts. This DVD proves that."},{"rating":"1","title":"Whats on the DVD","review":"Tell me what is on the damned DVD. Tell me what is on the DVD, since the idiots selling the DVD can not be bothered to posted that relevant information. Might help sales do you think. Is this the videos? If so what songs? Is this a concert? If so what year? What tour? What songs. I dont care that you saw them in 1982, or that you lost your virginity to Wheels of Steel, or that you think they look old. Or you think they rock. Who cares, I sure dont. Tell me what is on the damned DVD."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT the real thing!","review":"Saxon is 2 bands now. The Biff Byford and Paul Quinn led version on the DVD and the Graham Oliver and Steve Dawson led version. Buy \\"Rock has Landed\\" DVD by Oliver/Dawson Saxon it is a better representation of the band as they were during the NWOBHM. Graham Oliver and Steve Dawson were the founders (not Biff Or Paul). The band was called SOB in the beginning. That band also had Haydn Conway on guitar. The band changed to Saxon later. Haydn Conway is in the O/D Saxon version too. Steve Dawson wrote the majority of the classic material and Saxon suffered when he left. He did not like the direction the band was going. Saxon Chronicles is horrible sounding and just a shadow of what Saxon once was. Ideally a classic show with Biff Byford,Paul Quinn,Graham Oliver and Steve Dawson needs to come out. For now between the 2 versions, skip this and BUY \\"Rock has landed\\" that's how these songs were meant to sound!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Very poor","review":"This book is mainly useless. If you want to know how each piece of the MS server 2000 works, just look at the help files. This book simply repeats that. It does NOT tell you how the pieces work together. For example, if you wanted to set up a DNS server and Web server that work together on the same computer(as is a common task for a lot of people) this book fails. Most books are like this one. BOTTOM LINE - They tell you how to install a piece of the os along with a vague descrition of that piece and move on to the next topic.

The other three, in comparison, are frankly boring, so it might be worth your money to buy the Oresteia separately. But if you are curious about Aeschylus, or interested in Greek tragedy, then this book gives you all seven plays, and has introductions to each which explain the historical context and the content.

It's the same thing we all did as a kid, packed our bag for some reason and got no further than the end of our driveway. I am SUPER careful about the books that we read and definitely reject books that we find have objectionable content and/or discussing something further - like why a princess should not kiss a boy she does not know (as so many do in lots of well loved books!!).

I feel that not only are parents sometimes busy but honestly kids need to learn that they can't get whatever they want whenever they want it, even if what they want is as simple as a hug. Sure we shouldn't pass up on those opportunities to cuddle our children but letting them wait a little bit until we finish whatever we are working on is not only acceptable but sometimes even good for the kids. Instant gratification is not the best way to raise kids. That said, this is a beautiful book that shows a mothers love for her child even if she can't cuddle him immediately. Plus it is perfect for launching in to a discussion about why Claude was silly to think that his mother didn't love him and also talking about techniques for keeping busy until mommy or daddy are available to play or cuddle or whatever.

While its lessons are geared for beginners, and the step by step approach to sentence building was good, the lack of translation into Roman characters makes it nearly incomprehensible unless you've had exposure to Persian characters. Even after I started understanding the characters, the printing in this book is so small that you practically need a magnifying class to be able to understand what you're seeing. This is not a good stand-alone book if you want to learn Persian."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful","review":"This movie was boring and VERY slow moving, the plot was terrible and the acting stunk. It was of low budget homemade quality. The camera was shakey, the lighting was anything but good, and we went 45 minutes into the movie without one single kill. It's the kind of movie where the voices are low, then the music and bass are REALLY loud. I HATE THAT!!! The gore factor was non existent and the scare wasn't there. I'd say avoid this one at all cost!"},{"rating":"1","title":"More a suspense flick than horror","review":"This movie has mediocre acting and at times boring script. It relies more on the was it's filmed for the \\"scareyness\\" than on effects and gore. I will say I do like how it was filmed where it made you feel at times you were right in the house with the characters. When the killing begins, the movie moves fast and ends quick.

However, I should have listened more to the other reviewers who said the instruction is bad... it isn't just bad, it doesn't exist!!! I think the dance sequences would be fairly easy, IF they were broken down better, and there were some simple instructions as you're going along! But there really aren't, and it's hard to get a good workout when you're spending the whole time trying to figure out what the dancers on screen are doing.

Boring.*The \\"instructor\\" has the personality of a limp dishrag and honestly, if I heard her say \\"I wanna see your personality in this girls!\\" one more time... I woulda broke my TV.*It's way too difficult to follow unless you are an aerobics maven. I'm only slightly over weight compared to some of my friends (147 lbs at 5 ft 4 in) and I could barely get into some of the steps before Ms. Galardi was spritely bouncing into something else.

Boy was I wrong! It was so frustrating trying to follow the steps! They do not show the steps to you slowly first, and go way too fast into the routine for me to figure it out and continue on. The only one I could do was the ballet. At least that was slow enough to see what they were doing. I tried it twice and gave it to my 17 year old twin daughters. They had a good laugh, got their feet all tangled up and gave it back! No thanks! I was so disappointed. It is a good idea from Prevention magazine, but not for me!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible!","review":"I hated this dvd! The moves are very complicated and she doesn't give much instruction.

This is definitely not what I was looking for."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Dance Workout","review":"I love this workout. I have two other dance aerobic workouts and this one is becoming my favorite. What I like is that you get to do several types of dance routines, hiphop, latin, jazz, and ballet. I am 51 years old and have no problem keeping up with these gals (however, I have been working out and exercising for many years). Give yourself a few times through the dances before expecting to know the routines, but then you will find them fun and a nice workout and you will be amazed at how nice your body shapes up from dancing. If you don't have time to do the whole routine you can always just choose a dance or two. I like to do them just for fun and get rid of stress of the day."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for those who are inexperienced","review":"This has to be one of the worse exercise dance video i have seen in a long time. The instructor does not teach the steps or the routines very well and the fast pace of the video benefits no one except those who are very experienced dancers. the camera is constantly moving around and doesn't focus to well on the movement of the instructors and dancers feet. I have been a dancer for over 6 years and i found this video very confusing to follow and was very frustrated by the way the steps were explained quickly! This video should not be used by anyone who is not very familar with dance or who is a novice.

I have also never sweated so much in my life, mostly from a rise in my blood pressure from anger and frustration! I am in relatively good shape; I walk up to 3 miles a day and wanted this to break the routine. In only broke my spirits!Unless you are an accomplished club hopper or a trained hoofer, STAY AWAY!

She invited me to do it with her. I have a background in dance and so it was a shock to me when certain aspect of proper alignment and placement were never stressed in this video. I even told me friend not to do one of the stretches at the end, because she could hurt her knees. Incorrect technique and alignment can be very dangerous and if repeated day after day can lead to overuse injuries. The moves were not broken down enough and I only picked them up because I am already familiar with them. The music was so subtle that it was really hard to dance to it. I was not a big fan of the choreography.If you are new to dance, I would suggest starting with another video. I don't know what video to recommend because I generally don't use videos to work out. If you aren't new to dance then this video might be less than desirable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very discouraged--anyone want to trade??","review":"After using other Prevention Fitness System dvds (from the library), I thought I would purchase a cardio/dance selection. Not enough information on the liner notes to let you know that this is not for beginners in terms of following the instructor and learning the steps. I have taken classes and never had a problem keeping up and learning the steps; she goes too fast, does not pay attention to the music and adds-on too quickly. I skipped through to each type of dance hoping I just couldn't get the last one, but found the next one just as frusting. I may just go back to taking tapes out of the library to be certain before purchasing. Wish I could return it for exchange to another fitness dvd."},{"rating":"1","title":"I hate this DVD.","review":"My mother had bought me this as a gift. I was excited because I LOVE dancing. I was excited to put it in and do it, but when I had pressed play,it was SO hard for me to follow because it was SO fast. She didn't explain the moves that well, she just went RIGHT into it. It's fast, I barely was able to keep up let alone do the move. You need SO much space, and she is so annoying by adding \\"personality\\" in almost every sentence. This is definitely not something I'm into. the ONLY one I like is the Ballet one because 1: Slower! 2: She's great at explaining that one instead of all the others! 3: It's way less-harsher on the knees.My knees were killing me, and not in the \\"sore\\" way, in the \\"I think I popped something\\" way. It hurt So bad!Not worth it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as good as I had hoped.","review":"I bought this dvd with high hopes that it would be a good workout. First I should mention that I haven't had tons of experience with dancing (but my best friend has and she did this dvd with me). The instructions were unclear and Jennifer didn't seem very consistent. She never really told you how many times to do the moves and the workout looked like a bunch of moves hastily shoved together which made it really hard to remember what order to do the moves in. It wasn't very fun or motivational and I didn't really sweat much. The only part I truly liked was the ballet segment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a good workout and hard to follow","review":"The concept of this video is good, but it just doesn't work. The steps are hard to follow. What makes this worse is that you can barely (and I mean BARELY) hear the music. There are times when I couldn't even tell there was music. So, that just makes staying in rhythm even harder. And I'm not in great shape, but I didn't find this challenging at all. Maybe it was because I spent most of my time trying to figure the moves out rather than actually doing them. Don't waste the money on this \\"workout.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"choose this dvd if you want to be discouraged and feel crappy about yourself","review":"I can't believe that other reviewers are calling the moves in this video \\"easy to master\\". I found some of them to be nearly impossible to follow. The camara barely focuses on her feet as she perfoms intricate latin dance footwork! I am an athletic twenty-three year old girl who is not a slow learner. I just excercised with this DVD for the first time and it was really tough! I didn't get a work out at all because I was scratching my head and rewinding the thing so much. She doesn't break down the moves at all and it's just so much more confusing than it needs to be. The dances are cute, but it's frustrating that she doesn't explain the moves. I hope no one else has to waste their money on this stupid thing."},{"rating":"1","title":"not a good video for older folks","review":"I am 50 and feel I am fit, walk daily, do elliptical machine, ect.

I thought Prevention was for everyone, at least their magazine is for all ages. Not a good experience."},{"rating":"1","title":"too hard","review":"i think this dvd would be great for someone who has a lot of experience in dance. it was too hard for a beginner like me. she doesn't give enough time for the inexperienced person to get the hang of one move before she goes on to the next one. i didn't find her as annoying as some of the other reviewers did though. i think it should be stated on the cover of the dvd that this is an intermediate or advanced workout."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lots of fun","review":"This is a great workout and alot of fun. You are definitelysweating by the time you are finished. Also the time goes byvery quickly.

I'll admit that the first time I tried it (with my 19 year old daughter watching-bad idea)I felt a bit dumb and klutzy.I have done Jazzercise in the past and hoped I'd catch on to the moves in this video quickly, but it has taken some persistance!I have mastered the hip-hop segment pretty well, and I like the ballet as well. Still working on the Latin and the Jazz, but I like a challenge and I am not the type to be too worried if I'm not doing it exactly right at first.I think this will stay interesting and fun for a while, which is a plus-I tend to get bored with repetitive workouts, but with this one I can change things up.I do sweat, and the cardio is pretty good!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Hard to follow","review":"I found these steps so hard to learn and I don't consider my uncoordinated (I have learned a lot of other workouts without problems).

It will not cut uniform shapes of anything, let alone potatoes.

The blades became blunt after I used the carrot Julienne fitting only 6 or 7 times. Then the part that moves up and down started to jump off its rails every few swipes, effectively making the item completely unusable. Oh, and the plastic surface quickly stains, and it's impossible to re-sharpen the blades (and I have many different sharpening devices, including diamond and ceramic sharpening stones). I had it only a short while, but ended up throwing it all into the trash. I recommend you get yourself a really good kitchen knife instead, one made of VG-10 steel or similar. They are pricey, but last forever and are easily re-sharpened."},{"rating":"1","title":"difficult to use and painful","review":"I had this for a couple of years and found that the food guide didn't work well. It's hinged on one side and is supposed to glide in the track on the side but frequently stuck, left the track, and/or didn't stay attached to the food I was cutting. This led to problems; in my case, 3 stitches for a divet in my left hand. It went into the trash as I only need to experience this once. So be careful out there!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Cumbersome and infuriating","review":"I hate this slicer. I've had it for a few years and every now and then decide to give it another try. The blades are very dull, and I find that there is rarely an \\"easy motion over blade\\". Instead, I have had to force my vegetables across the blade in a jabbing motion. I've cut my self enumerable times when I completely gave up on the slanted grip that causes uneven slices and forced the veggies across it by hand. Tomatoes always get stuck and twist around, resulting in a goopy mess. I think the only vegetable I've had an easy time cutting is a cucumber.One good point about this slicer is that it's easy to take apart to clean, although you hardly have to worry about cleaning it if it rarely comes out of storage."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good intentions","review":"I'm surprised to see the all or nothing reviews; it makes me wonder if the production line produces some better than others!I received this as a birthday gift a couple of years ago and have been dissappointed from the first use. While I love that it has so many options and features, I hate that they don't work very well.The V-blade was sharp, but not in the right places? I was blown away by its lack of cutting through some of the sturdier vegetables like carrots and beets at times.I actually now spend the extra time in cutting my vegetables instead of using this product because of the hassle it causes. That was my cue to start looking for a better mandoline."},{"rating":"1","title":"Less than thrilled","review":"I bought this mandoline to replace a ten-year-old Boerner V-slicer which I though was getting a little dull and now I'm glad I didn't throw the old one away. I use a mandoline to get consistently thin, thin slices, and the Zyliss doesn't get the job done. Cutting with the .75-mm insert yields slices that vary between paper-thin and 1/16 of an inch thick -- a very long way from .75mm. I suspect the plastic used in the frame and insert is just too flexible or too poorly supported to provide thin slices every time.In addition the rail-guide system is cumbersome and makes it very difficult to position food for slicing.In short, for me, this product was a waste of money and the only product I've ever ordered from Amazon that I wish I could send back.Buy a Boerner V-slicer instead: its a better slicer and it costs...less!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing product","review":"I had the opportunity to test this mandoline once without actually having to buy it, and I am thankful for that. (This is not even close to being on par with the Bron mandoline, but I guess that is what you get for spending a third of the price.) Anyway, I tried slicing cucumbers and carrots, as well as julienning the latter vegetable, and the pieces were far from uniform. The food holder was clumsy and difficult to use, especially with the orange that I tried to slice. None of the blade units contained particularly sharp blades, which you definately need in a mandoline. The only reason that I am even giving this object two stars instead of one is because of the safety rail, which did make me feel more comfortable about using a mandoline in the first place."},{"rating":"1","title":"cheaper original v-slicer is better","review":"when my v-slicer dulled after nearly 10 years of lots of use and abuse, i decided to upgrade to this zyliss. big mistake! the guard rail is difficult to use, and i can't get the uniform slices i used to with my v-slicer. plus it is bulkier and harder to store than the v-slicer. so this is going back and i'm getting a v-slicer for half the price, but more than twice the results!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Buy Something Else","review":"Buy a different mandoline.

I've seen others say how flimsy it is and I fail to see where that's true. I mean I've put this thing through the paces too, slicing everything from potatoes to summer sausage to oranges. Is it absolutely perfect in each and every slice? No, but I'm not that OCD about it that I need it to be so picky! If you hold direct, firm pressure to whatever you are slicing it does it even. It's when you don't apply even pressure to the whole item that you get uneven slicing. I just cut a whole bag of garlic with it (so I could roast them and not have to try to awkwardly cut off the tops with the papery skins with a knife that inevitably rolls) and again, it didn't let me down. I'd say for the money, this is a great place to start."},{"rating":"1","title":"K&N performance air filter","review":"I bought this filter hoping to have improved fuel consumption on my 2001 Toyota Sienna.

In the bookstore I found the book to be interesting due to the great illustrations and accompanying text. But the actual book is another matter entirely. It's divided into several essays written by different authors. I wish I could remember who wrote the first one, because I would warn Irish history enthusiasts to steer clear of that author's other books.What bothered me was how the book begins by skipping over thousands of years of history to bring the reader into around 500-700 AD, with the clear implication that before the arrival of Christianity, nothing too interesting happened on the island.

At the end of the book, he has also advised on how we should accept or not accept old remedies or even modern or popular medical habits - he does not rule out modern medicines. I think a very rational view and discussion was presented.Like all views given, of course there will definitely be some people who would strongly disagree and deny the book's integrity outright. However to benefit more from intelligence of this book is to have an open mind. Even at the end of the book, I can't bring myself to agree on the urine remedy - but I accept the clear explanations given.I don't normally buy books and initially I borrowed it from the library, but I'm buying it because I think it's a good book to have for reference at home."},{"rating":"1","title":"Should not be shown to Children","review":"Sound quality , picture quality and performance are very good in this production by the Australian Opera Co. Most heart warming was the scene in which the children dreamed of their real mother,departed. Beyond that point this performance in flawed for 3reasons. One: The Dew Fairy scene is a mockery. Second: Displayedat the Witches home is a human hand sitting in the intake of amanual meatgrinder. Last: Instead of a magic wand or some otherdevice, the witch uses a large butcher knife to keep Gretel at bay viewed by Hansel prisoned in a cage. I waited for this DVD,in all reality will not play it for any children in my family norrecommed it. Definately in poor tast and should not be shown to children. I plan to return it and buy the older Met version on DVD which does not have these types of gruesome overtones."},{"rating":"2","title":"Schroeder's Debut Is a Success","review":"Schroeder's book is a great story told by this author who lives in Colorado. It is the story of a woman's journey as she reflects on her life after 50 years. It made me laugh, it made my cry. Schroeder's writing is thought provoking as the main character questions events throughout her life, and draws conclusions to problems that are faced by everyone. It was one of the best stories I had read in a long time.

If you do not use a mouse and prefer the track pad OR your laptop is smaller then this item will be fine.

Although the age range on it is 3 years and older (over choking hazard age), it is very appropriate for a girl under three.

She loved it! She didn't mind that the voice was not that of the movie Ariel. The little girl's voice used was just as exciting! The little acessories were adores. My daughter really loved the little bag with the fork. She really connected what with the movie and pretended searching for items with her new Ariel.My only complaint (being a mommy) is the hair. It tangles easily-so I recmmend leaving it in it's netting. But, it doesn't matter my daughter loves playing with her and it inspires her to play and pretend.

In particular, it does not mention the new overly restrictive permit system that the Forest Service has implemented. Despite that, however, anyone planning to hike or climb Whitney must read this book.Among its many virtues, this book has the most detailed description of hiking and climbing routes available. Indeed, it is the only guide I've seen which gives the correct mileage to the summit from Whitney Portal. In addition, it covers natural history, geology, flora and fauna, and the history of attempts on Mt. Whitney in far greater detail than other guides. Finally, this book gives lots of space to rescue operations, and the preparations you need to make to avoid a similar fate. For all these reasons it should be your first resource, despite the slightly dated material. Hopefully the authors can be persuaded to write an updated edition."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not so pleased","review":"The product might, probably works. However the smell is really horrific.

Probably the best domestic American chocolate, although you can probably do better with some European imports. But it is very sweet.

It is best made by being whisked into a cup of milk heated to almost boiling in a microwave.P.S. for a superior alternative, see my review ofSTARBUCKS HOT COCOA TIN WARM, RICH, CHOCOLATY - NET WT 2.5 lb (1.13 Kg), here: [...]"},{"rating":"1","title":"Anyone want something lacking flavor???","review":"I was disgusted by this \\"hot chocolate\\". You MUST use it with milk - using water is by far the most disgusting thing I have ever tried to drink. Even with the warm milk - you need several extra scoops of this to make it taste even okay. It was a TOTAL waste of money. I dontaed the other 3 cans to the food pantry.There is no flavor to it - just makes the milk kind of greasy until you add about 5 or 6 scoops - then you get at least a chocolate flavor.

I poured my hot water in, took a sip, and BLEH! Yuck. I came on the website to blast this hot chocolate and give it a poor review, but then read some of the reviews that mention how it NEEDS TO BE MADE WITH MILK. I didn't even read the instructions, because I've always used water in any other h.c. mixes I've bought. I remade it with milk, which made it better, but I still like Stephens hot cocoa more.

So I was looking for a satisfying chocolate to mix with milk. Love the Godiva hot chocolate, but that was expensive, and Ghirardelli's is a great alternative.The Hazelnut is terrific as well, but I am not fond of the mocha flavored Ghirardelli's. My favorite is definitely the Double Chocolate. Both the Hazelnut and Double Chocolate are very satisfying and the sugar content is low enough that I don't crave more.The price I see here is expensive.

It is way too sweet (too much sugar) and has too little cocoa beans in it (to maximize profits). I am almost done with one of the 16oz tins and will not buy this product again nor can I recommend it. Too be quite frankly honest, it is not just Ghirardelli Hot Cocoa mix that is too sweet, it is pretty much impossible to find a good-quality-lower-in sugar-and-richer-in-cocoa hot cocoa mix in the States. And no, I am not willing to pay 12 bucks for a hot cocoa tin from Godiva, that is a rip off."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice but very expensive","review":"I did not realize how small the containers were.

We wanted the crate to use in our bedroom but simply couldn't stand the odor anymore. The dog began to balk at going in too. It is now October and we've finally put the crate in a plastic bag under the house. The company won't take it back. Don't buy this!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Combination","review":"This is a great crate that combines the functional (cavey) nature of a plastic crate with the portability & openness of a collapsible metal crate, without having to purchase an additional cover. It is also lightweight, which you don't get with any other type of crate.The only complaint I have is taht I'd like to have an optional maybe velcro side panel to put on if you don't want them to have so much viewing capability...Of course, this crate is not to be used with chewers or those who will claw/tear at it (it won't withstand that).

In the past few years our Lab has developed severe anxiety especially separation anxiety when I leave the house. When left in a metal crate he tries to find a way out and cuts his face so we decided to try the softer crates alongside our other training routines. We picked this crate because it looks nice as a part of our home and it gives us the option of using it as a day time bed with the two Velcro doors up. Our lab LOVES it. It did have a slight chemical odor to it when we purchased it but now it has faded and we keep it in a small bedroom with us so we would notice it. All we have to say now is \\"go to your house\\" and he'll take himself in there with one of his toys, we couldn't ask for better for our older, already trained Lab."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very flimsy!","review":"This is a super flimsy crate. My 2 1/2 year old dog seemed to like the crate. I introduced it to him slowly with treats and letting him just go in and lay down at will. He is used to being confined to a regular metal crate most days when I go to work and has always been fine. But the first time I actually left him in this Firstrax crate, I came home and he had busted through one of the flimsy zippers. I fixed the zipper and tried it again. The second time I left him, he just tore the fabric along a seam and got out. I couldn't believe how flimsy this product is. It might be okay for an older dog or very low energy dog, but it can't stand up to a more energetic dog."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great if your dog doesn't move","review":"This crate tends to collapse inward on the dog. The frame that should \\"snap\\" into place needs something to slip over the joint so it can't collapse. Very little movement can cause the frame to collapse. The mesh is also rather flimsy - she is not a destructive dog, but just a few scratches resulted in large tears in the mesh almost immediately."},{"rating":"2","title":"Noz2Noz Soft Crate","review":"This crate works great for my standard Poodles, the fabric inside wipes down, if water spills, it wipes up easy.

Having had dogs for the past 30 years, I have owned all kinds of dog crates, and these are by far my favorites. They are sturdy and attractive (for dog crates), fold down small enough to be handy for travel, and are easy to fold and unfold. One of my favorite features is the door on top, which is so convenient for puppies--much easier to put them in and out this way than to crawl on the floor reaching into the back of the crate. Also, two side doors mean that the crates have easy access wherever they are placed in the room or the car.My dogs aren't heavy chewers, so I can't speak for how well these would hold up for big dogs that chew, but they seem very sturdy, and have withstood plenty of scratching from the inside without showing wear.

The smell was unbearable. The dog won't go near it. We read through some of the reviews and tried all the suggestions except for washing it in the washing machine. Wanted to be able to return it if necessary. We set it outdoors, sprayed it with Febreeze, wiped it down with vinegar, etc etc etc. Still stinks. Horrible horrible chemical odor.

It is nice that she can take her \\"bed\\" with her when we have to travel to somewhere new to her. She always has a place to feel secure. Also, since she is crate trained, and full grown (over the puppy chewing stage), if we need to confine her, she has no desire to chew through the crate. The smaller size doesn't seem to bother her.

We crate-trained her in a metal crate when we got her and now that she is 95% housebroken, she uses this model (really great looking and stylish) as her night time home. We keep it permanently open (side and front) and she comes and leaves it as she pleases. She felt at home quickly and the unit is easy to clean plus they also have replacement covers if needed. Overall a great purchase. I can see how a chewie dog can destroy it quickly as it is material that is not indestructible, nor do they advertise being so so be warned. If you have a well behaved dog that does not have bad chewing habits this might be a great option. It looks great."},{"rating":"2","title":"Much better than a metal wire crate","review":"We travel in a RV with our miniature Dachshund. The carrier has worked well to keep our pet safe and secure.

The price was half the price I paid for a crate of similar size at a nearby pet supply store several years ago! Would recommend this product to anyone needing a comfortable crate (my cats love it!) and I loved the price from Amazon!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Toxic smelling crate","review":"So, I love the construction of the crate. However, was hoping to use it next week when our sweet dog stays with a friend while we are out of town. The overpowering, toxic smelling fabric, makes me afraid to use it. Thus it rates a 1. Our dog has so far refused to go near it. We have been airing it out for just 2 days, but don't see the fume-like odor dispersing anytime soon. It is so bad that I am concerned for the dogs health if she sleeps in it. She is a rescue and we don't want to poison her!!! If carpet off-gassing will give people a headache, I can't imagine what this would do to a 30 pound animal. We will probably return it when we get home. Such a shame as the sturdy but light construction is fantastic and just what we wanted. Bummer!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Heavy duty mesh?","review":"I purchased the medium size (up to 50 lbs dog) and my 7 lbs yorkie broke through this kennel in less than 5 minutes twice!

The strong odor seems to be emanating from the polyester bottom. We don't dare put a dog in it as the smell is overwhelming and unhealthy."},{"rating":"2","title":"great soft crate","review":"I bought this soft crate because I have a new SUV and didn't want metal/wire corners to rip the headliner. This is a great crate: easy to set up and take down and light weight, too. My only complaint is the same one I have for most crates: it's taller than needs to be for the size of dog using it. I bought this for my 24\\" Golden Retriever and it's 27\\" tall. He isn't going to play basketball in it. It should be no taller than 25\\" and would fit more easily into corners or along the sides of vehicles if it was shorter."},{"rating":"2","title":"light weight","review":"Love it!, I use it at home while I'm gone during the day and fold it up to take with me when I go to visit my daughter.

I purchased one several month back and after about two weeks, the primary door zipper broke which made the crate unusable. Amazon graciously accepted a return and replaced the crate with a new one. The second crate lasted about 4 weeks... same problem... the problem seems to be with the zipper turning corners - the prongs seem to easily misalign and then break when the zipper passed over them.I would love to get another one, but I think that I'm going to have to get something else that is a little more reliable."},{"rating":"2","title":"My cat LOVES this crate!","review":"Have you ever tried to crate train a cat? Normally a difficult task but, due to the mesh \\"windows\\" that unzip on both sides (in addition to the zipper on the top), my cat started using this crate as a den the day I brought it home. Even when the den \\"betrayed\\" him by taking him to the vet, he was much calmer than normal (significantly less yowling) and he didn't reject the crate after the visit. That very afternoon he climbed back in, curled up and went to sleep.My cat is so darn comfortable in the Sof-Krate that I've started taking him with me when I go to the pet food store (in his crate) so he doesn't equate the car with a vet visit. It's my version of a dog in the purse."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect and portable","review":"This is a wonderful crate for my beagle mix.

Being a new dog owner I know very little about it and they say nothing about this crate being for trained dogs only. My pup ripped a hole in the front \\"door\\" in the first few days. I turned it around and put the hole against the wall, and now in week two yet another hole now rendering it's useless. I was only gone for an few hours, and I took him out just before i left, yet it took him no time at all.I will also echo what others say about the smell... it doesn't smell good at all, and the smell hasn't dissipated in the two weeks i've had it. I do wonder if it's good for a dog to be surrounded by that smell for hours at a time.There is no returning it because it was damaged by my dog. That's $90 in the trash.

It seems very well built and it set up in just a moment. However, my dog chewed through it and escaped the FIRST time I left him in it.

The friendless (except 1 jock who apparently ignores him in public) Fanboy meets Goth Girl who alternately fights with him and draws him out of his shell. The back and forth between the two is delightful. Even more delightful is the slow realization that Fanboy has been making assumptions about people that may not be true including his best friend Cal, his step fascist...er...father, his own mother and Goth Girl.Fanboy's emotional development is satisfying and fun. A great read and an easy sell to even book hating teens."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dark Teenage Humor","review":"This novel is more of a character development novel than anything else (here isn't really any action or adventure); it's just a short time in the life of a nerdy, comic book fan, angsty teenage male. That said, the main character is very engaging, tormented, intelligent, likable, nave, and ambitious. There's a bit of foul language in this for a young adult novel, but nothing too extreme. Both Fanboy and Goth Girl have acerbic senses of humor that make the story amusing. If you like dark teenage humor, it's a good read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Most impressive","review":"The beginning of this book had lots of red flags for me: a potentially whiny main character, a complicated, slow-to-get-moving plot.But boy did it succeed.

It seems to only be hanging up near the front, (due to the paint). as for the sequential trigger problem that another reviewer mentioned, my gun came with two different triggers so if you don't like the way it is firing you can change it.

I only like sequential triggering - here's the problem: The gun will not fire every time you pull the trigger unless you follow a strict sequence- i.e. after firing if you release the trigger before lifting gun off the material it will not fire the next time you pull the trigger. This idiosyncrasy is very frustrating. Thinking this just can't be right, I took gun to DeWalt service center in Little Rock. They said that's the way it is. You must hold trigger down until gun is lifted off the work piece or else the head will not re-extend for next shot. DeWalt help us out here. Other nailers don't have this problem. If you like the bump trigger you won't see this problem."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dissatisfaction of Staple Gun","review":"The staple gun I bought to build a house about a month ago will not accept the staples; I have to push on the plunger in order for the staple to go up to the head--I am very dissatisfied with item and I do not have time to replace before the house is finished.

The power is adequate for everything I've encountered so far...wood, steel, etc. Nothing cleaver to learn how to use, no wrenches or screws to misplace when changing blades, just straightforward cutting. the drop-in blade clamp is simple and effective. It makes changing blades fast and certain.

They include: Taxation and Government Finance in the 16th century Ming Dynasty; commerce in Ming China; captialism, etc. The collection also includes an essay on Macro History - a thesis that cost Huang's career in the Ivy League circle.The content in this book is very repetitive. Otherwise, I am quite impressed by the depth of Huang's analysis as to why captialism had failed to take root in China; how China had come to attain a revolution in its fiscal management and why such fiscal revolution, attained in the 1980s, is central to China's stability."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lace collectors will find this beautiful and enjoying!","review":"Faboulous color photos from Appenzell to Tatting, and How to maintain a collection.

The French involvement in Vietnam is not that well known in the USA. However, those that see this film will be interested to know that battle have been fought in that country for many years. Pierre Schoendoerffer, the director and Raul Courtard, the cinematographer are both veterans of the French conflict in Vietnam (Indo-China).

It was photographed in glorious black-and-white on location in Cambodia. If you were a combat veteran, line doggie or LRRP in Vietnam this wonderful movie will resonate with you. The little details are there, sounds, faces, jungle rivers, all of it. If you weren't there and want to know what it was like then you should purchase this film. No other film comes close to the understated realism and gritty reality of Schoendorfer's masterpiece -- and I've seen them all.

Thinking it was some coating on the new bowls, we washed and scrubbed them thoroughly--still same thing. We thought it may be some oil coming from the motor and escaping from where the beaters are mounted, but that doesnt seem to be the case. About the 4th time we used it the center beater jammed and cannot be removed--it is abiut 1/3\\" from being locked in place and wont budge. While struggling to remove it, some grayish powder came falling out--maybe that's where the deposits are from.

It could not mix a basic, from scratch, yellow cake batter. After wrestling with it for 3-4 times longer than it should have taken, I finally used my sister's ancient & tiny handmixer to get the lumps out of the batter.

It is powerful, it comes with two bowls, but most important, IT'S EASY TO USE.I had a large KitchenAid stand mixer for a while and finally just gave it away. I do not like the one-beater action for the small amounts I usually mix. The two beaters on my Sunbeam actually blend everything so much better, even at the bottom of the bowl. I also found the KA very cumbersome to use, especially when trying to add ingredients or scrape down the sides (yes, you do have to scrape them down). It may be okay for someone who makes double batches of everything or for the devoted breadmaker, but for the person who just likes to make cakes and cookies quickly and easily, this Sunbeam is so much more intuitive. I have had absolutely no problems creaming and mixing anything, and I have not had the spatter that others have mentioned.I would buy this mixer even if it had cost twice as much!"},{"rating":"2","title":"so far, so good","review":"I'm just getting started with my new mixer.

Would like handles on the bowls, tho."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointed","review":"I have been very, very disappointed with this mixer. I have had the sunbeam mixers previously and they were always great, but this one is so hard to use, and doesn't mix anything on the bottom of the bowl. It doesn't seem to mix anything unless the bowl is half full. I can't believe it cost so much money and doesn't do the minimum mixing. If I could, I would send it back and ask for my money back and go buy one at a store, not this kind. Thinking it would be a wonderful mixer, I threw away the box before ever using this mixer. What a mistake. Either this is a flawed mixer, or this brand is worthless. I usually use my $15.00 handmixer instead of this one, it is such a pain. I definitely do not recommend this mixer. I am truly sorry I bought it. A very UNHAPPY customer of this mixer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Broke during first use!","review":"I bought the Sunbeam Heritage for use with my cake decorating class. I was making buttercream icing for class and I turned it on to start it mixing and it was working just fine for about 30 seconds. I stopped it to move the mixture around and when I turned it back on, the second motor stopped working. There are two motors in the machine. One powers the beaters and the other powers the bowl to turn. The bowl motor went out and I was not able to finish my icing with the mixer and had to pull out the hand mixer to finish off.I would guess that if you are using the mixer for easy things like cake batter and such, you would probably be ok. But if you plan to use it for anything else that might need a little more power, go with a better mixer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the Mixer I had!","review":"I received a Sunbeam Mixer when I got married in 1963. It supported me through many wedding cakes, Christmas cookies and making bread. I removed the head to use it in my big bread bowl. It was going strong when 18 years later, I sold it. Now I have the time to cook again, I wanted a mixer as good as my old one. Within several weeks, the motor that runs the bowl section had quit. If the bowl motor is not working, the mixer stays put and the bowl won't move. It is also much louder than the first one I had. This is not a good stand mixer. I sent it back."},{"rating":"1","title":"not good","review":"bought a 350W version which mechanically is the same thing. Incompetent design imo.

Its been a year now that I have the Sunbeam stand mixer & its still getting very hot.

Had I done my research beforehand, I would have bought the Kitchen Aid right off the bat. Instead, I bought the Sunbeam Heritage series Mixmaster from Walmart for $90.00. It looked classic, solid, and similar to its competitor: The Kitchenaid which sold for about $200. Needless to say, the first time I used it, the power fluctuated in and out, the beaters are not thorough and you have to use a rubber scraper to get everything mixed in, and it smelled like burning wire (perhaps a short in the wiring?)

I have used it for 3 years and it is a work horse. I bake constantly and I have never had any problems. When I first moved, I did not have my mixer with me so I bought the Sunbeam Heritage to get me by. What a disappointment! You have to fiddle with the release to get the head to lift and it only works about 1/2 the time. The mixers do NOT mix in the ingredients on the sides of the bowl. Be prepared for your ingredients to fly all over the room (I am still cleaning up cookie dough!) and after all that? I still ended up mixing my cookies by hand to get them mixed! I am so happy to have my KitchenAid and will never settle for less!"},{"rating":"1","title":"OK for the price","review":"My Grandma baked EVERY day and always used a Sunbeam mixer. That is why I bought this one, but I am disappointed with it. It is very reasonably priced and the motor has been powerful enough for the baking that I do, but those are the only two good things I can really say about it. When mixing, ingredients fly out of the bowl all over the counter and me. When adding flour, no matter how slowly, a cloud of flour dust covers everything within about a 5-foot radius of the mixer. I have even tried mixing with a towel over the top of the mixer just to help eliminate some of the dust. Also, I have arthritis and have found the beater realase button extremely hard to push. I guess this mixer is a good buy for someone who will not use it very often because it is a good price, but a person who will be using it a lot may want to invest in something better."},{"rating":"1","title":"A real disappointment","review":"Got one of these as a gift from my favorite sister in law. I always wanted one, but the beaters were nearly impossible to eject and about six months later, the motor froze while I was making meringues. I complained to Sunbeam, and without consulting me, they immediately sent me a brand new one, beaters, bowls and all. When I said I didn't want to send the broken one back, they instructed me to just \\"cut off the cord\\" and keep the bowls and beaters as spares. It started to sound as if this was a common occurance. When I set up the replacement, the motor that drove the bowl turntable didn't work. My husband took the motor for the bowl stand from the \\"old\\" mixer and put it in the \\"new\\" mixer, so now I have a working mixer...but for how long? I don't care if his repair job invaldated the warranty. If this one breaks, I WON'T be getting another Sunbeam."},{"rating":"2","title":"I love my mixer","review":"I was thrilled when I found this great mixer in red. I have always wanted a heavy duty mixer and this one fit the bill. It has plenty of power for even my heaviest of cookie doughs. It's built like a truck and I think it will be with me for years. I love the rubber grips and it never wobbles during mixing. I also like the way the bowls attach to the base so you don't have to worry about them spinning off. The beater release button is a little bit hard but I think with time it will get better. I am very happy with my purchase!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Beware the nut comes off the bottom of the beater","review":"I have not been happy with this mixer; the release button is difficult, the beaters leave batter unmixed in the middle of the bowl - but the end of the road for mine was finding the nut from the bottom of the beater in a cookie I had just mixed and baked.

Rather than risk this again, we have thrown it out."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good while it worked","review":"Had an old Sunbeam mixer on which the turntable wore out. It lasted about 10 years, so I thought to go with Sunbeam again. The new one worked for almost a month before the gears stripped out on its turntable.

The only work it did was to make butter from 1 quart of cream 5 or 6 days a week."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not so Great","review":"Had it a year, it worked ok. But now, a screw has worked loose from the top part, and it prevents the head from tilting back. Total dis-assembly is required to fix this.There is no excuse for a screw working loose!

My cheesecake had to be mixed by hand for 10 minutes!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy this mixer","review":"I am returning this mixer because the release mechanism for the beaters is almost impossible to use by hand. You are supposed to press a button to release the beaters - unlike the original Mixmaster where you pulled down the handle on the top. The button is so difficult to press by hand that you need to use the butt of a utensil to cause it to release the beaters. Customer service at Sunbeam acknowledged the problem and said that over time it should become easier to press. I suspect that at that point, the beaters will not hold tight. This company went into bankruptcy once already and with this kind of engineering and quality control, I will now avoid all Sunbeam products."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tricked and forgotten","review":"I ordered the Sunbeam mixer from Orange onion through the Amazon site.

The poetry is pure and sweet and appeals to the cowboy/cowgirl in all of us."},{"rating":"1","title":"Easy Reading, and some \\"Nuggets\\" there.","review":"I enjoyed this book, but lack the belief it is for golfers. I suspect the author adapted his spiritual outlook to golf, to gain further audience for his books. Golf is a hot (money) topic to publish on these days. I'd expect this author's measurement of success with this book would not be whether you enjoyed your golf game more... but whether you purchased his core book, \\"The Road Less Traveled,\\" of which this is only a branch... or \\"Trailer,\\" so to speak."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very slow play.","review":"M.

Peck gives short shrift to the environmental degradation caused by golf, completely ignores the historical racism in the sport, and, most poignantly, he warmly embraces the elitism that golf symbolizes. It would appear that The Road Less Traveled would also refer to the numerous golf courses where African-Americans are still not allowed to play."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Golfer's Disappointment.","review":"My wife thought I should learn this language and she knows I love golf.

What a waste.","review":"The topic of Spirituality and Golf screams for a better book than this one. Peck has chosen to waste the opportunity on trying to impress readers with, I don't know, something about paradoxes and how damn smart he is. I found no spiritual insight in the book, and certainly learned nothing about golf. Given the title, I would say Peck whiffed. You're still away, Peck."},{"rating":"2","title":"Insightful","review":"While not ground breaking I enjoyed Golf and the Spirit by M. Scott Peck. The audio was both witty and insightful. The author takes us through a imaginary round of golf on the fictional course Exotica. Like many courses, Exotica has roughs, sand traps and water hazzards to sufficiently challenge golfers of all levels. Dr. Peck's audio however has less to do with the physical hazzards of golf. The book delves more into the spiritual and inner aspects of the game of golf. The book uses golf as a methphor for life. Golf like life has many challenges and success in both requires introspection."},{"rating":"1","title":"A writer should at least understand his subject","review":"It is quite apparent that Dr. Peck chose a subject that he is clearly not qualified to write about. I'm not really sure who he is trying to target with this book. If you understand anything about golf you will be bored with his lengthy details of golf terms and basic forms of play. If you are a beginner you will get into trouble if believe that his interpretations of the rules of golf and golf etiquette to be correct. Dr. Peck is quick to point out that after spending over 30 years as an avid golfer he is a terrible player. Part of why he is so bad is that he never bothered to learn the game. Now he thinks he is qualified to write a book about it. There are more great books about golf than any one person could ever read, but this is one that never should have been published."},{"rating":"1","title":"Way over rated.","review":"I own over a thousand cd's; most in the pop/rock, powerpop spirit.

Every single song on here is an awesome song and there is absolutly no fillers which totlly blows my mind!! This has to be the best album of the 90's, I mean really its great. It is great metal and desearves your attention. Some of the songs that I especially like are 'all she wrote', 'outta be a law', and 'shake and tumble', but seriosly every single song is great.

I really only knew Love of a Lifetime beforehand, but there is so much more here to like. It's a very solid effort. There are a few clunkers included, but once you get past the first 60 seconds of the opening song, it's pretty much smooth sailing. If you like 80's type hair metal you'll enjoy this. Shake & Tumble, Oughta be a Law and Overnight Sensation are a few of my favorites on here. It's worth your time. BTW, if you can catch these guys in concert, they still sound very good!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Enjoyable release before grunge took over","review":"I consider this album--and this band--somewhat of a copycat effort of others within the \\"pop metal\\" genre--bands like Bon Jovi and Europe come to mind. That being said, this is still a very enjoyable listen from the early '90s. \\"Don't Treat Me Bad\\" is a great melodic mid-tempo single, and \\"Love Of A Lifetime\\" was a big ballad hit. To me, the best track on the album is the single released after these two songs which didn't make it nearly as big--\\"All She Wrote\\". Man, what a powerful, melodic, rocking song!Other tracks are also very enjoyable. \\"Rock On The Radio\\" is a bit generic but has a big sound. \\"Shake And Tumble\\" and \\"Overnight Sensation\\" flat-out rock. \\"Home Is Where The Heart Is\\" and \\"Don't Walk Away\\" are great slower tempo songs--the latter being a true power ballad. All in all, a very good melodic effort a year or so before rock music was eclipsed by the gloomy grunge."},{"rating":"2","title":"music speaks for itself","review":"Although many of us would like to forget the big-hair excesses of the late 80s-early 90s scene, we would be fooling ourselves if we denied the quality of some of the music. Two talented bands, Firehouse and Slaughter, caught the last wave of the melodic-rock era and were denied the earlier acclaim given bands like Poison and Skid Row, whose talent was inferior. Songs on this album like Love of a Lifetime and Don't Treat Me Bad withstood the transition to an acoustic format on Good Acoustics (1996), which I would also recommend. Like any other era, it was originality, not big hair and make-up, that determined which music would survive. This album is still a treat for the ear, and I for one am not ashamed to appreciate it for what it is: a good rock n roll album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Firehouse Lights It Up!","review":"This debut from the Jersey rockers is a lotta fun! All the tracks on this album are good. Firehouse is right in line with White Lion, Winger and Slaughter putting out good melodies, great vocals, fun rock 'n' roll and great ballads.All She Wrote, Love of a Lifetime, Don't Treat Me Bad and Oughta Be a Law are very good.

In my 20 gallon tall planted tank, it caused my Boesemani Rainbow, my Madagascar Rainbow, my Black Emperor Tetra, and my Dojo Loach to develop bacterial infections that has killed them. It is causing wasting sickness in my Rummynose Tetras, and playing general havoc in my tank.I also used this, again to the instructions, in my fiddler crab tank which has caused massive buildup of bacterial fuzz on my cured driftwood that in some places got a centimeter thick. My hoard of snails can't even keep up with the growth.DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT.

Once you start using this product you can never stop. Stability does as it says and keeps your tank levels optimal, but only as long as you continue to use it. Seachem utilizes bacteria similar to those produced naturally by the fish, but not the same bacteria. This information was taken straight from Seachem's website. The Stability bacteria use all of the oxygen in the water and are introduced in such great quantities that the natural fish-born bacteria never have a chance. Once you stop using this and the bacteria left in your tank die out, it is as if your tank were brand new and you will have to cycle all over again (the natural way). Use Tetra Safe Start. This product utilizes the same bacteria that are produced naturally by the fish, and is ideal for long term tank stability."},{"rating":"2","title":"It Really Does Work The Way It Says!","review":"I set up a 20 gal 'long' tank with plants and used Seachem Stability as directed. Added some guppies the 2nd day and continued with the seven day stability. My fist fish and those added within a week have all survived. My test showed no water problems and I now have about 8 fish total. I use an air stone and power filter. My tank started clear and remains that way today. As for those that say if you stop using stability everything will fall apart are incorrect. I only add more at water changes and filter cleanings. To me it is a very good product and I am well pleased with it."},{"rating":"2","title":"It works!","review":"I have used this product multiple times to start quarantine tanks and hospital tanks (marine tanks, with both fish and coral.) It works; it's worked every time. I've never had my tanks spike ammonia or nitrite when using this product as directed. I'm amazed how many websites & forums claim that no such product exists. Also, the reviewer who says that you have to keep using it is wrong, for so many reasons (the bacteria don't get used up and die, they multiply, just like all bacteria, and also, all of the bacteria that would normally be in your tank if you cycle the traditional way will also still exist in the tank.) I've never used the product beyond 7 days, not even with water changes, and my tanks have never \\"crashed\\" when I stopped using this.

I have the new FP41XP and I love it. My old SFN40 is still going strong after about 10 years of heavy use. I had a Bostich (Stanley ) finish nailer before but I found it underpowered compared to the Senco. The nails used for the Bostich are inferior too. The so called galvinized 16Ga Bostich nails rusted easy. Senco nails are the best quality. The galvinized nails look like stainless and will not rust. The tip is easy to un jam if you hit something hard and bend a nail. The nailer has enough power to easily set a nail into 5/4 white oak. The gutless Bostich could not set a nail into 5/4 white oak."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent","review":"This is one of the best finish nailers out there. Performance seems to be flawless. I only gave it 4 stars because the tool case is ridiculously larger than the nailer itself. Any other comparable nailer that I own or have seen the case is 1/2 the size.

The nativity was mocked and made fun of, the young women with so much breast showing was deplorable and embarrassing to watch with the men in our family, in addition to the sexual innuendos, excessive cursing... I cannot believe that such a DVD was even made by Thomas Kinkade. My eyes have been opened as to what he is really like. I am not talking about him as a person, but for him to allow sexual innuendos, mockery of the real meaning of Christmas and excessive cursing was so unnecessary and ruined the nice movie.

I was extremely disappointed that anything associated with Thomas Kinkade would of been so rough. As well the story jumped all over the place. You never knew where the story was going, from him to his mothers distress of losing her home.

He was intimately involved in its creation process.Because of the reviews, I got this on netflix first and then turned around and bought it on here upon watching it. It was charming and heartwarming. I laughed, I cried, and enjoyed it quite a lot. The cast was amazing. Jared Padalecki is fantastic in everything he does, as is Peter O'Toole and Marcia Gay Harden.

But not because it has profanity or scantily clad women or suggestive scenes. I just found it tried too hard to be moving, to be poignant, to be funny, to teach us lessons. Overdone in some ways, underdone in others like plot and characterization. It always bothers me when a movie tries to convince us it's winter with all the leaves on the trees and flowers blooming. Some of the acting was wonderful, especially from the young 'Thomas Kinkade' whose dewy, earnest eyes and soft sincere voice lent such beauty to the scenes he was in. And honestly, it's just my opinion but I don't believe Jesus would have been offended by anything in this movie.

Also, we're both very Christmasy people. CHRISTMAS COTTAGE seemed to be right up our alley. But this movie which should have been one of the best family Christmas films ever is laced with very adult themes and crude material. There is a fair amount of unnecessary profanity as well as sexual themes in this film.Yes, there is some heartwarming and sentimental feeling in COTTAGE, as well as an outstanding performance by Peter O'Toole. But how much garbage should a viewer have to wade through to get to the good stuff? It just isn't worth it. There are plenty of wonderful Christmas movies out there. CHRISTMAS COTTAGE does not earn a place among them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Such a great movie, bought copies to give as gifts!!","review":"This movie is great! I have always loved Thomas Kinkade's work on canvas and other mediums, so I had to check this movie out...and I am so glad I did!The acting is supurb, the story-line, very believable, and the theme is moving beyond words! It was really nice to get a glimpse into the life of Thomas Kinkade. There isn't a lot of fluff here as the topic dictates, but this will be on the top of my Christmas favorites now!

As usual she is absolutely wonderful. I'm giving four stars only because of her."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Feel Good Christmas Movie","review":"Okay, so this movie isn't high art.

His work will live on a light and inspiration to his many admirers and this movie shows his the inspiration of his mentor and how he repaid this inspiration.

But it had me falling asleep because it was so slow!!! I was bummed because I had high hopes for it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"Though I am a hopeless romantic - and cry during Hallmark commercials - I just wasn't impressed with this movie.

It took over 2 weeks for the problem to be corrected and my money refunded to me. I do believe in the future that I will only order items that are handled by Amazon, as this is the second time that I have had to deal with other suppliers and have had problems. It seems as though the suppliers are never at fault even though they ship the wrong item and that it is my responsibility and expense to return something that they shipped wrong in the first place. It is very frustrating to deal with these people and I will not do it again!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Movie","review":"Not so sure when we started watching the movie, but I really was a good movie.

It was however; a good story and a quality production."},{"rating":"2","title":"Heartwarming Story","review":"Heartwarming story based on the real life happenings of Thomas Kinkade's early years. What a loss when Tom left us without his continued talents."},{"rating":"2","title":"A story of Beginnings and Endings","review":"Famed painter Thomas Kinkaid had this film made about a very pivotal time of his life. Kept raw as real life tends to be, it is a sad and yet very uplifting film. Topics are deep and moving. This is not meant to be a young children's film, but more a teenage and adult film. Deals with motivations, the things that shape us, those who mold our lives.While I felt the character of Thomas was not given enough depth to fully utilize Mr. Padalecki's talents, his performance with what he was given was awesome. Several of the supporting characters did super amazing work. Despite the rough language given to Richard Burgi, it was the most amazing piece of acting I have seen from him yet -- the depths of feeling and information in his vulerable moments were totally worth it. Mr. O'Toole also gives a wondrous performnce.If you want something to touch your heart, see how life chapes people, and just get some of that Christmas feeling flowing -- this movie is for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Christmas Movie","review":"I just watched the movie with my brother and wife. It was a great movie and very proud of Jared, he did a wonderful job."},{"rating":"2","title":"Heartwarming movie","review":"I loved this movie. It goes without saying that Peter O'Toole is amazing in his role. His designation as a legend is well-deserved. As a long-time Richard Burgi fan, this is one of his best roles, and he is wonderful in it. And while I've not known Jared Padalecki's work for as long as I've known Richard's, I have a similar admiration for both of them, and their scenes together in this movie are funny and heartbreaking. This is simply a very nice Christmas movie for older children/teens and their parents."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just Awful","review":"Stair Treads-Carpet Style - Set of 4 - Beige (Beige) (27.5\\"W x 8.5\\"L)I ordered these mats from Stacks and Stacks.

Meditation, chakras, chi, 5 elements, archetypes, and other aspects of this system of consciousness-energy informing the perceived reality of form are addressed. While there is a strong Chinese medicine component to this text there is a broader look at insights from intuitive sources and modern research in physics, consciousness, and subtle energy fields. The author is thoughtful and expresses concepts clearly, presenting a paradigm for healing which supports the path toward wholeness and integration which is inherent in the essence of Consciousness/Awareness from which all things and realities arise. This is a very worthy contribution to the mind-body healing field and related areas of exploration."},{"rating":"2","title":"Energetic Healing","review":"Greenwood has an excellent grasp of the holistic and energetic nature of the human condition.

I believe that he is a great preacher, annointed and full of God's grace. I heard him several times and have been blessed by his sermons. However, I have read several of his books and frankly I am starting to be a little disappointed. \\"Fresh Wind Fresh Fire\\" was a great book on the power of prayer but since then, Cymbala's books seem to be a little redundant in their styles. The Brooklyn Tab's illustrations are similar and Cymbala's message is too. The \\"Freshness\\" of his first book and rightly so best-seller is fading. This book addresses a vague theodicy of 9-11 and the testimonies, while touching, have less impact today than soon after. While I did not enjoy this book too much, I still think that this book would be good for someone who never read Cymbala before."},{"rating":"1","title":"I wish i had listened to the review","review":"This item had to be exchanged for larger size.

A poorly made product!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Love the look but not durable","review":"I love the look of this hamper and the mesh insert is a good idea. The problem I have with this hamper is that it isn't made very well. After 9 months of use two of the hooks on the mesh insert have come off.

For the price of this item I would have thought it was better put together."},{"rating":"2","title":"great quality","review":"I have been so happy with this piece. It really complements the nursery beautifully and is great quality. The fabrics are soft and the wood frame is really nice. I've washed both the liner and the outer cover and they both washed beautifully. What is nice is that I don't have to take the entire hamper out of the room when I do laundry.

The writing generally comprises a jumble of barely connected facts, boring digressions, second- or third-hand analysis and a writing style greatly in need of a rigorous editor. The authors quickly run out of anything interesting to say about the titular American Industrial Revolution, and eventually move on to a meandering chapter about the London Exhibition of 1851. No reputable university press would have released this work; apparently the Smithsonian Institution has much lower standards. One saving grace is the Suggested Readings section at the end, which will point the reader to many books far more worthy of his or her time than this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good book for American Industrial Revolution students","review":"If you study the American Industrial Revolution you need this book.

I use it mostly for resizing clothing and making my own clothes. You have to read the instruction manual very carefully. It took me a while to figure out how to wind and install the bobbin correctly. It's very important that you do that. When I installed the bobbin incorrectly, I kept getting bunched up threads in my sewing and it stopped my machine.The automatic threader is very convenient. It works great. Sometimes, the thread tends to snap out of the needle but I suspect that might have to do with the thread tension.This is a good model for a beginner. It's fairly simple to use and it has the good basic stitches. Also has a lot of decorative stitches to choose from if you want to do something decorative. Overall, I'd say my experience with this sewing machine is positive."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good description & photos of product","review":"I received the shipment of Serenity Green (or Naturewood Serenity) dinnerware yesterday and was very pleased with the actual product.

Stan Shaw was great as the brooding brother who doesn't care about anyone. The supporting cast were a bunch of guys who some say are misfits, but I don't think so. They were a group of people who got drafted, or enlisted in war time.

This film has some excellent performances, but it's also the story line that really keeps it moving along. Having been in Army, I know the feeling of what it's like to being new to the military way of life. Stan Shaw as the lone wolf does a great job of going from being all for himslef to taking care of his men. His acting along side of R Lee Emry makes the film worth seeing and purchasing. R Lee sees in Stan what a real leader is and someone who will not leave his men. The sene in which he and Stan are talking about the replacements and R Lee says to Stan that he has one \\"#$%^^ of a job\\", is a wondeful piece of acting. You see that Marines are not robots, but have feelings as well.So make sure this one is in your collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"This book is a keeper for any counsellor.","review":"Once again I am seeking a copy of Widow; I lent my copy to someone in need again and again did not get it back. It is always difficult to find good books offering sound advice in the form of an accessible story, even though such stories can be far more useful than abstract explanations. This book is one of those rare, useful tools. The author's story of coping with grief and bereavement offers many useful suggestions for others. The book contains no sermons or lectures. It is quite simply the story of her experience, told clearly and simply.

However, a strong external flash like a Canon 430 EX or 580EX can make taking good medium to close range shots a challenge... redeye, lots of shadows, etc.I tend to bounce flash most of the time and that helps to reduce the problems somewhat. But even with that, sometimes bounce flashing is impractical (like outside). I've often resorted to rubberbanding a tissue over the flash so I thought perhaps a diffuser would do the trick.There are lots of options out there but I like the Sto-Fen diffuser since it's simple, inexpensive and small. It does a good job of softening and spreading the light without making you look like you should be shooting a wedding.It couldn't be simpler - just slip it on and bounce the flash. The camera and flash take care of the rest."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works at advertised","review":"When used to bounce flash from a ceiling, this product does work. However, when I use it as a direct flash (90 degree angle) it produces shadows and a dark output. I don't know why.

It will take some time getting used to, had a couple issues figuring out what setting work best with it on."},{"rating":"2","title":"this was a brite idea :-P","review":"I really like this product. It is worth every penny! I like it because you can take pictures around shiney objects like mirrors and glass and metal.. and it won't make your picture end up looking like a lot of flash lights are shining at you. the shine of the light won't come back to your camera lense and it works very well.

Fits well my Canon 430-EX flash, does not slip easily.The only culprit I have with it, it has a yellowish (too warm) cast on most of my pics... This compared with the output of the flash naked, without the diffuser. BTW noticed the same effect when using the 430-EX flash own built in wide angle diffuser... it has a yellowish cast.These plastics are NOT transparent (display a color cast). And the built in wide angle diffuser looks more transparent than the Stofen.Anyone knows how to auto correct the light output, that is not editing with Photoshop?I can use my EOS 50D own built in color correction, or do a manual white balance with the diffser attached and store the value? Anything simpler than that? I do not like the too much yellow cast.Otherwise, very good overall difuser."},{"rating":"2","title":"I love it. It goes with me everywhere.","review":"I always find a diffused flash to give me better pictures.

It's become essential gear.5/5-Mike"},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect little diffuser","review":"This little puppy is great especially when you are bouncing the light off of other surfaces (like walls). I did a series of portraits and this diffuser was indispensable to my work. I had not lights (except one overhead fluorescent) and this diffuser did the trick when bounced off a wall. It didn't leave harsh shadows and provided amazing detail. You can see the portraits at [...]***UPDATE***I wrote the above review in 2008. Now in 2012, I'm still using that same diffuser. It basically never comes off my flash. Love, love, love it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Does what it's meant to do.","review":"This diffuser works fine with my 430EX II speedlight. It's not meant to be an easy button for flash photography, you still need to understand how to use it/the flash. But it most certainly helps spread the light more evenly and soften shadows. It fits snug onto the flash and doesn't fall off at all, or add much extra bulk to the flash."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lightweight and works great!","review":"This Omnibounce diffuser is a must-have for indoor shooting, especially when you have walls and ceilings to bounce off of. With this diffuser, some light will be directed toward the subject to fill the face or the shadow under the eyes. It will eat up your Flash power a little but it has never been a problem with me because I am not a professional photographer who shoots like 500 shots in one evening. If that's the case, just carry some spare batteries and you'll be set. I also find it useful outdoor when the subject is under some shade, not in direct sunlight. Last but not least, it's super lightweight and fits my 430EX II perfectly."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simple and easy to use","review":"Purchased this item to use with the Canon Speedlite 430EXii I bought.

From stobist.com (Lighting 101: Bare-Tube-Style Lighting), you should use these to bounce the light off walls and not directly on the subject. It's to create the \\"bare tube\\" or \\"bare bulb\\" effect to light up a room and fill in the shadows in all directions.Note that any diffusion source you use between your flash and subject will likely decrease the amount of light that reaches your subject and may provide a different color cast/tinge to the color of light. You can adjust your exposure compensation and white balance settings as needed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works well with Canon 430EX Speedlite Flash","review":"I purchased this with the Canon 430EX Speedlite Flash.

Even for how cheap it is, it isn't worth it.It also falls off easily"},{"rating":"1","title":"Fits too loosely","review":"I'm going to have to give this a 1-star. I just received it and haven't taken a single photo yet. But I can already tell I'm going to have a frustrating time with it falling off of my 430EX-II.

The diffuser is easy to slip on and will stay on tight unless it's pulled off.This diffuser light to escape in a number of directions (hence omni-bounce)instead of the typical single direction of the flash. The benefit of this is that light is less harsh and because of the bouncing light, there will be less strong shadows and generally more even lighting.You'll notice the biggest difference in shooting portraits as softer, more even lighting is generally more flattering."},{"rating":"2","title":"Big results for little cost","review":"This item works like magic.It was delivered to me in South Africa 2 weeks sooner than the stipulated time (though it was dusty).I was able to get close to natural colour on subjects with no harsh highlights caused by the flash.Its range is not that wide though.

The pictures without the diffuser looked natural, the ones with the diffuser had a brownish tinge to it. Pictures of faces using this diffuser look too tanned and I have to correct the color in my photo processing program. I also find my pictures come out darker with it then without it so it does lose some flash from your 430EX. I find it a nice idea but it also has its problems. I prefer to not use it and bounce the flash whenever possible."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sorry Andre.","review":"I never give up on a novel but in this case I am tempted as I fear I am wasting valuable reading time on, frankly, rubbish. What the hell is the guy trying to say? What are his political ideas? I am half way through the novel and I have no clue as to what he is trying to portray. Is Andre one of those attractive Afrikaan types that the world cannot forgive South Africa for having spawned. His totally uninteresting main character in this uninteresting novel is portrayed as a bitter, unattractive, nasty middle-aged man but he just comes across as a half-drawn, two-dimensional creature, who really only wants to indulge in masturbatory middle-aged fantasies. He does not even know how to swear convincingly! And if the Flemish hell hole he ends up into is as disturbing and grotesque as a Hyeronimous Bosch then I am Winnie Mandela. What a wank! Give me The Power of One or even Wilbur any day."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Hawk Really IS Dying","review":"This is a movie about a man with personal issues who is obsessed about taming a hawk. The characters interact in unusal ways (the main character sets up his love interest with his mentally challenged nephew for sex!) I have to say this was a hard movie to endure. The story line is very unusual and the conversation hard to understand. The actors should have been coached to enunciate! I had to rewind over and over in a few spots and never did figure out what the actor said, so I just gave up and went on. One thing that was interesting about this movie was the insight to taming a hawk, but I wasn't really sold on why the main character would want to do that. Nice packaging and filming, but entertaining? No."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Hawk Was Stillborn","review":"I thought this movie looked like a great nature type feel good movie but it turned out to be a over dramatic dis-jointed bunch of disfunctional weirdos and the dialog sounded like they made it up as they went along and not much of it made any sense.

Few of them sound like the book I read. The one I read did have nonstop action, and no doubt its basic premise is, shall we say, \\"too true to be good.\\" Beyond that, however, the book I read was biblically shallow, had an over-the-top storyline, and contained numerous textual errors. After looking forward to reading it (gift from a friend), I was disappointed to find it so. Did a different book somehow implant itself in my copy of The Rapture Dialogues?"},{"rating":"2","title":"A thoroughly enjoyable book","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed reading this book.

The action, suspense, and even a little romance thrown in was great. Thought it was very interesting how the very first two words were also the last two words. Beginning to end the book has a lot of truth from the scripture references to the details of the individuals that are protrayed.

It was NOT a thriller. No matter what situation or danger our heroes find themselves, they more or less just sit back and God do his thing. Really, the heroes of the book are more like 'on-lookers' as they really don't do anything heroic or adventuresome. No matter the danger they find themselves in, they do absolutely nothing and let the angels of God come and save the day. As a Christian, I have no problems with the issues of faith used in the book. But in the context of a \\"thriller\\" type novel, there is absolutely no suspense because the characters are never in any real danger. They keep reminding themselves throughout the book that \\"God brought us this far, whater happens, He will protect us\\". It doesn't make for much excitement."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rapture Dialogues","review":"Man...this is a good book.....I find it's written by a man with great insight on the times that are perhaps already here...have been here for quite some time...and will continue to manafest itself over the next few years...it's great to beware of what is actually happening...or at the very least what could very well happen....If I knew what to expect...the surprise won't kill me.( in this case....even though the book is a ficticious account) I do know, many parts of this book appear to be based on MANY truths.Couldn't put the book down....God bless you Terry.

Perfect timing!5 out of 5"},{"rating":"2","title":"Well Worth The Read","review":"When I requested my copy of the book, I could not wait to sit down and begin reading it. When it arrived, I sat down that afternoon and began reading and could not stop. Supper that night was a fix your own because I was very interested and could not tear myself away.Terry James has done a wonderful job with this book. He has masterfully explained some of the events that have (and will) happen as the end times draw ever closer. I've always wondered just how aliens/UFOs would fit into end time prophecy, but no one could explain it to me in a way that I could fully understand it until Terry James came along.Please continue the good work that you are doing for the Lord and as you stated on the www.raptureready.com website, may you have time to finish the sequel before the Lord calls all of his believers home.

Within the first couple of pages I realized I was being drawn into a masterful work of intrigue, mystery, and fast-moving twists interspersed with factual Bible Scripture that was going to keep my blood pumping.Historical events encompassing over fifty recent years, seemingly unrelated to each other were brought to life with believable characters engaged in a spiritual warfare that drew this reader into the plot. I couldn't put this book down."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Rapture Dialogues","review":"This was one of those books that I couldn't put down until I finished it. The story is suspenseful, intriguing, and importantly it is based on Scripture. The book covers something that many of us today are fascinated with but know little about-UFO's, Nephilim, and their prophetic connection to our world today.This book is interesting, enlightening, and definitely worth reading!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Must Read!","review":"I've been looking forward since December to read this book. It was worth the wait! This book will keep you on the edge of your seat. It's a fast read, even though very detailed, but full of biblical truth. I highly recommend reading this if you're interested in UFO's, government conspiracies, end times, and the declining morality in our current culture. I also recommend www.raptureready.com for more insightful commentary about the end times we are living in."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pulling It All Together","review":"Mr. James does an excellent job in his latest novel, RAPTURE DIALOGUES, of pulling together information about the Dead Sea Scrolls, UFO sightings, and the general state of spiritual confusion leading up to the end of days. I found the idea that \\"aliens\\" and \\"UFOs\\" were, in fact, demons to be both plausible and thought-provoking. I look forward to more novels from Mr. James, one of Christ's spiritual warriors on this earth."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very exciting book!","review":"I am a little more than halfway through the Rapture Dialogues and, after reading most of the reviews before purchasing the book, I am not disappointed.

Highly recommend."},{"rating":"2","title":"An exciting page turner.","review":"A fast paced, hard to put down page turner. I read most of it the first night.

In the words of Chuck Missler, I too, can't wait for the sequel."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Reading","review":"This book is so exciting and even though it is fictional, it really helps to pull together many ideas about how Satan may carry out his plans. Thank you for a great book and I look forward to reading more."},{"rating":"2","title":"Clever presentation of an old theology.","review":"Although I have read many of Terry's articles on the web I have never read one of his books. He has taken an explanation of Biblical events and has made a very interesting and clever story. We often hear about alien abduction and the \\"what ifs\\" regarding what we don't know about the universe. Terry has masterfully taken these \\"urban legends\\" and has incorporated them into a prophetic story that has a great storyline and is fun to read. I highly recommend this book to everyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Rapture Dialogues","review":"Terry James uses facts mixed with fiction to create a believable story line that is very captivating.

There are rich interesting characters that you care about. The characters are real in that they have their own struggles much like we do. It also demonstrates strong moral truths. For instance, when two young people fall in love, they decide to wait for intercourse. Even if you are not a Christian or don't believe in prophesy, it is an interesting read on what could happen and what could be behind the fascination with aliens and UFOs.If you liked the Left Behind series, you will also like this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great camera backpack","review":"I only have a few lenses for my digital SLR, so this backpack works great for me.

I'm in my second trimester and was looking for something to record my weekly thoughts and pictures in. It is perfect for doing that. Very cute book, fun questions. The ONLY reason I gave this book 4 stars instead of 5, is that it leaves a bunch of space for weekly pictures that I feel are ridiculously early. Who has taken a picture of their bellies at 5 weeks? First of all, there isn't much change and secondly, many women are just finding out they are even pregnant. I really hate that I have several blank pages with no pictures to fill in.Aside from this, get this book if you want a great journal to document your pregnancy in!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This is THE pregnancy journal!","review":"I love this journal! With exhaustion that comes with pregnancy and my lack of \\"crafty\\" skills the belly book makes an awesome keepsake! There's places to put momento's from the shower, how you found out you were expecting, week by week photo's and so much more. This will be my \\"congratulations\\" gift for any of my friends when they find out they're expecting and I plan to buy the baby book as well so that I can document all those precious moments without getting out the scrapbooking gear!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very light hearted","review":"I bought this book as a surprise for my wife 3 months into her pregnancy.

Almost every page of the journal asks for a picture, but if you are anything like me, you do not find pleasure in photographing your body getting fatter and fatter everyday. What I do like to do is write about my feelings about the pregnancy and how things are going, but this book provides very little space for drawn out responses. The prompts are very elementary and generic; I like a little more mental stimulation with my journal prompts. On the whole, it is great for someone who does not want to write that much and who is more visual."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for me! Cute, but a lot of blank space.","review":"I have to agree with other two-star reviewers. While a great concept, it's so rigid! I rarely use it, and I suppose I should catch up, I missed filling out the entire second trimester, I was so uninspired. PLUS, having photos from week one is just asking for empty space! (hello, you're not pregnant at week 1!) Like many others, I don't have a lot of interesting cravings etc so the questions haven't really suited me. Oh well. It's cute!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I wouldn't get this book again","review":"I was excited about this book because it really documents what your thoughts and feelings are throughout your pregnancy. However, once I started doucmenting in the book, I found it asked odd questions (i.e. \\"The size of you\\") and wanted a picture for every WEEK your pregnant. Honestly, who takes a picture of themselves when they're pregnant every week? Plus, I had no noticiable changes until I was about 18 weeks! There are some pages in the book where you answer a list of questions, but at times I could only answer one, then had to remember to go back to that page to answer the other ones when applicable. The other downside I found is that it has a place to tape a picture of your sono's on, which I like but there is no folder in the book to put the sono's to store. There's only a place for 1 picture, but I have about 5 pictures from each sono. It would be nice to have a pocket or folder in the book to store them in."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not What I Expected","review":"Although this book seemed like a great idea I felt as though there was not enough space to really write my own information. I really wasn't a big fan of it, although I did use it. It would have been easier to create a scrapbook of my own."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cute idea but poor execution","review":"I bought this because I thought the idea of tracking belly photos was cute. But this book is bizarre -- it actually has spaces where you're supposed to put belly pics from Week 1 to Week 39. Um, weeks 1-4 are before most people know they're pregnant. Was I supposed to start taking pictures of my belly when I got my last period, just in case I got pregnant that cycle? It makes no sense. Also, since most women aren't showing at all until much later, it's just strange and you end up with a lot of blank pages. I also didn't like that the format of it was so rigid and some of the questions it asks were just dumb and pointless. I never bothered starting it and I'll be donating it the next time I take donation books to the library.

First of all, there is room to put pictures for the first two weeks when one isn't even pregnant in the first two weeks! The trimesters are also off...I believe it says the third trimester starts at week 25, which is not the case!! There are also typos...how did this book get into print!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Recommend to any pregnant woman!","review":"I really loved having this book while I was pregnant with my daughter and I will probably get another one when I have my next child. It's very sweet and gives you silly things to answer and fill out, while giving you plenty of space to write out how you're feeling and what is happening in your pregnancy.The reason I only gave it 4 stars is because almost every page has a huge spot (half page) for a belly picture to be placed every week. I didnt take belly pics every week so a lot of those spaces are blank but if you do plan on taking pictures, every week... this book would be a great place to display them!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice way to create a keepsake","review":"I bought this for my wife, who is expecting our twins in a couple of months. The book itself has great construction quality. It has a sturdy hardcover that fastens shut with a thin blue elastic band. We were both really pleased with the content inside as well, which includes a bunch of questions to be answered by the expectant parent(s), detailing thoughts and feelings throughout the pregnancy. There are also plenty of slots for photos, both of the mother and ultrasound pictures. There is a lighthearted tone throughout the book, so this is geared toward someone who is looking something on the more informal end of the spectrum. We are having a lot of fun filling this out, and think it will make a great keepsake about this time in our lives."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I was looking for","review":"This journal just was not for me.

I did like it a lot. There was a place to put a photo for each week as well as room to write about at each week. They do have some questions they ask you to kind of help you think of things to write. I like how it is divided into trimesters and at the beginning of each stage there are cute questions about what you are craving and what you can't stand! Then in the back it asks you questions and has you write about your labor and delivery. The only thing I wished this book had was a place to write your weight each week or even for each check up. It also could have had an extra page or 2 at each month for the appointments as some people have more than the regular amount of check ups. I ran out of room in my third trimester because of all the appoinments I had each week. Overall, this is a fabulous journal for your pregnancy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A great gift","review":"I bought this book for both my sisters and my best friend.

The day I saw this one, I chuckled at how the pages (shaped like a belly) expanded with each section (trimester). This alone sold me. When I found out months later I was expecting I didn't think twice. I went to work and bought my first and only pregnancy journal. I loved how you had space for your own expanding belly shots and the fun lighthearted nature of the book.

The only thing I could do without is the weekly spots for belly pictures. I would like to have pictures but I don't need them for the first 10 or 12 weeks, so those spots are all blank.

This book is broken down into trimesters and then further divided into your pregnancy week by week. There are spaces for you to record your own reactions and those of family members to your pregnancy, details about cravings, morning sickness, growing stats, appetite changes, mood swings, and just general thoughts about the baby. You are prompted by the author to answer certain questions week by week but there is additional, limited space to add your own comments. I was sold on the blank spaces to attach photos week by week of belly growth and ultrasounds pictures."},{"rating":"1","title":"Really cute journal, but didnt fit my needs","review":"We tried to get pregnant for two years, and when it finally happened I wanted to document everything. I found this book and thought it was adorable. What a neat keepsake. But as my pregnancy went on, I realized that a lot of the sections didn't apply to me.

It's a great idea, but really check out each section and each page before purchasing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too rigid in its format","review":"I was given this book as a gift early in my pregnancy and I thought the format was too rigid. For example, there is only one page for each ultrasound per date, and I had several photos from each appointment. Also, it has pages for \\"belly photos\\" starting at week 1 when you aren't even really pregnant until 3 weeks into your pregnancy and probably don't know your pregnant until much further along.I ended up buying a photo album that had space on each page to write notes, and I can format the pages freely.

It covers everything from when you took your home pregnancy test, how you reacted, who you told, who you Dr is, due date, starting weight, where you plan to deliver, note from each appointment, ultra sound notes and room for pictures, room for pictures of your growing belly, stats from appointments, and a note section at the end of each trimester. Plus it has fun little questions throughout like my complexion is ___ glowing ___ green, I get up to pee ___ times a night. Also has places for popular music, shows, what fashion is popular, etc. This is such a great book! I've really enjoyed filling it out throughout my pregnancy. This book will become my pregnancy gift from here forward, every pregnant woman should have one!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice to have","review":"I bought this when I was 6 weeks along. I'm a scrapbooker, so I really wanted to do a scrapbook journal of my pregnancy, but I'm just so busy (last semester of college) that I was worried I wouldn't keep up with it. It's fun because you can write a little something every week- whatever you want- and you're not stuck commentating on specifics weekly. Some of the pages and prompt throughout the first trimester so far have not applied to me, but it's not a big deal. You can always tear unused pages out. I was a little disappointed in the cover's material (it would scratch easily, IMO), and it was a little smaller than I was envisioning, but I still love it. I keep it by my bed and write in it weekly.

I wanted to record it by journaling, but had bought and returned three journals already (they did not inspire me) before a friend recommended buying this one. The little prompts are perfect, and the picture/word space ratio is pretty good - if I had no picture but lots to write, I would just write where there would have been a picture, or all around the space for the picture. And it's a fun, easy way to share what's going on with my pregnancy without having to tell the same story over and over.

There are many better options out there [at a higher price, of course]. I will be replacing this speaker soon.UPDATE: I replaced this speaker with an Infinity CS60RDT.

I guess people have very low expectations. If I saw these in a retail store, at this price, I would laugh and walk on by. My opinion is that these adjustable trays represent very poor value. Each tray is constucted of three pieces of plastic with a molded, rubberized surface in the compartments. The three pieces are held together with pins that are molded into the middle piece of the tray. Only the two outside compartments are adjustable. THe plastic is not all that durable, as mine arrived with a broken/missing corner (as did another reviewer).

It is set in 1980's LondonIt is told very cleverly (rather too cleverly) from the point of view of each of a cast of characters who write as if trying to get their own points of view across to the reader and analyze each others motives and criticize each other. Normally I dislike these fancy narrative devices (sometimes called post-modern, although you can trace them back to eighteenth century epistolary novels, and addressing the \\"dear reader\\") but Barnes does this so well that I was captivated.The style becomes too fancy when Oliver is the narrator. He is fond of elaborate witticisms and bits of French. The best narrators were Val and the girl in the flower shop.Barnes wrote a sequel \\"Love Etc\\" ten years later, which is set ten years later in the characters' lives.

I furthermore suggest to everybody to RE-READ IT and you will be surprised to find yourself more in accordance with another character than you first did. That's really impressing!

She identifies some of the key characteristics of Neptune, but views them in an almost entirely negative light. What is worse, her descriptions of \\"Neptunian\\" people and problems are done in a condescending and belittling manner. Although she dismisses much religion and spirituality as Neptunian phenomena in a negative sense, her book offers no viable alternatives. There are few constructive suggestions given in this book for the supposed weaknesses of those with hard aspects to Neptune in their charts. Reading this book might lead some \\"Neptunian\\" people to think of themselves as being problematic and of little use to society, and could do more harm than good in many cases."},{"rating":"2","title":"Greene's Neptune is the best book on the subject I've read.","review":"Liz Greene is my favorite astrology writer and I think this is one of her best books.

I read this book with the hope of arriving at some kind of understanding as to why this murder happened. It is impossible to fathom precisely the confluence of circumstances that led to this terrible crime, but Judgement Ridge provides the reader with some measure of insight into the reason why this aweful thing happened. Why did this murder occur? Several circumstances had to intersect: two boys with complementary personality disorders; two sets of laissez-faire parents; a neglectful school system; and a 'boys-will-be-boys' community attitude. This is a cautionary story, and it is not emotionally easy to read. But it is very well constructed and will help those of us who are still dumbfounded by the horror of this crime."},{"rating":"2","title":"judgement ridge","review":"I remember this murder from the news at the time.The authors provided detail about the communities involved, background, and events leading up to the crime.

The Subwoofer has true quality to it and it goes very deep and low.My only gripe is that the monitors aren't nearly on the same level as the sub. While they produce sound with clarity, they lack fullness and power. Setting the speakers up for a movie reveals that even trying to fill a living room with sound can distort the satellites. And on top of that, the satellites are lacking in the midrange as well.

The problem is that any substantial vibration on the desk turns the sound off. There's a problem in the volume dial, which I discovered when it was too late to return the system. It's very annoying to have to tap the dial to restore volume. Additionally, sometimes the volume cuts out and the on/off feature of the volume control dial doesnt work at all, so the computer has to be shut down completely and turned on again. That's an odd problem -- sometimes you can't turn the power to volume on, and sometimes you can't turn it off. Must be a wiring or soldering problem.

It's very convenient.

However, since day one the speaker plug-in ports on the sub woofer have had connectivity problems. I've had to wiggle my sub woofer or the wires themselves to actually get the sound to come through. This leads me to believe they are cheaply made. On another note the \\"power on\\" button on the control box has recently had response issues. I try to turn the power on or off and find myself trying multiple times to get it to respond.

Very durable, very fun to play with, and it actually shows how an uruk-hai crossbow works! Acceceries: helmet, five arrows, and a crossbow. (The helmet is a bit bendy, but I usually don't have the helmet on him, so I don't worry about it.) I think the splattered mud on the uruk-hai's armor is very realistic, since in the two towers the uruk-hai were running through dirt while it was raining. The box for the uruk-hai says it's from the return of the king, but in the movie I bet it has a flashback of the battle for helm's deep. If this reveiw comes up after the return of the king movie it'll sound silly that I said \\"I bet it'll have a flashback of the battle for helm's deep.\\" But anyways it is a good toy and great for a collector or a child that likes uruk-hai...This is a great toy! A must-have for any Lotr fan!"},{"rating":"1","title":"eh.......","review":"I was gonna buy this book when it 1st came out but never got the chance. I had never seen the inside of it until recently.

While it may not be the best tubed cream, it is certainly better than anything that comes out of a can, plus it does not leave your face dry like some glycerin based soaps.

It's emotional, awe inspiring, and an absolute pleasure to read. We so often hear our Astronauts talking about the technical side of their work, but rarely do we get a look at the human side. If you ever wanted to know what it feels like to be on a shuttle, or just get a sense of the exhilaration of space flight, buy this book.It features short musings from many of the shuttle program's astronauts, and includes some of the most beautiful photos from the program's 20+ years.It's a shining example of how great our nation's space program is, through the eyes of our brave astronauts. Any fan of the space program should definitely add this book to his or her coffee table!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book, would like to see updated version","review":"I checked this book out, and enjoyed it very much.

Maybe even include a DVD too?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Breathtaking photos! Great anecdotes!","review":"Wonderful. Not a dry science book, but human and very real stories from the shuttle crews of the last 20 years... their favorite and most memorable moments and photos. It reads like diary entries, or postcards home. Very real and human descriptions, not dry. It captures the wonder and excitement of the program in a way nothing I've ever read has, and gave me a real insight into some of the aspects of daily life on the shuttle, the real fears, the fun, the stress. Also nice to see women astronauts! What an inspiration!

Jacqui McShee does some background scat vocals on 2 cuts where her voice is used as just one more instrument.Unfortunately the Album design could not be any more bland & banal.

Although written for upper elementary or middle school students, I found this book entertaining and informative for adults. The book goes into a great deal of detail not just about Helen's childhood, but examines all periods of her life: college, lecture tours around the country, her various writings, and her relationship with Annie Sullivan and later companions/assistants. The author does a great job of putting into perspective Helen's public fame and her inner determination to contribute to society as an independent woman who wanted to be defined by more than her sensory limitations."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Contrarian Perspective","review":"Among the reviewers, I am in a minority that does not think this book is such a high achievement. It is a mixture of facts and speculation, with theoretical terminology superimposed upon them. There is no clear criterion why some facts are included and others are excluded, and I have no idea what the lesson of this book is supposed to be. In fact, this is a self-indulgent exercise in historical erudition. I don't care what anybody else says, this is a philosophy rather than history book. The author gives a lot of facts, but he also frequently mistakes logical constucts for facts. The author tries to integrate almost everything under the Sun into this tome, and that is why he ends up with a bloated work that oppresses the reader with needless information."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad Book","review":"I got this book because of its Directshow chapters. The book says \\"Jumpstart Guide\\" and it is true that starts describing basic concepts like progressive and interlaced frames. However, a few pages later assumes you know all about DirectX. The book tell you that all explanations about installing and interfacing filters are in the CD, but the CD, that is oriented to Visual C 5 and DirectX 4, doesn't match the book at all (i.e. the examples are different) and has even empty files. I don't know about the other chapters, but the Directshow and filter creation chapters are a waste of time.

Well written, neatly organized, and highly informative, this is the ideal guide for anyone considering adding a new dog to the family. Unlike other books, this one lists all the breeds in alphabetical order rather than by AKC classification, a great feature for anyone who wants to refer back to a breed, but can't remember if their choice belongs in the terrier, non-sporting, or working group. In addition to accurate and detailed breed profiles (and there are LOTS of them), there is a plethora of information designed to help the future dog owner make the right selection: matching the right breed to your lifestyle, tips on finding a qualified breeder, pedigree terminology, health issues, and so forth.

I knew I wanted a small dog but didn't realize the different breeds and some really important characteristics that dogs have. This book was excellent in telling me the dogs' habits, what kinds of environments they need to be in, their health problems, and even what dogs not to pick out of the litter. It even gives you tips on how to recognize a dog that isn't a true breed; and with the detailed pictures that are contained within I am very confident that I will pick a perfect dog for me.

It's really sad to think some people have probably chosen the wrong breed for themselves or missed out on a wonderful breed of dog due to this book.

The tool will work without issues when bolted down using some grade 8 bolts, but the provided pins are not up to the task of holding down a crank pulley which will always require high torque.In the end, if you got to go out and buy additional bolts to make this tool usable, you might as well buy 2 bars of steel and 3 bolts instead of 2 to make this very same tool for a fraction of the cost.This tool is being sent back."},{"rating":"2","title":"Got the pulley off","review":"I used this to remove the pulley off a power steering pump on a 1991 Honda Accord.

Did I miss something?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Megan's Mystery","review":"I felt this book had a deep and powerful understanding of what true love is. I understand now that some love can be forbiding and sometimes makes it worth the risk. There is some racial controversy in this book, that makes you feel closer to the characters. We also enjoyed reading this book because we were adopted, so it felt like we had something in common. Chandler really brings you closer to their lives and makes you have an intimate relationship with them. It keeps you guessing until the end, you never will see it coming.Megan is attracted to her snob cousin (she is adopted). She looked into his eyes and felt an immediate connection, even though she didn't want to be attracted to him. Her grandmother though a little odd, and eccentric she ends up in the end of the book surprising you. The house even though mysterious has some secrets of it own...Luv ya"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good!","review":"I read this book in about 2 hours. Thats how good this book was.

This is not the case with this CD, oh no. Poor 2 mins attempt at speed-punk metal, it is annoying music for 80% of this CD, you do not even feel like headbanging.

Dive towards The Art of Rebellion instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"There are much better ways to spend your money...","review":"...and one of them is to buy a copy of the first Suicidal Tendencies album, which contains most of the tracks here. You might also get Join The Army, which contains two of the tracks on Still Cyco. Those two actually sound better here than in their original form, but only because the sound on JTA is atrocious. The tracks from the first album are immaculately rendered here, but along with the rough edges much of the passion that made Suicidal Tendencies such a great album is gone on Still Cyco.I originally bought this when it was first released. I got rid of it three months later."},{"rating":"1","title":"Get the first LP Instead","review":"I Dont understand the reason for this release? maybe theyhad an album quota they had to meet or their wallets were a bit light,In any case,Get the first lp, its a hundred times betterI gave it 2 stars because the songs are great,it's just thereon another album."},{"rating":"1","title":"DESCECRATION AND BLASPHEMY...THEY SHOULD BE ASHAMED!","review":"OK, great, let's take some of the finest early works of the thrash/punk crossover metal movement and rework them into happy-happy-joy-joy sing-along tunes.

I don't see how a young child can follow the concept, and even as an adult, I didn't find it entertaining. The illustrations are very good, and we made up our own story to keep our daughter's attention. We looked up the reviews for this and were surprised to see how many positive ratings it had received.

It came with all the accessories and they also were in brand new condition. I did the vac comparison with my Oreck XL and the Dyson won hands down, I could not believe the dirt and dog hair the Dyson picked up. Also the Dyson Full Kit is last years model, it is replaced this year with the Full Gear model, it is the same vac, but the color is different. It is a great deal for $229, thats half the price of the full gear model at Best Buy. I would highly recommend this product"},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than I hoped for","review":"What a bargain! I got this reconditioned Dyson upright vacuum, and it has performed extremely well. It has pulled dust and dirt even after I had vacuumed a section of carpet with my old vacuum cleaner, and it has attachments and extensions which are very easy to handle. All this and for a fraction of the cost! If not for the \\"reconditioned\\" stamp on the box, you would never know it was a factory reconditioned unit. We need more stuff like this to cut costs down."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Vacuum !!!!","review":"We bought the Dyson DC07 Full Kit on Amazon as reconditioned. The shipping was fast and the vacuum looked brand new. It came with all the attachments and booklets. If the box had not stated that this was a factory reconditioned model we would have swore it was brand new.The vacuum works great with powerful suction. There was an astonishing amount of dirt in the canister after just a couple of passes over our living room carpet.The wand takes some getting used to and is a little awkward when in use, but it more than makes up for it with it's suction power.The bare floor and mini turbo animal tools are nice but not worth the extra $100 for them (price of a new DC07 animal compared to the base model). If your thinking of getting a vacuum look no further than this Remanufactured Dyson. I believe this model is exclusive to Costco and retails for $430.00 brand new."},{"rating":"1","title":"dyson doesnt deliver","review":"this vacuum was the worst vacuunm i ever owned. the suction was horrible, no power! i bought the purple animal and i hated it! dont waste your money. if i couldve given less than 1 star i wouldve."},{"rating":"2","title":"What a great vacuum. Excels in all areas","review":"We had been wanting a Dyson for the longest time. with all the great reviews, and our next door neighbors (moved here from UK and had a Dyson) high recommendation. The price was just a little to steep for us, but when i found the reconditioned one here at Amazon for almost half of the new price, we jumped on it. Glad we did. We love this vacuum. We used a Hoover and Dirt Devil in the past and this one beats them both easily. it's quiet, easy to empty, and the attachments work great, especially the mini turbo tool. the turbo tool is great for cleaning out the car, and upholstery. we did the old vacuum with the previous vacuum cleaner, then the Dyson, and sure enough, the Dyson picked up tons of stuff the other left behind.Highly Recommended!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"Like New\\"?? Factory-Reconditioned?? What a Disappointment","review":"Never had the opportunity to even use the machine, as it was shipped missing a part. Even condition of packing was poor, as corrugated inserts were folded and torn. Machine was dusty, as though prior mishap during emptying and never cleaned. Rubber seals inside canister were (1) creased, so as not to make a proper seal with canister lid, and (2) filthy, as in coated in whatever muck the previous owner put through the machine. Likewise, the interior of the canister was caked with filthy residue. I've purchased factory reconditioned items before, but not have arrived in this poor condition. So much for the great deal! Caveat Emptor!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Vacuum!!!!","review":"I love this vacuum, it is one of the best purchases I have made. I only have one complaint...it is kind of a pain to pull the wand out of the hose to use the attachments. Really though, it is not too big of a deal, it just takes a little extra time. The pet attachment is a must have if you need to vacuum pet hair off furniture...I love that thing. It is really easy to empty, and so far just like they say, it has never lost suction. I couldn't be happier with it!! The color is cool too!! :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Incredible machine","review":"It never stops!

Strong performer compared to others with similar specs, even if it is a little more expensive."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best at a reasonable price","review":"This is by far the best vacuum cleaner on the market, especially for animal hair. I bought one at full price over a year ago and thought it was worth it. Now I've purchased a reconditioned one for my daughter at half price, and she loves it. It arrived with all the attachments and no scuffs or scratches, looked brand new and functions the same. If you have pets, this is the only way to go.

This book could be a valuable tool for the individual with limited coverage. However, the coding system is so overwhelming, with widely differing prices for what appears to be the same procedure. For example, I counted 15 different laparoscopic pelvic procedures for endometriosis. Determining what an actual fee should be based on this book is difficult. And it is doubtful you would find a doctor's office staff willing to explain why a certain service was billed under a certain code.

I don't think I'll watch this many more times, because I simply can't stand hearing someone singing so terribly."},{"rating":"2","title":"Oh boy......","review":"This is not an actual review of the concert, but the DVD itself. I purchased this thinking I'd get the concert in whole, but I guess I should've known that my copy which costs two dollars cheaper wouldn't be the complete package. Cause the DVD I purchased is missing the songs, Spoonman, Heaven's Dead, Shadow On The Sun, and Black Hole Sun. All of which I would have REALLY liked to hear. The case doesn't mention that there's another COMPLETE version available anywhere, so I'm very disappointed in the poor advertising. Just don't make the mistake I made, be sure to check the back of the case to make sure you're buying the ENTIRE package.

I can't believe that you guys are ragging on Cornell's singing so much. I've listened and watched this DVD probably more times than any of you, and each time I do, I wonder even more what you guys are talking about. Have you ever been to another live concert? Have you ever heard any other band live? So Cornell's voice isn' the same as it is on the album, so what? There's a reason why they record all of that in a studio, where they preform any given song time after time and edit the notes where Chris might've been a little flat or a little hoarse. After listening to this DVD for a long time and comparing Cornell to every other vocalist I've heard live, he's so much better than them, it's insane. I hardly notice a difference between the album and the concert in some songs. You guys have no reason to complain.This is a historic DVD, and it's the best live concert I've ever heard."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor quality recording","review":"1. This DVD is only in stereo. While I appreciate that it was filmed in Cuba, I still would have expected Audioslaves first DVD to be of a decent quality. I just really didnt feel that it captured their sound very well.

After watching the DVD I honestly can't believe the band actually released a show with such a horrendous vocal performance from Chris Cornell. I've always considered Chris one of the top rock vocalists, but he is awful on this DVD. He is truly painful to listen to, especially since the band sounds so good.Audioslave should be ashamed to release this DVD."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good view","review":"Although the sound quality is lacking (see other reviews) it is not terrible and in hindsight of what ultimately happened with Audioslave, this is a great video. Tom Morello is as amazing to watch as he is to hear. One underlying theme I couldn't shake myself of during the viewing was why the heck did Cuba get a free Audioslave concert? Does Castro even allow their CDs into the country???"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for Audioslave fans","review":"This is a great concert for Audioslave fans. They are one of my favorite bands, and this is a great concert. Audioslave plays a set of around two hours. The set is great, but Chris Cornell cannot sing Rage Against the Machine songs. Fortunately, he only attempts one.I do wish the DVD was in 5.1. This might be a big issue for some, but I can live with it.I was disappointed by the bonus CD, as it only contains four songs, which Audioslave played for AOL. I would have liked to have at least some of the songs from the concert, but the CD isn't bad.All in all, if you are big Audioslave fan, you should own this. It might not be essential for more casual fans."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cornell should get sober","review":"Seriously. He is so high or something, that he is spaced out, he can hardly sing on key, and he has no energy during the set. It ruined my image of Audioslave.

Cornell's voice is extremely horse throughout, and makes it painful to listen to if you are expecting what he is usually capable of. I wish I had read the Amazon reviews before buying this. Please heed my warning and do not buy this thing. Get the CDs instead if you have not yet."},{"rating":"1","title":"I still can't believe","review":"that Audioslave approved the release of this DVD!! Don't get me wrong, I love their cd's but this was not what I expected. It's pretty bad when the documentary is better than the concert. Chris's voice sounded terrible thoughout the whole show, the editing is poor with delays between audio & video and cutting between songs. The topper was Chris trying to sing Rage.. he should know better. Don't waste your money on this one, plenty of other great DVD's out there."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disappointing","review":"I waited for ages to buy this title because I knew many people had commented on the terrible singing by Chris. In the end curiosity got the better of me and I bought it.I wish I hadn't. It doesn't matter if this was an historic event or whether you prefer Soundgarden or Rage...the fact is that the singing is so bad it is almost unbearable.

Everything about this game is better. More characters, better graphics, and more modes. And what I think is a big up is luigi's popularity. He even has his own clone thing and a girlfriend. The ownly bad thing is mario's voice has changed. He sounds like a girl!! Overall A powerful 10/10.Keep the mario games coming nintendo!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Mario Golf? or Mario Sleep - Fest?","review":"I have one thing to say about this game, BOOOOOOOOOOOOORING.

It's slow, it's repetitive, it's boring. I played this game for 7 minutes and it seemed like i keep play the same holes over and over again. The controls weren't very good, not much to this game. The graphics are what you'd expect from Gamecube, but thats about all the good things i can say about this game. If you must play, RENT it, if it's over 2 dollars to rent skip it, or i'll sell you mine dirt cheap!!I HATED THIS GAME!"},{"rating":"1","title":"great game, bad experience with supplier","review":"I have rented this game for my son several times and he loves it so I thought I would purchase it for him for Christmas. Unfortunately, it is scratched so badly that it will not play.

Was Mr. Kong. Weird seeing a gorilla (not to mention dinosoaur)playing golf. Neverthless,I bought this game and you know what, I may have one controller but the game is still fun dammit and let's not forget the graphics, Wow.. It's getting great reviews as well.Bottom line, what do you have to lose buy purchasing this game? And if you like Mario then it's not a hard decision to make. At least he and Luigi can relax w/o any trouble.Princess Peach is one hot babe as well. I know I know I'm a sick twisted person. :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"This Will Be A Great Game!","review":"Mario Golf 64 was a fun game to play, but Mario Golf Toadstool Tour should be better. I played this games as a demo at a local game store. It took me a while to get the hang of the controls, but hey, all games take a while to get used to the controls. I was having trouble with the distance grid and getting a close up on the hole. After a while I got the hang of it, and started getting a birdie on the holes. I rated this game 4 stars because the graphics are amazing, the sound is okay, gameplay is great, and overall it is a fun game. I will definitely buy it when it comes out. Give this game some time, and you will see that this game is fun, and enjoyable. When I saw a movie on the computer about it, it looked really complicated, but it isn't. This game will be a hit!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Game of Golf Mario/Nintendo style","review":"I am not a golf fan by any means but I had a real blast playing this golf game. The gameplay is deep with several different modes to play. I like the tournament mode the best and play as either Mario or Luigi or sometimes Waluigi or Daisy Even if you don't know the difference between a 9 iron or a putter or have never ever played golf expect for watching the golf channel you should rent this and then after your addicted to it go out and buy it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than the 64 Version","review":"Mario Golf: Toadstol Tour Has over 10 different play modes, better handling and better graphics then the origional.

Yes There are even secret players to unlock."},{"rating":"2","title":"nintendo hits a birde","review":"It is amazingly fun, the graphics are wonderfull, and the courses are amazing!I played with my sister and we had the time of are lives.

It is a cute toy, but I found many things that I don't like about it. First of all the chariot does not stay attached to the dolphins. Every time my daughter plays with it, it comes apart and then she gets angry. Secondly, our star button on the side is supposed to play the music and make the chariot light up. Our botton doesn't work. The lights and music on her chariot appear 'stuck.' It keeps playing over and over until my daughter just turns it off. So, it is cute, but try to get it on sale as it is not worth $35.00."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poorly made!","review":"I don't usually write reviews but had to voice my opinion on this toy. I agree with the other review that the dolphins do not stay attached to the chariot and this frustrates my 4-year-old daughter! Also our dolphins fall off and the one that is supposed to flip around gets stuck and does not flip half the time. All that being said, she loves it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for a Little Mermaid fan","review":"My 4 yr old daughter received this for Christmas. By the end of the day, the dolphin section of the Chariot was in pieces all over the living room- it does not stay on with the rest and it just got annoying to try to keep it together. However, she loves the carriage part and had fun putting Ariel and her Barbie friends in the seat.Be aware that the Ariel doll is sold separately- make sure the child who's getting the chariot already has one, or you should get her one along with the chariot. It would probably be no fun without the Ariel doll to put in it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poorly made for the price","review":"I bought this for my 5yr old grandaughter against my better judgement and my judgement was correct. Not only do the dolphins not stay on, the clasp on the carrage which would hold Ariel in her seat broke and we needed to use a rubber band to hold her in. In all not a great toy and I definately would not recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Did not last long","review":"This battery was a waste of money for me.

They recorded an entire album of new material, and the record company didn't like it because they strayed from their \\"ballad rock\\" style, so the album remained unreleased. The two tracks from that unreleased album are worth the price of this rare import two disc set."},{"rating":"2","title":"historical account of the Texas cattle feeding industry","review":"An a amazing account of the birth to present day state of the Texas cattle feeding industry.

Mildly disapointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Everything it said it was","review":"I bought this mat for my nephews and they LOVE it. It's loads of fun for kids & practical for parents, as they can easily fold it up and carry a few cars or whatever in it. Great buy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect","review":"Tonight this supplied my son with hours of independent play, he pulled out all of his car stuff and even some things to build a neighborhood."},{"rating":"1","title":"won't last with regular use","review":"My son (4) is a car/truck fanatic. We've had this mat for 2 months now, and while he LOVES it, the papery-plastic where the road layout is separating from the mat. I think it will probably be unusable in another month or two. I should have known better that such regular use needed a more durable product.the ability to fold up into a box was a big hit however, makes cleanup fun for the kids, and didn't need another place to put all the transportation toys. The layout itself is also a bit hit. This would be a great product if it wasn't so cheaply made. I don't regret buying it, because it is pretty inexpensive, but I would have sprung for something sturdier if I'd realized it would be coming apart this soon.Updated: We replaced this product for a car road rug from Ikea (Lekplats) - the same price, and it has lasted 3 years now and still going strong."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cute idea...cheap product.","review":"This is just the product I was looking for as I searched the internet all month for the perfect toy for my car-loving 23 month old son. I was so excited to find this cute playmat. When I recieved it I was alittle worried about the durability, but my son loved it Christmas morning! It is now the day after Christmas and this morning I realized that the paperlike covering is peeling off of the mat, leaving white spots all over the cute town/road side of the playmat. It had not even been open for 24 hours. I am sad, because my son loves it, but the peeling stuff is a choking hazard so I had to put it up. The funny thing is, my son is young and has been very gentle with this mat. I wonder how fast it would have fallen apart if I had a 5 or 6 year old son!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A week after Christmas...","review":"I ended up throwing this mat out, as the printed design, which is made of a thin plastic sheet, cracked at the seams, and pealed right off. My grandson did have fun PEALING it off the mat though! NOT WORTH THE MONEY!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Great concept - not a strong enough material","review":"I bought this for my 1 year old grandson for Xmas - - it worked great he loved the colors and rolling his trucks over the mat. I also loved how it folded up to store all the trucks when his attention diverted to another toy.The unfortunate part is it now has a rip in the seam and before long will be thrown out or used only for storage cube."},{"rating":"2","title":"Grandson's favorite place to drive","review":"We purchased this for our grandson's second Christmas. He immediately enjoyed pushing his \\"Matchbox-size\\" cars around the mat, accompanied with his versions of motor noises. A year later, he still plays on it and likes to remind me to stay on the marked streets if I choose to take a shortcut through someone's lawn.The concept of the mat is very good. A vinyl surface that is simple to clean/disinfect and the ability to be folded into a carrying case for toys etc. is again, very good. Although ours has held up very well for about 18 months, the surface material would probably not stand up to aggressive play or toys that might pierce the vinyl."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dual purpose","review":"This product is great and sturdy. Easy to fold into a tote to carry the cars your kid plays with on this mat. It isn't too big and both my kids love it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a great mat...","review":"I am not thrilled with this product. Others might like it, but I find it too bumpy and just cheesy. The color is good, but my kid, who loves roads to play cars on, is not interested in using this at all."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great play mat for my son","review":"My son loves this. He is 3 and 1/2 and he loves cars, and he was really excited when I have him this playmat. It is also REALLY awesome that it folds up into a storage box for all of his cars. It's very easy to fold up and unfold, and it is easy to clean also if something gets spilled on it."},{"rating":"2","title":"No brainer for boys who like cars","review":"My two yr old son happily plays with this 10-20mins at a time. With two dozen+ little cars this gives him a good playground. The imprinting is good, so far it holds up well, and for the price you just cant go wrong."},{"rating":"2","title":"Versatility","review":"I liked this convertible playspace, mainly for keeping clutter to a minimum. It is slightly difficult to turn it into a box, but once you get the hang of it, you'll find the box is more entertaining for the children. the screening is kind of cheap, after 2 months of use, it started peeling off, so I threw mine away. But, it served its purpose, my kids had fun playing with it, but don't miss it now that it's gone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very nice in the beginning","review":"This toy is great in the beginning and we love that it can fold up and was easy for us to travel with it. We would fold it in a box and use it to carry toys when we went to hotels or grandparents houses but it does not hold up well at all. The whole top starts peeling up if it is played with very much at all. I am so disappointed in this product especially for what I paid for it! Very cheaply made!"},{"rating":"1","title":"It started pealing after one week","review":"I was fun for my 2yr old but only after one week the image started to peal off this play matt value should be $5 not $15 there for it sucks."},{"rating":"2","title":"Imagination","review":"My kids love this durable, washable mat. Even my little girl likes to play with cars on it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Road wear, lol!","review":"Although my boys love love this \\"road\\", my littlest (8 months) is able to rip off the top part where the road folds are coming apart at the worn seams and he has eaten the plastic, choked and thrown it up. I glued the seams tightly when I noticed this was starting to happen, but obviously to no avail. We love it so much I want another one, but surely would like a better product. If I wasn't around for a few seconds, he could have suffocated."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Mat","review":"I have a 7 month old little girl so I was reluctant to get this mat cause it looked too boysish but I am glad I did. She loves it! I also got her Fisher-Price Little People Wheelies All About Trucks & she was content with just the mat & her cars (usually I have a lot more toys laying out to keep her entertained.) I love this mat because if she spits up I can easliy wipe it down saving me from having to costantly do laundry. I also love how it folds up & can carry all her favorite tummy time toys. I finally have my living room back as I don't have a baby jungle gym & toys scattered all about. This will also be convienient when going to Grandma's & Grandpa's house & can be set up anywhere. It was definatley worth the money & if it wears out like some reviews say then I will buy another - they are cheap enough."},{"rating":"1","title":"cute but flimsy","review":"I agree with the other reviewer..this mat while adorable does not hold up well at all.

High caliber songs all the way through. Some particularly great songs include the opening track \\"The Gayatri\\" (At Sunrise), \\"In A Sense\\", the ending song \\"I Will Remember\\", and certainly many others you may like even more. Great album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Jody Rawks!","review":"When I first heard Jody's music, I was blown away. There is a soothing melodic tone to her voice that makes you want to hear more and more and more... As you dig a bit deeper, you quickly realize that there is much more to her music than her beautiful voice. The stories she tells in her lyrics are thought provoking and rich with meaning. I instantly became a fan. With the release of her latest, PIVOT, she further displays her diversity, sense of humor, and love for life. I think I speak for many when I say, \\"I hope there is another collection of music on the way!\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"You get what you pay for","review":"I was desperately waiting for this book to become available. I owned the original and it was amazing. This book is small and some of the most memorable photographs are missing. The $23.10 that I paid for this book could have gone toward the cost of a used copy of the original. Calling it \\"Allure by Diana Vreeland\\" is a disgrace."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great read","review":"(Full disclosure--Frank Heavey and I played soccer together in high school.) I had a very hard time putting down \\"Dying to Sea,\\" and finished it in just a couple of sittings. Heavey manages to create a sense of tension early and maintain it throughout the entire book. If Hollywood isn't already interested in this book, they should be. At no time could I predict where the plot was going. Details that come up early in the book figure into the plot later on in a way that always pushed me to think hard, but were never so complex as to be impossible to recall. A great read, whether or not you know the author!"},{"rating":"1","title":"This is an out-of-date program","review":"My nephew, now a Ph.D. candidate in math, LOVED the early version of Math Blaster I gave him when he was in Kindergarten. I thought that my twins who are first graders would also find it to be a fun way to practice the math they are learning. I was disappointed when I discovered that the software, which was advertised as being \\"for Mac,\\" was only compatible with a much older OS than OS 10.7. So we are not able to use this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not quite up to par with Herriot..... BUT","review":"While Younker's gift for story telling is not quite up to the level of a James Herriot, who is? All that aside it is one of the most entertaining comtemporary books written by an American veterinarian. It is definitely on a par with David Taylor's \\"Zoo Vet\\".Lucas Younker's love for animals and compassion show throughout the book. While nonconventional for that time, he would hardly draw a second glance today. One of my first thoughts after reading this book was \\"I wonder if he is still in practice\\" and \\"I wish he could care for my pets\\".All in all, it is a somewhat salty and probably much more realistic portrayal of a vet's life, but yet still manages to touch you and make you feel his passion for animals."},{"rating":"1","title":"Torn in 2 weeks in city driving alone!","review":"Installed new shocks for the rear of my 1999 Toyota Sienna van; bought these boots to protect my investment but 2 weeks after installation, upon inspection found both boots to be torn.

This book covers a huge problem going on today in the United States, and MAY help to direct some attention toward the problem. For legal thriller fans, this one is a \\"MUST READ\\"! You will not be disappointed with the story, the characters, the non stop action, or the ending. Highly recommend it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Can't remember what it was about!!","review":"This was a very light read. I was very disappointed. I don't feel that the authors spent much time at all on these stories. Sandy Blair's was okay, but could have been bulked up a little. There just wasn't enough there. I read one of the other ones (I don't remember which one), but I only skimmed through the last one. It was about a fairy or a wood sprite or something. Karen Marie Moning does otherworldly stuff far, far better. I should have just waited until her next book comes out. This book really was a waste of time."},{"rating":"2","title":"enter a whole new world","review":"I picked up this book by chance, but it sucked me in straight away. The story might remind you of some old favorites - anything from the Lord of the Rings trilogy to a good, old-fashioned Western - but the world Schimschal creates is clearly his own. His band of post-apocalyptic rebels fighting a dark empire includes two boys on a rite of passage, a rancher and soldier-of-fortune seeking revenge for the death of his wife, a noble mutant-hippo warrior, and a psychic priestess haunted by terrifying prophetic dreams. Schmischal's writing is brisk and absorbing, the pacing is great, and the book is a real page-turner - I found myself finishing it in two long sittings. As the cliff-hanger ending indicates, this is the first volume of a longer series, and I'm definitely going to be waiting for the sequel. If you're into SciFi, thrillers, adventure stories, or Westerns, I'd recommend this book, which combines some of the best of all worlds."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun Playset !!","review":"This toy is durable, has tons of plastic accessories and is worth every penny !

The ones that hold 20 and 12 guage would have to be squeezing the crap outta the 12 guage shells. The part that holds the shells is actaully a sleeve that is over the belt that clips together. That way you could slide it over a different strap of any kind, like a scabbard shoulder strap or a backpack shoulder strap. Makes it a little more versatile than the others out there.

My advice to Polanski fans: see the movie, skip the book. It's almost a word-for-word adaptation of the film (written, surprisingly enough, in the present tense). The film makes for an interesting (if somewhat misogynist) experience . . . but reading the story without benefit of the imagery or pacing of the film proves to be rather dull."},{"rating":"1","title":"buttons wear out","review":"This phone functions fine, but doesn't handle much use.

I could not have both of them on the slide at the same time without it deflating.The other problem we had was that we could never get the water positioned quite right to make them go fast. Several times my kids would lean against the walls of the slide, and they would fall off. It was probably about 6 feet high. Luckily they are though, and got up laughing. I would have hated to have a trip to the hospital.We have purchased 2 more of these from Banzai, and they are better quality, better material, and the designs are better.

Generally, the rhythms here sound more natural, as if produced by actual musicians on actual instruments (although the calmly, looped rhythms of \\"Never Meant to Be\\" evoke a certain sadness). The organic/electronic mix skews slightly more towards the organic here, but the balance is still well maintained.

What's entirely unsatisfactory is the sound quality of Amazon's offering. For some reason, the dialogue is very quiet, even muffled, even at volumes where the music and sound effects get uncomfortably loud. It's hard to say what went wrong, or when: Maybe it's a problem with how the recording plays back; maybe it's an issue of how different tracks were preserved; it might even be that the original dialogue recordings were subpar. Whatever the reasons, it's a thoroughly disappointing and even unpleasant experience.David N.

I liked this book quite a bit. The reason I liked it was because it doesn't have very many boring areas. If it was boring in a spot it wasn't that bad. The book The Golden Aquarians was also a good book that I would rate the same as I Wear the Morning Star because they both have their good and boring parts. This book is also like the book Bear Stone they both have Native Americans as the main characters and they both have trouble making friends so they both cause trouble at school. This book has a good story. It was sad at times because no one wanted to be Sitko's friend so they would treat him crulely and ignore him. Even later on in the story his brother began to ignore Sitko because he didn't do what he was asked. When he does make a friend no one wants him to be around because of his religion."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better Than Expected","review":"Great product.

They also asked me whether or not I had Skype installed on my computer and told me I should reboot the computer.That it doesn't plug into the computer is something that Linksys' tech support just couldn't understand about their own product (which they knew so little about that they actually asked me to describe it and to explain how it works). What a joke!!!! I wasted about 3-4 hours on this....."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good product","review":"I had been using an adapter that allowed me to place Skype calls using my regular cordless telephone hooked to my computer (a mac).

I brought it over, unpacked it and found that the two Power adaptors (base station and phone charger) are set at 120V input. Much of the world, and the UK, is at a 220 to 240 standard.

I was looking for Skype phone for my parents in India that did not need a computer as they found operating a PC cumbersome. Linksys is the best brand there for communication access equipment and Amazon is the best place to buy stuff. Skype is the best IP voice provider and its Skype-In service clubs very well with this product. All in all a very satisfactory product and worthy buy.

Doesn't show/alert when another party is trying to text Chat with you. Landline calls just good, not excellent. I bought this not for the main telephone in the house, but to help us become independent from the PC. Definitely good for its VoIP purpose and that is why I wouldn't buy any extra extensions for now.You can be logged in the same skype login at the same time at the phone and PC. When someone calls you...both, the PC and the CIT400 will ring, which is good.No, you cannot see someone's webcam through the phone.Each extension can have different logins, so I would only buy extensions if I wanted to manage telephone expenses at home ;).Easy plug & play and good user's experience."},{"rating":"2","title":"CIT 400 Good option but some","review":"I've bought this one based upon reviews that I've read here at amazon.

Unfortunately it didn't and I had to install Linksys own antenna too.Than I needed to go after a spare RJ-45 cable + an Ethernet switch-hub to connect it to Airport Extreme2nd thing is that when you got the product's handset on it's base for recharging, it's screen keep all the time back-lighted.

I also bought a Skype USB computer adapter. With the adapter, your computer must always be on and the adapter does not ring multiple phones. Without this phone I don't think SkypeIn would be very usable. This phone, with Skype, acts just like a regular landline. Your computer does not have to be on or running Skype. I should get another one of these phones to have an extension upstairs but I was planning to use the USB adapter for this. If I want to save myself a lot of headaches I should just buy another CIT400 and forget about the adapter."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great device","review":"Great little device-allows me to combine my VOIP phone and regular landline into one device. A skype client actually runs on the phone and if you get a incoming call on your skypein, both the phone and the skype program on my computer ring. This is a much better functionality than vonage. When making outgoing calls you can choose to call over the landline or skypeout or regular skype. The communication between the handset and the base uses proprietary, low power communication, allowing the battery life to run for days on a single charge rather than what one would expect if it was using wifi. Only reason to give it 4 stars is that the first unit I got had a defective scree and i had to return it. The replacement works great."},{"rating":"1","title":"Item was returned","review":"The item arrived with a faulty installation CD. The CD id not actually contain the instalation software.

Set up was easy -- it took no more than 5 minutes (the base unit auto-detects the phone and goes onto the internet The only thing you have to do is log in using your Skype username and phone number). The first time charging of the phone was a bit long, but the talk time is good and recharge time is very quick. I have a large colonial style home. I located the main unit next to my Linksys wireless hub in the central part of the house. From this position, the phone stays in range no matter where I wander in the house. Audio quality is fine and I have gotten good reports from people I talk to."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works perfect !","review":"It works great as mentioned. No issues at all in connecting to internet and logging into skype network. Even outgoing calls are good.I see 2 draw backs with this.

Second is we cannot use regular answering machine to record voice mail.Overall it is pretty good."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great with Skype","review":"I have used this CIT400 for a month now at home.

The people we speak with think that as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Finally one that works all the time","review":"This was my third attempt to find a decent Skype / landline phone. After a fiasco with similar Philips and Vtech products, the Linksys CIT400 is a decent product. Extremly easy to setup (you'll be up and running in appx 15 minutes) and reliable. Sound is loud enough, landline is clear and so is the Skype (except in a really high traffic times). I do make quite a lot international calls (Skype to landline) and I would recommend, that you have a base station somewhere so you can actually see the status light (blue means you're using Skype, amber is landline). I did make a mistake couple of times and dialed international number through landline in a hurry... Placing base station somewhere you can see it, will eliminate this \\"problem\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"horrible phone","review":"This is my second phone, and it is doing the same thing my first one did. It works fine for a week, then all i get is \\"system is starting up\\" and stays that way. If i push any button, I get \\"unavailable\\". If I disconnect it from the computer for a day, it works for two days, then repeats. I can't rely on this phone, calls to linkskys are not productive.

Our wireless phones were purchased in another city and retain that city's area code & number. So I downloaded and purchased a Skype account. No problem.Ater finally reading thoroughly the Skype FAQ's and then getting some additional background in VIOP, I realized that another piece of hardware was needed in order to actually TALK on VIOP.Hence the Linksys Telephony Kit. The set-up process was so simple that a cave man could do it (sorry). I followed the installation CD, put plugs where the plugs go, set my preferences, and presto: I had a local number. The setup lets me forward calls to my mobile phone for when I'm not in the office.The Linksys/Skype setup has been in place for about 3 months now and works just like it should work.

I don't like 1st generation, and there were complaints about quality of Wi-Fi phones.The CIT 400 works like charm and connects easily. One word of advice though, don't try to program it before it is fully charged. I programmed it while it is in the base, but after 1 day of charging, I had problems with the sound.

I haven't tried the regular telephone feature on it yet because I really don't have the need.I have a lot of clients in the Caribbean so I wanted to get this and not be tied to the computer via a headset.

I thought it was going to be very boring but than I got hooked and couldn't stop reading. Next, this book teaches me that everyone can change, and help can be found in ways you'll least expect.

Now of course, most of the kids at his school are very eager to get their clothes cleaned by a famous criminal, so the boy and his friend get a lot of business. I loved this book!!

It's a fast read, and you don't want to put the book down.

Yes, he lives on Alcatraz prison. His problems are not just that also, his sister is diagnosed with severe autism. His parents act like worthless dumps while spending all their time and money on help for Natalie (Moose's sister) and completely ignoring their son.

This story is particularly relevant to my daughter as she has a brother with autism, just like the main character. The only \\"downside\\" if there had to be one is that the book is rather short and she read it within 2 nights.

At first it seemed that she didn't like Moose but towards the end I could see that she did.I would recommend this book to pretty much anyone; it is easy to understand.I liked this book because I could never tell what was going to happen next.

That's fine, but a little bit of \\"how I spent my summer down on the farm\\" with Grama, my cousin, my uncle, or my foster family, goes a long way with modern kids.This novel gives us a strong protagonist, with strong parents, a challenging sibling situation, and a novel setting. All of that is fine by me. The writing style is effective and straightforward, but doesn't overreach. The book earns its emotional punch over time; it doesn't try to bully you emotionally or stylistically, which I think is fine for the target readership.So, definitely worth a try."},{"rating":"2","title":"Al Capone Does My Pants Is Super","review":"Al Capone Does My ShirtsI liked this book because it has some comedy and it talks about what some kids would actually do because it is a real place.Other kids might like this book because they might want to learn a little bit of history or they might want to laugh.

I haven't read Kira Kira, but I can't imagine it's any more passionate and absorbing than this wonderful read."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"If you love someone, you have to try things even if they don't make sense to anyone else\\"","review":"Moose Flanagan and his family arrive on Alcatraz Island in 1935 so his father Cam can work as an electrician and guard at the prison and his sister Natalie can have a chance to attend a \\"special\\" school for children with Autism. At the time it's not called Autism, but that is what the reader of today is lead to believe. Moose is caught in the middle of Piper the wardens daughters' schemes and her mad drive to meet Al Capone and his mothers desperate need to get Natalie into the only school that can help her. Moose is the only one that can really reach Natalie and the decisions and realities that the family has to face can just be too much for a 12 year old boy. Maybe Al Capone is his only option."},{"rating":"2","title":"bought for friend","review":"I bought this for a friend and I haven't heard her complain. That's why I'm giving it four stars.

Especially adults, because most do not (unless they have a child book lover) hear about this genre of books. Everyone that has read it, thanks me for recommending it. It has humor, humanity, and a great back drop in which the plot takes place. When recommending this book to students, most of which do not have a clue who Al Capone is, I advise them to do a little research about the man, first. Also, to familiarize themselves with Alcatraz Island and it's infamous history.

But the back cover mentioned murderers, rapists, hit men -- I thought I needed to read it through to figure out how much details on these crimes. There is a part where the main character loses his autistic sister and finds her she is sitting with a 'con.' Many questions can be brought up about why the boy is so concerned about leaving his sister alone with a man. The boys spends a while trying to figure out how much time they were alone together. There are phrases like -- Men that hadn't seen a woman in a long time, or exclamations like, \\"Sweet Jesus.\\" Review it for your kid. My kid is NOT ready for the subject matter of this book.

I toured nationally plaing his role in Play It Again, Sam --but he is totally miscast in this version of The Sunshine Boys. There is no sparkle between him and Peter Falk. It is lifeless and disappointing. It should never have been done. As other comments attest, the movie version with Matthau and Burns is vastly superior. Sometimes ---great talents just don't work well together. That's the case here. Surely they knew it was not working when they shot it. No chemistry between them --a sad on-screen encounter with no payoff whatsoever. You'll waste your time watching it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"AWEFUL!

Several of the tunes are just Monty playing clarinet with the rhythm section and many of the chestnuts he did with the whole band lacked the Chris Barber or Kenny Ball drive and creativity of arrangement. I may buy another of his CDs eventually, but I'll want some description and naming of the band members, who are not identified on this CD. Monty is a good clarinet man, but he's no Pete Fountain or Sidney Bechet, to hold down the fort all by himself."},{"rating":"2","title":"Grown Ups","review":"This superbly acted film by English director Mike Leigh (\\"Naked\\") is a bleakly funny slice-of-life tale about two couples mired in somewhat depressing routines. Manville and Davis are delightfully dour as a bickering couple trying to decide whether or not to have a baby, while Kelly and Duncan's moribund, dysfunctional relationship is alternately hilarious and gut-wrenching to observe. But the film's greatest asset is Blethyn, whose showstopping meltdown on the Butchers' staircase is the work of a champion actress--one fully in touch with the depths of despair. \\"Grown Ups\\" is a sweetly madcap gem for the feeble-minded fussbudget in all of us."},{"rating":"1","title":"Looks can be deceiving","review":"I thought this would be the perfect gift for my budding 4 year old artist. Was I ever wrong! The nicest thing about this 'art' center is the case it comes in. The crayons and oil pastels have barely any color pigments- the oil pastels are almost entirely wax. The color pencils are not much better, and the water color tubes are hard to handle for small hands and don't yield better result than the inexpensive kids versions. The markers are okay, but they were not the selling point for me since young children need to experiment with color blending.

I finally got in touch with the IRIS folks and they were, fortunately, pleasant. They offered to replace all three units, but I told them I only needed one. Sometime later (I can't recall exactly how long it was, but I believe it was fairly prompt), I received the replacement unit and...wait for it...IT WAS BROKEN AS WELL! Again, I was able to piece together the remains of the other units, but by this time I was completely disgusted.Even if the products arrived in perfect condition, they are clearly not worth the $71.00 (apiece) that I paid for them: the casters are flimsy, the tops are certainly not wood and the drawers and slides are hardly \\"furniture quality.\\"If you haven't guessed by now, I would definitely NOT recommend this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Love / Hate","review":"Much like my review of Hint Hint's \\"Young Days\\", I heard a single cut off this Tom Vek album and was in love enough to buy the whole record immediately. \\"C-C (You Set Me on Fire)\\" is an instant indie classic, which will find it's way on to playlists of mine forever.

First of all, Johnson plays way too slow and his music has no beat whatsoever. There aren't even any drums on the record. Furthermore, Johnson doesn't even play the electric guitar so there arent any cool guitar solos. His singing isn't any better, because his lyrics are unbelievably corny and you can't help but laugh at his whiny voice. For some real blues music you should listen to Led Zeppelin because at least he has good songs like Stairway to Heaven. I know Led Zeppelin is a good guitar player because I saw him play on the Song Remains the Same and he can play really fast and good.

Sony's King of the Delta Blues (Vol.s 1 and 2) offers a virtually complete collection and the diff in sound quality is startling. While you hear more hiss and scratches, the sound of Johnson's voice has a presence that that the \\"Complete Collection\\" lacks. I already owned the latter and upon hearing the former, went out and bought it. Skip the Complete Collection and get the recording that sounds more real, more alive.

The recordings are a little dated, but it takes nothing away from the rawness of the music and the story telling in the lyrics. You can hear that Clapton, Jimmy Page and the Stones have been influenced by this artist more than any other when they perform their blues and rock music. The way he plays guitar will leave you breathless as you try to work out how he plays so many notes, accompanying himself, whilst sounding so spare and raw. You have the complete recordings he put out in one package so you can hear how songs and lyrics changed from take to take.

A must!","review":"Forget about production wizardry and the big beat, this is raw blues and the roots of rock and roll done by its most legendary figure. Robert Johnson was a god-given talent. He also had big hands, and that made it sound like there were two guitars playing, but amazingly it was just him. Every song is a blues masterpiece. Recorded in only two sessions in 1936-37, it is almost a religious experience to listen to him. Nobody's mentioned the outstanding booket that comes with old photos, dates, lyrics and history about this phenomenal talent. Allegedly poisoned by a jealous man in 1938, only adds to the mystique. Essential! The sound is O.K. with surface noise which only adds character to these amazing recordings."},{"rating":"2","title":"robert johnson is the master","review":"i truly recomend this record it is a soulfull sad album and it goes strait to the ruits of the blues,and lets face it the blues is the best music around."},{"rating":"2","title":"5-Star Performance, Illogical Recording Sequence","review":"It's easy to get swept along in the hype and mythology surrounding Johnson and to accept him uncritically as the greatest (or at least the most influential) blues guitarist of all time. He was by any measure superb. And many of his 29 recordings are truly seminal works, but they are not scared texts ... and yes, the blues would have evolved with or without Johnson.These recording are testimony to his skill. This is a five-star performance by any measure when viewed from the quality of the material and no blues collection is complete without a Johnson recording. Knock one-star off for the brain-dead decision of the compiler to place the alternate takes directly after the \\"master\\" cuts.

With its entry on the GameCube, the game finally gets the dynamic look and feel it always seemed to be striving for. The tirelessly detailed environments of this game are breathtaking, but do not distract from its fast pace. The controls allow for many complicated racing strategies, but are still quite easy to learn.

This is an extremely (let me say it again- extreeemely) difficult game made for hardcore gamers from back in the day who welcome a decent challenge in the face of all the crap development that befouls the world of electronic gaming as we have come to put up with. This type of game requires a certain level of skill; simply put, the ones who have the natural skills will excel and come to love this game, while the others will practice the tracks over and over again in vain only to ultimately fail.For those of you who blew through Ikaruga, this is the new game to beat.

I was hooked on it ever since I first tried it out at my brother's friend's house. If you have no idea what F-Zero is, I'll tell you.F-Zero is a fast, action-packed race set in the 26th century. Over 30 different pilots are competing in the Grand Prix, and they all have different motives for wanting the prize money. In this game, you control an F-Zero pilot, and you have to zoom through many courses in an anti-gravity machine at speeds of around 1500 km/h! You can either select one of the pilot's own machines, or you can create your own (very cool). The graphics are the best I've seen yet in a Gamecube game, and the gameplay itself is addicting.

Being one of the primary reasons I purchased a Gamecube, I hoped it would live up to my expectations. It did, and in many ways surpassed them. The graphics are outstanding. The sense of speed is simply mind-boggling, you probably wouldn't find a faster game. The majority of track designs are absolutely great. The story mode is deep, plus there is a Grand Prix mode, and it's also four player. You also race against up to 29 opponents, and of course the gameplay is absolutely great. One problem however, is its difficulty. For Pros, this may be seen as a nice challenge. But for novices, the game can be frustratingly hard. This may turn away some.

He finds her in Texas 10 years after the Civil War and desides to take her to find her daughter who's in Atlanta, Georgia by way of Santa Fe, New Mexico. Now if I know my geography, that's WEST from Texas and Georgia is EAST! 300+ mi. west on horseback to go to Atlanta? All because 1 person MIGHT recognize her? Uh-uh.

Where she came up with a turtle for soup out there in the middle of the prairie is anybody's guess.And, as the other reviewer pointed out, the trip to Atlanta via Santa Fee kind of left me shaking my head too.

It's all I've been listening to for the last several days. Why aren't other bands writing and recording songs like this? I can sum up Shave Librarian in two words: PURE GENIUS! This new song is from an indie film, \\"20 Questions\\", which I can't wait to see. The song makes me feel like I'm happily drunk and I'm flying down the highway on my motorcycle with my hands waving in the air... Shave Librarian, *you* did it right! Can't wait for the next release!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice introduction","review":"This is a concise and practical introduction to some Newton method scheme, which can be read in a day or two if the reader has some background in numerical methods. The book sketches the main idea behind the methods and clearly explains the pros and cons of each method.I did not give 5 stars because the reader will eventually need his other book, Iterative Methods for Linear and Nonlinear Equations, SIAM 1995, in order to write one own code and get all the details right."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your money.....","review":"After reading the first review, I was really expecting something special. This body wash is sooooooo not worth the money. There is absolutely nothing special about it. The fragrance is faint, it has a slightly medicinal odor, and it hasn't done anything special for my skin. It also took forever to get it. Save your money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Got the Job done and Engine is back to running Great!","review":"I give it 100% for effectivness. It solved my problem. It came in a very rugged protective series of containers. It didn't look exactly like the original part which confused me but I was able to figure out how to remove and replace the old with the new.It would have helped to have some instructions. I found no instructions. I imagine the coil fits many engines types and there is an expectation that a mechanic will be installing and that's why there are no instructions."},{"rating":"2","title":"Remarkable collection of photographs","review":"Written by Kurt Titze, a German, this book includes a large number of dramatic photographs taken by the author. He has visited quite of few of the remote Jain pilgrimage sites that most Jains will not have a chance to visit. It contains very well researched description of all the sites covered.This is quite an unusual book. Strongly recommended for personal Jain libraries, although it is a fairly expensive book.Interwoven with the articles on Jain pilgrimage centers, the basic principles of Jainism, specially non-violence, are highlighted."},{"rating":"2","title":"Still on the fence but leaning. . .","review":"I'm a little on the fence with this product because I like the cream but not so much the body lotion. The lotion is thin and very similiar to the Vaseline Clinical Therapy that I can buy at most drugstores. The Glysolid Cream however, is one of the best products I've used. Within 2-3 weeks my cuticles were healed, my elbows lost that dry, dirty look, and my feet still looked like feet, except they were smooth.I know the product can be a little pricy but the company will send you a sample for the cost of postage. Being the suspicious person I am, I sent for a sample before committing my StarBucks allowance for a full size container.As a plus, I gave some to a family member who has eczema and it's clearing up nicely."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than The Accidental Virgin","review":"I decided to give Valerie Frankel another chance after I had read and disliked \\"The Accidental Virgin\\" and this was a much better read. The book focuses on three sisters-Illene, Frieda, and Betty. I disliked the character of Illene the most and liked the character of Betty the most. Illene didn't have many traits that I could connect to and she did a lot of things in the book that I found to be really annoying and ridiculous. Frieda was a so-so character for me. I didn't mind her and I did root for her and Sam's relationship but there just wasn't something that I could fully connect with. I probably connected the most with Betty. I felt for her when she got duped (I don't want to reveal too much). The book is a fast read, as I read it in two days. I've bought The Girl-friend Curse by Valerie Frankel and hopefully that will be as good as \\"The Not-so-perfect Man\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Eh. . .","review":"I bought this off the clearance counter at a book store. Now I know why. I found the beginning rather confusing and had a hard time keeping track of the characters and once I started reading I couldn't wait to be done as it really was boring. And the ending I thought was awful. Too many things were drawn out and could have been shortened earlier in the book to make the ending make more sense. It was almost like she just got tired of writing or figured it was long enough so she just quickly wrapped everything up. Plus I found the editing/proofreading to be horrendous. I proofread documents for a living so I have a tendency to catch typos. I tripped over way too many of them. It's just a pet peeve of mine - I understand we're humans but books shouldn't have typos. At least not this many. Definitely won't be reading any more of her books."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of Time","review":"This is junk fiction. The plot is unbelievably naive. The twists of events are ridiculous with no seemingly logical reasoning- especially how Sam and Frieda got together again through Ilene (yes, the person who first opposed their relationship). The story could be condensed to a third of its original length. Unless you have lots of time on hand, please do not waste it on this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good, but not as good as the book","review":"This movie can stand on its own, but the book on which it is based is much better. In fact, I highly recommend that you read the book before seeing the movie. Of necessity, the movie makers have left out much of the detail that led up to the action shown. It is an exciting movie, but I wish that a mini-series had been made to fully explore the content of the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"this case STINKS!

The performance may not be too bad, but the recorded sound is cloudy and it is quite difficult to hear details of quiet passages and loud climaxes. Bernstein's recording with Gary Graffman is much preferable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Did exactly what I needed it to do","review":"My goal was to run all instruments (banjo, guitar, drums, bass, piano) through my yamaha mixer, into my loop pedal to record and layer loops, then from the loop pedal into my amp for play back. Line from mixer to amp was noisy and not very loud due to impedance mismatch from mixer line out to amp input. This re-amper did the trick. Matched impedance and allows me to pump everything through the mixer and into the looper/amp. No more plugging and unplugging and the mixer allows me to fine tune with all adjustments and levels for all instruments. I just click my loop pedal, play whatever instrument I want, record the loop, and then play back through amp. Also, I can line out to, and line back in, from mixer to my Mac for recording and editing in Garageband and then playback fro Mac through the mixer to the re-amper and amp. If I get another one, I can pump instrument signals through mixer to different amps. Sweet..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great product","review":"Love the new light fixture.

I found this cd to be very enjoyable and relaxing and a great tribute to a great artist. I hope Ms Begum continues to do other cds from other artists as well. Although this is not a symphonic sound as The London Philharmonic is, I feel it is a genuine attempt through synthesizing by capturing Mr. Diamonds music to a \\"T\\". Headed for the Future is one song written by Mr. Diamond which was done entirely by a synthesizer in Mr. Diamond's studio and I found Ms Begum's attempt to be very good as she can only get better with future attempts.I would recommend this cd very highly"},{"rating":"2","title":"Reading for every officer","review":"This book is essential reading for all those who are or hope to someday be military leaders.

It shows intersections where there are none and misses real ones entirely. It recommends illegal left turns, often in places where it is a divided highway.

Like another reviewer, the only reason I ordered this was because of that song. I did not even open the CD, just sent it back. The other songs were okay, but I did not want to keep it without that song. I bought KTs eye of the telescope Cd and was pleasantly surprised that I really like all the songs on it, and for me that is very rare."},{"rating":"1","title":"Incomplete Soundtrack... But for a reason...","review":"I agree with all other viewers who harshly claim that this \\"The Devil Wears Prada\\" soundtrack album is incomplete.Keep in mind that K.T. Tunstall (performer of 'Suddenly I See') is one of those artists who protect the copyrights oh her musical work as pure gold or precious gems.Therefore, not being the WEA edition of this album a \\"COPY PROTECTED\\" one (very common actually in some Brit-German-European CD editions), she hasn't allowed the song to be included in the final version of the soundtrack.It means, if you really go crazy for having K.T. Tunstall's \\"Suddenly I See\\" at the touch of your hand every time you want to hear it, get her 'Eye to The Telescope' album, and simply avoid buying this really irrelevant compilation of songs titled as \\"Original Soundtrack\\"...However if you loved the great performances that Meryl Streep and Anne Hathaway developed in this film, get the DVD of the film instead!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Album only = no sale.","review":"Why do music labels pull the \\"album only\\" stunt?

I looked everywhere but no one seems to have them. I think it's a waste not to include those songs, as they were incredible, but maybe someone just wanted to put the songs on a track and not include the main sung ones.And my other complaint is that they do not include \\"Jump\\" by Madonna and \\"Suddenly I See\\", which is really stupid.

I found it disturbing, depressing and the ultimate message (conform--or else) to be frightening. Cormier had no intention of making a sequel but for years he got letters asking what happened to the main characters. So--he wrote this. The protagonist in the first (Jerry Renault) has survived the brutal beating that ended the first book. However, he's beaten up AGAIN (although not as bad) and this is shown as a positive thing!!! Archie and the Vigils are up to their sick power games again and Brother Leon is still a twisted pathetic man. Also this book contains a teenage suicide which is just harrowing.

I would avoid this book it is put out there to take advantage of the ufo theme which is ironic because the author hates all such books but still seems willing to take advantage of the market."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just like the picture!","review":"I really enjoy having this ring.

Both of them damaged numerous sets of headphones, wearing the connectors to the point that only one earpiece would work. On one of my players, the backlight on the LCD stopped working, and on the other the connection between the player and the USB chord no longer holds properly, preventing me from changing any of the MP3's on a 64 MB player.

This is an intensely harsh view of rural Sweden. Written from the authors point of view as a child, one sees through her eyes social injustice, intense poverty and alchohalic breakdowns. There is a tender quality in the protagonist that draws the reader in and makes the book difficult to put down. The honesty of the author in viewing her difficult past puts the reader in her shoes (Which by the way, she doesn't always have) and walk the dusty road of her childhood. Her feelings are so intense that you worry about her when you close the book and need to open it again to make certain she is going to make to the next page."},{"rating":"2","title":"Like an Ed Wood movie!","review":"This is a terrible book.

But I'm sorry, this book fails on so many levels. And what is the author's obsession with the wooly mammoth?!?! omg - that is the freaky part....every single page almost this guy draws them interacting with the diagrams and incorporates the mammoth into his examples, writing make-believe stories about how they'd react with each device being explained.

The descriptive explanations for inventions are a bit overdone in some places while others are a little lacking, but overall I'd say you're told enough without being flooded in confusing details. Very well done. The friendly cartoons are a plus as well, and the \\"Eureka!\\" section at the end is an outstanding resource.

The book fails to point out that the tree could also be used for fire wood, building materials, or space to farm. While a nice story, it fails to present a balanced view of nature and the choices that are involved with the extraction of natural resources from the forest."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tough","review":"This book is a tough read. It drips with research but it belabors the story with information that makes it very,very difficult to follow what happened in this horrible battle. The author for example lists units and military commanders giving credit to everyone and his brother down to a gnat's rump for line after line til you loose the thread of what the heck is happening. Things like Lt.Colonel Smith of the 3rd Infantry,2nd Regiment,4th Battalion, Company C talked to Major Jones of the 23rd Armored Divison, 2nd Battalion, Task Force Williams,F Squad about the shortage of toilet paper. Why not just say there was a shortage of toilet paper and get on with the story. This style of writing, tho flaterring to the people whose names are listed, is agony to read. It is more of a text book than an exciting retelling of what happened."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Lost Battle","review":"If you want to read a fascinating history of a major defeat of the American Army in World War ll this is it. Most historians write very little of this battle as the Army tried to cover it up and the Battle of the Bulge started during this time. Charles MacDonald does an excellent job in describing the horror that six American divisions endured over a six month period because of ego and poor leadership at the high command level. This book really fueled my interest in this battle and I took a couple of trips through this area as most of it is now a German Nature Park. The reminders of this battle are everywhere and MacDonald's descriptions of the terrain that the soldiers fought is accurate. Of the several books now out about the Huertgen Forest I feel this is the best and most accurate. I loaned my original copy out never to be seen again and ordered another from Amazon for my library."},{"rating":"2","title":"What a gem!","review":"I agree that it's a shame this book is not in print.

There is not a lot of action or suspense, and the characters are drawn in a sort of superficial and silly way, yet I can't put Beaton's books down or wipe the smile off my face while I'm reading. Maybe that's the secret of a great mystery, I know that's the reason why I can't get enough of Agatha, middle aged woman, ex-high powered executive, and bumbling detective extraordinaire."},{"rating":"2","title":"Can't wait for the next one.","review":"What a fun read.

However, the \\"same old, same old,\\" was very tedious this time through. While Agatha is up to another caper, she remains as stagnant as ever. While I still laugh at her irresponsibility and irrepresibility, I no longer want to tell her to smarten up -- but to tell her to shut up. I want her to find new people as a permanent part of her life. We have already run the gamut of the extent of the personalties of James, Roy, and the Vicar's Wife. They don't change, nor does the content of their dialogue. I thought the ending was predictable, and we already know what will happen in the next book. Without spoiling the ending, let's just say, \\"it won't last.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Ya Gotta Read the Book","review":"I bought this for my husband.

What bothered me was that the dummies in the skill mode were too aggressive. Something that bothers me about the SERIES is that, when your in \\"Create-a-Team\\", customization is limitied. For this game, I wish EA could have put in the option to put in your own logo, helmet and leg stripe , and add any effect into your stadiam, like in All-Pro -Football 2k8 (even though the stadiam depended on your logo.) What Iliked was the fact that the computer was so challenging. They're lot more challenging than the AI in previos Madden Games. And then there was the tournement mode, which has returned. That mode is still fun. Frnchise this year is awesome. I prefer to play as the New York Giants, or the Pittsburg Steelers. Overall, this game is a 5 star game.

First cliche- two characters fall in love with each other, but spend eight angst-filled chapters weeping because they are sure the other character won't like them. Second cliche- the characters discuss what they would do if a terribly unlikely thing were to occur, and amazingly enough- it happens in the next chapter! And the world is saved because they remembered what they decided they would do!

Unfortunately, however the switch to digital is accomplished, it's lacking, using incorrect grammer, wrong words, misplaced punctuation, blank spaces in the middle of words. In Oathbreakers, in particular, there was one place where it should have been the word \\"such\\" and ended with a \\"k\\" instead. I know the original book was free of these types of errors.

If you spent years meditating, going to church and ashrams, attending sat-sangs and empowerment seminars, paid for sessions with gurus and healers of all stripes, read voraciously on self-help, healing, occultism, philosophy and psychology, and STILL you haven't settled in the depth of your heart and mind, this book will do that for you. You will be reading it for years, and you will find the warmth, wisdom, love and acceptance that eluded you. The book is hard to read, it is dense with meaning and references to Christian Hemeticism you may never heard of, but if you are patient, it will stretch your heart and mind and make it more beautiful, just the way exercise does for the body."},{"rating":"1","title":"More failed syncretism","review":"It is funny to see always the same attitude in christian apologists trying to sincretize everything into their myth, Tarot in this case, specially something that the church dared to call \\"the devil's picture book\\" (there is a great book here in Amazon.com with this very title and story).Hermeticism was barely saved from the christian barbarity, from the book burnning inquisition, and as they could not destroy it, now they try to stole it, and present themselves as \\"inspired\\" and evolutive, something very far from Historical Reality."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not enough about tarot","review":"Boring, wordy and not really about tarot.

Twentieth Century Fox did a sloppy job on this one. The first disc has a bunch of advertisements in the beginning of it. The color quality is less than professional you'll notice some bleeding here and there. For some reason, they changed the name of the \\"U.S. Acres\\" cartoon segament in the series to \\"Orson's Farm\\" on each of the episodes but did not update the same names in the episode indexes. The \\"Special Features\\" are simply trailers for the movies \\"Like Mike 2\\" and \\"Dr. Dolittle 3\\". It would have been nice if they included in interview with Garfield's creator Jim Davis or some of those who did the voices of the characters. They could have included a pitch reel or other background stuff but they did not.

Included here are episodes that haven't been broadcasted in roughly 10 years. Just a taste of what to expect is a sequel to the picnic panic on volume 4, The garfield tin pan alley review, A few episodes with Penelope and some stand out U.S. Acres cartoons including Grape expectations a 2 part cartoon in which Roy faces the music by the big cock-a-doo due to the disappearance of a single grape. All in all if you love the series you will of course enjoy this final volume.There is one major gripe however. The series final theme song which was a rap is not included in the episodes or anywhere on the dvd's. Decent extras are once again absent. I would have loved to have heard commentary from the remaining castmembers, writers or directors on their take of the show. Still these issues aside, you can't go wrong. The perfect end to the perfect series."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply The Best","review":"Jim Davis ceases to amaze his fans with his talent and humor through Garfield and his cast of friends.

But I have long found Glimmer Train stories disappointing. Too many of them feel \\"writerly,\\" as if the writers, and editors, know that they are writing a SHORT STORY. The writing is too self-aware, and many of the stories ring false, with contrived endings and plots, when they exist.

After I wrote in the book, I realized that I had not ordered the most recent version. I looked back at the way the book was presented on Amazon, and the 7th version was displayed predominately. However, if you scrolled down, there was a small message that a more recent version of the book was available. Neither description clearly identifed which edition of the book you were purchasing. The newer 8th edition is very different than the 7th. I'm getting by in class, but I think the way this was presented was very deceptive.

The authors simply love citing their own work. They do so at LEAST twice per chapter. All the cases in the book were written by the authors and the cases themselves are riddled with meaningless buzzwords and are just downright lame (e.g. \\"a lights-out data center\\"). Small wonder why the non-English speaking reviewer had problems. Poor guy.It's obvious that the only opinions the authors value is their own. Beware of any class that requires this textbook because it means the professor has no idea what they are talking about. Just because you teach at Harvard does not necessarily mean you are smart or intelligent."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Crappy Textbook","review":"My MBA professor said this was an excellent book, but it was HORRIBLE. Well, at the least the first four chapters were extremely, extremely bad. I could barely finish them--if the professor hadn't been excellent, and gone \\"outside the book\\" most of the time, it would have been the worst class I've every taken.

What do you get for that price? Cases that are not up to date (many end around 2000-2001), terrible topic headings within the chapters, cheap looking diagrams using company names that are blurry and ineffective, and another worthless book that isn't being bought back on your bookshelf. And I haven't even started with the writing... They will give you a subject heading or topic that will be discussed without even explaining it very well AT ALL! Many times a topic will be given, they give a mediocre company example and you don't understand the concept clearly.

The backbone of the openings that Lane wants everyone to play is the London System. This has never struck me as being particularly aggressive but it is perfect to make sure that White enters the middlegame with no fear of falling into a trap. The London System is no good against every opening and the author is honest enough to admit this rather than give a game which just happens to demolish the Dutch or something! I have found that how to deal with the side-lines such as the Clarendon Court are very useful. In the main lines the easy to follow guide in the Benoni and the Dutch are well worth a look.Basically, I have improved my openings as a result of this book and that really is the true test."},{"rating":"2","title":"How to Play 1 d4","review":"This is a book dedicated to making it easy to play 1 d4 against everything. Mr Lane wants us to play the London System because it is easy to learn and there are possibilities to attack. It looks good to me who has a rating of 1860 and has been playing this opening for years.I particularly like the ideas against the Benoni and the Dutch. I now know about the Barry Attack and the 150 Attack which are good despite the odd names.Can this book make me play better, yes!"},{"rating":"2","title":"An Old Opening with New Ideas","review":"First of all the title of the book has caused much debate. It is now well known it was the publisher who decided to use the 50 year old title of Fine's book. A mistake to use the classics but hardly the author's fault. The soul of the openings are above average for me because I can learn the main one-the London System- fairly quickly. I train kids at school and the idea of easy development appeals to all ages.A good effort and worth reading."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Modern Chess Openings? Please...","review":"This is a repertoire book with something against most of the things you might meet after 1.d4. The lines are superficially explained and analysed, and do not often give white chances of an opening advantage. There are some useful lines here, but you can find better repertoire books anywhere easily.The title is stolen from Fine's \\"Ideas behind the Chess Openings\\", and it is a ploy from the publisher to get more sales. The London system, which this book is based on, is not a modern opening, so the title could not be more misleading.

Not the managers productivity, naturally, but those pesky employees. Managers will love this book, since it conveniently shifts all burden of responsibility onto the lower ranks, giving them advice like \\"work as though you own the company\\" and \\"you are responsible for your own motivation\\".

Aside from stating obvious advice such as stay flexible, keep your skills up to date, do a good job and other topics that fall under the rubric of \\"DUH!\\", this sparsely worded pocketbook proceeds to absolve managment of their duties by shifting them to the employees they manage. In between randomly quoted computer industry statistics that serve no purpose whatsoever other than filler amongst pages starving for content, Price places all responsibility on the worker bees, leaving the managers free to kick back and read more stupid books like this one.

I tried all the tips, followed the directions, and studied the video on the UE website, but couldn't get them to stay sealed in my canals--they would start out okay but gradually work their way out.As soon as they lose their seal--there goes the bass. I know the reach-over-your-head-and-pull-your-ear-back thing, and that didn't work either.I have a pair of Etymotic ER-4Ss (not nearly as nice) and have had no trouble with the fit.

No comparison.

They're a step up from the Bullards and the Beelers on the mental food chain, but still not finalists for the MacArthur Prize.

The thesis, in a nutshell: never shoot anything before thinking it through. You will ask if I oversimplify, but for this book I think not. The redeaming qualities are in how the tales are told. It was fun to peek at pre-WWII America: memories of stuff my parents' aunts and uncles told me enlivened the narrative. A younger reader will not have that. I was propelled to the finish by little more than the excellent wordsmithing. In general, I really like Berger. His 'Arthur Rex' is one of my very favorites, for lots of reasons.

Tom Gau's sections don't disappoint, probably because he was the most candid.

Fortunately, Sony has put them both on one budget disc, and it is one of the great bargains in the catalogue.

This DS Lite Stylus from Intec definitely follows in that suit. The stylus doesn't work very well with many DS games.

Now we can still listen to it, track to track, and enjoy every single song. In an age when you can craft your mp3s around what you want to listen to it when you listen to it, that achievement on the part of any band becomes more stark. Of course now the lyrics might seem a bit emo, but this album was written before that movement took off, when bands like Eels and Wheezer were pioneering the skill of articulating a volatile blue mood.One of my top 10 albums and probably the only one on the list that was written in the past 20 years"},{"rating":"2","title":"THE EELS--FULL PROOF PLAN TO SUCESS","review":"The eels have always been known for great music which is generally restricted to a small minority group known as college rockers, however with there latest 'Beautiful Freak' the eels have propelled themselves into the broader picture.

Because of that, I decided to drop it into my CD changer and listen to it several times. I did and it actually failed to grab me at all. I still love \\"Novocain for the Soul\\" but the other songs simply sound pretty boring to me...One word review: BORING!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Oddly electrifying","review":"Bought this CD back in '96 for $6.99 (a price the store was charging for 'new and upcoming' bands); it still gets airtime in my CD player. Too bad it only peaked at #114 in the Billboard Albums chart. Doesn't matter, it's still a great CD. Even though E's lyrics can get depressing and morbid, the oddly bright music always manages to lift them up. This album can be thought of in the vein of a dysfunctional 'Pet Sounds'. If you like your music a bit off center, but still accessible, then I highly recommend this CD.

I was expecting a pleasant shallow pop record to just sit back and enjoy. The songs here are much more interesting and demanding than that, though. It's a real charmer, this one, and unlike most records, the CD's 2nd half is its strongest. The album finishes with Spunky, Mental, Your Lucky Day In Hell and Manchild, all light and fluffy yet satisfying listens. Other songs worth checking out are Novocaine For The Soul, the title track, and Not Ready Yet, but the standout is Flower, because its most beautiful moment is its most dissonant. A great, if slightly oddball, listen."},{"rating":"2","title":"Outcast","review":"Beautiful Freak is the album that reminds us all what it is like to be an outcast; someone who doesn't quite fit it, and what the rest of us are missing out on by shunning that person away. My favorite track on this CD is the sarcasticly creepy Your Lucky Day in Hell. \\"And no one will know my name until it's on a stone\\" just echoed in my head for days after I first listened to this track. Flower is also a personal favorite, because like all of the songs on this CD, I get a clear mental picture of something standing alone because it is different. It is both creepy and enchanting at the same time. Take a look at the CD cover if you don't know what I mean."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best albums ever made. 6 stars!","review":"Words cannot describe how incredible this album is, but I'll try. First of all, this is easily one of my favorite 10 albums of all time. I can't get the songs out of my head... the music is so catchy, AND the lyrics are so intelligent and piercing! E experiments with a few different styles here, from harder stuff like Mental to funk like Guest List, to more depressing slow stuff like Manchild. My favorites are Not Ready Yet, Flower, Guest List, Your Lucky Day in Hell, and Manchild. However, it's ALL great stuff. The only low points for me are Mental and Spunky, but that's only because they're not INCREDIBLE like the rest of the songs... they're still very good by normal standards though! My only warning would be that this album is VERY depressing... by the time the last notes of Manchild (a real downer of a song, but an appropriate last track) have faded, I'm often in tears. But it's so worth it! Buy this album!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A great album","review":"I'm not much for modern music. I like classic rock/pop much better. I got in to this CD through the movie Shrek, and the song 'My Beloved Monster\\". Then I checked out the CD, and slowly, it grew on me.This CD is really a one-time jem. That's not to say that the other Eels albums aren't good, it's just that this one is so much better. It's done perfectly. The songs are tender, and the lead singer, E, puts a lot of feel into them. But, the songs feel somehow wrong. This isn't a problem, it's intentional. The songs are, in general, love songs, but sing them to your girlfriend and you won't have a girlfriend to sing to much longer. There's something lurking in them below the tender surface, like a crazy boyfriend in a stalker movie.Anyways, buy this CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"The eels Rock!","review":"This cd is definetly in my top 10 cd's of all time! I love this album. It has so much angst and depression but you can't help but love it! The eels send you on an emotional rollercoaster through this cd and leave you begging for more. It contains the hits Novacain for the Soul, Rags to Rags and my favourite Susans House! I can't recommend this cd enough.

And the films are a lot of fun -- as much for what they say about the culture of the 50's as for the stories themselves.My only complaint (and the reason for four stars instead of five) is that the studio skimped on extras; the films don't even have scene-by-scene menus. Given the price of this package, that seems a bit cheap."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great collection","review":"Right now, this collection is the only way to get these classic sci-fi movies.

He was always making up knew moves,usually involving a ladder. The book talks about how three teams came up to form TLC(tables,ladders,and chairs).Jeff and Matt being the ladders. Back in their high school days they were called pretty boys. That explains how good looking they are. Jeff never was all that good with the girls. He just never tried.

Compelling characters and plot. Heartily recommend this book if you like sci-fi, fantasy, romance or historical fiction."},{"rating":"1","title":"More Samurai Than Star Trek","review":"\\"Shadow Lord\\" deals with politcal intrigue, samurai-style warfare, and tribal politics on a planet poised to join the Federation. It is hardly a Star Trek novel. Spock and Sulu are the only characters who are present in the entire story. Kirk and McCoy appear briefly at the beginning and end, and that's it for the Star Trek personalities. The writing is decent enough, but the story line is often one-dimensional. The descriptions of sword fighting and equipment are detailed (and graphically violent), but the author doesn't offer very deep insights into any of the characters. Particularly disappointing was the glossing over of Sulu's having broken the Prime Directive."},{"rating":"2","title":"Star Trek: Shadow Lord","review":"Star Trek: Shadow Lord wriiten by Laurence Yep is a Sulu/Spock with a flavor of \\"Highlander\\" to give it some character. So sword fights are the norm and phaser fire is kept to a bare minimum.This book starts out on a mission to a primative and very violent planet called Angira where Sulu/Spock are to accompany Price Vikram to his home planet... then all hades breaks out as they are caught in an ambush. This book features the sword fighting skill of Sulu and those of Spock as well making for an interesting tale as modernization is shunned. With the future of Angira hanging in the balance, it is upto the skills of both Sulu and Spock to carry on with the mission as their survival and that of Angira are all dependent upon their abilities with the sword."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shadow Lord","review":"In my opinion, Laurence Yep has never read a Star Trek novel in his life, and the editor probably hadn't either. Often, facts become distorted and don't concur with previously established facts. The story did have a decent plot line - for a fantasy novel, not a science fiction novel."},{"rating":"2","title":"So ****ing jawesome!","review":"Every song on this album is jawesome. From the opening song (\\"None of the Above\\"), a tribute to their deceased friend Marty Emond (who was also a great artist) to the final song (\\"Guts and the Glory\\"); just......... excellent. Heavy enough for the headbangers, yet pop enough for the newbies (such as myself; before this, I didn't have any Shihad albums). Much better than the album they recorded as 'Pacifier' (what a ****ing cop-out).PS. If you say 'could of' instead of 'could have', then your opinion is null and void."},{"rating":"1","title":"Copying themselves.","review":"Unfortunatly this band \\"Shihad\\" are way to busy trying to be their \\"Killjoy\\" album again, copying it and trying to repeat themselves.Its a shame, cause they could of really made a great album, but this just is'nt the Shihad that made them what they really are.Get Churn, Killjoy, Shihad, The general electric."},{"rating":"2","title":"This may not be for you.","review":"First off, I thought the book was great! I liked the development of the characters, the changes in scenery, as well as the twists and turns the plot took. Although it was, at times, like riding a boat in an ocean with great swells and then down turns in pace until the next swell, overall it kept my attention.People who dislike this book seem to do so more out of a feeling that they were surprised that it was based on Christian values/morals... whatever. This to me is of no consequence. If had undertones of Allah, Buddha, Aphrodite, or any other god, I would be fine with it as well. It is a fiction book and should be treated as such. While I enjoyed the different views the author took on the subject of Christianity, many people found it offensive.In short, if you are offended by something you don't believe in, this may not be for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Light of Eidon","review":"Great story with wonderful Christian parallels. I really liked the character development of the main character. I downloaded and started the 2nd book of this series. \\"The Shadow Within\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"You know it's good when you go back for more.","review":"The Light of Eidon was one of the first books I grabbed for my Ipad when the Kindle application came out. I am a big fan of this type of fantasy and to have it written by a Christian author was just a bonus. I liked it so well that I purchased the other three books of the series on my Kindle and am halfway through reading them.There are wonderful twists and turns in the plot of the book. Just when you think you have it figured out it changes. The battle between good and evil rages but it is often hard to tell who is on what side (not in a confusing way). There is some real insight to the deceptive and devious nature of evil and how good can be corrupted. All in all a great read with human insight.Finally, how can you go wrong with a free book on your Kindle. But be warned, although this book has a true ending that you can stop at. I believe you will find yourself, like me, wanting to see where the story goes and reading the rest of the series."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely fantastic","review":"Definitely one of the best fantasy novels I've ever read. The story is well written with an complex and wonderful plot.The characters are lovable and Karen does well to capture a person's very real struggle with faith.Containing all the elements of a fine fantasy novel, this fast-paced, thrilling book is definitely a must-read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Definitely Surprised","review":"The story is about a young man named Abramm who is struggling through life. He isn't accepted by his family, tricked by those he trusts, deceived by others, and yet has many trials to face in it all. You follow him through seeming constant mishaps and disadvantages and watch him grow into an amazing leader who is strong and loyal. He wouldn't have become the man he did if it weren't for all the bad things. It's a story that makes you realize that although you feel betrayed by faith and let down by all, sometimes there is something far more important happening than just what you can see. The characters made you love them, laugh, feel sadness, and even anger at things that occurred. It was realistic and with the great way it was written, you felt like you were there with them through it. A great read and one that I would definitely recommend."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the fantasy i was expecting","review":"It starts out like it might be an interesting fantasy book but it gets very religious fast. It's about a young man trying to figure out which religion is the \\"real one\\". I don't like the whole \\"my religion is the true one\\" but also it was poorly written. The action was boring and slow. There was an attempt at character depth but failed. Im not one to leave a book unfinished so I finished it. Im not at all interested in how the series ends."},{"rating":"1","title":"reworking of christian themes, buyer beware","review":"this was well written but the strong christian theme was overwhelming. the plot is unoriginal and is losely based on the conflict between christians, jews, and muslims(with muslims protrayed as evil) . very disappointing and a total waste of money"},{"rating":"2","title":"Exceptional Story Line and Climax","review":"I found myself reading well into the wee hours even with an early work schedule - I just did not want to stop. I read this one through about 3 times savoring the plot and drama the author wove into it. I read the other two in this series as well and found them worthy sequels. My favorite so far is the second - The Darkness Within. I've read it through at least 6 times. Though not as high a literature as Lord of the Rings - I nonetheless enjoyed this series more than anything else I've ever read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unconvincing","review":"It started out interesting but got tedious very quickly. The characters and situations felt very contrived and there was no real suspense. It was obvious that the hero is destined to triumph (with the right attitude) despite all the impossible situations the author put him into."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a book for non-Christians","review":"This book is a fantasy based in a very heavy handed way on the Christian faith. Oddly it somehow manages to make the Christian world, which you would think be shown in a positive way, as just a bit creepy. Well actually more than a bit creepy. The writing is certainly well down. The characters have depth and the plot line is interesting. You want to know what happens and it is an easy read. I am sure that for those who share the value system in this book, this will be a fine story to follow. For me, even though I feel compelled to finish a story line, I find myself unwilling to dive back into what I feel is fouled water."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bleh","review":"The book may have been well written, as in good sentence structure, but the story was bleh. Nothing original and nothing stood out, and it was hard to get into. It felt like a forced story from page 1, and it made it impossible for me to even immerse myself into the story itself.I very rarely stop reading something when I start it, but this book would have gone in the trash (if it wasn't a digital copy), I wouldn't even have donated it to the library because I wouldn't want anyone else to suffer.This author is going on my no buy list (Granted this book was free, and I now know why)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Christian Fantasy Fiction","review":"If I had read a couple of reviews I would understand this is a thinly veiled Christian novel, which is fine but not what I was after. The first 25% was a good interesting read, which descended into rote action novel doldrums and finally the last half of the book resolved to be tortuously preachy and really just boring."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a fan of Catholic bashing...","review":"I couldn't help but feel the authors agenda to discredit the Catholic Church. Even using terms like catechism to make sure there is no mistake. I hate to break it to you, Ms. Karen, but there is truth and Godliness in the Catholic Church, and the Pope is a Godly man who desires to bring people closer to Jesus."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'm hoping for more in book 2","review":"My first Kindle reading experience, Light of Eidon was not all I'd hoped it would be. I have never read Karen Hancock before, but others had recommended it as akin to Tolkein and so I went in with high expectations indeed. I think many of the elements for good fantasy are there, but at times I had a hard time weeding through the plot and allegory. Elements of various stories, the Biblical Joseph and David as well as Martin Luther came through for me, but the storyline shifted a bit and became hard to follow at times. Given that it is the first book in a series and has a lot of characters to develop as well as a whole world to create, I may give the second book a chance to see if I can get into the world a little more."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good read regardless of genre","review":"The author has a website and the book is published by Bethany House, a Christian publishing firm. These are two big hints that the book may have religious/Christian overtones. Is that bad? Not if it's a good story. And this is a good story. If you like the fantasy/sword n sorcery genre of books, this should work for you.If you wish to read more into it you can. If you want your thought processes moving, this will do it. The other reviews tell what the book is about. If you want to be entertained, read it. I doubt you'll regret it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fabulous","review":"What a great story, I am so riveted by this amazing story as it unfolds that I have already purchased all the other books in the series, I want to be able to read one after the other and totally enjoy the journey! Thankyou to the author for such a wonderful book to read, easy style of writing, incredible imagination to bring this into a reality! Read this book for a wonderful gift to yourself!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Liked this very much","review":"I grabbed this book because it was free and ended up thoroughly enjoying it. I thought it was paced well and was exciting to read. I can see me reading the whole series if they are as good as this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"A hidden treasure","review":"When I first bought this book I did because it was cheap. Ater reading this boolk I went on to complete each and every book in the series. It so beatifully describes the personal relationship with Jesus and what walking in the Light really means and l,ooks like. A great alagory for today."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good adventure story","review":"After finishing this book I'm left scratching my head at the reviews which cry foul at being preached at, etc. Yes, a major theme is religion, but it is a fantasy religion, which has magical powers. While there are obvious parallels to Christianity, the story hardly would be considered preachy. I made the mistake of reading some of the comments here before reading the book and I think it took a little away from my enjoyment of the book. I kept waiting for the blatant religious plug that the detractors claimed was in here and it never came. I think too many people are looking to be offended by anything remotely associated with Christianity.My advice would be to read it and judge for yourself. Don't pass it up just because of some of the agenda driven reviews. It is a good story on its own."},{"rating":"2","title":"Christian themes, but enjoyable for all.","review":"I greatly enjoyed this book. If you are familiar with Christianity it's difficult for some of the themes not to remind you of it, but the books is not proselytizing and it would be enjoyable for any fantasy fan, not just Christians."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Read!!","review":"After reading this book I read every book I could find that Karen put out. She is an amazing writer with unique ideas. I love Science Fiction and Fantasy, so to have that with the Christian backdrop was like water on dry soil. I like Orson Scott Card but there is always something disturbing that is slipped in the message. I wish she wrote more books!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I must have been really bored to read all the way to the end.","review":"I spent the first half of the novel thinking that the hero was a wimp. The last half showed that he was just stupid. No wonder he converted. I thought that the transparent Jesus theme was ponderous."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very 1 dimensional","review":"I read it all the way through and was glad it was free. The book takes most of it's story from Spartacus, but with a simple, black & white evangelical spin. Mot much depth to any of the characters. Not worth the $0 I spent on it. I just want Amazon to stop recommending other books in this series."},{"rating":"1","title":"too much focus on finding god","review":"It has no real action its main focus is finding god for the people and belief. It reminds me of the people who can't accept other religions or all other religions are evil."},{"rating":"1","title":"Deception, disgrace...","review":"This book made me upset. One everyone was interchangeable; the names of the characters seem to change often. That or the author maybe forgot who was supposed to do what so, what the hey, lets make all the names the same and let the reader guess who I was supposed to be talking about. Also this is a JESUS book. not the Bible...but the whole time he's talking about sacrificing for God and his spirituality and whatnot. I didn't bother to finish it because it was too bloody frustrating to try to piece it together; I'd rather watch paint dry. No seriously, I deleted it and just sat around the office while people we painting instead. Much more gratifying."},{"rating":"2","title":"a great read","review":"I opened this book a little skeptical of what I would find, but I ended up falling in love with the characters -- Abramm and Trap and even little Philip. If you like fantasy, particularly Christian fantasy, this is definitely worth a look."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pulp fiction","review":"I have mixed feelings about this book. I found the writing trite. It reminded me of pulp fiction novellas, especially how the author felt obligated to remind us of past action, some of which just happened. The world development was excellent, though the character development was slow. The story line has promise, through the thinly veiled Christian influence was annoying. The author could have come up with a better delivery.All in all, a quick read without much substance."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderfully gripping","review":"I read The Light of Eidon a couple of years ago and I'm reading it again now. I am enjoying it every bit as much as I did the first time--actually more! If you love fantasy where real truths shine through and God's love and mercy are portrayed with startling clarity, then read The Light of Eidon."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing read","review":"I don't have enough good things to say about this book and the rest of the series. Karen Hancock draws you in so that at the end of each book, you can't wait to start the next. I first got this book because it was free, not thinking much of it, but once I started reading it, I could not wait to buy the rest. The correspondence with Christianity and the Christian walk is powerful as well. Excellent allegory, intriguing plot, likeable characters - everything to make this a fantastic read. It will be worth your time."},{"rating":"2","title":"truly awesome","review":"The first book I read from this auther, and now one of my favorite books. I love the writing. Awesome book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hebrew and Aramaic Languanges are breath of God","review":"As I consider this book is really inspired by God, because for me Hebrew and Aramaic are languages that really originated from God - Himself. So using this as an incantation is really wonderful and very extra ordinary because million of His angels will respond to the invocation and guard and do the bidding of the conjurer. So I hope that all occult student who wants to know the wisdom of God may know his secret and never give to uninitiated idiot."},{"rating":"1","title":"Classical Elevator Music","review":"The music lackes the fire I like from Wagner.

To this comment, I say \\"Baloney\\". One great thing about Amazon is their sale of deleted CDs by independent sellers. When George Szell/Cleveland Orchestra CDs suddenly disappear, their price by the independent sellers skyrockets. As for the present CD, I have bought it on LP, cassette and CD and cherished it for years. The playing is sensational, the performances have plenty of passion and the sound is great. The Die Meistersinger and Tristan excerpts were recorded earlier than the Ring and have a little more spontanaiety but the Ring excerpts are also outstanding."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ok tires.","review":"Got these, and they seem nice, were inexpensive, but ended up putting hookworms on my bike."},{"rating":"1","title":"Slippery","review":"AFTER RIDING MORE, I\\"M DROPPING STARS TO ONE.

I ride through everything. Also don't worry about the \\"square tread\\", it's not really that square, you won't slide out unless you are cornering VERY sharply at high speed on a dusty road or whatever.

You get thicker, stickier, and less knobby treads which roll a lot smoother and faster.

In my opinion the author simply could not maintain the viewpoint of someone who doesnt already know the material long enough to convey much of anything usefull. He steadfastly plods along spiceing up his verbage with mneumonics but doesnt bother to tell you what they mean any time soon. His \\"this is covered laters\\" makes one wonder why the [heck] he introduced the concept if he wasnt going to address it. His lack of address of basics in any logical direction left me spinning.

The basic premise isn't bad, although it's a bit of a stretch historically: an ailing emperor Tiberius sends a trusted investigator to Judea to look into the facts and rumors surrounding the trial and execution of Jesus of Nazareth. But from there on, it's all down hill. And the climax, in which a swishy Caligula murders his uncle Tiberius to keep him from issuing an edict making Christianity the official religion of the Roman Empire, boggles the mind. Not worth even the reduced cost of the DVD or the time it takes to watch it, unless you can enjoy the locations and costumes and ignore everything else."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Final Inquiry","review":"AWESOME movie!!!

Dolph plays a barbarian who has a secondary role at best. The dialogue was abysmal. This was the first time I've ever seen a movie where I actually realized that they were using fake props. This was particularly evident during a stoning scene. It was obvious that the person was being hit with foam rocks. I'm also pretty sure the swords during a fight scene were made out of cardboard.Dolph needs to be the lead in any movie he's in. It doesn't work otherwise, except in Rocky IV. The fact that his character didn't even have any personality didn't help either.The one redeeming thing about this movie is that a Christian will find the story/ message good. This does give a positive and uplifting message about Jesus.

He does not disappoint. The combination of technical prowess along with romantic feeling can be heard throughout. It is a live recording, and there is a sense of it being a special occassion. The violin concerto is equally satisfying. Although this is a showpiece, Oistrakh doesn't dazzle us at the expense of the music.

If that's your thing, fine, but I bought this as a monster movie, not a titillation flick. The Ron Jeremy appearance was just weird.The only good thing about this was the Creature costume, but even that didn't work out particularly well.

Marla, though in a good job, still had to watch her budget, while Jaicey had financial security. Jake's protective instincts towards his baby sister, told him there was alot more to Marla than she was willing to say. Though Marla wanted desperately to share the secret, it wasn't hers to tell; it was Jaicey's. Yet as she got to know Jake better and their attraction to one another grew, Marla was torn and no longer wanted to keep secrets.This was a sweet story of a woman torn between loyalty to her fraternal twin sister, and the man she has come to love, her sister's adopted brother.

The acting is horrid. The dialogue is even worse. The actress who was supposed to be playing the \\"hot chick on campus\\" was nothing to be desired for. I don't understand the DVD cover; it really has nothing to do with the movie.

Even though the comedy was nothing like Super Troopers, and thank god it was nothing like Club Dread, I found it enjoyable. If I had to compare it to another movie I'd say it was a lot like Clerks. The acting at times in terrible, but most of the jokes come off well and are really funny. The movie basically revolves around this guy who gets into relationship with a girl who is still dating her old boyfriend. The main character is Dante'esque in the fact that he has no spine, and is a bit of a loser. The plot is pretty strong, and believable and has a nice climatic ending. If you're not going to buy it, I highly suggest you rent it because it has one of the greatest lines ever in a movie (when one friend basically ruins anothers chances of hooking up with a girl at a bar)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Warm, solid comedy with bits of Broken Lizard brilliance","review":"You gotta stick with this one! I'll be the first to admit, the first twenty or so minutes threw me.

This movie flat-out SUCKED!!I did not know that this was, in fact, a first/college film going into it. To its credit, it LOOKS okay, but it is a steaming mess from beginning to end. The jokes, with a few exceptions, were nowhere to be found and the ones I did like could've been written better. There was absolutely NO chemistry between any of the Lizards or their supporting cast. I felt I was watching a bad Kevin Smith film(If Kevin Smith was lobotomised and electroshocked while shooting heroine)on a bad acid trip while on fire!!BOTTOM LINE: Take the $4 you'd spend renting it and see \\"Super Troopers\\" or \\"Club Dread\\" again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Woefully Bad","review":"I read all the negative reviews of this movie before I bought it - I should have believed them!

After becoming a huge fan of BEERFEST, i had to see some of Broken Lizard's earlier work. This one stacks up nicely to other low budget films (i think the entire movie was done for less than $50k?). Steve is the main character, a typical college student trying to make it with the Student Body President. Unfortunately, she's got a boyfriend from high school who plays rugby. The rest of the BL crew fill in as his buddies. Erik's character is quite eccentric (sic). The humor is not as laugh out loud funny, but an enjoyable movie nonetheless. Also check out The Slammin' Salmon, Broken Lizards newest flick which ranks up with Beerfest and Super Troopers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better Than Super Troopers And Club Dread!","review":"I am shocked at all the negative reviews. This movie is absolutely hilarious! There are some classic lines in this film and the film had a good story. Super Troopers was good but was too silly and Club Dread was just stupid.

I expected better than what I watched from the film. I wasn't able to follow the plot of the movie because they goes off about each of the five Lizards. I did think the movie was funny and I laughed through various scenes such as the one in the cafeteria where the lizards get caught, which is why I am giving the movie two stars instead of one. If you are into crude humor I slightly recommend this movie, but it definitely isn't worth spending the money buy.The only part I liked was the chemistry between the 5 Lizards, but not much else."},{"rating":"2","title":"no structure ? you need the ''Remedial Reading'' dvd !","review":"dvd keep-case insert reads :LESSON INDEXI What is Grammar ?II Nouns, Pronouns and Adjectives_ A Nouns_ _ 1 Common Nouns_ _ 2 Proper Nouns_ _ 3 Compound Nouns_ _ 4 Collective Nouns_ B Pronouns_ _ 1 Personal Pronouns_ _ 2 Possessive Pronouns_ _ 3 Demonstrative Pronouns_ C AdjectivesQuiz 1III Verbs_ A What is a verb ?_ B Verb Tenses_ _ 1 The Simple Tenses_ _ 2 The Perfect Tenses_ _ 3 The Simple Progressive Tenses_ _ 4 The Perfect Progressive TensesQuiz 2_ C Verbals_ _ 1 Gerunds_ _ 2 Infinitives_ _ 3 Present and Past ParticiplesIV Adverbs, Prepositions, Conjunctions and Interjections_ A Adverbs_ B Prepositions_ C Conjunctions_ D InterjectionsQuiz 3V Sentences_ A Simple Sentences_ B Phrases and ObjectsQUIZ 4so, yeah ... these is no discernible structure, just as another reviewer claims"},{"rating":"1","title":"print comes out so soft and light it's a waste of paper.","review":"I have been printing with Hahnemuehle Fine Art Paper and assumed Canon Photo Rag would be similar to that.

The claim: \\"This book will guide you to the top point of professional trading.\\" The reality is that the first part is poorly written and edited--and its just a short summary of the nuts and bolts of forex, with a plug for the author's website training program (I thought I was going to be guided the the \\"top point\\" of professional trading, but it looks like I'm just being guided to give more money to the author). The second part of this item was copy-written in 2002. It is essentially just another encyclopedia of technical indicators and an outline of US currency/economic history.

I think that it is a valuable inclusion in this bible. if you think of it less as a comparitive tool and more like a 4 in 1 bible that lets you pull scripture to fit your audience or to simply help you to better understand then the message fits right in."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice bible, however......","review":"It would be nice if these parallel bibles came in larger print, even an upgrade to a 9.5 would be such a blessing.

The lights come on in just about any type of wind. The controls are not easily accessible one the light is mounted. While the motion detector pivots up and down, it does not pivot left or right. Plus, after a little over a year of owning these lights, one stopped working according to specifications. No matter how I adjust the timing control, the light goes off after 10 secs or so. I called the manufacturer and they said it was a defective sensor that would need to be replaced but that they would not cover (because it was over a year old) and they could not sell me the part. I contrast this to support from a competitor's product that I had purchased several years earlier that had problems after several years. That manufacturer replaced the product free of charge. The only ask was that I send them the defective light."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring!","review":"The author of this book obviously knows this subject very well,being that he was a reporter for the El Paso newspaper during the time of the historic NCAA championship game. Mr. Sanchez's writing style does not make for an exciting read. This book is very dry and sticks to dull statistics. It basically is a game by game telling of the season.

I got this disk to see if that old country version of Ed Sullivan, called Hee Haw, was better or worse given the vantage point of history. At its best, HH could in fact be funny, sexy, irreverent, and even fun to listen to. Plus, it did have \\"a heart\\", bringing the \\"grand ole opry\\" spirit to tv. The grand ole opry was unique in that it was the zenith of country music, yet (unlike say Carnegie Hall for classical musicians) the performers normally did not demonstrate a complete mastery of their craft...in other words, anyone could do it. But that was what was(and is) great about country music versus, say, rock.Anyway, if you want to see Hee Haw again, this disk certainly does that. It is just a piece of the giant (Hee Haw series) pie and thus is by no means the best.

Judith Modell is an adopter and a cultural anthropologist. Her book is a careful analysis of the institution of adoption.Modell points out the historic roots of \\"fictive\\" kinship in adoption. She also brings up some of the paradoxes of this \\"peculiar\\" institution. Adoption requires that the birth family be destroyed before the adoptive family can be created.Modell gives a brief description of the first investigation of \\"baby farming\\" in Chicago in 1917. She point up news articles from the 1980s on \\"baby marketing\\" as big business.Overall, Modell questions the benefit of the adoption system for those directly involved and for this society at large."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unjustly negative toward adoption","review":"I think the book was written with a very negative view of adoption.

I would recommend just checking it out of a library rather than buying it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for the average bride","review":"This book, written by the owner of a web design firm and a professional writer, is clearly slanted toward the older bride who lives in or near a metropolitan area and who has a large wedding budget. If you live in a mid-sized city or a small town, you won't find most of the ideas of much value. As an event planner located in a mid-sized city, my clients provide more down-to-earth and affordable ideas than those found in this book. Save your money and purchase a more practical book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book!","review":"The Anti-Bride Guide is the single best wedding resource we have found. My fiance and I didn't think that there was anyone out there who knew much about what the Alterna crowd wants, and what's wrong with the whole tradition surrounding weddings in general.

It is, generally, about the same as the others I've read. The most \\"anti\\" theme is the book is that you don't have to do what your family wants you to. But, there is plenty of discussion of etiquette, what to do, what not to do, etc. Sure there are a few nice ideas, but all bridal guides tend to have a few nice ideas. I was looking for a book that could really assist me in having a wedding that is *different.* I wanted something to help me get past all that brainwashing about what a wedding looks like. This book, instead, offers slightly alternative-ish ideas about how you might adjust existing traditions and how you don't have to listen to all your family. Not a bad wedding book, but just doesn't live up to being anything that different from what is already out there."},{"rating":"1","title":"Some tidbits...but decidedly not for the anti-bride","review":"I was very disappointed with this book. As a traditional wedding guide, it's not bad - filled with the basics of wedding planning: cutting down your guest list, gown shopping, reception options, etc all wrapped up in a fun little guide. However, as an anti-bride wedding resource? Not so much. While the book toted the mantra of \\"it's ok to be different,\\" it didn't offer much of substance. Other than explaining that not all bridesmaids are wearing the same dress these days (*gasp!), that brides...sometimes wear dresses other than traditional white (*holy cow*!), and you can get married...in a park (*Crazy talk!*). The wedding planning section was thrown in as an afterthought (assuming you'd spend the big bucks for its sister book, called the Anti-bride planner).If you're looking for off-the-beaten-path ideas for your wedding, move along. There's nothing to see here."},{"rating":"1","title":"There's nothing anti about it","review":"This book is exactly, EXACTLY! the same as every other wedding planning book on the market. Nothing happens outside the box. I was looking for a book that would help me plan a truly non-traditional wedding, and instead the book suggests a few slight variations on all the current traditions.

If you're old enough not to need advice along the lines of \\"you don't have to conform to anyone's expectations\\" (e.g. the alleged target market for the book in the first place), you may not find it very useful.

DON'T MAKE THE SAME MISTAKE!!!!If you want help with the nuts and bolts of wedding planning, refer to something practical like the Knot or Martha Stewart guides. Then, use their outlines, checklists, and advice as a spring-board for implementing your own personal and creative ideas.

This book is a pretty typical wedding planning book, with a few nontraditional ideas here and there. What I wanted from this book are real tips for people who have not been obsessed with their wedding since elementary school, but it did not deliver. In my opinion, anti-brides do not register at Tiffany's and do not wear couture bridal gowns. I'll stick with Bridal Bargains which is a great book for those who are not obsessed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not much different than all the other bridal books","review":"I bought a slew of books when trying to plan my wedding in 8 weeks.

It's too structured. She can't just go to the game she wants to play. She must complete them in a specific order. Also, if she makes a mistake on a game, instead of asking her to correct her mistake, it makes her start the game over -- very frustrating! The only thing she liked was printing coloring pictures from the Great Big Book of Everything and even that was disappointing as it did not provide pictures for every letter of the alphabet. I found the games very simplistic with no way to increase the skill level. Even if she liked it, she would have outgrown it very quickly.

Well, it does, if your fist aquarium is a biotope. I would not recommend this book for beginners who are looking for basic ideas to set up their first tank. It DOES have a great intro on fish, substrates and planting. In my opinion, this book is GREAT for someone who has earned their experience and is now up for a new challenge, ie, designing a biotope. If you don't feel like choosing particular types of rocks and gluing them together with silicone to make caves, or, varnishing bamboo inside and out, then, I would recommend that you search the web and look at pictures of other peoples tanks.

You will definitely be inspired! The biotopte profiles are in-depth enough, but I feel Hiscock could have better explained how to actually assemble some of the tank features--namely the Chinese Stream waterfall. Although some of the plant types listed do not always \\"go\\" with the specified biotope, the finished product looks great and could be easily modified for the purists out there. The only complaint I have is that most of the designs are intended for large tanks. I think you could probably scale down some of the designs, but they might not have the same impact. Regardless, this is a great book for the money!"},{"rating":"2","title":"An excellent read","review":"While most people tout the pictures, I find the Hiscock's description of the different ecosystems fascinating. For example, most people know, at the most, that Zebra Fish come from Eastern India.

For example, a roly-poly is not an insect, it is a crustacean. Also, the book counts pro-legs on caterpillars as legs (ALL INSECTS have 6 legs!). What is even more disappointing is that the book promotes itself as scientifically accurate, so parents teach their children the wrong information.

In all honesty, I was kind of disturbed at how \\"loosely\\" Scotty holds God's grace. I know we are saved by God's grace alone and that our righteousness is as filthy rags before God, but his description of God's grace seems to nullify sin. He makes it seem as though Christ actually killed sin on the cross, therefore we can pretty much do what we want and it won't be counted unto us as sin. It seems more like a book on making people feel better about their sinful state rather than using the Spirit of God to overcome it. We may be in a sinful world but we can live above it."},{"rating":"1","title":"I learned more than I wanted too.","review":"I am a big fan of SCC, so of course I'm going to buy this book.

The Shadow Within is a perfect example of the above. Characters are richly developed and I find myself caring about them to the extent that I eagerly await the next installment of the Guardian King series so I can know what becomes of them.

I have to send it back for service. I got it back about 2 weeks later, and everything seemed working fine -- except now I have problem using it with my 420EX flash in bounced position. I have sent complaint letter to the Canon customer relation department and got no reply. Anyway, this may be an isolated incident and I may have gotten a lemon, but I just can't recommend it to anybody because of the problems and frustration I'm having so far."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best prosumer camera period","review":"I owned a G2 for over 6 months. After taking over 4,200 pictures, I am still amazed by what this camera can do. I use this for my wedding photography business and my clients are all very happy with the prints from the G2. The picture quality is excellent, I printed many 8X10 photos and seen many jaws dropped when I told them that is from a digital camera.If you are serious about indoor photography, an external flash is a must. The Canon 420EX is an excellent companion to the G2.The G2 is not perfect, there is room for improvement. The G2 could use a better and faster low light focusing system. The manual focus could be made better with a focusing ring. Faster shutter response time would be nice too. Overall, the G2 is an excellent camera that I would recommend. If you want a simple point and shoot, the G2 might be an overkill. However, if you are an amaturer photographer, this is the camera for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best ever","review":"This is the best digital camera I have ever had.

All praise. 2 little complaints","review":"Great camera as everyone else has pointed out. Two of my biggest beefs/annoyances (which don't affect the picture quality) are:1. It's big and heavy. Compared to a SLR, it's about the same. But many other cameras pack similar features in a smaller/lighter size.2. The grip is too small and very slippery. My older Kodak camera had a rubberized grip and was very easy to hold and compose shots with. It's hard to get a good grip on the camera so it feels like I'm gonna drop it when taking shots on the go.It would have been nice if there was a built-in lens cover too.Ok, enough griping. It's a nice camera."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing Camera at any price","review":"...This is my first \\"serious\\" camera. I researched high and low, and this camera turned a once Olympus repeat customer into a Canon believer. The lens on this camera is very hard to beat. I challenge anyone to find a better lens at this price. If you want better quality you HAVE TO GO SLR!Another major selling point was the rechargeable batteries. DONT BELIEVE THE SALES PEOPLE!! These batteries last FOREVER. I took 2 sets of pictures (122 each) on my new Viking 256MB memory card (purchased from Amazon) with previewing and slide shows in the hotel room ON ONE CHARGE!Try that with a Kodak or Olympus. It's impossible!Buy this camera, or the new G3. You will not be dissapointed!"},{"rating":"2","title":"What a camera!","review":"Honestly, this is an incredible camera. Takes great quiality pictures, along with many awesome special options and effects that you can add.

I purchased the G2 and when it arrived today and did not work properly I contacted Canon. They said they would gladly repair the camera but were unwilling to replace it or guarantee a quick turn around. With a planned trip to the Carribean next week I'm stuck with a non-refundable plane ticket, a defective camera, and a company who could care less about helping solve a problem caused by their defective product. It seemed reasonable to me that they correct this problem but a supervisor told me that Canon does not replace defective cameras. I read another posting about Canon's poor customer service but thought it was just a fluke. I assure you that is not the case. Even the best companies have defective products, but I was expecting more from Canon in terms of correcting the problem. Buyer beware! PS, I hear Nikon and Minolta are very responsive and customer focused. I plan to return my camera and purchase anything but a Canon."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Investment","review":"Easy to use. Takes great pictures. Has lot of extra features to continually improve on your picture taking experiences."},{"rating":"2","title":"good camera but some flaws","review":"A nice unit. Price and features are only average for this class. Feels a bit flimsey. Minor artifacts when sharpening is turned on. It would have been nice to see a better lens. More zoom, better macro. Maybe a 5mp like Sony, Minolta and others are doing. Even better would be a SLR type layout. If you buy this camera you are not likely to regret it. But at 4mp, you better not do too much cropping if you want full 8x10 printouts. Since at 8x10 a 4mp like this only outputs 210 lines per inch. Photo quality requires 200 lines per inch. a 5mp would give more flexibity. The nice things are that it uses industry standard memory sticks so the cost of ownership will be lower as a result. Also comes with a slightly larger then most 32meg memory card. Not big enough, so plan on buying a 128meg one. But large enough to enjoy the camera for a few weeks first."},{"rating":"2","title":"A masterpiece of a digital camera","review":"I've had this camera since April 2003, and it has been one of the best electronics purchases that I have made. I've taken about 5,000 shots with this camera to date, and the image quality with all of them is outstanding, even by today's standards.This camera is capable of producing images up to 11x14 inches without noticeable image grainyness. The F2.0 lens is superb and produces super sharp images. The features are fantastic. The panorama mode is something I use a lot more that I thought I would and produces stunning, seamless panoramas which could easily pass as gallery prints.If you can still find this camera, purchase it! You will not be sorry."},{"rating":"2","title":"A fantastic photo friend for photographers","review":"I've used my Powershot G2 for about a year now and love it. The picture quality is superb. I also consider the G2's support for an external flash a must in a digital camera. This wonderful 4-megapixel camera works very well with the SpeedLight 420EX.

It's an outstanding camera! Takes great pictures, is easy to use (I was taking pictures within 5 minutes of receiving it), and has more features than I have figured out yet. I would however, suggest getting an additional compactflash memory card. The standard 32MB one is decent, but it only allows you 24 pictures. You can always adjust it to take 54 medium quality pictures which is better than the high quality settings on lower cameras, but it is easy to get spoiled. A camera case is also a good idea as it doesn't come with one, and you'll love it too much to risk it getting damaged."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Camera For the Money","review":"I've been using my camera for about a week now but I have to say I love it. My friends and family who all have other models agree that for the few bucks more this one is well worth it. I ordered a 256MB card too so the amount of pictures and video I can record is amazing and far more enough then I need. Pictures come out so clear !! I was debating between this and a camcorder but was extremely happy with my decision. Digital Camcorders only allow you to take pictures at only 1 MP where this one is 4.1MP and allow you to record up to 2 hours on a proper card !

But it was lots of fun. I do recommend that people who are interested in reading this trilogy read it in the correct order, it will make more sense and propably be a little more captivating...but order all three at once because you will want to jump to the next one quickly!

This is my favorite one! Gian's character was not only sexy, and I do mean SEXY, but he was funny and kind. I really couldn't put it down!

Check out the others if you have only read the Matrix set."},{"rating":"2","title":"Matrix of Destiny continues","review":"Great addition to the Matrix of Destiny series. Parts of the book will make more sense if you have read the first two books in the series, but there is a stand-alone story that is well told. Familiar Gian is rescued from the evil Karpon by Jenise after he agrees to an unorthodox bargain. In exchange for his release, he is to take her virginity. What familiar would turn down that arrangement? It quickly becomes more than a simple de-flowering when feelings and instinct become involved. With Karpon on their tail, they must run through danger and through several worlds until they arrive at their Destiny.The story is told in a manner that is both humorous and sensuous at the same time. There is action, adventure, and romance. You will re-meet several characters from Knight of Trillion Stars and Rejar continuing the 'Destiny' storyline, which will make you want to keep reading the series.I listened to the audiobook which was well done."},{"rating":"1","title":"Book is amazing but is not in \\"used, good\\" condition!","review":"I love this book, which is why I ordered it here.

I read it out of sequence by mistake, but was still able to follow the story.I can't believe I never heard of these books before.. This one is a very sensual, erotic, romantic, & suspenseful story. Which has an interesting and refreshing take on shifters and their world. It has a bit of a futuristic/sci-fi tone, but not too much. I really liked this one. And all of the characters were well written. It is a short novel, but there is so much story within, that you will not feel as though something is missing. I highly recommend this read.

This author is an ABSOLUTE MUST READ!!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Mine to Take","review":"The storyline continues and develops that of Rejar and Knight of a Trillion Stars. I read it in one day, it was a riveting page turner. The characters of Jenise and Gian Ren are believable and interesting. Jenise is nnot the usual run of the mill heroine, she stands up for herself when the time comes for it.I look forward to reading the rest of the \\"Matrix of Destiny\\" stories. A must read"},{"rating":"2","title":"a fna of dara joy","review":"I absolutley adored this book. It is worth reading over and over again. I wonder when she is going to come out with another great novel. Gian Ren and Lorgin are my two favorite heros out of dara Joy's novels. Gian almost makes you melt. I LOVED IT."},{"rating":"2","title":"Her best book yet!","review":"Although I did not believe it was possible I actually enjoyed this book more then any other I have ever read. With this book she has become my favorite author!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The story flowed very well and was never boring.","review":"The third book in this series delivers as much enjoyment as the first two. Bringing in new aspects to continue the series while telling a brand new story keeps new readers and old ones glued to the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"I liked it, a lot.","review":"I am a fan of Dara Joy, for the most part. There are some things that were very unclear to the reader and you had to go back and search for parts that made them clear. But all in all this was a very good book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dissappointing as well as insulting","review":"Oh my gosh. I do not know what is up with all these 5 star ratings! I read this book and by the time I got to the end I was ready to toss the damn thing out the door! Admittedly this book was well written, and had a nice plot line, but the characters were terrible! Gian was a self centered, manipulative and arrogant $*%&#@$! He used and abused Janise throughout the whole story, treating her less than human! He took away all her rights as an intelligent being, and controlled and manipulated her to further his self interests. Janise was weak and easily lead astray from her goal of freedom and liberty. She escaped the prison of Karpon, to be locked away in the prison that Gian made for her. Is this what all Ms. Joy's books are like? If so, then I am NOT going to read any more from her. These characters were an insult to any intelligent and independent woman. I had really expected more."},{"rating":"1","title":"I don't know","review":"I was a actually enjoying the book until I came to one sex scene that was like a horrible assault. I'm very open minded to all forms of sexuality, but this seemed to much like a rape. I found it disturbing in the midst of rather silly, whimsical romance."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mine to Take","review":"I have enjoyed All of the books that she has written. I am waiting for her to come out with more of this series. She is keeping me in suspense. I would like to know what the Matrix of Destiny Series is all about and what the titles are. I have not found any of them. If any one knows please let me know. I strongly recommend all of her books."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dissapointing.","review":"I found the book not very well written, though I applaud Dara Joy's talent in creating her own fantasy world. The characters seemed extremely underdeveloped and the sex \\"scenes\\" seemed tacked on for effect."},{"rating":"2","title":"Too much of the plot was left wide open","review":"This was a good book - no where near as good as Rejar. Also there were two main storylines that were introduced and never tied up in this book. The young familiar left in the old cabin being tended by and old lady and Tarbon with his drug to capture the Familiar. Is there another book being written in this series? If so when? Also I really believe it is about time that Traed had his own book. And if I read the word sensual one more time I am going to scream! But all in all this was a good book if you are following the matrix of destiny series - which I am - otherwise I would have given this 2-3 stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow.. HOT","review":"This was the best book of the series. Much better than REJAR. The heroine and hero were well matched. She was independent and intelligent. He was sexy, intelligent and knew how to get what he wanted, but still respected her. THis is a keeper to read again. I am looking forward to Traed's story. Hope it is forthcoming."},{"rating":"2","title":"WOW When is the next book? PLZ PLZ I need to know.","review":"I've read \\"Mine to Take\\" a dozen times and will probably read it a dozen more. This is definatly on my KEEPER list. Gian Ren & Janise are explosive together. Throughly enjoyable. Can't wait for your next book.The book \\"Rejar\\" took me time to find but was well worth it. OK now for the questions for Ms. Joy .. When are we going to see the story on Traed ta'al Krue? Does he rescue Dariq? Does he mention to Yaniff seeing a battered body and Yaniff sends him to find his destiny? Please let me know when I can read the next story? Traed is mysterious but sexy."},{"rating":"2","title":"To good to put down","review":"I have read all of Dara Joy's books. I have been so captivated by them you can not put them down. You just have to find out the ending. I also never laughed so much with the silly little things that can go wrong in the adventure and that can go right in the same moment. MINE TO TAKE is so spell binding I don't know where to begin. If you have read REJAR you will know what a familiar is. In this book you learn more about the habits and then way familiars can control their bodies to satisfy a mate. It also gives you an idea on how a mate is chosen and how that familiar can keep his ferility. Please read this book.....I have read it 7 times and still can not get enough of it.Dara Joy please keep making these beautiful and heart warming stories so I can add them to my collection. Would you also send me an autograph please."},{"rating":"2","title":"DARA JOY'S MEN ARE EVERY WOMAN'S FANTASY","review":"I have read all three of Dara's Avarian books and I have to say they are the most sensuous stories I have ever read. I am usually put off by time travel but her stories are somehow believable. The male characters are very real, however I wish the female characters had more substance. The females are so ordinary that I wonder what draws the men to them in the first place. The only thing that makes the female exceptional is the male's devotion toward her. I am anxious for Traed's story. Keep up the good work Dara and please give the female a little more backbone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not bad, but not one of her better ones","review":"I lvoe Dara Joy, but for some reason this one didn't grab me--too much time spent with other characters especially in the beginning. Still, it's worth the time and money."},{"rating":"1","title":"waste","review":"the book was a waste of a poor tree. please do not let trees die in vain... OMG this horrible book has turned me into a tree hugger!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Merely finishing a manuscript must get her published.","review":"Too many scenes of extra-terrestrials standing around explaining the rules of their species/planet/power/inheritance/etc. I really could not follow the Sci-Fantasy aspects at all. But that's not why most people are purchasing the book, is it?"},{"rating":"1","title":"I cannot stand the covers on Dara Joy's books.","review":"I enjoy this author's writing, but the book cover designs are such a turnoff they detract from the storyline. Hopefully, this will change in the near future."},{"rating":"2","title":"oh Boy!!!! lol","review":"What a story, never have i read anything that got my interest so fast, i picked it up thinking \\"Dry spell have to read something\\". The Familiar appeals to my own heart, the sensualist in me would not let me put it down. The idea that a man was dedicated to your pleasure is what captures our imagination, admitt it girls wouldn't you like to have someone devoted to you like that. I love cats, this surpassed my expectation, I just can't wait to read the rest of her books. Until then i'll just have to dream. Very naughty grin I recomend this book to everyone who dreams of a perfect lover. ENJOY ladies!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Logical continuation of series; prep for what to come","review":"I enjoyed this book, but I have to admit to being put out by the shallowness of the heroine, Jenise, and how easily Gian manipulates her. More than anything, this book really makes me look forward to the next in the series. (I think) that it will be either about Traed or about the presumed-dead Familiar left behind by Gian. Both are terrific ideas. Either way, I hope that the future heroines of the series have more personality than some of the previous ones! All in all, an enjoyable read."},{"rating":"2","title":"DETAILICIOUS!!!!!!!","review":"I must say that I have never had any interest in science-fiction or any reading material that included aliens. This book opened my eyes! Again, Dara Joy thrills the heart and soul with the fire of pleasure and desire. The mind is full of vivid pictures as one reads the events throughout this story. The gallant and chivalrous Gian Ren was magnificent and the spunky character of Jenise was designed perfectly for such a cocky King. MAGNIFICENT!"},{"rating":"2","title":"They just keep getting better.","review":"How can you argue with a 32,000 ton Mk XXXIII Bolo Planetary Siege Unit? Veeeerrrry Carefully. Action, adventure, drug abuse and recovery, are there any bases Keith hasn't covered here? Well worth the read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Take out the human element.","review":"If there was no human element in this book, it might be 4 stars. It has a slow start. The star of the book,is Victor a Bolo Mark XXXIII of the 4th Regiment, Second Brigade, First Confederation Mobile Army Corps, in the vanguard of an all-out Bolo strike against the planet Caern. The enemy is the Aetryx, shadowy, unknown beings who enslave other species with nothing less than the promise of immortality. As a savage interstellar war begins, Colonel Jon Streicher prepares to lead Victor and the rest of his reigment in a planetary invasion. But the landing falls into a trap. They find themselves stranded and desperately attempting to survive the hellfire chaos of modern warfare as Bolo faces Bolo-human hybrid in a cataclysmic showdown that will uncover unexpected truths, reveal hidden secrets, and even call into question the loyalty of the Dinochrome Brigade itself. Should have only had the Bolo elements in this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"stupid","review":"This book is too focused on the action and doesn't have anything to really say. The action itself is suspect and, since you have little choice but to pay attention to all the nagging details, you acquire doubts about it. The lead Bolo character jumped on the way down to the surface by a submarine. Nobody thought about the possibility of submarines? And \\"nobody expected such stiff resistance.\\" Oh how original is that. Why do I even notice that the yields on various weapons keep changing around?The biggest disappointment is the Bolos themselves are very boring, when they are supposed to be the draw of a Bolo book.The human characters are frightfully overwrought. The female lead who is in love with the Bolo because she was sexually abused by her father and previous boyfriends? The drug-addicted regimental commander who nips off from his post in the middle of a planetary invasion and starts making out with his XO? Come on. It doesn't serve a purpose."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ex post facto assertions","review":"It is an agitprop masterwork involved presenting the communist wolves as innocent victims of a heartless state; repackaging Jack the ripper as a feminist would have been, by comparison a child's play.Reading the book savored all too obviously of the proverbial chutzpah-exemplar who murdered his parents and then pleaded for mercy as an orphan."},{"rating":"2","title":"3 great DVD's that a true horror fan must have","review":"If you're looking for good horror movies you definitely have to buy this box set, it has 3 great horror classics and are on special editions, that a true horror fan must have, I mean it has a great price, and I asure you that you'll love this movies:-Carrie (A+)-The Fog (A)-The Howling (A)"},{"rating":"2","title":"3 GREAT DVDS!","review":"These are some awsome movies!

The absence of technical terms leads to a readable and useful tool to maximize one's understanding of the Word for daily life. Commentary is substantial but not over done. This is a real treasure for those who seek to understand the spiritual, practical message of the New Testament and live accordingly."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Overview","review":"This book isn't for everyone but I think Oxford Handbooks (all of them for Political Science at least) are a useful tool.

They have been around for many years and still none have surpassed their excellence. They are very helpful for the beginner and the advanced student alike. I have read them all and have found that each book in the series is excellent. Although you can't learn a martial art from a book alone, these books are an excellent supplement to your training and are very helpful in learning the finer points of the art of Shotokan. Each book in this series sets the standard for books on Shotokan training. There are simply none better, at least none better that I have found, and I read a lot of martial arts books. I highly recommend these books for anyone who is interested in improving their karate or who is interested in Shotokan. They are simply the best! Highly recommended. 5 Stars.Bohdi Sanders, Shotokan Blackbelt and author ofWarrior Wisdom: The Warrior's Path"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not very helpful...","review":"Volumes 3 and 4 were not very helpful for class nor tournament preparation.

But Lois Gould's poignant memoir \\"Mommy Dressing\\" again underscores that a childhood lived in the shadow of glamor but without love and affection is no way to grow up. It is a dark moment when Gould asks her mother about a scar only to learn that her mother, who had a horror of doctors, had a rib surgically removed the better to wear the fashions of the 1920s. Gould's portrayal of herself as the gawky, awkward, intellectual daughter of a beautiful woman who dominated the American fashion industry for a time is reminiscent of Susan Cheever's recollections of her life as the daughter of novelist John Cheever. A quickly read but fascinating book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Quality","review":"I loved that these dumbbells were sturdy and easy to handle for me. I wish they had come sooner but they were coming from the manufacturer, who were nice enough to call me when they couldn't fulfill the other part of my order (5 lb. dumbbells).

There are no separate levels, as with many other computer games, and the game pieces are cheap.The only educational value that I can afford this game is possibly \\"memory\\" and maybe the \\"sharing\\" of the remote.Other than that it is a very tedious task calibrating the remote and I would honestly not recommend this game at all.

This game sends the wrong message to young girls. First of all, every question focuses on Disney-specific trivia, so it's not educational. But the worst part is that the \\"Reward Video\\" is a montage of princesses kissing their princes. I don't want my daughter to think that being a woman means being rescued by a man. There are so many other toys out there that are designed to send positive messages to young girls, such as exploring your talents, becoming self-sufficient and using your imagination.

However, it was a 2005 edition, and the colors were no longer all \\"true,\\" especially the CMYK mixes. I had a print job almost ruined because I used the CMYK mix on the bridge set. Upon seeing a printed proof of my job, I double-checked the ink setup on another CMYK chart, and realized the Bridge color was very wrong. I returned the set the next day, as this could have been a very costly mistake. On a positive note, Amazon made the return very easy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect for Digital Printers","review":"I am a part time Graphic Designer, and full time Pre-press worker for a 4-Color digital print shop. This book is perfect for that.Many people bring their print jobs in to us and say \\"I need Pantone 320 for the logo\\" and we have to explain over and over again that many Pantone colors are impossible to create using on the CMYK color gamut. They always look at us like we are crazy.Now we can just show them the color swatch and how much different it will look when printed in CMYK. Then we can work on finding the closest equivalent color.It's more expensive than other books because it has double the number of color chips in it. But if you plan on printing with any 4 Color Digital, or Press printers it's a must have."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best solution if you don't need to mix the ink yourself.","review":"I was agonizing over which Pantone set to purchase until I realized many of them deal with mixing the ink. Since I don't have to worry about that (and the printers I work with all have their own Pantone mixing books), I could focus on what was most important to me: the Pantone color, number and associated CMYK and RGB values.

The advisement on the traycard that \\"maximum volume yields maximum results\\" is absolutely true. Seeing Sunn O)))'s name thrown around by countless acts or even just popping up on clothing sported by said acts (including locals Buried at Sea), I pretty much knew what I was in for. Well, to review this here CD particularly, I didn't care much for the opening spoken word part, but after that's over, the second half of the opening track is HEAVY and SLOW (two things I happen to like). I dug the second track a lot with its odd sound. The last cut, taking minimalism to a whole new art form, was completely crushing in the way that only a lack of music can convey. Coming from the more metal-leaning slow, heavy acts (Sleep, Corrupted, Buried at Sea, etc.) this was a little more esoteric, but I loved it the whole way through.How much low end can you take?"},{"rating":"2","title":"OK","review":"Not as good as I remembered it smelling years ago but a nice addition to my fragarance collection anyway."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad Shipping","review":"Don't buy this from Amazon.

If they have not shipped, cancel the order and get it from someone else."},{"rating":"2","title":"My only fragrance","review":"I have been wearing this fragrance for three decades now and I don't wear any other scent.

He is brought back in a most touching scene in the attic with his wife's two small boys.What this man went through from a foremost critic of the faith to one of its most prominent defenders is well showcased. The highlight however, remains the pain of his newly wed wife being taken so quickly from him.Heartwrenching, yet profoundly edifying and inspirational. So well done. Wish there were more demand in our country for such quality without all the sensational and violent and sensual. Speaks too loud about where we are as a nation.This film is definitely the one to view repeatedly for C.S.

She is being told \\"no\\" throughout the entire story. And at the end of the day, she needs to ask her Momma for a kiss goodnight. It would have been nice if the Mother would have atleast told her baby that she loves her when she tucks her in to bed, but she doesn't. This book was such a disappointment without any positive message. The only reason why I gave it 2 stars (instead of 1) was because of the beautiful illustrations."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing but negatives","review":"The book is, not surprisingly, a mirror image of Spike Lee's general demeanor and attitude about life--NEGATIVE. Yes, the mindless repetition of Please baby Please is atrocious, but page after the page what you-and your child--sees and hears is negativity over and over again. DON'T DO THAT! STOP SPLASHING! HURRY UP! NO NO NO NO NO! We all know Spike generally hates life, the man, honkies, Quentin Tarentino, the man, studio execs, the man, and the man. It's sad, frankly, that it's clear that his negativity also crosses over to how he views bringing up children. Can you not show joy and fun to your kids, Spike?"},{"rating":"2","title":"so much fun!!!!","review":"we love to read this book - the pictures are fun for mama and baby, and the cadence of the text is really lovely and enchanting for small children.

It's a board book, so it's perfect for an infant's busy hands. There are probably seven different words in the entire story!!! Absolutely no plot & the story doesn't even make any sense. I'm all for supporting African-American authors, but Mr. & Mrs. Spike Lee need to stick to movies that don't make any sense."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst book ever","review":"I can't believe that trees were killed to produce this awful travesty of a children's book. The text is annoying and idiotic. Kids are supposed to like repetition but the endless begging of \\"please, baby, baby, baby, please, baby\\" is mind-numbingly horrid, not to mention that it sounds like something you'd hear coming out of the VIP room in a cheesy strip club. I suspect that this monstrosity came into being for two reasons: (1) its authorship by Spike Lee (one of my least favorite people) and (2) the illustrations of the African-American eponymous \\"Baby\\" makes it attractive as a shower gift for expectant mothers of color.Please, book-buyer, please, pass this one up. Please, please, please."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love the illustrations!","review":"The artwork is fantastic in this book. The swirls in the little girls hair just make me happy!

My 2 year old enjoys this book very much, and I am glad to have added to her books with people of other ethnicities."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not just for African-Americans!!","review":"This is my daughter's (2 yrs old) absolute favorite book! Although it is illustrated for and targeted to African-American children, it was a must-have for us! I was drawn in by the adorable illustration on the cover + I adore the text, how often am I constantly telling my toddler to \\"keep off the wall?!\\" This is the first book my daughter reaches for when we sit down to read. The rhyme & beat make the book an untiring pleasure to read! Now that we have read it a million times, my daughter will often \\"read\\" it to herself! One of the best things about this book is that my daughter has begun to follow requests with \\"Please\\" in her everyday vocabulary! Who knew that when I bought this book 6 months ago that it'd help to teach my daughter manners?! Don't hesitate to buy this book if you are Caucasion or otherwise, it is bound to the best on your bookshelf!"},{"rating":"2","title":"great pictures","review":"I love reading this book to my 3 and 1 year old!

My husband and I both thought the book had a negative influence. Don't pour your bowl of cereal over your head ... baby baby please ... Great! She had never thought of that before! (She's two.) Don't stick your tongue out at other people ... please baby please ... again. She hadn't done that until the book arrived. Also not a fan of the one about throwing a tantrum when it's time to leave the playground, refusing to hold mama's hand when requested to, coloring with crayons on the wall, or eating sand.I know all ideas eventually occur to all kids, anyway, but it just seemed unnecessary for us to have a whole book sort of glorifying them. Too bad, because the pictures really are fun."},{"rating":"2","title":"You gotta get it! please baby please!","review":"Please get this book. when my household got this book, by twin daughters were a year old. This book is read everyday in our house, and it has been taped and repaired several times due to the girls carrying it around. The rhyming and big pictures are worth it. The illustrations have other details to look at and makes the reading last even longer. Can't wait for Spike Lee and his wife to come out with some more. We have Puppy, Puppy please, and it is almost as big as a hit as baby, baby please. The girls are now 16 months old and this book is still one of the faves!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Adorable illustrations","review":"Hands down - this is my 2 yr old's absolute favorite. She requests to read it all day long. Short enough that I can stop what I am doing long enough for a quick story throughout the day. Illustrations are fantastic!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Part of our nightly ritual","review":"I believe that it is important to introduce children to reading as soon as possible. I love reading this book to my 4 month old daughter, especially at night as part of our bedtime routine. This book would appeal to anyone with children from newborns to toddlers, regardless of race. The topic of this short story is universal, as it discusses the routines that a toddler goes through in a day. The writing is simple and rhythmic with a humorous and loving tone. The illustrations are beautiful and appear to hold my daughters interest. We will be reading this book as she grows into a toddler, if she doesn't eat it first. She loves putting everything in her mouth."},{"rating":"2","title":"Don't take this book so seriously...","review":"Parents that hate this book are expecting some great literary read. Wake up. It's a childrens book. Guess what? Children, especially young ones like repetition.My now 11 month old has loved this book since she was 6 months old. Her first statement was \\"please baby\\" which comes out...\\"peas baby\\". So cute. If I ever want to make her smile in public, I just lean over and whisper in her ear. \\"Please, baby, please\\"....Again, so cute.I will admit after reading it 3 times in a row, I try to distract her so I can hide it, but like I said before, it's a children's book:)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent for Toddlers!!!","review":"Our little girl is 15 months old and loves for me to read this book to her every night. It has became one of our must reads and she enjoys the pictures. I enjoy changing the tone of each page with the \\"please, baby, please\\". I never read it the same way twice. Excellent book for all ages!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful and fun to read","review":"This book is one of my 22 month old daughter's favorites. The illustrations, as other reviewers have mentioned, are unbelievablely gorgeous. A couple of reviewers have complained about the negativity in this book. I really didn't see it that way at all. Every child is being taught(hopefully) appropriate behaviors. Toddler years are challenging for both parents and kids. This book without shouting \\"no\\" at the children, lovingly asks the child to do or not do certain things. I think this book beautifully relates a challenging day in the life of a toddler. How better to send your child to bed than to know that he/she is loved?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Frozen in time","review":"Please Baby Please, is a nightly read for my 15 month old daughter. It was a gift from her aunt, intended for her older brother age 2. The first time she listen to the book being read she was frozen in time. She sat so still. This book is truely about her! Now each time I attempt to read any other book she shouts, \\"Pies Bobby Pies\\", and I know then she wants to read, \\"Please Baby Please\\". Spike and his wife did a wonder job on this book. My kids and I are looking forward to more great books from them."},{"rating":"2","title":"I love this book!","review":"Me and my daughter both love this book! The words create a very fun, song-like rhythm and the little girl is super-cute. I love the ending!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful, funny book that my child loves!","review":"My 2-year-old absolutely loves this book, as do I. The beautiful rhythms of the language, the gorgeous illustrations, and the naughty antics of the baby make me laugh and smile every time. I don't understand the (very few) negative reviews -- just as every parent can relate to having those days when you feel like you're saying \\"No!\\" every other word, I'm sure every toddler can relate to those days when it seems like Mom or Dad is constantly nagging. Being able to laugh about it makes it less stressful.Also, the book is a great way to teach children about time, as the first page is very early in the morning, and the last page it late at night. Each page has a little clock before the text, showing the time of day.I'd recommend the book for 2-3 year-olds."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Joy To Read","review":"This is the perfect gift for a new mom or dad and children LOVE having it read to them before bedtime. The illustrations are the most adorable I've seen in a long time. A must have!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliant Illustrations and Great Reading for Toddlers","review":"Have you ever begged your kids to go back to sleep or thought that baby needs a nap? Well you can identify with what this baby gets into. Even though the child is told \\"no\\" to this or \\"don't\\" do that, you will find yourself laughing at the clever illustrations and expressions. The kids at the daycare believe that everything in the book could happen and realized that the clock depicted in each scene proves that naps are necessary. Now that is a positive reinforcement for parents. The illustrations are phenomenal - the details, color, and mischief depicted - will fill your heart with joy as well as provide discussion topics with your kids.DeltareviewerReviewing for Real Page Turners"},{"rating":"2","title":"An unexpected treasure","review":"We picked up this book at random at the bookstore for a quick read and my 3 year old girl & 5 year old boy LOVED it!

It is a terribly negative book. Everything is \\"don't do this, don't do that!\\" Babies like to splash in the bathtub, and it is joyful to watch them play, but in this book the baby is told not to splash in the tub. Ditto for stopping to smell the flowers: \\"Don't be so slow, baby!\\" My toddler loves looking at the pictures in this book and saying \\"please, baby, please\\", but we have changed the tone entirely, and most of the words so that this book is not negative and unpleasant."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lovely Read","review":"I loved this book because it was a funny and lovely read.

Similar button layout, with the notable exception of the \\"Start\\" and \\"Back\\" button will make sure players can quickly pick it up in the stead of a standard, and an inconspicuous shape and weight make it easy to hold for long gaming. The only notable downside experienced was it the inability to map out all the shoulder buttons when using the controller as a PC gamepad through a third party button mapping software. If you can find this controller for cheaper than a standard Microsoft Wired, I'd recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"HORRIBLE PILE OF POO","review":"This controller came out of the box with an AWESOME option known as the fire and forget.

Casadesus and Francescatti gave in this recording the best performance I've ever heard of the Kreutzer Sonata. I am very biased to Francescatti's side, I cannot hide this, but Casadesus does his best to accompany him, and viceversa.

They will stop you in your tracks. Dybek has staked out a territory purely his own, the lost and dispossessed of Polish Chicago. Chicago has proudly produced Dreiser, Norris, Algren, Levin, Bellow and Farrell--and now Dybek. His work is enduring, funny, incisive and unforgettable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Contemplative and dark short stories. True excellence.","review":"Stuart Dybek is my favorite short-story author. The stories in this book,ranging in length from 'flash' fiction to moderate-length (20-30) page short stories,are written in a sharp and efficient style that is contemplative at the same time. Not overly contemplative, though. It is difficult to explain why you will like these stories. To give you some idea, I would compare the mood of these stories to the stories and longer fiction of John Fowles. Get this book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Polish Kerouac","review":"Ive just finished speed-reading the last pages of The Coast of Chicago (I had my public library deliver it to me via their shut-in service & theyll be picking it up today.) My Polish-speaking psychotherapist (from Chicago) suggested I read it because Im half-Polish myself (maternally; my Polish-speaking mother was even a postulant of the Polish-speaking order of nuns of St. Felix, the Felicians.) Reading Dybek is a frightening & disturbing experience for me because the Polish Roman Catholic image-obsessions he writes about were once just beneath my skin, too. Dybek & I are the same age (b. 1942); but I grew up in Lynn MA. I had once thought Jack Kerouac wrote for all working-class Roman Catholics, but I now know Dybek writes for Polish Roman Catholics, & is the Polish Kerouac.

And having a candlelight brunch (can you picture that!) with this playing in the background truly is delightful. HIGHLY recommended!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Still Relevant","review":"A delightful tale that reverses the role of men and women. For me the most significant part of this fantasy centers around women's behavior in this utopian society. Far from running amok, the absence of men merely means more time for the pursuit of arts, science and gardening. A far different picture than is painted by patriarchal religious leaders around the world.This book is a must read because far from being in decline, purdah and variants of purdah (the segregation of men and women, spiritually, socially and eventually legally) is on the rise. It's noxious seeds can be found wherever and when ever men talk about \\"woman's place\\". Just one of the debilitating effects of purdah in a democratic society is the belief of the woman that she is not accountable for the character of her community. An issue this book addresses clearly.Buy it!~ In fact, buy several and pass them around. Share it with everyone, friends, sisters, daughters, ministers, teachers, legislators."},{"rating":"2","title":"Powerful Stuff","review":"If you are at all interested in Feminism then you must read this book. Discusses Purdah and the utopia dream of Hossain."},{"rating":"2","title":"Primarily non-fiction","review":"Purdah, or the seclusion of a group of people from the rest of the world, is a practice still alive and well in several parts of the world. While it may not be very common in India at the beginning of the twenty-first century, it was quite common during the first half of the twentieth. This book presents short story \\"Sultana's Dream\\" and the recollections of women living under purdah complied by Rokeya Sakhawat Hossain. There is also an introduction to each work and an analysis of Hossain's life and writing by Roushan Jahan interspersed between each piece. In other words, there are four individual essays and one short story in this collection. It could be difficult for women today who do not live in purdah to understand but it is important to remember our collective past and realise similar things are happening today."},{"rating":"1","title":"I AM VERY DISAPPOINTED!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","review":"i wish i would have looked below and read the other reviews because i was expecting two dumbells to be in the box. its pretty stupid to buy one dumbell when they normally come in a set of two. but i guess i will just have to take the lost because i failed to check everything out before i purchased the item."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Eddie Dean Singing","review":"Harmony Trail was produced in 1944 during the waning years of Ken Maynard's popularity as a western hero. Harmony Trail showed Maynard past his prime. He was overweight, doubled chinned and not his usual dashing self. Eddie Dean, the future PRC star and country singer, displayed the singing talents that marked his later career. I rated this 1 star not because of the mundane plot (typical for B westerns). Maynard and Dean together would have rated 5 stars anytime. The poor video quality merited the bad rating. Ghost shadows throughout showed this was derived from a VHS copy and not from film (probably because there's not one left or the poor and detriorrated state of those still in existence). This is becoming typical of recent Alpha Video releases."},{"rating":"1","title":"Weak flavor","review":"I found this very weak in flavor compared to loose leaf Pu-ehr.

But on the page."},{"rating":"2","title":"great novel; distracting edition","review":"This is a terrific novel, even if bleak, as some of the reviewers claim. And really, the bleakness is leavened by a wicked sense of humor. My only complaint is about this particular edition, the Oxford World's Classic. In their attempt at erudition the editors insert irritating asterisks all too frequently in the text, in order to draw our attention to explanatory notes at the back. The notes are in most cases unnecessary, explaining things most readers would already know, and seem provided more in a desire to justify an annotated edition than out of actual need. In any case, they could have a volume with notes included by page at the back of the book, without placing an asterisk in every paragraph that gets discussed--if we have a question on a particular page we could look to the back and see if there is any explanation for that page. So, this a great book, but I'd get a different edition."},{"rating":"1","title":"suga t leave jesus and go back to drugs and hustling","review":"suga t was a cool decent rapper back in the click but then when the money goes low and radio does'nt give you airplay you know radio and television just act like the west coast does'nt exist these days it's easy for suga to quit the life and go gospel this is awful though kirk franklin started this by taking christian rap mainstream now everybody wanna follow suit she think going gospel whatever will get her a bigger audience a sad joke and tells you the state of west xoast hip hop who's gonna go god next boss, yoyo, deadly venomz, jj fad, marveless."},{"rating":"1","title":"Somewhat disappointed","review":"I had high hopes for this book when I bought it, but I am somewhat disappointed. I usually like unique female heroines, but for some reason Fox was incredible unappealing. I think if she said \\"fricking\\" one more time I would have thrown the book out the window. I think the author used superficial elements to try to convey Fox as a spirited, unique, independent woman, i.e. bacon grease, rough language, cigars etc. I would have preferred the author to use a bit more character depth to convey \\"true grit\\" and independence. I agree with the other reviewer whose visual on Tanner sucking on sweaty toes says it all."},{"rating":"2","title":"So wonderful you will laugh and cry outloud!","review":"I love all of Maggie Osborn's books. But Foxfire Bride is incredible. At the beginning you are not sure if you can even relate with the heroin but you come to admire the strengths and weakness of this woman.

Finding this original Title by Claude Challe was impossible. I Even tried to find it by emailing Claude, but that was not successfull. Get your copy of this Re-release while you can. it is a classic and contains many nice tracks. The sound quality of this CD is excellent.

She's really good at cueing you on upcoming moves. Once again, you will get confused the first few times of trying the workout but it's worth the effort once you get the steps down.

There were some new concepts, new ideas, as well as the tried-and-true soothing stories for when I just wanted my troubled waters calmed. The short chapters meant I could read two or three a night. My favorite ones are The Caregiver by N. Davison, and Little Vigilance and The Teacher by Ford Boyer. Lisa Payne's Millenial Dance of Death is a beautiful kind of prose poem--very inspiring stuff."},{"rating":"1","title":"Book review on double helix","review":"Double HelixThis book was an okay book. It is the story of Eli Samuels who is graduating out of high school and gets hired at Wyatt Transgenics by Dr. Quincy Wyatt. Dr. Wyatt seems to be paying special attention to this Eli. Meanwhile Eli's father has a bitter dislike for Dr. Wyatt although he won't tell Ely why. Eli suspects it has something to do with his mother, who is suffering from Huntington disease. This book is a mystery of Wyatt Transgenics and Dr. Quincy Wyatt. Follow Eli as he searches through his family's past to find out what the hatred for Dr. Wyatt was and why he is taking special interest in Eli. This book is full of relationships in the character's life and scientific mysteries."},{"rating":"1","title":"Could Have Been Better","review":"First of all let me say that I am not the target audience of this book, as I am a very well educated middle aged man who is very Transhumanist in my views.Maybe this book appeals more to teen agers, but I found that the book wallowed way too much in teenage angst. Often I found the characters behaving in unrealistic ways. The main character seemed to obsess repeatedly about the same issues. I also found that the subject matter was handled in a way that was too conservative and narrow minded for my taste."},{"rating":"2","title":"great read!","review":"Double Helix was very entertaining, suspenseful, and...real. I felt connected to the characters and enjoyed reading it the whole way through. It had a lot of interesting twists, and I just could not stop reading it. It is a great book teens--both boys & girls."},{"rating":"2","title":"WOW!!!","review":"Dr. David Rose is absolutely A-M-A-Z-I-N-G!!!

I do not recommend."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring...","review":"Williams once again shows how fast his fingers go with nothing happening musically. I have a few recordings by Williams and they stay on the bottom of the stack.

But with the infra-red mice this thing is useless. The surface doesn't allow the mouse movement to be tracked properly. I bought 2 (one for my office and one for home) and it was very foolish."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a Waste","review":"I was looking for a new mouse pad that doesn't slip and slide. This one was advertised as having an, and I am not making this up, \\"Exclusive Non-Slip Backing.\\" What a joke. This thing slips and slides all over the place. I have a basic wood desktop, so I don't think it was unreasonable to expect it to perform as advertised. Do not buy this. It may look good on line, but the functionality is pathetic."},{"rating":"1","title":"Flimsy, thin, easily damaged","review":"I bought this because I liked the picture. However, after a very short time of usage (maybe one or two months of, albeit, heavy usage) the pad tore from wear. The thing is flimsy as heck.

The price is excellent. The shipping cost seem high but mine arrived so quickly that it was completly worth it. Where we live we have to drive nearly an hour to get to a rink, so its probably no surprize that it is nearly impossible to find ice skater gear or themed cookie cutters anywhere. So I was super thankful to find them on Amazon. My daughter is having an ice skate themed party and these cookie cutters will be put to use for that. And for decorating next years christmas tree... I am very happy with this purchase. So the cookie cutters themselves appear to be of the same durability of other cookie cutters that can be purchased at craft stores - Like Joanns or Micheals. Don't bother trying to get them there though - they don't sell them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great fashion book for the coffee table","review":"512 thick, glossy pages of fashion. Each page highlights a different person... Designers, models, icons, photographers, illustrators, milliners, cosmetic creators, tailors, etc. Each page has a brief paragraph or two describing the artists contributions, and below is a single large picture or illustration depicting the work of the artist. One of the more stunning fashion books I've seen. Quite impressive."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mini Edition may not be the best choice","review":"This book was suggested reference material for a college course of study at FIDM. Initially I thought this was a paperback condensed version of the hardback book. Upon receipt I found it extremely difficult to read without a magnifying glass - the print is literally micro-small. At first I blamed my aging eyes, but my nineteen year-old daughter whom I purchased the book for has 20/20 vision, and she expressed a similar opinion. I would not recommend this version of the book - if you have the option, purchase the full size hard bound copy."},{"rating":"2","title":"I love this book, but there are some problems.","review":"The Fashion book features over 500 pages of the best designers, photographers, icons and much more over the past 150 years. But one particular thing I have noticed, is that Anna Wintour (the editor in chief of American Vogue magazine) is not featured in this book. Anna Wintour is considered the most powerful person in the fashion industry. Yet, she isn't considered in icon? Other than that, each page has an illustration that is as much fun to look at, as it is the read the passages. I love this book. Best $10.00 investment I've made in a while."},{"rating":"1","title":"too broad, not enough detail","review":"In my opinion, this book could have whittled down the number of entries, and told us more about each subject.

If you want the far more complex truth then don't waste your time with this book. I received this book from a college student and was shocked that this passed as scholarly writing. I understood the dumbed-down level of the book once I saw the author writes articles for WIRED magazine and also cashed in by writing a biography about a distant relative. There are many great books available about the developing world, but this is not one of them."},{"rating":"2","title":"works great, my beardies love it.","review":"I have to admit, I was not impressed when I first received the item, it was made of lightweight foam, I guess I was expecting resin or something more substancial. But I really can't complain about it. It works well, looks good, my beardies love it. The negatives would have to be that it splashes a lot, creating a mess in the tank, and I have to refill it almost every day (I do live in a dry climate, though). But it's a nice addition to my dragon tank."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great before it started leaking...","review":"We bought this for our son's Crested Gecko about a month ago.

Collector's Choice did a two-fer of the first two, and was considering the release of 3 & 4(they told me they would base their decision on how good the sales were of the first, but that ship has sailed) 9 times out of ten reviewers in the Marketplace gloss over any mention of the audio or video quality which is SO frustrating especially when the CD or DVD in question is released by a small company. This release is on the German TRC label whose origin is obscure. Is this a bootleg? Taken from vinyl or mastered from tapes? Is there any noise in the playback: crackles,pops, extreme hiss? Any thing in the way of liner notes or credits? ANYONE???

I own Fever Tree's first two albums on a 2 for 1 Cd, and had to have more of their music. If you enjoy 60's music then maybe it's time to ad this one to your collection. This Cd is good, not great but one that I wanted to own. I received this disc today and have played it twice already."},{"rating":"2","title":"A excellent book on the Saints","review":"This is a excellent book on all the Saints known up to the time of its publishing.I purchased it for exactly that information. I wanted to learn more about the many..many Saints known to the Catholic Religion. I discovered that there are far many more that even devout persons have probably heard of. !!This is a thick volumed book --that lists the Saints not only in alphabetical order --but also in chronological order as well.Its listings go far back ..and includeds many from the Roman period...but also ecompasses all time periods and countrys throughout Europe and other countrys as well !Very highly recommended for those that want to simply learn more on the subject...especially the past.If you are looking current or newly made Saints--they will not appear in this older volume !"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book","review":"This book is great. I used the boarders to inspire my own custom boarder in my celtic calligraphy. Though you could just use the ones in the book if you like. Only down side was it didn't come with them all on a supplemental CD. But you could just scan the book yourself. If you would like to see how I used the book you can visit my calligraphy blog[...]and see the piece I completed for December 2011.

Five star all the way."},{"rating":"2","title":"FINALLY again","review":"The Equalizer was a great show- and not just for its time. I have to join everyone else in shouting \\"FINALLY!\\" from the rooftops- I've been waiting for this for a long time! I hope it doesn't stop at season one and we eventually see all episodes out on DVD- I'll be buying every one.Kudos to everyone who worked on bringing this show to us- it truly has been one of the greats and has stuck in my brain all these years."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Equalizer needs a revival for present day!","review":"Edward Woodward commanded attention back then, and he's still doing the same thing today. MORE SEASONS PLEASE! This show is timeless, and now more than ever we need The Equalizer back in action. Even if it's just in our living rooms, I think his attitude is more American than apple pie :)"},{"rating":"1","title":"BAD COPY","review":"I purchased the Equalizer and two of the discs stop running in regular mode and start playing scene by scene. Chop, Choppy, Choppiest. It doesn't pay to buy these programs because you are sent junk. They probably take returns from people and re-wrap them and sell them to the next poor schmuck down the line. This is very discouraging, as I purchased other series, and have had the same problems. One disc,Sons of Anarchy wouldn't play at all. The same thing happened with the Hunter series. So who knows where these series were copied from? Pirated?"},{"rating":"1","title":"DVD's freeze up","review":"These are from Universal and they will lock up, freeze on one image and will not allow you to fast forward. There is also no scene selection, means when they lock up, you cannot see the remained of the episode. The same thing happens to A-Team and Night Rider, it is a Universal Studios problem. Reviewing the few episodes that I was able to watch, the slow has a very slow pace, the credits, establishing shots, stock footage last forever. Woodward talks tough alot, and glares at people, but there is very little action. They do the something exciting 20 minutes in and 10 minutes before the end ala Dukes of Hazard car chase. He always has two clients, one the main story, the other comic relief. I think the series got better after season one, but those are not available on DVD. But you could argue with lock up DVD, Series one is not truly available either."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love the series","review":"My kids an I were watching Person of Interest and this caused me to mention that I had enjoyed the Equalizer and that there were a lot of similarities.

Of course the only songs you hear, which are horribly overplayed, are the ones with established singers. Take out Snoop and Shady, and all you're left with is some whiny hack with a nasal drip voice reminiscent of Larry Flynt. Kind of reminds me of Rockwell, which no one remembers, but everyone knows his song. Somebody's Watching Me was not a hit because of the song, but because who sang with him. Hmmm.
