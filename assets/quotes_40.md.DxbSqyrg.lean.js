I even like \\"I Could Not Ask for More.\\" You appreciate it more when you here the limp version done by country artist Sara Evans.

Sat box worked fine until you changed the input to something else then it would not reconnect. Most frustrating part was to get it all working again, all the power cords and HDMI cables had to be unplugged. Doing one or the other would not work. Receiver would also shut itself off after a few minutes of playing at moderately high volume. Not sure what the problem was. Wiring all checked out ok.

It covers most of history of IPA and of the American usage(s) in transcription, with some minor gaps (e.g., the symbol for dental voiced affricate used by Gleason and Hall, the special use of reversed small capital U in Hockett, etc.). It is a trustworthy guide for the traditions of transcription it covers: I learned a lot about them. Some moot points of the new IPA are duly commented upon and clarified, too. The Continental European tradition, on the contrary, is only cursorily hinted at (e.g., Meillet-Cohen, Slavic linguistics, but not Dialectology and Linguistic Geography, both Romance and Germanic) and so is the tradition of Africanists (Beach and Doke are taken into account, but not, e.g., Guthrie).

It zeros at midnight, but that's it unless you want to zero out and recalibrate the whole thing. Even simple pedometer programs for a smart phone do that. Further no adjustment for sensitivity, etc, in case your stride is atypical. What a waste."},{"rating":"1","title":"TOO BULKY!!","review":"I wish that someone would have said how big and bulky this thing is. For a woman that intends to wear this during the day (to work), I was hoping for something very discrete!! No so with this one.It may have the funcationality that makes it better, but in this case, bigger is NOT better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Drop it in your pocket.","review":"I am completely satisfied with this product. I started using pedometers several years ago in order to get some idea of how much I walked each day and to motivate myself to walk more. However, I never really felt comfortable strapping one onto my belt at work and I was constantly taking it on and off to see how far I had walked. This product is simple to use---just drop it in your pocket and forget about it. It takes up little space and is very easy to use. It also seems to be very accurate. Furthermore, I like that it resets itself automatically at midnight each day and allows you to check back easily on the past 6 days' results. The aerobic feature is very useful too as it allows you to distinguish regular steps from \\"aerobic steps.\\" I have had several pedometers over the years but this, by far, is the best and the easiest to use."},{"rating":"2","title":"Replacement for a laundered pedometer","review":"My wife loves her pedometer (small size, clock, seven days) but ran it through the laundry, so this is a replacement. It's even slightly smaller. The buttons are a little harder to push, but overall this is an advantage. She would recommend this pedometer to anyone looking for one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Saw this one on the Dr. Oz show","review":"Saw on the Dr. Oz show that we should all be walking 10,000 steps a day. This pedometer is small enough to put in a pocket or clip on to a waistband with its own clip. I like that it has a digital clock, records your steps for the past 7 days and doesn't need to be fussed with."},{"rating":"2","title":"the best one for the money","review":"this is the best pedometer yet! It does everything! We have ordered over 40 for our employees at work who are in the biggest looser program and they love them!! So accurate and so much info in one little gadgit!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Love my Omron","review":"The Omron HJ-112 pocket pedometer is easy to set up and use. I jump out of bed and clip it on... and forget about it for the rest of the day. I enjoy comparing the number of daily steps each I've taken each week."},{"rating":"2","title":"Don't leave home without it.","review":"This is a great product and I use it on a daily basis. Everyone in our extended family now has one and we compare progress (or not) depending. It is not only helpful, but has become a fun tool to track our families progress to getting in better shape through walking. Only con, sometimes it does not track my aerobic steps... but overall a great product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pedometer","review":"Omron HJ-112 Digital Pocket PedometerA truly excellent device. I have checked it daily against a measured mile for over a month and found that it is accurate every time. The weather has been cold (we are northwest of Albany, NY)and I have worn it attached to sweatpants under a sweatshirt and jacket. I shall continue to test it as the weather becomes warmer but feel that this is the severest test. All other modes--steps, aerobic steps etc--seem equally accurate but I am most concerned about distance walked. My only negative feeling relates to Amazon, not Omron. Amazon should have told us that the pedometer came with a safety strap included. I therefore bought one needlesslessly. However, I shall keep it as a spare."},{"rating":"2","title":"Superior Pedometer","review":"I've had a couple of Omron Pedometers over the years and they are so very accurate, durable and easy to use. Never mind spending your money on the expensive Body Bugg or other such devices, the Omron does tell you how many Aerobic steps you have taken during the day. The only downside is the battery life...stock up on 2032 batteries and remember to store the screwdriver, you will need it later. When I lost my Omron, I went to Target and many other sporting good stores to find a decent pedometer...none could compare. Omron, please never stop making pedometers!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Take a walk with me.","review":"I got two of these, one for my wife and one of the ladies she walks(1 hr a day)and works out with. They both liked it and two more hikers are going to get one. It will take you a little time to program it, but after that is seems easy and fun to use. They like the fact that it can record all you steps in a day and even used it when they were golfing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Having little success with this","review":"I'm very frustrated with the Omron. I wear a pedometer because I may walk a max of 5000 steps a day. (Learning to live with chronic illness.) The clip pops off constantly, which makes it annoying if I wear it at my waist. My doc wants me to wear it at my waist, directly beneath my armpit. I don't find that having it in my pocket is the least bit accurate. I've worn my old \\"tic-toc\\" mechanical pedometer at the same time as the Omron, and the tic-toc's readings seem far more accurate to me. (I've given up the tic-toc because it's worn out and resets itself too often.) My physical therapist recommended something more substantial. I've read and reread the Omron instructions, and my only surmise is that my step isn't \\"vigorous\\" enough to register. Beats me. I picked it out because of all of the rave reviews, but now I'm wondering if anyone with compromised health is having any luck with it."},{"rating":"2","title":"I am just surprised it works so well!","review":"We purchased this to measure our walks around the routes that we take. It was priced right. I did a bunch of research, and we tried it. IF you follow the directions, which we did... We set the stride length etc. and went out for a walk. Then, we looped the same area as close as we could in our car. It was over 6 miles and the difference between the odometer on the car and the pedometer was less than mile. Which could easily be because we can't drive on the outside loops on the sidewalks. So, it's probably much closer. VERY IMPRESSED!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Missing Battery","review":"What a disappointment!! The battery (cr2032) was not included in the package. It is listed as a component but was not there. Is this a way of keeping the price low, by not including components readily available at the local store and cheap enough so as to encourage consumers to not return the Omron pedometer. So - should I spend 10$ on return postage or quit buying Omron products and tell everyone I know about the missing component?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Little Pedometer","review":"This is a great little pedometer. Clips on easily and the safety line is also very easy to use and does come in handy. I'm disabled, but try to walk as much as I can, and it's fun to try to beat the day before's steps taken. It's very light, you don't even realize you have it on. I would recommend this little unit, it's very helpful and has some nice added features like the memory."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dependable and easy to use","review":"I am relieved to have purchased a pedometer that I perceive to be accurate and comfortable enough to wear all day long. If there is one improvement, it would be an option that allows the figures to read either upside down or rightside up (It's hard to read the pedometer while you are wearing it.). This is the first review I have ever written and I am doing it because I appreciated all the reviews others had written which led me to decide to purchase this product. Thanks, everyone!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best I've used.","review":"This pedometer works way better than the cheap one I had before. I wear it on my treadmill which also tells me the steps and they're almost the same so it's a good indiciation that this is accurate."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Pedometer","review":"This pedometer is working well for me. It took me a few tries to get the step length adjusted to be accurate, but once I got it, I've been happy. I had to do it by trial and error because the ten step walk that they suggested just wasn't right. So instead, I set it, walked 100 steps, looked at it and made minor adjustments until it was right. It took me 3-4 tries. I don't really use all the functions it is nice to be able to look back several days. I am also finding it is pretty accurate while other pedometers I have had have failed to count steps or have overcounted steps in various situations. It is a little on the heavy side but this has only been a problem with very lightweight clothing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Counts WAY too many steps","review":"When I first tried the Omron, and went for a walk that I know to be 1.6 miles, it registered it as 2.91 miles. The next day, walking the same course, it registered 2.75 miles. FAR over what I actually walked. The number of steps seemed way too high as well. That's when I realized that it over-states the number of steps dramatically when worn in the front pocket of my shorts. Its a fair bit more accurate when clipped to the belt, but that's not why I bought this one. I bought it specifically to just put in my front pocket and forget about it until the end of the day. Some of the discrepancies I've noticed included it saying I'd walked a hundred steps while driving my car. The 20 yard walk to my bosses office is apparently 112 steps according to Omron. It makes the item virtually useless unless its attached to the belt. And with the cheap belt clip it comes with, this isn't that helpful."},{"rating":"2","title":"Accurate and multifunction","review":"I bought this at the recommendation of my doctor to start walking 10,000 steps everyday. I looked up the highest rated pedometer on consumer reports and this was it. Consumer reports has not steered me wrong yet. Compared to 3 other pedometers that my mother and sisters have bought at Target and Wal-Mart, mine is more accurate and more sturdy. I would highly recommend this pedometer to anyone who wants to count their steps."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Motivator","review":"I have used several pedometers in the past but the results were always unreliable, therefore had little impact on my behavior. This pedometor is different. Gives very accurate results. The only time I found a discrepency in the results was when I was doing a walk in place tape.I find myself trying to continually improve my previous results. With the seven day history log, this makes it very convenient for me to go back over several days to get the results and log. I would highly recommend this over competing pedometers if you are seriously considering the purchase of one. It is well worth the few extra bucks you pay over the cheapie competition."},{"rating":"2","title":"Eye opener","review":"My husband purchased two of these pedometers in an effort to fight our increasingly sedentary lifestyle. I figured I would probably use it once & then throw it in a desk drawer & forget about it...but that didn't happen! Not only are these little devices easy to set up & use, but they do the trick of really making you realize how little excercise you get at a desk job!! Just clip it to your belt at the beginning of the day & forget about it. I almost died when I realized that on average I was walking less than 800 steps a day. Talk about a much needed wake up call. We are now taking daily walks and steadily increasing our daily excercise. Well worth the money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Good","review":"I absolutely love this model. Pretty accurate against my wife's that cost $100.00. With the belt loop and lanyard you can't loose it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't last long term","review":"I bought this product awhile back, and it was fine. But now, it eats through batteries every 2 days. And once the battery is low, even though the screen is still on and functioning, it will not count the steps until I replace the battery.The cheap one's you buy at discount stores last longer. Not impressed with what I spent on it that it didn't continue to function properly."},{"rating":"1","title":"Missing battery, zero service","review":"I ordered the pedometer from Amazon and it arrived in a sealed plastic container. When opened, it had no battery. The battery is listed on the box as included. The video says it is easy to get started because the battery is included. I sent an email to Omron and got a prompt reply the next day. They said they include the batter when it is shipped. I seriously doubt somebody at Amazon is cutting the container open and stealing the batter, then magically resealing the container.It was frustrating to have it arrive without a battery, but even worse to have them tell me this was not their problem.I've not had the pedometer long enough to evaluate its performance but I did pay $4.29 for the battery."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pedometer","review":"I'm not really sure I should have purchased the pedometer for what I tried to do. I was doing mountain hiking I couldn't get it where it was accurate. Hiking on a mountain trail is much different than walking down the street as your steps are not equal. I was going on hike to the top of a 14,000+ peak & wanted to check my progress. It was way off & I gave up on it. I had made adjustments to it prior to the hike trying to make it accurate.

I have used it both outside and on a treadmill. It only has one setting for stride. My stride is different for a leisurely stroll, walking for exercise and jogging or running. I wore my pedometer on the treadmill. It was accurate for the leisurely stroll. It was off by 1/2 mile for vigorous walking. It was off over a mile when I jogged 3 miles. It even misses steps. Several days in a row, I ran on the treadmill, the same speed, the same distance, and the same time. The step counter read vastly different several days in a row. Needless to say, I have been dissappointed and am looking for a new product. Any suggestions?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Omron Pedometer","review":"This is the best pedometer I have ever purchased.

Don't waste your money on any others."},{"rating":"2","title":"Accurate, convenient, comfortable!","review":"I love this pedometer! I'm particularly happy with it's accuracy, since I have tested it in a number of control situations and am quite pleased with the versatility of it (i.e. the ability to carry it in my purse and it still works properly, the clip so I can clip it on my clothes when I don't have a readily available waistband, and the waistband clip/holder thing). I love that it has a memory feature- I just wish I could look up more information than just how many steps I took (but then again, it may be that I need to go over the instructions again). I like how it feels in my hand, the material is nice, and it's just a great thing to have in general if you are trying to lose weight or are on an exercise regime where you need to track your steps. I'm glad I bought this model and not a cheaper one. I would definitely recommend this model to friends/family."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sometimes it works & sometimes it doesn't","review":"Some days it stops at 57 steps or 300+ steps and some times it works all day.

Since we started, I have had a number of pedometers. Some work just fine but they don't stay attached to me easily and can't be worn when I am in a dress (unless tucked into the top of my tights- that is how I dropped one pedometer in the toilet). The Omron has been accurate when in my pocket when I am wearing a dress, and also pretty accurate when tucked into the top of a sports bra when my dresses don't have pockets. Also, the teather prevents dropping it- in the toilet or elsewhere. Finally, I love the fact that you can't accidentally clear your steps. Steps reset to 0 every midnight.

Before I bought this, I had read reviews to make a right choice. It looked me that this one would be a good choice. However, it didn't turn out as I expected. I run same course every day, but the calculation of steps and miles by this product varies every day. If deviation is around 5%, I would not complain. But, it is far worse than acceptable. For example, one round of my routine course should be about 4 miles. However, the calculation of this product fluctuates b/w 3 miles to 4.8 miles. Bottom line is if you want to have this kind of product for the peace of mind, then avoid this one and buy less expensive one. It is not worth at all."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved it until it broke","review":"I bought this based on others reviews, and have also found that it is perfect! Well...until it stopped working. I replaced the batteries and still can't get it to work again. Not sure why, and this is the only reason I'm rating it a 4. Otherwise, I highly recommend this and will most likely just buy it again.

I told them I had already bought the battery and I wanted a credit or another battery to use when the current one expires. They said, \\"Sorry, you have to return the whole unit.\\" I told them that was the dumbest thing I ever heard.... spent $5 to ship and be without the unit for at least a week. \\"Sorry, you have to return the whole unit.\\" The next day I called back and asked to speak to a manager... got the same story, except they would send me a pre-paid mailer.

Mine broke in less than a week. It would no longer count steps. Overall, even if it managed to work longer than a week, the way that the interface works makes it fairly useless for going back and looking at prior walks as it is either difficult or impossible to get all of the data about the walks beyond the number of steps.Overall, I'd rate this product as not worth anything to a serious walker.

It's easy to read, however, I wish it could be worn 'upside down' so the wearer could read it. You have to remove it to read. It comes with a safety clip, which has saved the unit from falling a few times. In the beginning I found it frustrating that it didn't register very short duration steps. If I walked across the kitchen, say 6 steps, it doesn't register them. Seven steps, and it counts them.

However, both yesterday (on my belt) and today (in my pocket) the step numbers automatically reset themselves during the day.

I get accurate counts with the cheapo belt clip models if I have it exactly on the apex of my hip.

I was under the impression that I would be able to keep track of either my aerobic steps or my \\"daily\\" steps. Since I was interested in starting a 10,000 steps per day program, I thought I could wear it and it would keep track of ALL my steps, including those steps I take in my house while I'm doing housework, and steps I take while I'm in the grocery store or going from the car to the store, etc. It records NONE of those! It will only record steps after you have been walking for about a minute or so at a continual fluid pace, such as walking for exercise. It also won't record steps you take going up stairs! But I didn't even find this out until AFTER I had opened the package and read the instructions inside, and by then it was too late to return it for a FULL refund! So I feel somewhat cheated and VERY disappointed! Other than that.. it does record my power walking steps and it does reset itself during the night, so those claims are true."},{"rating":"2","title":"great product","review":"product works great! very easy to use. it's great because it automatically resets it self in the morning. my only complaint is the detachable belt holder that holds the unit is not very secure. it's recommended you use the security strap to prevent losing it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very easy to use and read","review":"This is an easy to use item and if you can measure your stride length the pedometer is quite accurate.

Twice the first day I wore it, it came off my waist band and fell to the ground. The clip just isn't secure. I would return it except the package has been opened and the pedometer set up.

I tried putting it into my pocket, where it was over by 50%, then the more usual way of clipping it onto my waistband, where it was 20% over - better, but still not acceptable. (One can enter the stride length incorrectly into the pedometer and thereby get wrong values for distance, but I'm talking about just the number of steps taken.) I was careful to have it in an upright position both times. It's gotten good reviews, and a friend of mine loves hers, so maybe I just got a lemon.

I then checked all the settings again and they were right. I decided to walk normally with the pedometer and counted my steps to 100. The pedometer read 74 steps. This thing is supposed to be accurate up to +/-5%. I double checked my stride to make sure that it wasn't off - it was right. I think I must have gotten a total lemon.

The fact that you can put it in you pocket is handy, plus the leash clip holds on tight.

I have dropped this twice now and left it outside overnight once, both times I \\"lost\\" it and found it, it was still in good condition and had stored the memory.That brings me to my only con..... the clip keeps slipping off of my pants so sometimes it pops off an inconvienant times.Would totally recommend as others at work are using different pedometers to track their steps and they seem to have difficult with accuracy or accidentally hitting theirs and resetting it.

I love going to the gym but I am busy working part time at a retail store. I love that I can see how many steps I did at work and if I need to up my steps I go to the gym afterwards and run on the treadmill. I love to see how I am doing for the last 7 days.

I keep this discreetly in my pocket and it seems to be very accurate.

I originally wanted to try for 10,000 steps a day, but since I started using this pedometer I've been averaging 10,000 aerobic steps and between 25,000 and 30,000 regular steps a day.

If you want to reset your steps for a certain event or excercise walk you can't without resseting the entire unit. I called Omron about this and they stated that for some reason the version which is being sold now lacks a reset button. The new model is called the HJ-112N. For some people not having a reset button might not matter, but many people really like to be able to reset the unit for various activites throughout the day. You can reset the entire unit, but when you do that you lose all of your data. I bought two of these and both are being returned."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can't insert battery","review":"The screw for the battery compartment does not seem to be an isolated problem. The screw for the battery cover is an extremely small Phillips head. There is a flat piece of metal provided with a tab on each end. This supposed to be the screwdriver. Ordinarily this might work. But in this case the tab is too long to fit in the cross-slot. Therefore the screw cannot be removed so the battery can be inserted. I have jewelers screwdrivers but doubt they would work because the cross-slots are so small they appear nearly round. Makes it difficult to screw in or out.It's a shame because the product looks and feels good. But with no battery it is no better than a paper weight, in fact not that good. It's not heavy enough to hold paper down.There are MANY other ways to secure a battery compartment. Too bad they didn't choose one of them. I have sent this thing back to Amazon.

It has a good solid safety leash (so not always falling off on the floor). It has a 7 day memory (which I thought was silly but am finding really useful when I forget to enter my steps), and it is really accurate and forgiving about how you wear it. Also I thought I'd want a cover so I wouldn't accidentally reset it, but this one is made so you have to hold it down long enough that you can't accidentally push it.Plus it wasn't expensive!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A great help - this pedometer!","review":"This pedometer works great!

After calling the 800 number for Omron Customer Service, the only solution they could find was for me to ship the unit back to them at my expense for them to replace it under its warranty with one that actually had a battery. They told me that they DO NOT handle batteries and it was my tough luck, and no, they wouldn't refund me the cost of having to go out and buy one. They suggested I deal with Amazon and I did. Thank you Amazon for crediting me for the amount of a battery. I still had to go out and buy one but at least I did not get the cold shoulder like I did from Omron. It appears that the battery does not last long in this pedometer and so twice a year you will have to unscrew the little screw and replace it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Accurate, Resilient, Easy to Lose","review":"I recommend this product for its durability and accuracy.I have dropped it on rock, hardwood floors, asphalt, and concrete with no loss of function. When one went through the wash, it still collected accurate data, but the display was compromised in that some of the LCD segments did not darken.Omron could improve the HJ-112 by putting a stronger spring in the clamp of the belt holder.

I would recommend this to anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"I like mine, just wish it were a bit smaller","review":"I've had my pedometer 2 years now, replacing the battery about every 6-9 months. It really gives you the incentive to walk more when you see you haven't gotten 10,000 steps yet. I also like that it tracks your aerobic steps. The distance is impossible to get right for me because there are hills. the distance is too great on uphill since I'm taking shorter steps, and is either too great on steep downhill (short steps again) or too short if the slope allows longer strides. So on average, it's about 10% off of distance. But at this point, GPS watches need to be recharged every day, and if you're backpacking or in remote places, that's not going to work. Anyhow, I like it. The only other one I'm familiar with is the Life Source.

It's easy to use, cheaply priced, tracks steps, seems to be pretty accurate, and has memory for 7 days. I love the fact that it displays distance traveled in miles, since this is primarily what I bought it for.CONS:The problem that I see with it, is that you can't start or stop the step counting. This is a big problem, since you are not always walking. If you are in your car, it will count every bump in the road, which by the end of the day will give you a hugh false reading. This unit is way to sensitive and will pick up any little bump. A simple start and stop button on the front would have been perfect. I am forced to stick a pin in the back master reset button, re-enter the time, my weight, and stride length, if I want an accurate reading. This however is not very convenient.

Highly recomment this product."},{"rating":"2","title":"accurate but missing something","review":"I am very impressed with the accuracy of this pedometer: I was using a lower-quality model for my daily activities which was reporting a 10-15% higher step total due to inadvertant bumps, etc. However, this model does not allow you to reset the count to zero, which is a serious deficiency. If you have the pedometer in your gym bag, and then once you get to the gym you want to measure the distance you walk, you can't reset the count to zero, you will have to subtract whatever the start count is from the end count to find out how far you traveled."},{"rating":"2","title":"Omron HJ-112 Digital Pocket Pedometer (Purchased on 04/09/2011)","review":"This is my second one. It is very durable and an excellent value. You have to make sure you use the clip that comes with it.

Great pedometer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Does a Good Job","review":"Have had no real issues with the unit. I walk approx one mile, over the same route most mornings and find about a 10% variation in the number of steps from day to day, which I consider aceoptable. Very easy to use, except, do use the safety cord supplied as an auxilliary securing means. The unit comes off very easily when clipped to the belt or to an arctcle of clothing. I did lose it one morning without realizing it had fallen off, although it was returned to me later in the day."},{"rating":"2","title":"Omron Pedometer","review":"Best pedometer I have used.

It is easy to program, easy to read and super easy to use. We love all the features it has...7 day memory, miles, steps, aerobic steps and calories burned! In addition, it has a safety clip that you can clip on your belt and then just put the pedometer in your pocket. It's a great pedometer for the price."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good pedometer, but no Clear button","review":"This seems to be a fine pedometer, well constructed and with reliable detection of steps. It's probably perfect for people who want to count their daily steps. That's not exactly what I wanted, though. I take various hikes, and I like to measure the distance on each one, which means I want to start the pedometer at zero. But there's no easy way to do that. It clears itself at midnight, but there's no other way to clear it easily. One hard way is to manually set the time to 11:59 pm, wait a minute, then set it to the correct time. Another way is to use the general reset, but that also clears the stride length.Every other pedometer I've owned has had a Clear function. I was surprised to discover that this one did not."},{"rating":"1","title":"Product is not as advertised","review":"This product was purchased because it was advertised to work effectively being carried in the pocket of your pants.This does not happen, it is much more effect being attached to the belt, but it does not document the correct mileage.Very disappointing and would not purchase again."},{"rating":"2","title":"excellent purchase!","review":"We had a contest going on at work and the pedometers we got were very cheap and inaccurate. I wanted a nice pedometer without spending a lot of money. I read earlier reviews on this and most were excellent. It's great to be able to put it in your pocket or clip it on. Mine even held on throughout a Zumba class. It doesn't have a ton of bells and whistles but I didn't really want all that. It keeps track 7 days out and automatically resets each night. It's not overly sensitive and once I got my stride down right-it has been very accurate. I highly recommend this."},{"rating":"2","title":"enjoy","review":"I HAVE PURCHASE 3 SO FAR.

Setup was very simple, and based on the previous reviews, I made a point of putting the battery in at the kitchen table so the screw wouldn't get lost. I am wearing it almost every day, and it seems to be pretty accurate. It gives me the information I'm looking for without being complicated.My only complaint is the clip. It is just too short to stay secured to my waistband or belt buckle. I'm awfully glad this comes with a pretty decent safety strap so that I can secure that to my belt loop. This would have fallen off many times by now if I had only the clip to rely on."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Gift for a walker/jogger","review":"I bought this for my mom as a gift. She walks quite a bit every day. She really, really likes this pedometer. She had used other ones previously that turned out to not be very accurate & would break. This one is still working great after a couple months, & is user friendly. It clips on securely & seems to be very accurate whether it's clipped onto you or lying in your purse. It also has a clock on it, which is very convenient. This pedometer seemed to be the best value after looking at many different models. Good brand too."},{"rating":"2","title":"walk a mile in my shoes","review":"Myself and a fellow nurse decided we needed to know how much we walked every day.

I love how reliable it is and that I can clip it anywhere at all. I actually often clip it to my shirt around the neckline if I already have my pockets full with the iPhone etc or if I'm wearing a jacket and just want the pedometer in a more accessible place. As long as the pedometer isn't dangling, it counts steps no matter where it's clipped. I haven't tried just putting it in my pocket but I can tell from the way that it works that it would be just fine. It's really a great little device. The fact that it also tells the time, maintains a 7-day memory, and counts your \\"aerobic\\" steps in addition to all steps, are just added benefits!"},{"rating":"2","title":"walking","review":"Love my Omron pedometer and am in the habit of using it every day even if not walking a lot.

I bought a few cheap ones in the past because I'm cheap. However, big mistake, who knew? The cheap ones were so crazy sensitive that you could just tap them and the counter would go crazy. This one is well, more expensive but worth it.It is sensitive and keeps accurate count when in my purse or even clipped to the center of my shirt but I usually wear it on my hip. I read many of the amazon reviews before buying it because I don't like to waste my dough. Frankly, it works great and I look at all the different features of it.

My only complaint was that I had trouble calibrating it. I used the directions that came with it and recalibrated it 3 different times. I then \\"tested\\" it against a treadmill that was measuring distance. While the number of steps were accurate, the distance was way off each time. I ultimately manipulated the stride measurement until it was close enough to true distance. Certainly, there is a large possibility for human error in the stride calibration. But otherwise, it is accurate. Also counts strides fairly accurately on an elliptical and does a good job of differentiating between aerobic and non-aerobic steps."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pedometer Extraordinaire","review":"Compact, easy to use, keeps track by week of steps you take, works in pocket or clipped to clothing"},{"rating":"2","title":"Omron pedometer","review":"Very user friendly, made me realize just how many steps a day I take.Great product for keeping track for my weight loss program."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great price and very reliable!","review":"I originally bought this Omron pedometer as a gift for my Mom.

Its compact size really makes it convenient and easy to use."},{"rating":"1","title":"Newer model but one less feature","review":"Beware buyers of the newer version of the HJ-112 pedometer. It lacks one important feature the older version of the same model had: the ability to reset to zero the counter. If you do multiple workouts during a day, this feature is handy so you can measure each workout separately. The old model had four buttton on the face, including a reset button. The new version has only three buttons, with the reset replaced by a set button which when pressed resets all stored information like time, stride, etc. You cannot do a temporary reset to zero. So if you walk twice a day, you cannot measure two separate workouts. You get a total for the entire day and only at midnight, the pedometer resets to zero.Omron HJ-112 Digital Pocket PedometerOnly after calling Omron's customer service did I find out the new HJ-112 pedometer has an \\"N\\" designation, i.e., HJ=112N.

I wish that it took my every step though."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent overall, but has limitations","review":"This device gets 5 stars because it is well-made, accurate and is great for training. The problem is you cannot RE-ZERO it. You can RE-SET it, but then you have to re-enter your stride length, weight, etc. It works on a 7-day cycle and will only give daily totals. So, for example, if you have been wearing it all day and decide you want to know how many steps and kcals, etc it takes to walk to McDonald's you will need to note all the initial readings and subtract them from the totals when you get to McDonald's."},{"rating":"2","title":"wonderful product and ease of use is a selling point","review":"I have purchased a number of pedometers.

The manual claims if no button is pressed that it will turn itself off within 5 minutes. However, it stayed on no matter what I did. This means I have to reinsert the battery every time and the thread on the tiny screw will wear out. It also means I have to reprogram every time, thus losing the data from the 7 day calendar.

Easy to use, easy to read, and seemed fairly accurate. However, having only owned it for 4 months now, the step counter frequently locks up. It literally misses hundreds of steps. It has never been dropped or mishandled. It was nice while it worked. It's just an aggravating piece of garbage now."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic Pedometer!","review":"I have purchased other pedometers, but this one actually works. I wear it each day.

Great product. Worth the money"},{"rating":"1","title":"if you change the features, change the model number","review":"I have ordered several Omron HJ-112 pedometers since I have a bad habit of washing or losing them. the latest to arrive, much to my surprise, no longer featured 7 day memory. It's almost impossible to remember to look at miles traveled before going to bed. Most logical time is when you get up in morning to see how the day before went. I've had this new one less than 24 hours and am already looking for a suitable replacement."},{"rating":"1","title":"5 star pedometer with a zero star holder and clip","review":"I have 3 of these pedometers. It is a great pedometer, it's accurate and can even differentiate the number of aerobic steps taken. I especially like it because of the memory mode where I can see how many steps I've taken for the past 7 days. For the pedometer, I give it 5 stars.However I would take away 1 star because every time I bend over, the holder unclips from the top of my pants. Minus another star because the little clip at the end of the tether breaks exactly 13 months after purchase. Minus a third star because it's out of warranty and the customer (non) service people won't send out a replacement clip.So like all the other reviewers, this is a great pedometer at a great price but plan on using something (safety pin, rubber band, zipper pocket, etc.) to secure it or lose it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very difficult and frustrating to setup","review":"When using a pedometer, the most important thing to set correctly is your stride length. On this product, this is very difficult and frustrating to do, For example finding the place to do this is impossible. The instructions are not clear and it loops though the time (hours and minutes) your weight and never goes to Stride length. The other items only have an advance button. There is now way to go back. I hate this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Omron HJ 112","review":"I have had bad luck with this step counter. I liked the added features of customizing your stride and calorie counting, so I purchased it over cheaper models. I had to send the first one back as it stopped counting. It was replaced and within one week the same thing happened. As far as it counting your steps while in your purse, I found this did not work either. I spoke with the company today and they want me to send it back for repair.I can't say I would recommend this product to anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very cool tool! But have a question?","review":"Just got mine in the other day too and having loads of fun with it, so far. Great and inexpensive motivator, that's for sure.

So Accurate I am amazed.My husband who has never even cared about pedometers is now wearing this one daily."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great but..not impossible to lose","review":"I used this for several days after setting it up, kept it in my pocket while walking and then thought later, it is so accurate, I will clip it and make sure I get my ten thousand steps in. Well, it disappeared and has never turned up so I am replacing it with a wrist model which I hope will be as accurate and impssible to lose. This worked great, but I am outside in rugged country and I have lost or broken two cheaper models since this one! So I hope the wrist model works."},{"rating":"2","title":"Expectations exceeded","review":"My wife and I recently each purchased pedometers as part of our fitness/wellness program. This is an extreemly capable little device. We particularly like the memory feature, which allows us to look back 7 days to monitor our exercise program. We both find that while wearing our pedometers we tend to go out of our way to take the stairs, park a little further out in the parking lot, ect. to try to increase our daily steps. The unit functions perfectly in almost all situations,even registering steps on the eliptical trainer. We would highly recommend this product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good pedometer","review":"This may cost a little bit more but it is a lot better than the other 2 cheaper ones I had.

The book was helpful in getting me motivated to walk more."},{"rating":"2","title":"Finally a pedometer that works!","review":"I must have bought a million of these things over the years.

It helped me set a goal and I have been sticking to it as I have a visual to look at everyday."},{"rating":"2","title":"2 years and still going strong","review":"I purchased my HJ-112 in Feb '06. In that time I've walked well over a million steps, dropped it (I, stupidly, don't use the strap) on the ground, even dropped it in the toilet once, and it just keeps running! I can't complain about the battery life. Sure, Omron states it at 1 year and I only get about 10 but... who cares?! It's not dying every other month like some. I've had to replace the batteries twice. That's it. I'm greatly considering getting another one, though, because mine has become very ugly from my abuse.The clip is very well designed, I rarely have trouble keeping it clipped on my clothing. The accuracy is very good, better than other pedometers I've tried in the past. I don't know what I'd do without my trusty sidekick :) He keeps me on track!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Works as advertised","review":"I have used this pedometer for about three weeks now. And I am very impressed with it. It is very accurate, extreemly light, and very well built. I have accidentally dropped it on tile floors at least three times and the unit continues to work with no problems whatsoever. A few of my friends have borrowed it from me, tried it, and are buying it for their use. I also bought a unit for my wife and she loves it too. I have now ordered 4 more units to give as gifts to family members.I have used cheap pedometers before which are not accurate and difficult to use. This Omron unit is an excellent buy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Product","review":"Ordered this pedometer based on customer opinions already given. Have found it to be a great product. Fairly accurate when I walk on my treadmill. Would probably be more accurate if I bothered to measure my stride during different activities. Keeps me moving throughout the day. Like that it resets iteself daily and that it retains data for a week. Great gadget at reasonable price."},{"rating":"2","title":"EXCELLENT","review":"What an excellent pedometer. Bought two, one for hubby and one for myself. Resets at midnight so you never have to remember to do this. Long time walker and this is the best pedometer I have ever owned.

I asked around for info on a good pedometer and the Omron HJ-112 came highly recommended. The selling feature for me was the fact that you can put it in your pocket and it will still work. This pedometer is amazing. It works just about anyway you wear it. It has a tether strap with a tight clip, a memory, automatically resets at midnight, and is very easy to set up. I highly recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great pedometer","review":"Purchased this pedometer eleven months ago. I wear it almost every day. It's not only accurate, but it serves as a motivator to walk. I'm averaging 9.4 miles a day and have walked 2,524 miles in eleven months. I like the aerobic counting feature where you have to walk for 10 minutes without stopping to count as an aerobic walk. I've set a goal of 5,000 steps a day in aerobic mode and that keeps me walking steadily. No problems with the product at all. I just bought this next one for a friend."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pedometers for wellness","review":"We have purchased these pedometers as part of a wellness program for our employees.

(and I've used many including Weight Watchers, and various ones bought at Walmart, etc.) Best feature is that is cannot be accidentally reset during the day..automatically goes back to zero at midnight each day. nothing more frustrating that having a couple thousand steps in, only to have one of my previous pedometers accidentally get bumped and reset in the middle of the day. Like the seven day memory as well. I've used another model of Omcron with the ability to link it to my computer but that was more than I needed.

I've owned others and found they get discarded after a while but not this one. I love it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Addicting","review":"I bought this pedometer for myself to find out how much I ran around all day, and how many calories I burned. I really like seeing the number of steps, distance and calories burned, then using the 7-day history to compare one day of activity to another over the course of the past week. I keep it clipped on a belt loop all day, and I've dropped it a number of times but it still works great. Just be careful when changing the battery - make sure you write down the model # on the battery because it's similar to other batteries, which won't work!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The best ever","review":"This is the best pedometer I've ever used - it's incredibly accurate, quiet (no little ball sounds every time you take a step) and little bumps and such to the mode buttons don't inadvertently reset your activity.The size took a little getting used - it's a bit bulkier than other pedometers I've used, but once I began to use the safety clip, it felt more stable.I'm buying a second one for my husband - I would highly recommend this to anyone who is interested in accurate step counts."},{"rating":"2","title":"Omron HJ-112 Digital Premium Pedometer","review":"It's handy and very accurate.

This is a great instrument for keeping you on target if you have a daily exercise goal.A suggestion to the manufacturer: would be really nice if the unit illuminated with the push of a button. Would like the ability to time my steps."},{"rating":"2","title":"a great pedometer","review":"I was so frustrated trying to program my first two pedometers that I went on line for reviews. Taht led me to select Omron. Very easy to program and easy to see. Accurancy is dependant on how you calculate step base and that will vary with conditions, I do a lot of mountain hiking. It provides a good estimate. It does work in a pocket or waistband."},{"rating":"2","title":"instant gratification!","review":"I purchased the Omron HJ112 about 4 weeks into my walking routine, having been recommended by my walking partner, who owns one. It is easy to program, and the only thing I had to learn from the instruction manual was how to determine my stride. I've found it to be pretty accurate..my 6.2 mile walk ( according to the car odometer) actually steps out to between 6.2 and 6.5 depending on my stride(as compared to what I've entered it as) and how fast I walk it. I LOVE the instant gratification of seeing over 12,000 steps in a workout, and the calories burned definitely gives you feel good points. It gives you accountability and I've recommended it to several friends."},{"rating":"2","title":"Makes walking fun!","review":"I've tried several other pedometers, and I prefer this one by far. In the past, I have charted my daily progress by hand. This pedometer's memory function allows me to go up to seven days between times I record things by hand. In addition, I like the guard strap (which has saved the pedometer from falling to the floor) and the fact that the pedometer can be in almost any position and still count my steps. The extra feature of \\"calories burned\\" is fun and helpful. I strongly recommend this pedometer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Your pedometer search is over","review":"A group of us at work purchased this pedometer for a little interoffice competition (who can log the most steps in a month). This pedometer is easy to use, extremely reliable, and well made. As other reviewers have mentioned, the belt clip is just okay, so make sure you wear the security strap too- it just might save your ped should the clip pop off unexpectedly."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lasted through a wash and dry cycle!","review":"This pedometer went through a full wash/dry cycle, and still works fine. I just took it apart, took the battery out, let the pedometer dry, put the battery back in, and it's working fine. I've dropped it on the floor countless times, too. VERY sturdy. Keeps very good step count on the waist, not so good in a bag. I'd get it again!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disappointed!","review":"Based on high reviews, I purchased this pedometer to track my daily steps. It undercounts! It does not record steps unless moving at an even pace for a few seconds. Caring for and chasing an active toddler barely registered. It also only recorded 20 steps for a 3 minute test of step aerobics. I would not recommend this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not all it was portrayed to be","review":"At first this seemed like a great pedometer but I started noticing that it would randomly stop keeping a step count and then start up again so I was never really sure what my actual step count was each day (this was within the first week). Then it just completely stopped giving me a count at all, although it seems to still be functioning as far as toggling between steps, aerobic steps, cal, miles (it just doesn't count anything anymore). I thought if I spent a little more on a pedometer, I would have a better product but this one didn't last a fraction of the time that the \\"cheap\\" ones given out at my work did. I wouldn't recommend this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed--simply too big","review":"With high hopes based on rave reviews here, I ordered this pedometer, but returned it. It is just way too big, particularly for a woman, and I'm a small one - 5'3\\". It has the best features of peds I've read about, but when I received it, I was taken back by its size--approx 2\\" wide and 3\\" tall, very bulky looking. It sits upright on your belt and not securely since it is so tall (it cannot be clipped on belt sideways). The alternate is a good one, which is carry in purse or pocket, but if I wear it all day, which is recommended, I don't carry my purse all day of course and don't always have pants pockets. Even if I did, the size creates a larger bulge than I would like to wear around all day. For men, since they tend to be larger in general and usually have pockets, the pocket option is a great feature. But, not for this little lady! Wish Omron could make this gem smaller."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Pedometer","review":"I saw this pedometer highly rated in Consumer Reports. When I searched for it, I found it at Amazon for a much lower price. It works better than any of the other brands, even highly rated ones, that I have tried. It works in a pocket, upside down, at most angles. Its retainer cord, used in addition to the belt clip, has prevented me from losing it a few times that it got knocked off my belt. Uses easy-to-find battery."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very accurate!!!","review":"I originally had a Brookstone pedometer that was not accurate at all (like for every 1 step, it counted 2-3), so someone told me about this one and I ordered it right away. It is soooooooooooooooo accurate. For the whole day, it might be off by like a few steps, but nothing to worry about. The only thing I dont like about it is that it is huge compared to other pedometers, but I would rather have it big and accurate than not. I would definitely recommend this pedometer to everyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"I love this thing!","review":"I wear it all the time, every day. It's light and accurate and easy to use. I'm getting in better shape and losing weight by keeping track of my steps. Bravo, Omron!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Pedometer","review":"This device is great. It is very accurate. As long as you input your correct weight and stride length, it will accurately calculate your distance in miles walked, your calories burned and correctly sense more intense (aerobic) steps.

It meets the high quality standards I have come to associate with the Omron name. Thank you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Battery replacement big problem","review":"I have no issue with the pedometer's functioning but the battery compartment is closed with a very small screw which is very easy to drop and not easy to replace. The cover has to fit a small tongue into a slot so the screw must come all the way out and you need a tiny screwdriver for it. The battery costs about $6 but you can't use it if you can't put the cover back on because the tiny screw has disappeared. Easy to use, screw-on cover designs for batteries this size exist that can be opened with a coin, why make it so very difficult?I am looking for something that doesn't waste my time and money so I can go walking."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works as advertised","review":"I purchased the Omron HJ-112 pedometer for my wife, who has been on a walking regimen.

This is a great buy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Pedo","review":"Great pedometer; seems very acurate; it even works in my shirt pocket and the belt clip is strong; unlike my last one that fell off all the time. Love the 7 day history and the buttons are simple to use. I try to do 7k steps daily during the week and 12K on weekends; so it forces me to go out and take a brisk walk each day.Only negative is it is just a little bigger than most but still very cool; at work I carry it in my pocket and never notice it. Best one I have owned."},{"rating":"2","title":"The clip that failed on the Omron Pedometer","review":"The pedometer itself is great and is everything I had hoped for. The clip to wear it on your belt is not very good. The clip portion is too short and the spring is not strong enough. If the clip was similar to the one on my cell phone, I would rate the pedometer 5+. If I try to play golf with it on my belt, it falls off, and it will even fall off sometimes when I bend over."},{"rating":"1","title":"Every little movement counts as a step.","review":"When I wore this, it would record that I'd walked over a hundred steps when I only walked down the hall. I tried wearing it in different places (waist band, top pocket), but nothing worked. Within a half hour it was recording that I'd walked over 500 steps when in fact, I'd done very little at all. I stopped using it after a few days."},{"rating":"2","title":"the best","review":"this is absolutely the best pedometer I have ever used. Records steps very accurately in every position except horizontal. I can even have it in a pocket.

I purchased one for my mom, uncle and myself. Both my mom and my uncle's pedometers would count additional steps or not count steps. We programed them and re-programmed them with no avail. My pedometer seemed okay for the first three months, but then I washed it. Unfortunately it never recovered, so that's my fault, not the pedometer. I would say that the belt clip is doesn't work and will not stay in place. Your best bet is to just put it in your pocket and NOT put it in the wash. I am disappointed that only 1 out of 3 I purchased seemed to work. Hopefully you'll get a good one."},{"rating":"1","title":"A little short","review":"First the good: Setting up the HJ-112 is easy. The displays are clear and easy to read. Steps and distances are accurately measured. I suppose the calorie counter is accurate but I don't have any way to confirm its accuracy.Next cons: The belt/pant clip is really, really worthless. You must us the safety cord and clip or you will loose the meter. The display is always on; it can't be turned off so the battery is always draining. It would be nice if the display turned itself off after a certain amount of inacitivity to conserve the battery. The meter does not calculate your speed. You can do it yourself if you really want to, the data is supplied by the meter. Distance is measured only in miles; You can't switch between miles and kilometers.Bottom line: it's a competent pedometer; few bells and whistles; very easy to loose if you're not careful."},{"rating":"1","title":"Please read this BEFORE BUYING.","review":"This does seem to be a wonderful podometer which does deliver everything they say it does. The problem is that it is SO SENSITIVE that if you're riding a car and the road isn't PERFECTLY smoothe, it will register the vibrations as steps!! If it had an on/off switch or a PAUSE BUTTON to turn it off and stop counting steps whenever you're on any motorized vehicle it would be THE perfect podometer.A few days ago I realized at some point in the day that the pedometer was marking waaay to many steps for how inactive I had been that day. I then thought of checking the steps before and after I got into the car and realized that any minor vibration is registered. One would have to write down the number of steps before and after any ride on any motorized vehicle and do the math at the end of every day! I find this extremely frustrating"},{"rating":"1","title":"Pedometers & the Disabled","review":"I bought this item for my wife, who has multiple sclerosis. She's trying to keep track of her walking distances and the number of steps she takes.

The count was not accurate at all. I couldn't reset the number to zero by any of the buttons in the front.

It hardly counts steps when I am walking on carpet which 90% of my house is carpet.... I have to say that it is the worst $25 I have spent!

Would recommend for anyone wanting to know how much they walk in a day and/or to use during your walking workout."},{"rating":"2","title":"Forget the discount store cheapies, buy this Omron.","review":"I've bought a number of $10 dollar cheapie pedometers over the last few years and they never last and never calculate right. This Omron pedometer can't be beat, especially at the $21.65 price I paid for it on Amazon. It's easy to use, accurate and the belt loop safety strap and clip, in case it slips off your belt, protects your investment. There's no stop watch, but it has this great aerobic step mode that once you reach an aerobic heart rate (as calculated by your stride length and weight) starts a clock that tracks how long you've walked at an aerobic heart rate. I chose it because it was top rated in Consumer Reports and now, after two months of use, I couldn't be happier with it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great pedometer","review":"I bought this pedometer for my wife who said she wanted a 'good one', not like the cheap junky ones she has seen in the past. Well, I went to Target and all of them looked pretty junky. So I went on the web to find a well rated one and this is the one that I came up with. My wife says she likes this pedometer and it works great but the thing that it clips into is kind of bulky. The only thing more I could have asked for is for the entire pedometer to be smaller or at least thinner so that it would be less noticeable in a pocket."},{"rating":"2","title":"I would highly recommend this pedometer!","review":"Wanted a pedometer, and after researching online I found this one by Omron to be rated highest by consumers. I think it is a great motivator whether you are a long time fitness guru or a beginner! I have lost 5 lbs using it for just a couple of weeks. I shoot for 10,000 steps a day, and that means I have to do about 45 minutes to an hour a day of aerobics in addition to my regular steps I average a day. It will count your steps whether you are walking or running on a treadmill, a stepper machine, an elliptical, and a nordic track as well as walking or jogging outside or taking an aerobics class. I also like the fact that it holds your last 7 days of steps. I use both clips and attach to my waistband. Works well!It is like any other fitness plan you follow--JUST DO IT! If you eat fairly healthy and don't overeat and get your 10,000 steps in a day, you will get results."},{"rating":"1","title":"Died after 4 months...","review":"I bought two of these... one for me and one for my husband. They were great while they worked. We walk together and quite logically they died within a day of each other. I bought two new batteries from Amazon.

I've had the pedometer for a month and there's no question that it's inaccurate. It doesn't come close to counting all of your steps (as confirmed by numerous checks / tests). The price was right but that's about it. I'm in a fitness contest and way behind due, in part, to the fact that the pedometer doesn't give me credit for all of my steps. And, yes, I'm using it correctly. Look elsewhere (as I'm about to do right now)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Good","review":"It's calibrated poorly. Completely inaccurate.

It claims there is a strap yet none was in the box. There is no battery in the box hence this thing is not ready to use.

After that nothing worked. Followed all instructions carefully. Company unresponsive...have to pay to send it in and send it back and no promises about fixing it when you send it in. Used pedometer only for about 7 months when battery needed replacing. Need proof of purchase for any warranty work...but still paying for all shipping and no assurances that it will be a warranty related matter. Does all that make sense for a $22 product? Not ready for primetime piece of equipment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not accurate at all","review":"I have had this for less than a month and I've given up on using it. Ever since I bought the pedometer, I've used it 5x to test its accuracy. I run the same exact route at home and this pedometer has given me 5 different readings each time. Sometimes the difference is over a mile and there's just no way my routes were that much different. I basically bought it to use when I'm out of town but now i'm not confident that this would give me the correct reading. I replaced the battery with a new one thinking the battery might be low but still got the same inaccurate readings. I followed the set-up directions exactly as stated in the manual. I even reset the program just in case I made a mistake on the initial set up but again got different reading of the same distance I ran. I just wish I can return it. Totally not satisfied with it."},{"rating":"2","title":"definitely premium","review":"I bought this pedometer shortly after being diagnosed with diabetes and needed to exercise. I bought it from an online diabetes specialty company and when I saw them on Amazon for much, much less I bought two for members of my family that walk a lot. The ease of set up and use, different ways to attach the meter, easy to read display, and clip so you do not loose it should it fall off are all great reasons to own this pedometer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Undercounts steps - even moreso over time","review":"I used to wear this pedometer all the time, recognizing that is undercounted steps, most glaringly during every day activities. Frustrating, but what can we do? I took a break and started up again (my unit is a few years old) with a new battery and it is severely undercounting now, to the point where I'm going to buy a different machine. Even if I jog 100 steps, it counts about 40. Too frustrating for me. Other sites talk about undercounting as well and I wish someone would fix this problem."},{"rating":"2","title":"wife loves it","review":"I got this for my wife and she loves it!

Having the memory so you can check your progress from day to day is awesome and inspiring. I challenge myself everyday to do better than I did the day before. There is something about being held accountable for the steps you take in a day that encourages me to go farther. I even find myself looking for ways to walk more. Like parking farther away from a store, taking stairs and working out more.My message to you is GET ONE!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent pedometer for the price","review":"To be absolutely honest, I have not owned a pedometer before other than inexpensive freebies. This time I was looking for a good one, and I did a lot of research before buying the Omron. It has more functions than most pedometers in this price range. It measures regular movement and aerobic movement separately which I like and resets itself every night at midnight. With a 7-day memory you can see your totals for a full week. I compared it to the quality strength training machines in the gym and the totals on distance and calories burned were very similar. I bought an extra strap because the strap that comes with the Omron has a plastic attachment, and I prefer metal. However, the strap I bought broke the first time I used it. So now I'm using the strap that comes with the Omron pedometer and have had no trouble with it. I would recommend this pedometer to my friends with confidence. I doubt you'll find a better one at this price point or even up to $15-20 more."},{"rating":"2","title":"omron HJ-112","review":"This is the best exercise equipment you will ever need. It is great.

I'm sure it's great for walking, but I will definitely be searching elsewhere for a running pedometer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I bought this pedometer and was immediately impressed with the accuracy. However, there are two problems that I find aggravating. First, the clip is not the right size, it should allow the pedometer to be tightly attached, not loosely attached at the top of the garment. Second, the pedometer resets to zero at least once a day. After a reset, the only way to get the total steps for that day is to go to the memory of the \\"previous\\" day. Of course, it is not the previous day, it is only the number of steps that were recorded before the pedometer reset itself."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cannot be zero'd","review":"This arrived today and I quickly discovered its obvious design flaw. All well and good that it will calculate your distance etc over a 7 day period but its laughable that the read-out cannot be completely zero'd unless you do a complete system reset resulting in having to input the time and all your personal information again. The lack of this flexibility is a very short-sighted decision by the manufacturer."},{"rating":"2","title":"#1 everyone should have 1","review":"We own 3 different types of pedometers and this one is the best!!- It's extremely light weight and really easy to use.- It can be warn anywhere.- 7 day history so you can track your progress.- Calculates your calories and milesI wear it daily except for when my hubby runs off with it.

I purchased another brand to replace it and couldn't figure it out so returned it. Got another which I couldn't set up and gave it away. I received my Omron on Saturday and was able to set it up within a few minutes, it was so easy. Once it was set I tried it out and I mentally counted the steps as I walked.

Lesson learned, but too bad it had to happen this way. Learn from my mistake and don't trust that the clip will hold and don't forget to take it out of your pockets before washing clothing. All in all it was a great pedometer, very easy to use and seemed very accurate. I owned the pedometer for a wonderful three weeks before I ran it through the wash. I tried to wear it using the clip on my pants so I could hide it under my shirts, but the clip was so weak that the pedomoeter kept falling off my jeans.

The size of the unit makes it inconvenient and bulky. It is top heavy which results in it being easily knocked off by a purse or just the natural movement of your arm. The clip is not sturdy enough to hold the unit in an upright position. Being so large (larger than some pagers)it is embarrasing to wear since it tends to draw attention. The step counting mode seem to be fairly accurate. The mile counter is not even close. After setting my stride length a couple of times and walking 4 miles on a treadmill (interval walking 4-5 mph) it showed about 2.5 miles. I used a Digi-Walker for many years and was extremely satisfied with its overall performance.

I did however note that some other reviewers rated the clip rather poorly. I have also found this area to be the weakest in the Omron. My pedometer falls off of my waist as many as 10 times a day. If it weren't for the safety leash it would have either been broken or lost as I don't always notice when it releases. The pedometer's saving grace is it's safety leash. This little clip is strong and hangs in there so that when the pedometer falls it just swings at the end of the leash.

That said, I have used it once to count my steps in a typical work day and was impressed that the predicted distance that I cover matched up very near my own estimation (basically, I guessed that from my parking space to my cubicle is about 1/4 mile, and that's about how many steps the pedometer displayed)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice","review":"This is a good quality item. It is a little to big for my taste so I sometimes leave it in the drawer, but it is very helpful at guiding you... you must enter your stride though, because if you dont the numbers come out a little different from what you expected. Very cute though."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful product","review":"This product works very well. I like the fact that it resets itself every morning."},{"rating":"1","title":"Useless","review":"This is calibrated wrong or just defective because it nearly doubles the amount of steps you take, making it completely inaccurate and useless.

You can carry it in pockets, etc., and it still works. I have dropped mine so many times, it's ridiculous and it keeps working. Last week I accidentally ran it through the wash. I took the battery out and let it dry out a couple of days...and it's working beautifully. I like that it holds 7 days' worth of data also."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than the rest!","review":"This is so much better than the other two pedometers I tried.It is very motivating, accurate, and reliable. I bought the sportline one first. It worked fine but would reset randomly which was very frustrating.One great feature this has shows you the aerobic steps you have taken and the time spent doing aerobic walking."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor accuracy","review":"I bought this unit based on the good reviews here, however, I have found its accuracy to be inconsistent. I tried using it in my pants pocket and it was wildly innacurate, more or less doubling my step count. On my belt or waist band it was better depending on where I placed it, i.e. front back or side, but it would still add extra steps no matter where it was. One caveat to this review, I'm recvovering from a stroke and my gait is unsteady, so this might be part/all of the problem, but I thought these electronic sensor types where supposed to be better than the old mechanical pendulum type. Well, not in my case."},{"rating":"2","title":"Omron Review","review":"I've been looking for 3 years for an accurate pedometer. This one is accurate; and easy to read and works in your purse. The clip holds strong and the additional security of the \\"leash\\" to also attach it to your clothing puts your mind at ease that you won't drop it down the toilet. I really, really like this pedometer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pedometer HJ-112","review":"The pedometer works exactly as described; I have not experenced any problems with it. I must credit Amazon for an outstanding job with my order. When the original pedometer I ordered was lost in the mail, Amazon shipped me a replacement immediately.Do to Amazons outstanding service, I placed a recent order for another product. They are a trustworthy company."},{"rating":"2","title":"Quiet, dependable","review":"I had only one other experience with a pedometer, a cheap one that came with a meal from McDonalds. It wasn't very accurate and made an annoying clicking noise while you walked. The Omron HJ-112 showed me what a good pedometer is like. The instruction manual it comes with is very clear and it was easy to program. I like being able to read aerobic steps in addition to regular steps, and the fact that it converts steps to miles and even calculates calories burned makes it a great little tool. Plus, it's quiet - no annoying clicks like cheaper pedometers. It seems to be quite accurate, too. The little extras like the cord to attach it to your belt in case it slips out of its holder are nice additions. It would be nice if the seven day memory feature allowed you to view aerobic steps along with regular steps, but you can't ask for everything.Overall, this is a great little pedometer that will make keeping track of your daily walk a breeze."},{"rating":"2","title":"Omron pocket pedometer","review":"I was disappointed with the belt clip for the pedometer,a s I lost my pedometer within 1 week of buying it because I didn't feel it fall off my pants. The safety clasp does hold well, I did connect it when I purchased my second pedometer. I love the fact that I can even wear the unit in my bra and it is accurate!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Pedometer","review":"Simply put, this is the best pedometer that I have ever used. Its oval shape and easy settings make it a delight to use. If you are a female and don't want to wear it clipped on your slacks or even your jacket pocket, you can simply clip it on to the center of your bra and off you go. At the end of the day take it off and the next morning it has reset itself. I highly recommend this product.Omron HJ-112 Digital Pocket Pedometer"},{"rating":"1","title":"OK..... FOR A WHILE","review":"Researched A LOT, tried almost as many (my research/purchases say stay away from SPORTLINE anything), before purchasing this Omron, considered top -of-the-line. And, yes, it worked well -- until the battery ran out and needed to be replaced. Now, either it records inaccurately (walking briskly for 45 minutes took 545 steps, none of them aerobic???), or the readout is 0.Bummer. Pretty costly for it to work only a few months.Buyer beware."},{"rating":"1","title":"Annoying","review":"One star: featuresone star: ease of usingOther than that, it was inconsistant, when on a known distance, track, got different readings. Cant reset to zero once arriving at a starting point. Ex: walk from car to starting point, it keeps track, then have to subtract when you reach starting point. Which is annoying, not having to zero it out without resetting everything every time. Sent it back."},{"rating":"1","title":"overcounts steps","review":"Easy to set up, but it way over counts the number of steps taken. I counted my steps on five different occasions, and each time the pedometer showed I had taken many more - in one case it more than doubled the actual number of steps I had taken."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy this if.......","review":"Don't buy this if at the end of the day you want to know how many steps, converted to miles, you walked that day. This is a slick looking pedometer that is pretty tricky to set, and even trickier to get the info you want out of it. I started out at zero steps, walked and counted 100, HJ-112 read 62. Unless I clear all the settings, and reset them, I cannot begin again to try for an accurate count. I am very disappointed in this, given the amount of research I did before purchasing it.

Don't waste your money like I did."},{"rating":"2","title":"Buy it!","review":"Thought I needed some incentive to get off the couch. This baby fits into my pocket, or hooks onto the waistband of my pants and, so far has recorded pretty near every step I take. It tells me how many are aerobic (yeah, I need to pick up the pace) and how far I've gone in a day. It also tells me how I did 6 days back. AND, it tells me the time. Now, if it just showed more calories burned........Have now used this for about a year. Found out that it is not always that accurate in the pocket. I step with more force on one foot than the other and need to put it in the forceful foot pocket. Does a nice job, tho."},{"rating":"1","title":"Problems","review":"We've had a lot of problems with this pedometer. Both my husband and I got one for Christmas. We followed the directions to adjust the step length, but we know the distance is not correct. We walked a route and checked the number of steps, and then checked after returning on the same route only to find the number of steps to be different by quite a margin. We also have checked mileage and found the pedometer to be inaccurate. I would not recommend this product at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Gone already","review":"Already lost this unit. The technique to hold it on your belt need serious work because I already lost it walking. It seemed to work ok for the short time I had it but it's a poor design cause it is supposed to measure your walking steps, etc. and it fell off somewhere I was walking. Won't buy another of these. Needs a strap in addition to the clip (like a surfboard strap) to prevent the customer from loosing it right off."},{"rating":"2","title":"Solid pedometer","review":"Purchased this for a work \\"contest' where everyone tracks their steps during tax season (we're CPAs). Love the fact that it keeps 7 days of activity. Easy to use and read. The emergency clip is great - saved me from losing the pedometer on many occasions.

I like that it's extremely small, because I carry a lot of things in my pockets. I have accidentally hit the wrong button a time or two; I was briefly confused but lost no data. One thing I didn't notice in the reviews I read is that the automatic re-set that occurs daily happens at midnight. The first time this happened (I was still awake) I thought it was broken. I use it strictly to count steps, not calories or distance. It's easy to install the battery, too. Very clever of them to package in the screwdriver."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pedometer","review":"A nice little pedometer, smaller than I thought it would be.When displaying the time shows AM or PM but they are very small.I would rather it just said PM and nothing for AM so I could tell them apart.Even with glasses and a strong light it is difficult to see which it is showing.Yes the belt clip could be better disigned. Use the lanyard clip as well or you willeither drop and break it or loose it.I does a good job recording my steps."},{"rating":"1","title":"Goes through batteries","review":"There's no way to turn off this pedometer.

He has trimmed off a significant amount of weight from his waistline. He can snack at night and not feel guilty!ConsCould MAYBE consider that the delayed counting of steps (12 at a time, I believe) to be a bit annoying, but it is nonetheless accurate and has proven results so we don't care. We haven't used any other pedometers, and can not compare.This was a GREAT first pedometer experience!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I purchased this on 4/7, and it broke on 5/11. The display stopped showing all the numbers. To say that I'm disappointed in this product is an understatement. The return policy expired on 5/10. I wonder how many others broke so soon to only have a 30 day return policy. I will be returning this even if I only get a partial credit just to make them stand behind their product!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Somewhat accurate step counter...not accurate calorie counter","review":"This is a great pedometer for counting steps most of the time. However, I've seen it jump hundreds of steps at a time before. Yesterday I went for a 30 min walk and clocked in over 6000 steps, and today I took a 46 minute walk/run combination and I only clocked in 5639 steps. I don't know if it was because of the running that might have confused the omron, but I'm sure that I put in more steps today then yesterday. Not a huge deal, just pointing that out.Also, if you are trying to count calories, get yourself a heart rate monitor for accurate calorie counting. I use a Polar heart rate monitor in combination with my omron pedometer when I go out for a walk, and am always shocked by the differences in displayed calories. For example, the omron said I burned 127 cals in 1.77 miles, while the Polar says I really burned around 402 calories."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Pedometer wouldn't stay clipped on...it's gone","review":"I loved my pedometer for the short time that we had together. I was at a Physical Education Conference and it fell off for last and final time. After having it for only a few short weeks, I am very disappointed.

That is the only thing I have to not rate it as a GREAT product. Having that said, I really like the function of it storing 7 previous days steps walked. It automatically starts a new day. (You have to have the Time set right though ... seems I missed that step for the first few days. [laughs]) If your out for a brisk walk some time durring the day it will track those steps seprately in its Aerobic Mode for you. You will only get to see those for the day tracking today. The memory doesn't keep those. I'm not sure that one would want that but I find it nice to know for instance my day consisted of 10,000 total steps and 6000 of them were aerobic."},{"rating":"2","title":"I love this pedometer","review":"This is the third pedometer I have had and by far the best.

It is really easy to set up and use, and it has been pretty accurate."},{"rating":"2","title":"wear mine everywhere I go","review":"I love this pedometer. It is small and convenient. It measures distances and steps very accurately when worn on the waist (I can't vouch for whether it works in your pocket, but I wouldn't have definite expectations so for $29). The memory feature is nice, since it allows me to ensure that I have an average number of steps over a few days. This way I can feel better about missing one or two days a week. It keeps me motivated to keep exercising. The customer service is great. They sent me a new belt clip when I left mine on a trip out of the country for free and they sent me a new pedometer (charging only shipping) when the first pedometer broke within the first year. I like it so much I bought one for my cousin and one for my mother."},{"rating":"2","title":"Has worked 100% of the time for 3 years","review":"I've had this pedometer for 3 years now and it has always worked, despite the many times I have dropped it on the ground.

It also measures calories expended, miles etc.One problem with the pedometer however is the clip -into which the pedometer fits- for attaching the device to a belt or waist line on pants or skirts. It does not fasten securely. As a result, the pedometer frequently works free and falls off. This happens when one is just walking, imagine trying to run with such a malfunction. There is another fastener, attached to the end of a short cord. I think the clip on it is supposed to attach to one's clothing also. However, the directions aren't clear and also, there is something wrong with the clip. There seems to be no way to open that clip without actually breaking it and rendering it useless which, in fact, it already is."},{"rating":"2","title":"pretty good","review":"i would say this product is pretty good...coz it's only accurate when i'm walking, but when i started to jog, doesn't seem to give a good result or when i'm on a bicycle..but i guess the latter is quite understandable. other than that, i like everything about it. having a pedometer encourages me more to walk to reach my target goal of 10,000 steps or more."},{"rating":"2","title":"perfection","review":"easy to use.

I thought maybe i wasnt running fast enough, so i wore both the pedometers and ran and one registered the aerobic steps and other did not. By the time i realized it it was out side the return window so now im stuck with a bad product. Very upset that after paying good money the product does not work."},{"rating":"1","title":"Does not work well","review":"This pedometer does not work very well. The clip does not hold firmly and it has fallen off my belt several times. I would not recommend it and I plan to buy another different kind soon."},{"rating":"2","title":"Omron HJ-112 Digital Pedometer","review":"I purchased two of these pedometers, one for my walking partner and one for myself. I wear mine all day and we power walk 5 miles 3-4 times a week. We are both very happy with the information they keep and their overall performance. I would highly recommend."},{"rating":"2","title":"great little item","review":"This is the third pedometer I have owned. The first fell off my pants the first day and into the toilet, need I say more. This pedometer is great. it has a safety clip that really works, and the few times the pedometer did slip off my pants, it was saved by the safety. It is EASYto use, and each day it automatically resets itself. wearing the pedometer has helped a great deal. they say to aim for 10,000 steps a day, but I would say without consious exercise my average is only 6,000. Now I purposely walk a bit extra to get to 10,000. I am almost 50 and have a few medical issues and must work to control my weight. I find this a fun way to monitor my progress, and on the days I reach my 10,000 steps it is a boost and a great feeling of accomplishment."},{"rating":"2","title":"Stick it in your pocket and GO!","review":"This pedometer is great! It's so easy to just slip it in your pocket or bag and take off. Nobody has to know it's there."},{"rating":"2","title":"My new daily companion","review":"I did some internet research on pedometers and found this one to have the most favorable reviews. I saw it listed @ Wal-Mart, but when I went to my local store it was no where to be found...LAME. So I drove back home and ordered it thru Amazon.com . It arrived when they said it would, it was packaged well and I've been oh-so-happy with my new addition. I use it daily and mark my steps on my calendar...I like that I can go up to a week without losing my data. The buttons are easy to navigate and the display is easy to read. Set-up was easy to do without too much trouble."},{"rating":"2","title":"Keeps Me Honest and Motivated","review":"This Omrom is a wonderful Pal to have!. I decided to get the Omron pedometer to help me keep track of my daily activity... and to keep me motivated to exercise more frequently. I love how small it is, I can slip it in my pocket every morning and be on my way. I've found that it's super accurate and doesn't get tricked into counting false steps due to shaking, riding on the subway, etc. The memory function is really useful' it's nice to be able to look back and see how much I've walked on previous days. If you're looking for a low cost-investment to help motivate you to get more active this is definitely worth the money."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the easiest to use pedometers I've ever used.","review":"I very much like having the flexibility to clip this to a waistband or put it in my pocket. Wearing it daily pushes me to increase my steps during the work day as well as add extra steps to our weekend walks. This one is so simple that I recommend it to my patients of all ages."},{"rating":"2","title":"Terrific pedometer, just a little bulky","review":"Love this pedometer! Easy to set up, easy to use, and the memory function is great too. The only downside is that it is almost as large as my cell phone and when it is clipped to my waist it does catch on my purse sometimes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Finally a pedometer that works!!","review":"I've been through a half dozen pedometers over the years, and never stuck with them because they were so unreliable. I finally found this one which is without a doubt the best and most reliable (accurate) pedometer I have ever used. I took it to the track, walked a quarter of a mile, did the math to get my stride, walked the quarter mile again, and it was right on the button. I have never, repeat never, had a pedometer this accurate.You can also use the formula they have in the book to get your stride. I tried that first and was within a couple of inches. I re-adjusted it after I did the quarter mile.Other great features: Simple to set up, great quality, the clip seems adequate, plus there is a strap with another clip that you can use to make sure you don't lose it.If you're looking for an accurate, simple to use, high quality pedometer look no further. The engineer who designed the counting mechanism for this deserves a special reward."},{"rating":"1","title":"Non-existent customer service","review":"I purchased this item after reading all the positive reviews about it but nothing was ever said about customer service. The battery to power the unit is behind a cover held in place by a screw so tiny that they send a little piece of metal that has a tiny head to use to open it. No common screwdriver in your home would work. I dropped the screw in the process and it's so tiny that even with a magnet I couldn't find it. When I contacted them to get a replacement I was told that putting one in an envelope with a first class stamp on it wasn't how they did things. I would have to spend $ 6.50 plus insurance to mail it back and enclose a $5.00 check for their return costs to have them put the tiny screw back in. I could expect that it was going to be gone for a couple of weeks. So I would have to pay more than half the original cost of the item and wait weeks to use it. Does that make sense to anyone???? When I asked to have a supervisor contact me I had no response."},{"rating":"2","title":"My first pedometer - loving it!","review":"I have had this item for just a day now, but I'm already singing it's praises! It was extremely easy to program (took about 5 minutes). I love the fact that it has modes for normal steps, aeorbic steps, distance walked, and calories burned - which are super-easy to flip through. I haven't gotten to use the memory feature yet (since this is day 1), but I'm sure it will be flawless as well. It's also great that there is a clock on the readout, so I can easily check the time during a workout or walk without having to wear a watch. I hope the Omron continues to exceed my expectations!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great. Wonderful. Adore it.","review":"Excellent. Extraordinary. Perfect. Fills the bill. I have only superlatives.

It automatically resets to zero every 24 hours."},{"rating":"1","title":"Omron HJ-112 Digital Premium Pedometer","review":"Instructions difficult to use, doesn't turn itself off to save battery, is now stuck on steps so as not to go over 4900.

I aired it out to dry; even unscrewed the back. After 2 days drying out, it ran perfect and still does 6 months later. Thank goodness!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The best pedometer you can buy","review":"My husband and I currently own four of these pedometers. We absolutely love it so much that we keep spares just in case we lose one or a battery dies. You can keep it in your pocket, your purse, clipped to your waist band, it is amazingly accurate. By accident, I put one through the washing machine and the battery was destroyed but the pedometer was fine. We put a new battery in and it worked perfectly."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love It!","review":"I have been looking for sometime a pedometer that counts steps and calories when I came across this one. Initially I was looking for a \\"wrist-watch\\" type pedometer, because I wear skirts 98% of the time, except at the gym (SMILE!); but they cost way more than I was willing to spend. This one is great because it not only has a belt (waist) clip, it is doubly secure because the cord also clips. It fits perfectly on my skirts, counts my regualr and aerobic steps, counts my calories and calculates mile. My only wish it that is was \\"slighty smaller\\", otherwise, I absolutely love it!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"keep on walking","review":"I love it. Helps me to improve my indurance.

One of the best features is the (safety) strap which keeps it from falling. It seems to be accurate and I love that it keeps track of my aerobic and regular steps.Great buy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Handy Pedometer!","review":"I've used this little pedometer for a few weeks now and fine it fairly accurate (the hard part is getting your stride lenght right). It certainly lets you know when you have been sluffing-off! I also like the fact that it has a \\"safety\\" line on it that clips to your pocket or waist so if the pedometer gets knocked off your waistband you don't lose it. Of course, you can also carry it in your pocket, since it doesn't have to be \\"right-side-up\\" to function. I'd recommend everyone carry one of these!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it!","review":"This pedometer works just great. One of my favorite features is the fact that it keeps track of the data for 7 days. I like to keep a log of my exercise but some days I am busy and don't have a chance to do so. No problem - I can just check back on the pedometer. As for the 'belt clip' about which some reviewers complained, I see NO PROBLEM. I keep the pedometer in my pocket and just clip it to the pocket edge - it has never come loose. I agree that the clip would not attach to the thickness of a leather belt, but if you want to attach it to your belt, the solution is simple - just loop the strap around the belt and then attach the clip back to the strap."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent pedometer","review":"I've been using this pedometer for about a month, and I find it rugged, pretty accurate, able to discriminate very well between routine walking in the home or office and aerobic walking. The set up is simple, the buttons easy to use, and I like the feature that remembers the previous few days while zeroing itself each new day. Also, the numbers are easy to read, and the lanyard invaluable for keeping you from loosing it. And yes, it DOES work in my pocket. A great improvement over the chintzy little blue pedometer I had before. I highly recommend the Omron HJ112!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Can't go wrong with this one","review":"Dropped it from the counter top to my kitchen tile once, and dropped it on my blacktop driveway once. Didn't faze it a bit. It's rugged. Very accurate, easy to use and highly recommended. Not sure how it works since if you shake it, you can't hear anything inside clicking like my old pendulum style pedometer. Liked it so much I bought two more as gifts."},{"rating":"2","title":"excellent but falls off clothes and easy to lose","review":"I fell in love with this pedometer the moment I held it. It's a joy to look at and hold because it's well designed. However I had it for only three days before I finally lost it. The clip is pretty weak and ineffectual. Perhaps four times in the three days that I had this pedometer, I found it on the ground -- it had fallen off without my noticing -- and another time, my spouse found it in the yard. That's the problem, it's so small and light that you don't notice that it's on or off. I am buying a replacement, but the sting of the loss of the first one will be with me forever."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worthless","review":"Looks good, and most of the reviews I read rated it highly, but it's worthless. I realized after I was wearing it why so people would love it - because it counts steps that you don't walk - and LOTS of them. I'd walk 20, it would give me 33. I'd walk 5, it would say 17. It's worthless. I had a pedometer years ago that didn't count the first 5 steps, so all the little movements would not count. It was FAR more accurate to all the actual walking. I'm very disappointed with the Omron brand."},{"rating":"2","title":"works well, but VERY sensitive!","review":"I bought this pedometer because I liked the aspect of being able to put it in my pocket during the day. However, I have found that it is incredibly sensitive. I teach at the college level and do a lot of writing on the blackboard. I know I don't pace around the room that much, but apparently just moving my arm up and down while writing is enough to make this thing think I am taking many steps. So I learned to leave it in my office while I taught. But otherwise, it is a really great product and very easy to read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Pedometer","review":"I own two pedometers before this one. So far this is the most accurate. I agree that the belt clip does not hold very well. But with the tiny safety clip, you will not lose it either on the belt or in the pocket. Three features I like most: being able to carry it other than on the belt, resetting the data at mid-night, and 7-day memory. Buy it. It will be the best $20 you have ever spent."},{"rating":"2","title":"best pedometer ever","review":"This pedometer is the best.

Today is Saturday and the pedometer arrived but without a battery. The Omron customer service is closed Saturday and Sunday.

Nothing. Total waste of money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"After reading all the positive reviews, I decided to try it out for my jogging. It was very inaccurate.

Very disspointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good while it lasted","review":"I was really impressed with this unit when i first got it. I tracked my steps for about 9 months or so before the battery died. I changed out the battery thinking that i could go back to tracking with no problems. Unfortunately I was wrong. Once the battery was changed it couldn't store the time and ran slower then it should have. It now sits on the shelf in my bedroom, not tracking anything but dust growing on it. I gave it 2 stars because it was a great pedometer while it worked."},{"rating":"2","title":"Accurate, but bulky","review":"This is a highly rated pedometer, and it doesn't disappoint. Easy to set, has 7 days of history, silent, and it's quite accurate (so long as you set the stride accurately). It even works without being clipped on your waistband, so long as it remains upright and not tilted face down. The only downside is it is a bit bulky compared to other pedometers, but it is just a matter of getting used to it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Belt Hook Not Secure","review":"I was so looking forward to using my pedometer to help me keep track of my exercise routines. Unfortunately I lost it on my first walk! I secured it to my belt and started on my journey. Somewhere halfway through my walk and home it must have come loose and fell off my belt. I wish I would have placed it in my pocket instead. What an expensive waste of time!"},{"rating":"2","title":"It works but finding a place to wear it is a challenge.","review":"It works as advertised and appears to give a pretty accurate reading of the distance you've covered as well as the number of steps counted, etc.The unit should be positioned roughly straight up and down which means you can't just drop it in your pocket. It's too bulky to clip in my shirt pocket.The biggest problem is the clip cannot be trusted to hold onto my belt and eventually falls off, so finding a safe place to wear the unit is challenging."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stopped working","review":"I thought this was a great pedometer. But I certainly thought it would last longer than it did. It just stopped working last night when I was on a walk. The battery is fine and the pedometer just stopped recording. I reset it and still nothing. I liked it up to this point. I just thought it would last longer. I also didn't like the fact that it couldn't be turned off. The battery is always being drained, even when not in use."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overcounts Steps and lousy, lousy, lousy belt clip","review":"I have to admit I only had this pedometer for a week and I suspected that it was over-counting my steps. But that wasn't as annoying as the fact that the first weekend I had it I clipped it on to my belt so I could count the steps down to the farmer's market and back and by the time I got to the market it had fallen off! Ah well, it gave me some idea of how many steps I am taking daily and how much more I need to ramp up to 10,000."},{"rating":"2","title":"Seems pretty accurate","review":"I've owned a few cheaper, less than $10, pedometers, and they definitely don't measure up to this one. When I first received it, I tested its accuracy by counting my steps and it was right on. My only complaint so far would be that it has fallen off of my belt several times, mostly when getting out of the car. The clip could be a little deeper or something."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointed!!","review":"Since my last pedometer died, I'd been using my ipod as pedometer. It was fine but could make things a little complicated. I started reading reviews on this Omron and it sounded really good. I decided to order it as it wasn't that expensive. I am really disappointed and not at all happy with it. It claims to be slim but once it's in it's clip it seems huge. It catches on doorways, slips off my waistband and is very bulky under clothes. In reality, my ipod did the same thing with a much lower profile! sorry I thought it would work and threw away packaging."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good pedometer","review":"I purchased this pedometer after reading numerous reviews online and thought this is the best one so far.I have been using it occasionally, but so far it has been working pretty well.Recommended"},{"rating":"2","title":"Pleased, but would make one change","review":"I like everything about this product except how it clips onto a waistband!

Otherwise, it is my best friend and travels with me everywhere!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great item...","review":"I do alot of walking on my job, I just didn't realize how much until I picked up this up. I think the steps are off by a few, but it keeps me on track. If I don't get my 10,000 steps in a day at work, I try an finish it off when I get home."},{"rating":"1","title":"extremely inaccurate pocket pedometer","review":"Put plainly, this pedometer does not work as advertised. I specifically paid the rather steep price for this pedometer in order to have one that could be kept in a pocket rather than on a belt clip. It does not work at all when in a pocket. When using the belt clip the pedometer accurately records forceful strides on hard surfaces such as roads and long linoleum hallways. It drastically undercounts leisurely walking such as in your home and also drastically undercounts walking on carpet. Depending on the day's schedule I estimate it undercounts by 25-40%. Perhaps it would work better for a heavier person (I am 130 lbs). This pedometer does have a nice feature set as described in the product description, but I do not recommend this pedometer for the person trying to achieve their daily 10,000 steps. The only use I could recommend it for is to measure your workout on a sidewalk or road."},{"rating":"2","title":"LOVE IT!","review":"Got this pedometer for a walking competition at work. My favorite features are the safety clip that keeps it from falling off if it becomes unclipped and also the fact that it stores 7 days worth of info, so you can easily look back and compare your progress each day. I've had 4 co-workers order the same one after seeing mine!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A great choice for me!","review":"When I decided to get a pedometer, I researched the reviews and decided on the Omron HJ-112 Digital Premium Pedometer because of the reviews praising its accuracy and sturdy construction.I am very happy with my choice!

Overall, I am extremely pleased with the device and the purchase."},{"rating":"2","title":"Only accurate pedometer I have ever purchased!","review":"I'm glad I spent the cash to purchase this pedometer. Previously I bought a few under 10 bucks from Target and Walmart but they didn't seem to track correctly.This pedometer is very accurate, tells you how many steps and miles you have taken, estimates burned calories, and will even track \\"aerobic\\" mode. It stays on my belt pretty well. Sometimes it feels a little bulky when I am wearing a tight shirt so I will throw it into my purse and it still tracks (miraculously!)Recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Product, Very Pleased!","review":"I bought 45 of these for our Company's Wellness program. They have performed wonderfully. Accurate step count, reliable, easy to operate and easy to program. All my employees love it and want to purchase additional pedometers for their families. The \\"safety strap\\" has been a lifesaver, as sometimes the belt clip isn't always secure. Also, a few employees have actually ran them through the washing machine, accidently, and they came out okay (after a little bit of dismantling and drying).Highly recommended, I am very pleased with this product and I am sure that you will be too. ~SJ"},{"rating":"2","title":"Omron HJ-112 Digital Premium Pedometer","review":"Best pedometer on the market.

It seems like an OK product but I can tell you that the technology is not that sophisticated and it's impractical to carry around with you every day. It looks like a pager when you wear a suit and the clasp doesn't hold even the thinnest belt that good. I'm not going to go on and on like other reviewers but I suggest you buy a stopwatch and time your walks...this way you can use your watch or carry a timer in your pocket. P.S. I cared so much for this little device that I haven't been able to find this device after the first week of use."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lost within a week...","review":"This pedometer's functions were awesome....while they lasted. Unfortunately the beltclip wasn't as well made and within 5 days of using the pedometer, it fell off my pants and was lost forever. If you're planning to use the pedometer at your waist and don't want to flush $30 down the drain, this might not be the pedometer for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"step counter","review":"I felt I needed this kind of product as I am trying to master my weight gain. I am a 74 year old - have a heart condition - but am healthy and want to get my weight down. I walk six days a week for at least an hour a day. My goal is after loosing the weight that I need to do this for the rest of my life. The number of steps a person takes each day is important in obtaining this goal. This product has been a real help to me - I just got back from vacation for two weeks - and it went with me to St. Maartens. While there I lost four pounds - I contribute it to the fact that I was out walking each and every day. I highly recommend this product. I found the best price at Amazon.com."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor - One star is too good for it!","review":"This pedometer defaults to 0 steps at midnight, and maintains records for 7 days. It is very difficult to program, and does NOT accurately measure steps. I am very dissatisfied with this product. It is now stored away in a drawer, since it is not cost-effective for me to return it to the manufacturer.I am sorry to submit such a negative response. My first OMRON pedometer was so very useful, I had expected a newer one to be at least that proficient. My old one is simply worn out.Thank you for the opportunity to 'sound off' about this new pedometer.B. Lindfors"},{"rating":"2","title":"Love this pedometer","review":"Great pedometer. I have had others before this and the Omron is far superior. I love that I can view my steps for the entire week. Easy to use. It never falls off."},{"rating":"2","title":"great pedometer","review":"This works exactly as it says it does. I put it in my pocket but you can put it in your purse as well. It keeps the steps walking and by aerobic steps. We just love it....I bought 4 and got one for my boss who loves to walk"},{"rating":"2","title":"makes exercise fun","review":"The pedometer is small - fits in your pocket or on your belt. You can see at a glance how many steps - how many arobic steps - miles and calories you burn. Love that you can go back and see what you have done for the past week. Virtually indestructible. Also easy to set. Love this product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it","review":"This pedometer is very accurate, for a pedometer. I know it counts a little low around the house but is great when I go walking or running. Only thing I could wish better is the clip. It's come off a few times but I think that would be a problem with any clip-on pedometer."},{"rating":"1","title":"DOESN'T COUNT ALL STEPS","review":"When wearing this with my older pedometer, I find that it doesn't count all of my steps. In the manual it says that the unit will not change until you have walked more than 4 seconds. That means that walking across a small room doesn't count to this pedometer. As I sit here my Omron says that I've walked 5557 steps and my older pedometer says I've walked 7530 steps. Not sure the reasoning for that, but Omron is shorting me on my steps! Also, it falls off of a waistband when clipped to it in the belt clip most times that I bend down. I'd return this if I hadn't already thrown out the packaging, don't waste your money on a pedometer that won't register all of your hard earned steps!"},{"rating":"1","title":"2009 model","review":"I wasn't able to program this unit.

Nope, not happy with the condition of the packaging."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Pedometer I've Tried!","review":"This pedometer is reliable and accurate. It was easy to set and keeps track of steps, calories burned, aerobic steps, etc.I have tried several other pedometers and this one is by far the best one I've found."},{"rating":"2","title":"Counts steps pretty accurately","review":"This pedometer is the most accurate at counting steps of all the brands I've tried. I don't have to clip it on my waistband or shoes, I can just stick it in my pocket and it still counts my steps. I have noticed that it will miss a few if I am wearing loose fitting pants like sweats."},{"rating":"2","title":"Omron Pedometer","review":"It's the best pedometer I've had. I can view my aerobic steps, calories burned and distance along with the steps. I've had several that worked for a while and then quit working or they didn't correctly record my steps. The only draw back is the size, it's the largest one I've had."},{"rating":"2","title":"Meets Expectations","review":"The product is simple to use and set up. It tracks data for up to a week. You do have to measure and set an average stride length to get the distance to work. The more accurate this is, the more accurate the overall distance will be. I found it to work in most conditions. If you store it in you pocket, the mode button has a tendency to get bumped, changing the display mode."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it!","review":"I have had several cheapy pedometers that were okay but this one works so much better! I am a consumer reports 'junkie' and this is the one that they recommended. My whole work group is wearing them and we are having a walking competition. I love that you can put it in your pocket too, it can be unconfortable sometimes on the waistband. The extra features are great: aerobic steps and the memory. I will continue walking a bit further than I needed to so that I can register aerobic steps! Overall, well worth the money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the product I was Looking for","review":"Well first of all I got this pedometer hoping that it would help me calculating the distance I run , but unfortunately its more useful or maybe it has been made for walking. It does not count very well when I run with it , but its quite accurate when I walk.This was not the product I was looking for , and a bit disappointed it. One more thing I noticed is , the manual said it switches off after a 5 min delay ( if you do not press any buttons ) , but mine does not !! I guess it has a defect , and did not want to pay more shipping to get it back to the Company."},{"rating":"2","title":"Satisfied","review":"Speedy delivery. Simple to use. Does all I was looking for in a pedometer. A bit big to be a \\"pocket\\" pedometer; would love it to be smaller."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad quality","review":"I got this pedometer in February. It is easy to use and much more accurate than the pedometers that I ever owned. However, just like these cheap ones, it died just in less two months. It is still in warranty and I may replace it with Omron, if the shipping charge is not too much. But I am very disappointed with the quality."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointed","review":"I was so excited by the reviews that I read on this product that I ordered two and eagerly awaited their arrival. Once I received my shipment, I immediately followed the instructions and set up everything according to the instructions. The next morning I put the pedometer in my pocket and started my day. I checked it periodically and it was registering more steps than I knew I had taken. The ultimate straw was when I logged several hundred steps while driving a short distance in my car.I promptly requested a return label and sent them both back. Fortunately, I only opened one, so I will get full credit for one, but who knows what I'll get back on the second one since the package was opened. Of course I am also out the shipping costs. I expected more."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great pedometer terrible accessories","review":"I've had two of these - the first was replaced after some months of use, when first the belt clip/holder broke, shortly followed by the clip on the lanyard - the pedometer itself is still functional though. The second one lasted less than a weekend - the new version of the belt clip doesn't hold securely enough and I lost my new pedometer on the second day of wearing it.It's a shame that such a good product is let down by the accesories. Unfortunately my experiences have put me off replacing it once more."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not good so far","review":"My daughter set it up for me to track my steps. I haven't been able to make it work yet. Have owed it for about 3 weeks or so and haven't tracked anything. Not too happy. Who should I contact to get more directions??"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Pedometer!","review":"If you are trying to lose weight like me, this is the perfect tool to have. It's easy to read mode tells you how many steps you have walked in a day and has a 7 day memory capacity to tell you what you have walked during the week."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Product","review":"The pedometer works in my purse. The clip on feature is great and the accuracy is excellent. It is easy to use. I would recommend this product to anyone who has the desire to keep track of their steps or miles from one day to one week. I would buy the product again for a gift."},{"rating":"2","title":"Could Not Be More Pleased","review":"Having owned other pedometers that you needed a PHD to set up and operate, this is very easy to program and is very user friendly. Just stick it in your pocket and it tells you how many steps you walk on a given day.If you are in to the new 10,000 steps a day as part of a healthy life style, this is a MUST HAVE."},{"rating":"2","title":"Most bang for the buck!","review":"I ordered this while I was preparing to walk a half marathon, and was so glad I did. It came in handy on the long walks (up to 12 miles!). It works well once you get the stride adjusted. Also, I am a nurse and it was interesting to see how many miles I logged in my twelve hour shifts!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Small, convenient, no-fuss","review":"Not much to say except this little gadget is hassle free, easy to use, and USEFUL. Can't go wrong. And the Amazon price is perfect. No excuse for not getting in at least some exercise now."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Nice - if you do not own a recent cell phone","review":"I have had this unit for several weeks and have found it to be accurate and easy to use -- the same as the other 700+ feedbacks here state. However, if you have a recent cell phone and a carrier such as Nextel, you can download a GPS Pedometer applet to your phone for $9.95. The applet will measure distance, time, speed, hills, calories and steps for walking or any outdoor activity. Most new US cell phones have a GPS built in. May be worth exploring for your situation."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Pedometer...","review":"There are so many pedometers to choose from I was beginning to think pedometers are all the same. I saw Dr. Roizen, author of YOU: The Owner's Manual, on a PBS special. I don't know what brand Pedometer he was wearing but it looked like this one so I ordered it. It works really well. I really like that it keeps track of your steps for up to 7 days, too. You can get replacement batteries at Sam's Club for $12 for 6 batteries near the pharmacy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Belt Clip for Pedometer","review":"I love the pedometer. Easy to use. BUT I should have heeded the warnings the first few times the clip fell off with the pedometer. Getting in and out of my car, etc. Now it's lost. Don't trust the clip when it's directly on your waist band. Maybe it works better on a belt."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great pedometer","review":"Before purchasing the Omron HJ-112, I bought a different brand, that cost more money, at a local sporting goods store. It was a piece of junk. It often was off by 50%. I did some research and settled on the HJ-112. It's fantastic. I verify accuracy about 3 times a week by counting 200 steps and checking the pedometer. With rare exception, the pedometer counts 200 steps. When it is off, it counts 199 or 201, which probaby means that I miscounted. I highly recommend this product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Omron Pedometer","review":"The pedometer came in quicker than expected and works perfectly. I am very happy with it and the service I received from the seller. It was a gift for someone and that made it even more important to get it right the first time.In short, I am a very happy camper!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Ego boosting but not accurate","review":"I purchased this pedometer for it's ability to count steps in your shirt pocket. Unfortunately you must 1 have it vertical for it to count at all and 2 you must stop breathing for it to count only steps. I was able to sit at my desk and it would add steps while I was working on the computer averaging about 300 steps per hour, very gratifying to my ego but not what I wanted. It is extremely accurate in a pants pocket or attached to a belt and gives the same count +/- 4 steps as a manual count over a three mile course. Has some fun features like calorie count and aerobic timer. I bought it though as a drop in my shirt pocket pedometer and it is simply not at all accurate for that purpose."},{"rating":"2","title":"Reliable product","review":"This is my second Omron Pedometer bought in 2008. I have not only used it myself but have liked it enough to gift it to a friend, and have recommended it to others.Simple, straightforward to use, reliable and consistent.The only drawback is for people like me who like to walk and run. Because the calculation of the distance is based on number of steps, if the step is any shorter or longer, it does not really compensate for that. Once you've setup step length - thats the basis of calculation.2 step settings would have helped!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Performance","review":"After having owned over a dozen different pedometers over the years, this one, the Omron HJ-112, turns out to be the one I have been searching for. It not only has all the features one could possibly want, they work as aadvertised and as they are supposed to work. I find the most convenient feature is the ability of the Omron to work accurately while in your pocket. If you want or need an accurate and reliable pedometer, I would recommend the Omron HJ-112 without reservation."},{"rating":"2","title":"Omron - through the washer and back!","review":"I love my Omron, used it daily, and was very upset to realize -- upon hearing a \\"thunk...thunk...thunk\\" in my dryer -- that I'd accidently put it through the washer and dryer!I grabbed it out of the dryer (it had been there for about 10 - 15 minutes) and thought perhaps I could take it apart and let it dry to see what happened, laid it on the counter to work on later, and walked away.About an hour later I walked by the counter, picked it up and pushed a button. To my complete shock, my Omron appeared to work! I wore it around the house long enough to see it seemed no worse for wear except for a little fogging over. I sat it on a table in the sun to finish drying out and now it's doing fine!What a great little product, under $20 on Amazon and worth every penny. I'm completely impressed with Omron."},{"rating":"2","title":"Premium Pedometer","review":"This was a gift for my husband. He had tried several other pedometers and they never seemed quite acurate. This one really works! He loves it. I have to believe that Omron just makes really good products.

Easy to use, love that I don't have to hang it from my waist.Well worth the price. Also Omron is a good product.I have and will recommend this pedometer to family and friends."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect","review":"This is my first Pedometer, and after purchasing this one, I likely will never have anything else to which to compare it. At the time of review, I have been using it for about a month.It is remarkably accurate. The 'aerobic steps' feature encourages me to get more 'quality' walking in each day. The memory feature allows me to track progress.I just love it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not liked it","review":"I just bought it but it is not calculating steps sometime and also it is very hard to know how many calories burned, it shows in kcal that doesn't tell exactly how many calories burned.Also, it must be perpendicular to ground, if it is less than 60' and more than 120'(degrees) it will not calculate steps."},{"rating":"1","title":"Read the instructions","review":"The product looks well made but it has been confusing how to program the pedometer so have not been able to use yet. The instructions give you one sentence. If you don't understand there is no where else to go. I also bought one as a gift and they too have not figured out how to program. There is no on/off button so once you install the battery it's on for it's life, unless you want to unscrew the back and remove it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Omron Pedometer","review":"This pedometer was easy to set up. It is also accurate. I have been using it to track miles when my husband and I walk. Now we don't have to drive all of our routes first to see how far we walk. The only complaint I have is that it is bulky."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice Pedometer","review":"I bought 2 pedometers, one for myself and my husband. They work very well, and it has very good features. I would recommend this to anyone, who is serious about doing 10,000 steps a day. We are working on getting to that."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great counter","review":"I purchased this item from Amazon end of December 2005 and have worn it every day. It seems to be very accurate in the number of steps recorded and the aerobic function is a nice touch. I did set up the kcal and milage but don't really know if this are 100% although most likely are. Earlier reviewer mentioned the wasit safety clip breaking. I had the same problem but went to Omron website and used the comments section to tell them the issue. Included my name and address (plus date purchased) and in 3 business days they had sent me a new clip and holder, no cost."},{"rating":"1","title":"Clip on the back of the Pedometer","review":"The plastic clip on the back of the Pedometer broke off the first time we used it.The Pedometer worked fine...just the clip was bad."},{"rating":"2","title":"Keeps track just about anywhere!","review":"The other day, I was on an outing and inadvertently left my pedometer in my purse backpack, which I wore on my back for several hours. And I went about my routine. This pedometer had recorded all of my activity. That is how cool this little unit is. The other nice features are the calibration (can input average step length and weight), aerobic activity meter and its 7-day memory. This is a must have for the serious walker."},{"rating":"2","title":"You get what you pay for","review":"I have tried other cheapy brands that this blows the doors off of. Sure you pay a bit more, but what you get is a pedometer that doesn't end up in the toilet (it has a secure clip for your beltloop), memory from one day to the next so you can track your progress (yes, it does know when it's a new day), acurate steps - not something that skips a beat, a split out of regular steps vs aerobic steps for those faster paced walks with the dog...and just an overall feeling of quality vs the fear of breakage if you look at it wrong."},{"rating":"1","title":"it counted more steps than I actually took.","review":"I purchased this product due to the reviews and I am very disappointed. I did several test to see how accurate it was. It counted more steps than I actually took. I even picked up 5 steps driving to work. It is not worth the money. I took it back the next day."},{"rating":"1","title":"No Battery Included","review":"I recently purchased an Omron HJ-112 pedometer which I received. On the Omron box it states that a lithium battery is included. It also stated a lithium battery is included on the Amazon website. When I opened the packaging to set the pedometer, there was no battery. I called Omron to complain and was told by their customer service rep that sometimes Amazon re-packages some of their products and they had been getting a lot of complaints about no battery included. Omron customer service also stated that it was \\"only a short-term battery anyway\\". I disagree with Amazon re-packaging because the plastic packaging looked very authentic--Omron packaging. So now I have to wait until I get a battery to try the pedometer which means if I don't like it, I lose x-amount of days I have to return the product. Obviously, I couldn't rate the pedometer without a battery.Just wanted to give everyone a heads up."},{"rating":"1","title":"broke after less than a month","review":"I was very pleased with this for the whole 3.5 weeks that it worked. Suddenly it began adding steps with the slightest movement- if I had it in my hand or in a bag and moved either across the table, 8-10 steps would be added. Maybe I got a defective one but reading the reviews about the customer service, I am not going to put in the time to find out or spend the money to get another one."},{"rating":"1","title":"A packaging nightmare","review":"Product arrived in a padded Amazon box, inside of which was a plastic bubble pack, that stiff kind you need a hacksaw to open. Inside of that was a stiff pasteboard box and inside of that was more plastic protection. Inside of that the product was well protected, but since the package had to be ripped to shreds to open, pieces went flying. I fianlly found the strap on the floor. I never did find the battery. I'm not sure there was one, though the manual says it's included. I even opened the battery slot(which requires a tiny phillips head srewdriver NOT included to see if maybe it was already installed. It wasn't. I would return this piece of junk but the Amazon policy says \\"return in original packaging, wich no longer exists. I don't know it the product works well or not.

Cannot be turned off and will reset to zero for no apparent reason."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Pedometer I've used","review":"I love the Omron Digital Pocket pedometer! I've used both the Omron HJ-112 and the HJ-720ITC and loved both of them. This one is about $10 less and the only difference is that you don't get the software to track your steps for the whole month. I was introduced to the Omron when I was part of a weight loss/ bone density study in college and they bought them for all the participants. They are well worth the money. I like that I can put it in my pocket or clip it to a purse shopping and the steps seem to be fairly accurate. It does count a little less than the cheaper pedometers that you use on your hip. I've bought two because I keep forgetting about them when I wash my pants and ruin them. Thats the only downside I've found to a pocket pedometer."},{"rating":"2","title":"My favorite pedometer","review":"This is the fourth pedometer I've had in the last 2 years, and it's definitely my favorite. It was very easy to set up, and what I appreciate the most is the dual clips. Other pedometers I've had would come unclipped and fall to the ground, dislodging the battery and erasing my steps (and my weight, height, and stride length that I worked so hard to enter). But this Omron pedometer has two sturdy clips, and neither has become dislodged - ever.Another frustration with other pedometers is that it's too easy to reset and lose all my steps for the day. The only time that's ever happened with my Omron pedometer is when I held my 25-pound child on the same hip as I was wearing the pedometer. But otherwise, no accidental resets.I am amazed at the accuracy of this pedometer, even when it's in my pocket. And the price - What a deal!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Easy to operate","review":"I have never owned a pedometer and imagined the instructions would be complicated.

I'm pleased with my purchase"},{"rating":"1","title":"DON'T lose or break the belt clip!","review":"I've had this product for years and love it BUT the belt clip broke and there is no way of getting a replacement. Omron doesn't stock replacement clips even though they still sell the product. The only ones they have come with a new unit. So if you buy a new pedometer today and lose or break the clip, you have a pedometer that needs to be replaced. Good product! Dumb decision by some genius at Omron."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Product","review":"Great product. I wear it almost all the time. My wife has one also and it is a contest to see who has the most steps at the end of the day. 10,000 steps is equal to about 5 miles so if you are a couch potato this product will give you an incentive to get up and walk."},{"rating":"2","title":"simply the best","review":"Forget about the cheap pedometers and the ones that come 'free' with Step counting books. This is accurate, counts aerobic and non-aerobic steps, computes distance, calories - What's not to like?"},{"rating":"1","title":"No Battery Included","review":"Well, I ordered this item as a throw in with the heart monitor. It's been over 30 days since I ordered it and finally remembered to bring it with me to work so I can count my steps. No where is there a battery in this thing even though the package clearly states there should be one. Called Omron and got a sorry we don't have those batteries to ship out so you can send it to us for repair along with $5 and you pay for shipping as well. Called Amazon and they at least credited me $4 (10% of my order amount)towards a battery. After 30 days there is no full refund or exchange. So, this may be a nice pedometer but the company who makes it sure doesn't have good service, so I recommend you open your package asap to make sure everything is included."},{"rating":"1","title":"Omron","review":"I have used Omron pedometers for years and this one was horrible. It was so tall that when it was fastened to my waistband it would poke my ribs when I bent over or moved, as did the safety harness clasp. It wouldn't acurately keep track of my steps if I used it in my pocket or on my waist."},{"rating":"1","title":"Maybe I got an older model....","review":"But this pedometer does not deserve all the rave reviews it gets here. I bought this particular model because it wasn't too pricey and it got great reviews. I found out that it doesn't accurately count the footsteps. I wear it in my pocket and sometimes when I take it out, it will jump 10-20 steps. I have to handle it very carefully. I use this for it's \\"ballpark\\" accuracy. As in it will give you a \\"ballpark number\\" of steps you have walked."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not secure enough.","review":"I purchased this and wore it one day it was fine. The next day I wore it to school since I work there and lost it within an hour of being in school. The strap clip did not open for me. The clip is not sturdy enough and it popped off my waist 5x. That should have told me something. The product itself is great but they should have a more secure way of keeping in connected to your body.

Only one of them was almost as accurate as the Omron but the belt clip broke. The Omron can be used in a pants pocket, on a belt or waistband, in a purse, or a shirt pocket and still provide relatively accurate step counts. It also provides a 7 day history if you keep a log and don't have time to write down your results for a few days the Omron HJ-112 keeps 7 days in memory."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Pedometer","review":"This pedometer is an excellent way to track your activity throughout the day and week.

It has been a great tool during my weight loss journey. It was a bit of a problem setting my \\"stide\\" but by following the directions provided the set up was very quick and easy. One reviewer cited that the battery life didn't last long, however, I'm still on the same battery five months into use. I can verify what another reviewer stated - I've clipped this onto my purse when shopping and it still keeps track of my steps accurately. I can't agree with another reviewer about having the pedometer in the car, hitting bumps and somehow the pedometer counted that as steps - I haven't had that happen with mine. Definately worth the price and will purchase it again if something happens to this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Pedometer","review":"This is a great pedometer and I love the fact it will track your calories and aerobic activity.

I wish it measured all the hills I have to climb on my walks, but never mind. My only gripe is I do not think it measures distance accurately. When I drive my car to measure the distances, they invariably add up to more. I have repeated the experiment several times. But the number of steps is more important than the distance. Last night I found my dog had chewed up my pedometer so I'll be ordering another.

It additionally gives me distance, calories used, and whether any of it was sufficiently sustained to be considered aerobic. Useful information for someone trying to develop healthier habits!*I accidentally left the pedometer clipped to a cargo pant pocket and it went through the washing machine.

It fits snugly in my pocket, and I switch back and forth between miles -- so far today a bit less than two miles -- and steps -- 5,5665.

I've tried attaching it different ways, putting it in my pocket, putting it in my bag, but it only records about one out of every 50 steps (right now it says 12 after I've been walking all over the place).

I like that you can put it in your pocket or drop it in your purse and it will still keep tracking. Without the clip it is pretty slender but with the clip you will have twice the bulk. I use the strap whenever I carry it because I have dropped it a few times. My only complaint is that it does not calculate the distance correctly for aerobic steps. It only asks you for the length of a normal step when setting up your gait so there is no way it will calculate your running gait correctly. I suggest that if you are using it more for running then input your running gait and if you are using it mainly for just strait steps then your normal walking gait will suffice.

Neither problem occurred after dropping it or other possible answers. I replaced the battery but the display continued to malfunction. When contacting the company, since it was under warranty, I was told I would need to send it back at my expense, pay another $8 for their costs and they highly recommended that I insure it as well.

From the start, with the easy-to-open package and simple configuration with directions, this tool has been a joy to use. It has both a belt clip and a smaller clip for pockets. No more pedometer falling off because the clip was designed for a men's belt, not a women's waistband.I like that I can just keep the Omron in my jeans pocket (clipped on with the smaller clip). It works in breast pockets, too, but I haven't tried it. I like that it counts steps fairly accurately and keeps the last 7 days in memory. I like that I can put in my average pace-length and that it calculates how far I've walked.About the only downside is that the Omron is a bit bigger than the little one that fell off my belt the first day I had it. Other than that, the Omron HJ-112 works as advertised without any fuss. To me, it really is an explemplar of good design. It's a pedometer that just works."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than most....","review":"This pedometer is not only competitively priced through Amazon, but it is fairly accurate with my stride count.

We make sure that we put the unit on first thing in the morning and don't take it off until bed time. A great product for anyone concerned with their health.

My 1 year old daughter loves to play in it. It is much longer than I expected, and is made of very a strong material. I love that it has a flat bottom too, although she is able to roll it over. It is held up by tent poles which are very well hidden within the material once constructed, so when she pushes on it, it just pops back into shape. An excellent product in my opinion. Well worth the cost. The only downfall is that it is not easily collapsable for storage. You would have to take all of the poles out. But she plays in it so much I probably won't take it down anyway."},{"rating":"2","title":"Our boys love this!","review":"Our boys love to play in this. Although it is designed for 3 and up - our boys are always supervised while playing in this. They love to play peek-a-boo with each other. They hide toys in them...chase balls. Even the dog goes through it with them. The boys are only 1 and they can sit up inside perfectly. Still have about 2\\" until their heads reach the top. So plenty of room to grow into. It is flimsy hence the 3 yr and up for age. The poles are flexible so it is not as sturdy for kids who can't really walk. But love it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Thorough end-user guide","review":"This is a thoroughly end-user guide to the .Mac service. Engineers need not apply, but a typical Macintosh user who wants to make complete and proper use of the .Mac service will find lots to like. The presentation and organization is well thought out, but the book has more screen shots than I have seen in any O'Reilly book. And the screen shots are often used as exposition, which, from the outside, appears to be a no-no (a well appreciated no-no) in the house of O'Reilly.I definitely recommend this for .Mac users, but not for engineers or experienced users who won't find anything they haven't seen first hand."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad Teacher","review":"I do not like the way the book is written (frankly). Maybe it's just me, but I like things explained better. I understand everything he is saying and he does give you a step by step list of how to do things, but he DOES NOT tell you the purpose of each of the features of .Mac, which to me is essential. It's almost as if he thinks we already understand what to do with each of the components of membership. He gives absolutely NO examples of what you'd use these things for and all he really would have had to do would've been include a couple paragraphs about it. As I read it's hard for me to follow along because he excludes essential information relevant to .Mac and the use thereof."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buy any other horse book instead","review":"Very disappointing. If you know anything at all about the famous Thoroughbreds, this book will add nothing to your knowledge. It's written in the form of a dialogue with a fictional groom who seems to have seen every famous horse from Regret to Personal Ensign, and the information is just brief capsules summarizing their careers, and sometimes volunteering opinions based on no evidence given. For me, definitely a \\"give to a local nonprofit book sale\\" item. And the paintings... well, I've seen better pictures sent in by 10-year-olds to the Breyer magazine."},{"rating":"2","title":"Old Dog Learns New Tricks","review":"As an investigator of 20 years and the son of an investigator, I thought I knew it all about interviewing eyewitnesses.

Good book, good woman, good work."},{"rating":"2","title":"Reluctantly Recruited","review":"I resisted this choice of book for our July selection. I detest \\"cop stories\\" and thought this would be one. It's not. It is more like the anti-cop story. It is the story of courage, of an outsider taking on a cause.

But the good she does in channeling her own pain is what will inspire you to do something grand with your own."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lucky, I guess","review":"While in a doctor's office, I saw an excerpt from the book, \\"Portraits of Guilt\\", and began to read.

Almost like reading someone's journal. Ms. Boylan is to be admired for stickingby her guns and her principles. Her trials became my trials. I felt what she was feeling. During my reading, there were, at times, when I stopped reading and openly sobbed.

I read this book after it was given to me by my neighbor to take with me on summer vacation. After hearing her rave about it for days, I opened it, and to my amazement since I normally don't read crime related books, I could not put it down. It is a rich and unique biography. I've since given it to my 18 year old who is engrossed in it as I type, and the other two girls are fighting over who gets to read it next. This writer is not just a groundbreaker in her field of forensic investigation, but a courageous and strong role model for young women everywhere. I am delighted to have her book to pass on to all my daughters as an example of what one can do to turn tragedy into triumph and to open the minds and hearts of a male dominated police system that is traditionally very resistent to change. Hats off to this amazing woman and her extremely engrossing and well written book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Facinating subject, well written book.","review":"I recommend this book to anyone with a warm heart and an open mind. Boylan writes beautifully and takes the reader into her unusual and chaotic world of forensics, (with a twist) and simultaniously weaves the power struggle in her marriage and effects of her demanding job on her personal life, into and in between the ongoing case to case dramas. Brilliantly balanced story with something to hold all interests from the hardest cop to the softest stay at home mom."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your money","review":"This book is a real I, me, my.

What was interesting about this book, was the story transported me out of my professor mode and into that of an extremely absorbed reader, walking by the side of this author through her amazing trials and tribulations. For that, I give it the highest marks. Boylan made me forget my own profession and instead took me on an eye opening journey deep inside of hers. I learned so much from \\"Portraits of Guilt\\" and would recommend it to others with vigor."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very weak","review":"This could have been an interesting book if the author had focused on the important stuff. The interview process she uses should have been fleshed out more. Instead we get lots of info on her flying around the country.

Very disappointing because it just misses the mark."},{"rating":"2","title":"Deserving \\"Best True Crime Drama of the Year\\" Edgar Nominee","review":"I read that this book was among the finalists for the prestigious EDGAR Award as \\"Best True Crime Drama\\" of the year. Historically, the 'Edgars' are not handed out to less than the very best work.Hence the prestige in the nomination alone. I ordered it and was definitely not disappointed! Excellent book. This is a refreshingly honest and new look into the back scenes of crime, written from a rare personal perspective of one woman who was involved in every case and whose source of passion is through her personal experience. I was extremely impressed with her candor, her self deprecating and humble style of giving credit to all those around her for the successes and to the remarkable way in which she honored the courage of all the people she so lovingly talks about in her cases."},{"rating":"2","title":"EXCELLENT MOVIE BUT IF U MAKE ONE MAKE IT AT LAST ONE HOUR!","review":"NICE FINALE FOR JACKIE BUT PLOT COULD HAVE BEEN DEEPER, MOVIES BELOW HOUR SUK ESPECIALLY IF IT'S YOUR FAVORITE!OTHERWISE I D GIVE IT 5 STARS, JACKIE SHOULD HAVE MADE 40 HONEYMOONERS NOT 39, THEY HAD ONE FULL SEASON TO DO IT, LIKE ROCKY MARCIANO 49-0, WHAT THE HELL WAS HE THINKIN OF, EXTRA FIGHT WOULD NOT BE EASY BUT NOT TOUCH VS BOB BAKER, THE ONLY LOGICAL OPPONENT LEFT FOR HIM HE AVOIDED & HE'D HAVE BEEN GOLDEN BOY WITH 50-0,SHAME IT DIDNT HAPPEN!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Picture Show","review":"Save your money.

When you buy your \\"cat\\" you get a purina specialist. Then you must buy purina toys and purina food to make your cat happy. It won't be. It wants to eat every 5 minutes and you won't have enough money to do so. To get money you either have to enter conestests based soley on what purina food you feed your cat how many times a day. The only other ways to make money are play the simon says game where your cat jumps up and down and makes fake meowing noises and a game where you have to copy and hit music notes along with a well-known song so that a human will start singing \\"meow\\" with the song.This is a purina promotional game, not a pet game!So, if you want a good cat game this is not a game for you. Instead, try to get Nintendo to make Nintencats or stick to Nintendogs, it's 10 million times better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Purr Pals","review":"Purr Pals is the perfect game for the people who aren't fond of the Nintendo dogs DS game. The cats are very realistic, but it is almost impossible to earn money. Also, the cats have endless needs and it takes forever to keep them well fed and happy. Overall, it becomes very repetitive, the cats are the only bonus to the game."},{"rating":"2","title":"meow meow","review":"I bought this for my grandchildren ages 6 and 8.

I ended up returning both. I returned LOL because your friend has to have the game to be able to use it at all, when I thought everyone could play on one Nintendo DS. When I tried to play a mini-game on Purr Pals it got stuck and I had to turn off the game. I traded this game and LOL in for Petz Horsez 2 which I am very happy with so far except for I can't seem to brush the horses right. I didn't try competitions. I may be unfairly rating this because I didn't do much in it. But what I did in it I didn't like very much. You can clean the kitten's litter box, which I thought was neat. You can also spray your kitten with water when it misbehaves, which I also thought was cool.I think this game would be enjoyable for younger kids, although you read in this game some - but some older kids may enjoy it, though."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed :(","review":"I bought this game when I first bought my DS. When I first started playing this game it was pretty fun. I bought that game because I thought it would be like the game Nintendogs, and look the same. Now after having it for a few months I realize it was a waste of my money. The graphics and the way the cats move are terrible!The cat has to eat, be brushed, play, and be petted, like every five minutes.The games were pretty fun, but the basketball one was a little hard, the music one was my favorite, the one where you shot the hearts like Cupid was ok, and the copy cat was a little boring after awhile. You also have to pay to get your cat in a contest.If you are thinking of buying this game don't. The graphics are horrible, and it is just downright boring."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Poop on Purr Pals","review":"Purr Pals is a very repetitive game in which you must take care of your cat (which has a tendency to use the restroom a bit too much!) The mini games get boring very quickly. Some of the graphics are more realistic than others. You can customize your cat so he/she has pink or blue whiskers! It's cute and fun at first and then it gets very, very dull and predictable. Of course this is only my opinion and you must use your own judgment before purchasing any video game because everyone has their own idea of what a fun video game truly is! C : I believe this game caters to younger users (13 and younger)In my opinion Nintendogs is more interesting, although it also become very repetitive!"},{"rating":"2","title":"good game","review":"My 8-year-old daughter wanted this game and liked it!

This is now my favourite opera of Richard Strauss."},{"rating":"1","title":"THis Danae is unlistenable","review":"I just regret paying more than 35 on this.

Gone is the gamelan-like ricky-ticky edge caused by too many percussive instruments (and I was a percussionist!). This softening is also considerably helped by the decision to assign the Pulse to a synth rather than a piano. Kudos to whoever thought of THAT one.The second thing that struck me is the fact that these guys actually listen to one another. This performance doesn't sound, at least to these ears, like the 2 rehearsals then do the gig situation that has produced a great many mediocre, or just plain bad performances and recordings of this work. Instead, it strikes me that there must have been many many sessions sharing ideas, experimenting, discarding, adding, editing and on and on. In four short words, a real group effort.This realization is a must-have for fans of the genre. Bjork, how about some cross-marketing?"},{"rating":"2","title":"The unceasing pulse of the Universe","review":"I can listen to this piece over & over & over ... really, what else has to be said? Its sheer energy seems to fill the air with visibly burning notes, like melodic bursts of electrons in the shimmering aether -- it has that sort of fierce joie de vivre. Needless to say, this utterly engaging Bang On A Can recording has sent me in search of previous ones, because it clearly lends itself to varied interpretations.It's understandable that this won't appeal to everyone, of course. When I was younger, I might not have had either the patience or perception to experience it properly; but I'm glad that I changed enough to appreciate it now. I find that it has a paradoxical quality, in that it's contemplative but also quite active -- it settles my being into a calm state, but it's an exceptionally aware, almost electrified calm. I agree with another poster here -- this will still be played & enjoyed in the year 3000 -- most highly recommended!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Could use better booklet","review":"This is a nice recording of an interesting piece, although in this genre I think Steve Reich's Music for 18 Musicians is a more haunting, beautiful piece, mainly because it uses voices (although you can use voices on In C, but BoaC doesn't). To paraphrase Gertrude Stein, Riley did it first and Reich did it pretty. Riley actually recommends using 35 players, which is over twice what Bang on a Can has. The CD booklet is pretty spare, without any real information about the piece. However, the booklet points you to good website which has the score and Riley's commentary on the work, which is worth looking at..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Music Lover","review":"It is great to have all of my favorite Larry Graham songs on one cd.

For some reason, however (probably legal reasons), his name has been changed to 'Bob.' He is played by veteran Bruce Lee imitator Bruce Li, who does a servicable job. The film traces 'Bob's' work in a Chinese restaurant where he makes enemies with a local gang, opening his own kung fu school, the creation of 'jeet kun do,' and...er, more run-ins with gangs. This seems to have been shot mostly in an Asian suburb/park, giving the movie a strange low-budget feel. It's not a whole lot more interesting than any other Bruceploitation movie, although there are plenty of fight scenes, particularly towards the end.The DVD from Jalisco is in 1.33:1, heavily cropped from the film's probably 2.35:1 aspect ratio. The image is a bit sharper than expected, although still fairly scratchy. The dubbed sound is as you'd expect. There are, unsurprisingly, no extras.

Expecting better works from this great author in the future."},{"rating":"1","title":"not what I expected from Robin Cook","review":"This is the first Robin Cook novel I have ever read. But given his popularity and success, I expected more.The concept behind the novel is pretty good. Black rocks fall from the sky. People pick them up and get sick. But instead of having the flu, they have been infected by an alien virus that is planning to take over the planet.But despite the good idea, the book isn't very good. The writing was not the caliber that I expected from such a successful author. It seemed more like something from a college student trying to write his first novel. I wasn't impressed.I had to make myself finish reading this book, just because I hate to quit reading a book in the middle. I hoped it would get better but in the end I was disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just awful!","review":"The worst novel by far that I have read by Cook. A highly unbelievable plot, clunky dialogue, and a ridiculous \\"love story\\" about the love of a mutant virus for a foxy coed. Cook's attempt to write a sci fi novel is a fiasco. As has been noted, he should stick to writing medical thrillers, some of which are pretty good."},{"rating":"1","title":"A TV movie script?","review":"Ten minutes in I recognized this as the script for a TV movie that I've seen at least ten times. Stock characters, standard dialogue, totally predictable, and a lame ending."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great Take on Alien Invasion","review":"Invasion draws you in from the very beginning. The first half of this book was five stars. The second half, three stars. It averaged out to be a very compelling read. The author did a great job in making you believe the authenticity of the method by which Earth was compromised. Some of the plot twists later on in the book could have been more interesting. Overall this was a very good story and a recommended read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not original!","review":"It's a mix of Bodysnatcher and Visitors, where only a small group saves the whole earth. Besides some unreality, there's nothing new. I've read it quite fastly, without emotion.Cook makes better when stories, even if fictionary and futuristic, have some grade of realism (i.e. it may happens)."},{"rating":"1","title":"An awful book from a terrible excuse for an author.","review":"Tripe like this consumes resources (paper, ink, shelf space) that could be used for better books. Help raise Humanity's standards: avoid all of Cook's books (except as a source of kindling). Only the very young or very ignorant could like this book. Even the \\"official\\" reviews (above) hate it"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a worthy endeavor for Robin Cook","review":"I am a fan of Cook's other novels, but couldn't wait to finishthis one so I could go on to something better. It seemed like a firsttime attempt for a new novelist and not a very good one at that. I felt like I was reading a screenplay and not a novel. All in all I felt like I wasted my time reading this thinly disguised rewrite of \\"Invasion of the Body Snatchers\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Absolute drivel","review":"I'm stuck in an airport with a ninety minute flight delay and nothing to read. Not much to pick from at the Corpus Christi Airport bookstand. Took a flyer on this book. Egad, what a putrid read.Where to start ... paint-by-numbers plot? Character development? dialog? sanctimonious BS enviromessage? Convenient narrative manipulation?We'll start with the character development. There isn't any. Everybody in the book is pure cardboard. The neurologist, the doctor, the student, Cassy, ... take your pick. I didn't buy any of them.Dialog is simply wretched. A tin ear for human speaking doesn't begin to cover the author's lack of grasp in this matter. Maybe its just too much time in the medical books. There's no way English is this guy's first language.I won't bother with the rest. The book had no redeeming features. By the end I was rooting for the virus to put all these poor saps out of their misery."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cook trying to be Crichton","review":"I do love Robin Cook's novels. They are so compelling, fun, and a good read. But this one seemed like the author was trying to write like someone he is not. It almost seemed like a Michael Crichton novel, but it turned out so second rate if that was the intention, it fell very flat.You will find the book a page-turner, but at the end you will feel it was not nearly what you had expected from this usually good author."},{"rating":"1","title":"Under Cooked","review":"Invasion does not live up to my expectation of Robin Cook. Unbelievable story, far fetched sci fi. His med thrillers are always based on a plausible idea gone bad; this Invasion is a disappointment, I sped read the last 70 pages to get the misery over with."},{"rating":"1","title":"An embarrassing crock!","review":"I can't even believe I finished reading this amateurish attempt at a half-way decent waste of resources (ink, paper, shelf space.) I started this with high hopes but they were immediately dashed and stomped out. I just wanted to break down and cry after reading this book. Don't get me wrong--Robin Cook is a great, experienced , and talented author. ITS JUST THAT HE REGRESSED WITH THIS BLINDING USE FOR CHEAP KINDLING. I lost considerable respect for him after reading this laxadazical daydream for medical literature. This piece of flamingo feces was consistent with its mediocre characters, cliche and repelling plot and anorexically weak and dilluted ending.

It's too bad that the crew from \\"Mystery Science Theater\\" can't lampoon books because they would have a field day with this tepid attempt at sci-fi. Hopefully, Dr. Cook will stick with the subject matter that he knows best - the medical thriller. If you're looking for a good Robin Cook book to read, don't start with this one. It is for serious devotees only!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I swear HE did NOT write this book","review":"I have often heard that James Patterson - the author of bland - now allows people to put his name on their books for a fee. I would guess that this is what occurred here. This book is awful, terrible, trite (\\"he alighted from the car\\"), ridiculous, unbelievable, a waste of money, etc. A total piece of garbage not worthy of Mr. Cooke."},{"rating":"1","title":"Get back to earth!","review":"I have been a devoted fan of Dr. Cook until this novel. It started out ok and went downhill from there. The author is a medical murder mystery writer not a sci-fi writer. The story line was so predictable I skipped paragraphs just to get it over with. No matter how awful a book is I will read it to the end because I paid for it. If I could have returned it I would have. Skip this book and read his other novels they're much better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful. Just awful.","review":"In short, it's the only book I've ever thrown away.I began to read this book with high hopes. The novel begins with some promise, but quickly degenerates into a mix of clichéd plot twists and unbearably forced dialogue. I can't help but suspect that Cook's heart wasn't in this project. Let's hope for better in the future."},{"rating":"2","title":"This was a GREAT book!","review":"I think this book was really good. I honestly can't see why some people didn't enjoy it! It was action packed and I couldn't put it down! The only reason I didn't give it a 10 was because at some points in the story they got too technical and I didn't really get it, but the action and suspence that Robin Cook included in his story made up for that. The movie, however, was a different story! Compared to the book, it wasn't that great, but it still was ok in that you actually got to see the characters come to life. I'd give the TV movie about a 4 or a 5 because of that. Anyways, I highly recommend for people who are into high action stories!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing. Nowhere near the level I have come to expect.","review":"Robin Cook should stick to what he does best: writing INCREDIBLY BELIEVABLE medical thrillers which keep you on the edge of your seat, terrified that in the not too distant future, or even NOW, these things can be /are actually happening. This space invasion stuff is beneath him and best left to those with less imagination who are dedicated to this area. Being a physician I especially enjoy his medical thriller aspects; space junk is a dime a dozen. I expected more from Robin Cook. Please stick to the old, better format!"},{"rating":"1","title":"INVASION is a disappointing experiment in science fiction.","review":"Robin Cook has diverged from his normal genre with Invasion, arather implausible tale about aliens who wait billions of years toinfiltrate the dominant life forms of planets throughout the universe. The concept of 'invasion by virus' was interesting, but the rest of the hard science was not convincing; indeed, little effort was expended to explain the mechanics of the aliens' science. The plot was weak and the characters were poorly developed - when several died I didn't care. Try again, Robin. This is simply not in the same class with your medical thrillers."},{"rating":"1","title":"If you can believe that...","review":"The earth is invaded by strange black discs which sting and infect people. An alien virus implanted millions of years ago into mankind's genetic code is being revived. People start to behave strangely and some of them become mutants, half lizard, half human. But a handful of haunted refugees struggle to piece together the puzzle of this improbable invasion in an attempts to save humanity.To be avoided at all costs."},{"rating":"1","title":"A BIG disappointment","review":"I was very eager to pick up this book after all the other great Cook books I'd read but after I finished the prologue I was very disappointed. I mean, Cook, doing a medical thriller about aliens! I found it very predictable and, I hate to say it but, stupid! I will admit after I finished the book I wasn't as upset but I still thought this was definitely one of Cook's worst books."},{"rating":"2","title":"Strange...","review":"I can't believe Robin Cook wrote this book. It's not like his other books at all. It's a good book, a little impropable, maybe, but good. Of course, all of his stories are impropable. I don't really like the ending. I mean, what would be so bad about the world ending up like that. I won't spoil it for anyone; I hate it when people do that. I just think the planet would have been it they hadn't stopped \\"them\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book, rushed ending","review":"I finished this book in about a week of non-stop reading. I thought it was great. It captivates you early on and the characters are well-described enough to keep you hooked. My only complain is that the ending seems rushed and hurried. It seems as though he just ran out of time and just ended the book. I would have liked a little more explanation and to know what some of the future events in the story were."},{"rating":"1","title":"What was he on?","review":"I could not believe that he wrote something so bad. it is definetly below his standards. The plot, the characters, everything was awful. If he actually put some thought into this novel, it would have been somewhat decent. Instead, it is a cheesy attempt to write a science fiction novel, when the author has almost no clue on how to do it. Cook should stick with the medical mysteries, it is what he is good at."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible Dialogue and aCheesy Plot make this book a disaster","review":"The most glaring and annoying flaw in this book is the wooden, stiff,dialogue. Not only is the dialogue stiff but the actual words the characters use to talk to each other are laughable. The cheesy plot is the other big blow to this novel, not only is the \\"aliens from outer space come to take over the earth plot\\" absolutely tired and overused but the book abounds with numerous cliches. All in all, simply save your money and don't shell out the money to buy this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Robib Cook's Worst","review":"I've read many of Robin Cook's books, and this was definitely not his usual good writing. As another reviewer stated, it's like someone else wrote it. Someone who is not a good writer and used a formula for churning out novels. Even the storyline is dull.Read Cook's earlier books, when he had the time and the imagination to write a very good novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book reminded me why I don't like Robin Cook","review":"Ok, can we get real for just a second here? Since this book is supposed to be a medical thriller, andnot science fiction, you would expect a half-way plausible plot. Well, don't get your hopes up, because this book is so completely unbelievable, it's ridiculous. The characters are just plain lame, the dialogue and speech make you laugh out loud, and the ending was horrible. I don't know why anyone would give this book a good review."},{"rating":"1","title":"A mindless one-sitting read","review":"Good escapism for an evening, but not all that well thoughtout or written. Mankind hangs on by a thread again!"},{"rating":"2","title":"What next?","review":"I thought that this book was extremely good if you like medical and science-fiction novels. The plot was amazing and the ending was very surprising. There weren't too many medical terms, so it was easy to follow.

I reccomend it very strongly."},{"rating":"1","title":"BOOOOOORING","review":"This was my first Robin Cook. It was bad. Some people may have liked it, but I didn't.The plot is creative and interresting, but I found the book boring. It's a good thing I ignored this book and read some of his better books."},{"rating":"1","title":"Watch the movie \\"Invasion of the Bodysnatchers\\" instead!!","review":"Poor. A real let down. Having read some of Robin Cook's earlier work I thought I would enjoy this book. How wrong can you be! So many elements of the book are from the 1978 version of Invasion of the Bodysnatchers that I can't believe it wasn't written whilst watching the movie. The book was then padded out with ever possible cliche available in this genre."},{"rating":"1","title":"oh heck!","review":"I love Robin Cook's stuff soooooooo much..and I also love sci fi. As a medical professional, I picked up this book thinking here is a marriage of my two fav subjects, medicine and sci fi..and was so disappointed.

Little in life will be this good. Pick up this book as soon as humanly possible. Seriously, this book is of the highest quality, easily rivaling most novels.

This collection of the first 6 CRIMSON issues will blow you away. With its fantastic artwork by Humberto Ramos to it compelling storyline from Brian Augustyn. Sure you might think it's another 'vampire with a conscious story' (which it is) but, it's a 'vampire with lots of new freaky unvampy like powers who is the 'Chosen One to defeat all evil conscious story' story. With a really cool supporting cast with Ekimus (one of the first living creatures on the planet), a voluptiously clad religous bounty hunter babe, the legendary St. George, and his vamp-indian best friend.

RECOMMENDED to all!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Someone Get That Penciller a Nude Model!","review":"Mediocre story; continues the long tradition of Wildstorm and Image artists who have clearly never seen a naked lady before. This comic has some of the most ludicrous anatomy I have ever seen, as though Rob Liefeld and Marc Silvestri taught a class in figure drawing and gave A's to anyone who showed up. Terrible."},{"rating":"1","title":"not very good...","review":"I'm not sure if I read the same book as these other reviewers. The plot is sub-Anne Rice drivel about vampires that dress and act like Marvel superheroes, Humberto Ramos' art is a grusome cross between manga style and Rob Liefield, and Brian Augustyn's script reads like Chris Clarmont on crack. All the chracters are always introducing themselves by exclaiming their inner angst as loudly as possible, usually in some cutely spelled comic book \\"accent\\". Uhgg... this is all the stuff that embarasses me when I try to show someone that there really are graphic novels worth reading. Give this a pass."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best of the Best","review":"Currently this game is my favorite. It runs smooth as silk at least if you have the specs to run this game. I have Nvidia. If you have ATI Radeon, I suggest you go update your drivers to 3.10 or go back to 3.7. Also check out the support page at Activision.This game is well executed: story, graphics, enemy AI and sometimes friendly AI (they get in the way sometimes), gameplay options, the music is perfect to set the mood, etc. My only gripe is the last 3 missions: too short yet great anyway.One of the things I liked was the group feel versus fighting alone. You're not in charge so there's no micro management. Given there are times when you must go it alone and that's okay to bring a change of pace to the game. I sure hope they make an expansion soon. Yet I don't think I'll ever uninstall this game. It's staying in my hard drive."},{"rating":"2","title":"Call of Duty","review":"Worth it.

Enemy AI is very good and makes for interesting replays after dying.Other than the GTAIII & Vice City games I have not bought many games in the last few years since my old pc would not do them any justice. After finishing building my new pc- I decided I needed a current game to see what my new system could do. I could not have picked a better title to christen my new pc.I have not found anything negative to say about this game and I am very picky about game quality. Until Halflife2 is released I am sure I will be devoting all gaming time to Call of Duty.The standout parts of the game are the Russian levels, especially the tank levels.I hope there is a sequel already in the works, or at the very least an expansion pack."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good game","review":"Critics say it's the best war game ever. I'd say if it was released 2 years ago, there's no doubt about it. With too many similarities with those mega hits released before, you won't be impressed easily. That doesn't mean I did not enjoy this game. I can't stop playing and I love almost every aspects of the game. The sequence design, graphic, and sound are outstanding and most important the multi-player mode is unbelievable smooth. I don't consider MOHAA a five star game and same as Wolfenstien. But I do think Hitman and Max Payne 5. So it probably just my personal preference.The conclusion: go get this game and you won't regret!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice Game with good realism","review":"I am a newbie game player.

I found it professionally produced and engaging."},{"rating":"2","title":"Much better than Medal of Honor","review":"When people got Medal of Honor Allied Assualt, they really got into the game and realized how good it was. Call of Duty is much better. You play as the Americans, British, and Russians. I have had this game for over a year, and I am still playing it. When I got it, I beat it on the second day, and started on the next dificulty level. I worked my way up to the hardest one, and it is an enirely diferent experience. It's replay value is incredible. On the hardest dificulty level, you die after only two or three shots, so you get more into the game than ever before. This is the best first person shooter that I have ever played."},{"rating":"1","title":"Same old tired game","review":"While this game had decent scripted scenarios, this basically led to zero replay ability. Which wouldn't be so bad if the game were longer, but as it stands, the average completion time is about 10 hours or less. For my $50, this is by far not enough entertainment. And if you say that there is a bright side with the multi-player, I saw, play Return to Castle Wolfenstein, and you'll get a visually similar game, with tons of better game play. In the end, a game like Medal of Honor is much better than this, even if it is older. I was looking forward to the storming of Stalingrad level, and needless to say, it couldn't hold a candle to the Omaha beach invasion from MoHAA. There was nothing stellar about this game, nothing that made it stand out from the crowd at all. In some respects, the I found the story of RtCW much more intriguing, even if it was fiction. Call of Duty is the same tired formula of FPS's that everyone's used before, nothing new here."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tribute to Medal of Honor or a simple clone?","review":"Call of duty has great graphics, tank battles, mad charges of enemy gun implacements and players have lots of weapons from which to choose; just like the Medal of Honor games.In fact, I can't see any real difference between the two games, and that is sort of a good thing since Medal of Honor is such a great game.

The game on the other hand will leave you saying.....\\"I don't just want my money back...I want my TIME back!\\" In fact, A Bridge Too Far is LONGER than the amount of time I spent on the game.

I'm still trying to figure out how to work around this, I have the latest drivers on all my hardware.This is a great game, and there's a 90% chance it will work on your PC.

There's no \\"Use\\" button, you can not open doors or drive vehicles. The movement is slow, no mather how you are aiming. The best aspect of this game is that,for some times, you can feel very inmersed in the story and in the \\"war\\" that is going on around you. The multiplayer option needs more development. My biggest complain is the time for completing it. Terribly short time, I finished in TWO days. For a game on this price there are other options in this particular genre (First person) that have a more value for money (Ex. Return to Castle Wolfestein or No One Lives Forever).

Graphics were ok, but there was the occasional enemy soldier poking through the brick wall for all to see.In summary, I know the squad additions were supposed to take this game to the next level; however, they actually made the whole genre regress.

The single player game is a lot of fun, but isn't any longer than most expansion packs. Definitely not $50 worth of game time. It can easily be finished in a few days, and the character actions are very predictable and repetitive at all levels.The multiplayer game could be the most fun, but it suffers from some very serious bugs, particularly in timing. The game seems incapable of keeping all the players in synch. Instead, certain players will seem superhuman, because they move incredibly fast and can't be shot, yet they appear to shoot you even when their weapons are pointed 45 degrees away from you. If your frame rates are good, the game plays fine, but if your frame rates drop off, it becomes impossible to hit anything, because you're firing behind the image rendering.I would save my money and try a different game."},{"rating":"1","title":"Check your video/audio cards!","review":"I have a 1 year old,and a 3 year old computer,but i have to upgrade the video card,and possibly the audio cards before it will run.It looks great,with positive reviews,but it's gonna cost me.I might just get an X-Box."},{"rating":"2","title":"The most realistic game play","review":"This is a living legend so to speak.

This game is I think alot more reilistic than the Medal Of Honor games but this game is a little too relistic and some times it gets a little boring. But over all the game is great!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"It can't be over already!!!","review":"This WW2 shooter has the most atmospheric content I have ever seen in a game so far. Medal of Honor had Omaha beach and it was wonderful. Call of Duty has Stalingrad, the French countryside with multiple explosions. By the way, I like the way the game makes you deaf and shocked when you nearly get missed by a shell. Those moments are scritped but they are a nice addition.The enemy AI is very satisfactory. Plenty of times, I thought that a soldier was supressed in a corner. I get to him to pump him full of lead and he is not there anymore. He hid and flanked me.Unfortunately, there is not much interactivity in the levels. The doors cannot be opened and the levels are linear. Also, the single player campaign is too short. It should be twice as long. But there is an expansion pack that will give me my fix of CoD.With Brothers in arm and Medal of Honor, Call of Duty is the best WW2 shooter on the market."},{"rating":"2","title":"good game!","review":"I love this game very much ! I will buy call of duty United Offensive Expansion Pack and Call of duty 2."},{"rating":"2","title":"Start of the series","review":"This is basically the game that defined the FPS genre.I played this game after playing COD2, COD4, Medal of Honor 10th Anniversary (MOHAA, MOHAAB, MOHAAS, MOHPA, MOHAB) - I think MOH was the better series, but all of the games are great fun. COD was a bit easy after playing the other games, but still a lot of fun. The main flaw is the weapons are accurate at much longer range than realistically and the game is pretty structured in how you perform actions."},{"rating":"2","title":"This title is a standout even if it's not COD4...","review":"This title is a few years old, yes. Still, it is a fast paced, well made game & the graphics are quite good. I recommend the game to anybody who likes a solid first person shooter and it can be had for very little $$$. How can you go wrong?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great But I Wanted More!","review":"This is a great WWII genre action game. You move through the single player missions in three distinct phases during American, British, and Russian campaigns. Your skills are tested in 24 realistic missions offering plenty of challenges without becoming tiresome. A little advice for the novice: Don't try to be the hero. If you liked Medal of Honer Allied Assault you'll definitely enjoy this game."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good action game that lacks in the historical department","review":"The game overall is a great action game, based off of the Quake 3 engine it looks good and it plays good on most computers, the singleplayer mode is that of putting yourself into the shoes of three soldiers, a russian a american and from what I think is a english man, although he could be any one of the nationalities of the UK, historically speaking the accounts taken are semi-accurate, namely the american and british ones, but the russian SP missions are innacurate to say the least, it's taken directly from the movie enemy at the gate which is also a hollywoodized version of the actual eastern front. Multipleplayer is a standard death match shoot very close to that of medal of honor and quake 3 death matchs.Overall good game, but unaccurate."},{"rating":"2","title":"Totaly awesome!!!","review":"Ok,first I loaded the demo,then after I picked myself up off of the floor I rubbed my eyes,I thought I had gone back in time to the war!People,this game is awesome!!I bought the game and glad I did! I am not a big game player,but this game has me hooked.The graphics are incredable!!If you have a good video card,you can crank up the options in the game for wild scenes.I have a 256 mb video card,the game was so realistic,I had to get a first aid kit out.I felt like I was shot!Buy this game,you won't be dissapointed!By the way,you just have to try the multiplayer mode! To fight in teams against other people across the world is totaly addicting!I hid the \\"honey\\" do list my wife gave me!!Bye bye,I am off to COD multiplayer....see you there!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This is Medal of Honor... on Steroids!","review":"Wow! I've played the demo over and over again. It is really good. Your squad members aren't anywhere near as stupid as they are in Medal of Honor. All I have to say is if this is the demo, how much better is the actual game going to be? I can't wait."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overrated","review":"I bought this game thinking it would be another Battlefield 1942. I was wrong though however. Like others have said, it is scripted. I wanted a game with unpredictable AI, and this game is very predictable. It reminds me of the James Bond games and there is even a high speed chase in this game which to me is stupid for a WWII game. I feel Activision is trying to cash in on the WWII FPS fad that is going on right now. This game is just a clone of the MOH:AA.The only positive thing I liked about this game is the graphics.Also the multiplayer sucks! The maps are very small and the guys run like they are always trying to do the russian dance of joy.To sum this game up: very overrated!"},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT!","review":"Call of Duty is by far the BEST WW2 or any other war pc game so far. Actually I think it's better that Counter Strike. The maps, the graphics, the action is the best ever.Better than Battlefield 1942, Medal of Honor, Wolfenstein,Ghost Recon, Blackhawk Down, Rainbow Six 3, Tactical Ops, and all the others.Activision should be proud that they have put out such a great grame. Thanks"},{"rating":"2","title":"kills medal of honor!","review":"call of duty is the absolute BEST world war 2 action shooter EVER! no medel of honor or soldiers of fortune game will EVER outdo this game. i would recommend it to ANY pc gamer!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Game!","review":"Call of Duty is the best WWII Shooter I've ever played. It's realistic, intense, and has a wide range of missions in which you play through all sorts of battles.The American Campaign is my favorite. As Private Martin, you battle through French towns and countrysides, take a wild car ride through occupied territory, and rescue prisoners from a huge house and later a POW camp. Awesome.In the British Campaign, you are Sergeant Evans, and assist in taking and holding a bridge, destroying a dam, sinking a battleship and more.In the Russian Campaign, as Alexi, you fight through Stalingrad, drive T-34 tanks, and capture the Riechstag in Berlin.The weapons and voice talent are great, although they could have added a little more German death sounds. It gets rather boring hearing the same cry every 10 kills.Overall, a great game, with plenty of interesting action to keep things stirred up."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun for hours","review":"What a Journey!! This game has it all. There was one level which gave my computer trouble loading. The detail and graphics in this game does require a rather robust machine to drive it, but overall it definitely has my recommendation."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best First Person Shooter to have if you only have one","review":"While there are many improved FPS games out there that are improved in graphics and complexity, this is the one game you should learn to be good at before you ever move on to online or other, more difficult First Person Shooter or multi-player combat games. This one will make a gamer combat veteran out of you and give you the eye, the reflexes and raise you to a level of competance you'll need for the games you'll move on to. I get this \\"old\\" game out every few months, just to remind myself of HOW to game, using all the basics. Best first time FPS made, in my book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Give me more","review":"Is this 10 times better than MOH? No, actually, it's quite similar but with better graphics and sound. Great fun to play, as was MOH. I appreciate the attempt to get real but I have to admit that Wolfenstein was better with more interesting things going on and a lot of variety. This game is over very quickly. It feels like an expansion pack. I also don't feel very comfortable with skipping around from American, English and Russian. I guess it is an attempt to sell everywhere, but I prefer to stick with a character. I like the increased squad level combat. All in all a great game but too short. I hope the inevitable expansion pack (how many missions would that be?) comes out soon."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent","review":"This just might be the FPS world's crown Jewel.Gameplay is immaculate, and the graphics and sound are supurb. My ONLY gripe is how quickly I beat it. In a year when this game and Far Cry have graced my PC, my computer feels well taken care of.Thanks, Activision. Thanks, Infinity Ward. You have made a masterpiece.On to the expansion.."},{"rating":"2","title":"Call of Duty is the future of WWII Gaming!","review":"Call of Duty is now the best WWII FPS out there! I am playing Call of Duty on an Alienware Gaming PC and it runs awesome! Now, I know most of you guys think that Call of Duty is so short. Well, it's only short if you play on the easiest difficulty and play 24/7. I mostly play on the weekends. And hey, I play on the second to hardest difficulty and I'm not even finished with the 1st Campaign yet! But, overall Call of Duty is awesome. This is a MUST for WWII FPS gamers!"},{"rating":"2","title":"What a blast!","review":"I have really enjoyed this game. I bought a copy for a buddy at work and he loves it too. It's got a good script and rewards careful strategy. On the most difficult level there are no health packs available, so it really makes you think about what you're doing. The Russian campaign is my favorite. I highly recommend this game to anyone who enjoys first person military shooters."},{"rating":"1","title":"A book and it\`s Cover","review":"The content of this book is up to the author\`s usual standard - excellent; so why the awful rating? This edition is almost unreadable. the type is almost smudged, the paper quality is of the cheapest imaginable. The binding makes it impossible to open the book to a comfortable position without cracking the spine. As a product it is not worth 10% of what I paid for it.

But these veterans of the jazz scene have teamed up to form a powerful piano/bass duo. The resulting recording is a gem from an unlikely location (although those in the know will recognize Potsdam, NY as the home of the renowned Crane School of Music).From the start, I was enthralled by the music they make together. I couldn't get enough of it so I began listening to the CD at work and found that my colleagues would linger in my office to hear a bit more of it. The combination of jazz standards and original compositions on the CD works very well. The two artists complement each other wonderfully.Although the hail from the cold \\"North Country,\\" their album is hot!"},{"rating":"2","title":"6 curry asst.","review":"this curry assortment is a great way to sample different curries at a very affordable price and curry pastes are a very quick and easy way to spice up almost any dish!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice Variety Great CD!!!","review":"This cd was really good! there is a nice variety so that basically anyone can listen to it.the best songs were- BACKSTREET BOYS'\\"All I Have To Give\\" and IMAJIN's \\"Shorty\\"!"},{"rating":"1","title":"This made even my life look interesting.","review":"Russian woman marries into wealthy and powerful Italian family and raises a family.

Mostly it got my attention because it incorporates music from various of John Adams' orchestral compositions. Now that I have sat through this bland drama, I am shocked that the composer consented to this appropriation. And the torrent of praise given this film, from even our most insightful professional critics, confirms simply that a tale about a woman who feels trapped but escapes in the end will milk, without fail, any faux-progressive's heart (like auditing coursework from a women's studies program). This is basically a second-rate revival of Tilda Swinton's early feminist film \\"Orlando\\" in a rather different era and with much less subtlety. The cinematography aspires toward epic luxury but basically conveys a lazy, digital aesthetic with awkward coverage shots and uninventive tracking shots. As a low-budget film, \\"I Am Love\\" needn't have bothered trying to look like a vintage studio picture, admitting \\"I Am Not.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"God! Help Us!","review":"I did not see this movie on DVD but saw it when it first opened in the local art house. As always, when confronted by films such as this, I am puzzled by the willingness of some to put up with the pretensiousness these writer/directors' inflict. Many of the reviews here tiresomely rave about the beauty of the photography, the first refuge of those desperate to present themselves as a true film aficionado. Well, yes, but their are documentaries that will give you the same vistas. Tilda, God love her, remains the critics' darling but as ever is sexless, opaque and lacking any appeal of any sort. After watching for hours what basically were silly, inane people and the final scenes finally, finally and finally arrived accompanied by that infernal chugging soundtrack, all I could moan was \\"Oh,dear!\\" Ditto, the tediousness of \\"White Material,\\" another pile over which certain critics gushed and fawned with their favorite purple prose."},{"rating":"1","title":"THIS IS NOT THE FULL VERSION !!!!","review":"This was my favorite film of 2010. The DVD however is the edited version. There was a beautiful love scene that was VERY important to the story, and for some reason was cut out of the film. How could they just erase all of that emotion? It was so amazingly shot. I am so pissed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horribly fragmented plot","review":"Just following the sometimes unrelated elements of the plot in this movie was annoying. Things often happened without any setup, basis, or rational reason. It could have been a much better movie if they had just handled the transitions and cut out a lot of the unecessary pieces. I do appreciate the way they allow a woman older than twenty-something to do nude scenes without trying to make her look perfect like the typical American movies do. Without that I'd have given it one star."},{"rating":"2","title":"I love \\"I Am Love\\"","review":"As usual, Tilda Swinton is amazing.

I recently read this to my daughter and some of her friends. They all laughed at the goofy disguises that the witch wears to scare the ghosts.I think it is great that this book counts backwards from ten. It is always useful to teach something in books like this. Yet what I truly appreciate about \\"Ten Timid Ghosts\\" is the good story. Reading is so crucial for kids. It takes a truly gifted artist to absorb them in a story. I commend Mrs. O'Connell for doing just that here.If you want a great book to read to younger kids this Halloween, you need look no further than \\"Ten Timid Ghosts.\\" I recommend this book. At this price, it is a steal."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Halloween book ever!","review":"I have been teaching preschool for 22 years. This is the best Halloween book ever!

With it's hilarious lyrics and good beat, it is very similar to the \\"Rockin' the Suburbs\\" single. Rent-A-Cop is also a hilarious song. I can see the whole concept for the video. Ben Folds in a security guard uniform with faux mustache strolling through a mall, singing this catchy tune. If this song doesn't totally fit every Rent-A-Cop you've ever seen, I'll be surprised. As for the other tracks, \\"Them I Got\\" is a short but swwet cover of a Ray Charles song. Ben admits to not knowing all the words, but definately lends great feeling and enthusiasm to the short tune. Adelaide, is one of my least favorites, but does have some witty lyrics.

It will only come on and get you to the little check points for the stylus then nothing.

It has a unique smell because it contains lanolin. The new jar has no smell whatsoever. The cream is very very thin and does not moisturize well at all. I have to use 3x the amount of the new cream to get barely any effect. I am so disappointed that they changed the formula. DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS GARBAGE!

Like listening to a person who recognizes an interesting idea he doesn't fully understand, when he tries to explain it, the idea is rendered indefensible because he not capable of explaining it. The author introduces a topic, meanders away from it, and then draws conclusions! Because he jumps from one idea to another, he doesn't present cohesive ideas or clearly convey meanings.

I decided that I trusted the panel and didn't pay much more attention to it. A few weeks later I noticed that the blue light (indicates it's working) wasn't lit. Even in direct sunlight outside the panel no longer works. The bad part is, after the panel stopped working it completely drained a new battery.

Of those, four have suffered from this defect, the nosepiece spontaneously snapping after only a few weeks of use. I do not abuse the goggles, nor is the pool water I swim in harsh. I do live in a dry climate (Saudi Arabia), and this may be a contributing factor. Either way, I'd be interested to know if others have encountered the same problem.

I assumed wrong. I was originally very pleased with the unit because of it's light weight and crystal clear sound and would still be thrilled with it ~ if it still worked. Less than 3 months of very light, very tender use and the thing is garbage. The plug split at the seam when I inserted it into the jack so I repaired it with electrical tape.

It is particularly interesting because, without directly confronting alternative views about the resurgence of crypto-Jews in the New World (until near the end of the book), it makes an incontrovertibly persuasive case for their movement into what is now New Mexico and for the longevity of their self-identity and -awareness. The case develops not only because of Hordes's identification of specific individuals and families but also because of close studies of Inquisition records, statistical analyses, genetic investigations, and other approaches that provide a broad, multi-faceted background.

Beautifully illustrated, but ultimately random, unfocused and very very disappointing.

Hurrah!!! i fell in love with the elevenbane back in the summer of '95, and have been stuck ever since, and when i learned of this third installment i couldn't wait to read it, to see what shana, lorryn, and company were up to. a huge credit to the authors for trying a new angle and introducing a whole new set of characters to the sage of the halfbloods. while it did start alittle slow, only really the first two or three chapters, i jumped right in and was quickly sucked deeper into the mysterious world of the elvenlords and the secrets they wanted to stayed hidden. i won't tell the ending, but i will say that the dynamics used on the characters were quite a change, but very welcomed, to breathe new life into them, to really see the dimensions of the characters and the world in which they lived in. kudos!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I wish they'd hurry up and write a fourth one!!!","review":"I loved the first two books in the series and then loved this one just as much!

He doesn't come across well by recorded voice, whereas his DVD's are better at transmitting the essence of presence.It is about \\"practicing presence\\" as the title says. However, he does not go into details about how to teach this to others except through living example. Tolle even makes a joke of the fact that he isn't \\"teaching\\" a method or technique. A classic non-dual evasion of responsibility.Basically, it's an okay set if you know presence (which is scintillating ever-nowness) but even then, why bother?

It was a little slow at times, but it made up for it, with all the mystery going on, within the novel. If you like educating yourself about slavery, and don't mind seeing the\\"real\\", I felt for the slave mother Roxy in the novel, I'm sad that she had to make that type of life changing decison for her, and her son.

I look foward to reading other books, but the infamous Mark Twain."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pudd'nhead Wilson","review":"Another one of Mark Twains mystery's. It starts out with a young slave woman,fearing for her young sons's life,exchanges the light-skinned child with her master's.

So from this a detective sets out on a mystery of reversed identities,a horrible crime and to go with that nobody believes the detective,so it goes into the courtroom."},{"rating":"2","title":"Don't Risk Things So Serious","review":"Pudd'nhead Wilson is a book about a slave named Roxy who does'nt want her baby Chambers to be sent down to the river. So she switches her baby with her masters baby Tom. Since Chambers was so light skined her master couldn't tell the difference. As the two boys grew up together Chambers was the one who protected Tom and was hard working. Tom however, was very rude an selfish. Then finally when the boys were adults everything was fixed. The real Tom got his money and the real Chambers was a slave...I happen to like this book a little because it's interesting to know what happens to two people who have switchd lives for so long. One who has lots of money and the right to do anything when he really is a slave. The other who works twenty-four hours a day with labor in the sun with no rights, when he should have lots of money and live in a nice house. You see things like this don't happen in real life everyday."},{"rating":"2","title":"Puddin' Head is full of fun!","review":"Puddin' Head Wilson, by Mark Twain, is full of fun twists and laughs.

It has very cheesy moments and the very young cast is still finding it's acting legs, but overall it's engrossing at any age.

Another section discusses mapping out a network via GPS & topo maps. Other sections cover types of connectors, how to calculate range/distance, and more.My favorite section is the last couple of chapters which include a review of FCC rules as applicable to 802.11b, as well as tidbits on the various Community Network groups located throughout the US...with web links to boot.Definitely worth the $$, IMHO!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The format is a mess","review":"Please note that the 1 star tha I give is for the kindle version, not the book itself.

If you are even remotely interested in what life and death was really like for the Americans that crewed these \\"Liberator\\" airborne behemoths, you need to read this book. My thanks to the author."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome Account of Young Men At War","review":"Extraordinary account of an ill-fated group of young men at war and the terrible anguish of those at home waiting for their never-to-be return. Should be required reading for young folks today to realise how much was given for them and for many is now all but forgotten."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Benchmark of Literary Power and Skill","review":"This is by-far one of the most moving, engrossing and powerful WarStories I have ever read. When you consider the great research and attention Mr. Childers applied to the Book, it is nothing short of a Milestone. I was GREATLY moved (3) times in the book, on the first combat mission, on the event of the Crew being shot down, and on the postumous discoveries and emotions brought about through research. The power of this book is in that the reader becomes a part of the crew, and literally feels the same emotions, fears and anxieties that the crew of the Black Cat most likely felt. A literary (emotional) equivalent to Saving Private Ryan. But this story uses no Film, only the power of the pen.+"},{"rating":"2","title":"Mourning the Loss - Wings of Morning","review":"I would conservatively estimate that I have read 500 books on WWII, and this would rate in the top three. I cannot recall a book that more completely gripped me from start to finish. Childers' unique \\"first person\\" story telling breathes life into young men that have long passed from this world. Through dialogue that seems very easy to accept as real, he makes us love and respect these true American heroes, and then causes us to feel the loss (albeit a minute fraction) that their families and friends felt almost sixty years ago. I cannot recommend a book more highly, even if you are not a WWII scholar. If you are, it is a MUST read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Research on its finest and a great story","review":"I found the book by coincidence during my last trip to the States and read it on the way back to Germany. I'm a member of a group of researchers doing similar research on WW2 planes and the fates of their crews and this is an excellent example of research plus shaping it into words and finally a book. Back home I contacted Peter Schmoll who is mentioned in the book and talked long to him. Some more details came out after the publishing. This book - like so many other - had to be translated into German so people here also could read it. Later I visited the graves of Noe, Peterson and Farrington at Lorraine Cemetery, St. Avold, France, just an hour from my hometown St. Wendel in Germany, three graves of 10,500 burried there. But now three with a written history behind them. Thanks a lot, Mr. Childers. Your work is much appreciated. Not alone in America."},{"rating":"1","title":"box was a mess and opened","review":"i was very disappointed ... the box was faded and looked as though it had been in water.....colors were all faded.... box was not sealed....... looked as though someone had returned it..... i almost sent it back.... however i did write to you.....

This version of the song must have been recorded when Ritchie Blackmore(lead guitarist) and Ian Gillian(vocals) were feuding. Not a good way to promote Deep Purple. Jethro Tull & Johnny Winter weren't half bad, but Carlos Santana's Black Magic Woman was cut off before the song was done. The credits state the video was made from a DVD.

It's built very well, good quality item. It has a three way switch, so you can turn on only the bulb, or just the leg, or both. The only thing I don't like is that the entire leg doesn't light up, instead just the middle of the calf lights ups. It makes it look like a lower and upper bulb are burnt out."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good but not exact.","review":"The leg is good but not an exact replica. Stockings are not realistic.

It has a three position switch that turns on a small bulb (C7?) in the leg to act as a night light, but we use this sparingly because the leg gets VERY hot.

My LTV-32w6 from Best Buy started intermittently flickering and eventually died after about 3.5 years, which was about $340 per year. I asked Westinghouse for help and they emailed me several suggestions, none of which worked. When I told them their suggestions didn't work, they never replied back. I tried to have it repaired, but the necessary spare parts are no longer made. When I searched the internet and found how many other people had similar problems with this TV and found that Westinghouse ranks with the worst on Consumer Reports brand reliability, I kicked myself for ever falling for the decent price. I have since purchased a Sony."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great for a year -- now no picture","review":"I got an amazing deal on this TV and was quite happy with it at first.

All of the stories in Natasha and Other Stories are connected and narrated by the son of a Russian-Jewish family from 1970s Toronto. The stories of their struggles with wanting a new life. The language is sharp and evocative -- the descriptions vivid and beautiful. And the stories are thought provoking and poignant. My favorite stories are \\"The Strongest Man\\" and \\"Minyan.\\" Reading about this family gave me the impression that David Bezmozgi was writing about his own experiences. It doesn't matter, for this is a brilliant short-story collection that I read in one sitting. I wish I had taken longer to read it and savored the experience. Natasha is going to my re-read pile.

The only complaint is that the screen is impossible to see underwater and very difficult to see in bright sun.

The mode settings are very intuitive but not always the right choice. I find candlelight often works best indoors both at night and in daylight.Again this is an easy to use durable little camera.

I do agree about having problems seeing screen when very sunny out and have order folding screen shade to solve this problem. Another reviewer complained about low light level picture results well I have to say you should have read your instruction manual because it has a low light setting that works great with the aid of a tripod. Besides I have yet to own a pocket digital that rivals all the features and picture quality of this camera and can take the abuse of water and sand.

I'm a subcontractor for a TV cable company and frequently have to cut off locks from closets or pedestals where the cables are kept. This cuts through them surprisingly easily.

The difference in quality over the more expensive brands offered at Home Depot was clear and definite.I highly recommend this bolt cutter if you occasionally need to remove Master locks or similar metal chains.

A locksmith estimated $60 to come over and snip the lock off for me. I turned to Amazon for 'master lock bolt cutters' and found these. Two days later, the huge heavy monster cutters arrived. I stepped outside with them, fully dressed for work in a business suit, got the mouth of the clippers around a piece of the shackle, propped one arm of the cutters against the wall and leaned my weight into the other arm of the covers. Voila! Clipped in one swoop.

Season 6 was full of amazing shows (The Doctor in the Photo was one of the best things ever on TV). And even the end of the season was fascinating in its way, how the romance played out. But this most recent season has been a disaster. The whole thing got simultaneously beyond gooey and they also upped the ick factor with the bodies. Gooey and ick in one fell swoop! And it kept getting more and more hopeless until the completely ridiculous finale. The whole thing is depressing. I can't imagine what would possess anyone to possess this season.(The Eighth season started off depressingly, but the writing has picked back up again!)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Extremely disappointed","review":"If you only care about having the 7th season episodes, then it's fine.

I really didn't like that they changed the location from New Orleans to Flordia. New Orleans has so much more personality and mystery, Flordia has had a million shows filmed and based there and is just not nearly as interesting. The team also fits together better as a group out of N.O. A gypsy, a crazy finder, a chick cop and the spiritual big black man just doesn't make any sense when you drop them into boring old Flordia. It was a bit hard to follow as well, they really tried to pack way too much into one episode (too much explaining history).

The stories are well written, cliff hangers are really heart pounding and best of all, the chemistry among the casts is definitely excellent since season 2 and we can see them grow.The props, yes, corpses, that are in various level of decomposition (often boney), are highly realistic, in fact to the extent of funny. We sometimes watch this show over meals. No appetite was lost.Season 7 is interesting as usual, with a little twist or addition to the casts. The return of various equally 'whacky' interns is also welcome.If I want to 'complain' about this season, it is because of the short season, which is inevitable.I look forward for more seasons to come!I definitely recommend this to everybody, provided they do not get grossed by the excellent props"},{"rating":"2","title":"Bones does It Again","review":"Once again Bones hits a homerun.

It was way too redundant."},{"rating":"1","title":"There are much better books out there on the same topic","review":"If you are looking for a book that can help you create greater emotional impact in your writing, this is NOT the book you're looking for.

If you are looking for specific techniques for creating and amplifying emotion in your fiction, you can not do better than attending David Freeman's ground-breaking course \\"Beyond Structure.\\" If you can't do that, then buy David's book, \\"Creating Emotion in Games: The Craft and Art of Emotioneering (New Riders Games).\\" Yes, it's about creating emotional impact in video games and not the type of fiction most writers aspire to, but don't let that fool you - \\"Creating Emotion in Games\\" is packed full of writing advice, techniques, and frameworks that are invaluable for any writer working in any medium."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not just for screenwriters","review":"I only buy a writing book if I can use it as a reference repeatedly.

He uses well-known examples that make sense. If you are serious about drawing readers into your story and holding them there, get this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Invaluable.

Eye-pressure readings with this spring-loaded toy are quite subjective, needless to say. And note: there are NO optical components, unless you count the 10-cent plastic magnifier card.

Beautifully illustrated, it harks back to the mores and lifestyles of rural Victorian England, and depicts a life close to nature.

The liner notes were very informative and gave insight of the creation of each album.Judging by the fantastic arranging and conducting on these two albums, I cannot believe that Mr. Matthews' career did not take the more successful turn of other arrangers of that period.

The eTrex personal navigator is NOT color, does NOT have maps, and does NOT have a USB connection for your computer. To interface with your computer, you need to order a strange sideways looking cable that connects to a serial port. They have adapters from serial to USB, but the port on the device is not typical. I would suggest buying the device first and then ordering a cable.This is fine for a startup GPS device, specifically for geocaching. It's very simple. All it does is point you to your waypoint, which is great when Google Earth can't get you close enough.

Many versions of it were sold that were not WAAS enabled. You can ask a seller if the system menu has an option to disable/enable WAAS.

The reason I say this is that in the end you will spend less money. The Legend has 8MB of memory and it can take quite a lot of extra maps into its memory. So why not do that first?Otherwise, these little GPS units are the most wonderful things to own. They are incredibly helpful. I took my Legend to Florida with me and it saved me at least half-a-dozen times from making wrong turns that would have put me miles from my goal.

It is easy to use and perfect for the first time GPS user who maybe doesn't want to spend $200-300+ on something they may never end up using. It offers a great introduction to using a GPS and does pretty much what it says - tells you where you've been, where you're at, and where you're going. I owned one for about 5 years before upgrading to the GPSMAP60 CSX, and it served me well through many camping, biking and hiking trips.

It's easy to lay way points, has all the features I thought I'd need and the compass feature was surprizingly helpful. However, as rugged as it seemed, it just stopped working for no reason. I've switched out batteries, but I think my etrex has died. Unfortunatly, I'm in Central America, so it's kinda' hard to take it back to Bass Pro Shop (where I bought mine).I may just have a defective unit, but I would not recommend this product if you are going away to someplace where you cannot return it. Get a more tough unit."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not bad for the price","review":"I bought one of these instruments in 2001.

Good customer service"},{"rating":"2","title":"value for money","review":"If you need a basic GPS receiver, this is it. No complication, no headache. This is very similar to etrext legend, but no stick, no map and no area calculation. But you have a map page where you can view your waypoints and your active track log. Also notice that the box does not contain the PC interface cable. If you need to transfer data to PC, then order it separately, or buy etrex legend (its box contains this cable)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great fun and a great value!!","review":"I purchased this unit to try \\"Geocaching.\\" It was recommended on the geocaching.com website as an inexpensive, entry-level unit. It has fulfilled and exceeded my expectations. It has a very short \\"learning curve.\\" It took me less than 30 min. to initialize the unit, learn how to input a waypoint, and start a \\"GOTO.\\" ( This is the method used to find a location according to GPS coordinates.) Within an hour of opening the package, I found my first Geocache!! I highly recommend this unit to anyone who wants basic GPS capability without all the frills."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"Keep It Simple Smarty\\" applies to this!!","review":"This is a wonderful little unit, compact, light and very easy to use. I have worked with some other GPS units and this one is so simple for the minor simple functions! The unit has the ability to give you time for the time zone you are in, sunrise, sunset and many other functions. I have found this unit to work mainly outside, inside it seems to have troubles picking up the satellites, however if you are using this it is logical to be outdoors. I look forward to getting out on the trails now both hiking and biking, as I can map the trail I take. For someone that wants a simple unit, this is the way to go, as you cant beat the cost. For those that want all the big bells and whistles, keep looking. This unit gives a map of the trail but it is not going to give you every detail of area around you like some of the higher costing units."},{"rating":"2","title":"Buy one... you won't regret it","review":"I bought my Etrex as a gadget, but its now an indispensable part of my travels. It's well designed, functional and inexpensive. Having owned my Etrex for 6 months, I now find uses for it that I never envisaged, for example; finding my way back to a hotel in a strange town at 3 in the morning after a party. Having previously marked the position as we left the hotel, it steered us, effortlessly through a maze of suburban streets, right back to the door. I would point out though, that since it has no 'base map', you really need a programme such as Autoroute to input your desination, if you are going somewhere for the first time. Just jot down the Lat and Longtitude and key them in. A terrific peice of technology."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great introduction to GPS","review":"I have had this model for several years and am now considering upgrading. It does a great job of pointing me in the right direction when I'm headed somewhere new. Good for geocaching, although under heavy tree cover it can be far off the mark. To get the most out of it, you really need to hook it up to a computer so you can download/upload data. For the PC, I recommend ExpertGPS."},{"rating":"2","title":"12 Satellites.","review":"My eTrek is primarily used as a navigational aid when I'm bicycling the poorly signposted roads of Northern Ireland. The signposts are there, of course, hidden behind a corner as you pass them by, or as an indication to a town fifteen miles further on from the town you'd expect to be signposted in the first place. All this turns a long day in the saddle, into a very long day in the saddle. But with the eTrek loaded with waypoints, I simply have to follow the guiding - Go To - pointer, and save myself a lot of hassle.The eTrek hasn't saved my life, as yet, but one's imagination can fill in the blanks. Just remember to carry extra batteries and make sure that your mobile phone is charged :-)"},{"rating":"2","title":"got the geocashe bug","review":"good unit to go geocashen. works well even in deep wooded areas. easy to input waypoints.

I have tried 5-6 different GPS models over the years, and the Garmin Etrex series is the most impressive. They are simple, rugged, and deadly accurate.The only reason that it did not get five stars from me, is that it does not come with a PC interface cable (although compatible), which takes it to the next level.I am not a novice by any means, but this GPS is in my pack, car, or hunting bag every single time that I go out. If it is not my backup, it is my primary unit because of its reliability and simple use."},{"rating":"2","title":"A nice tech toy with limited features.","review":"I bought this device for my brother who likes to hike and fish.

I recently went backpacking in the Big South Fork national recreation area. I set a way point at my car and headed out. I received the weak signal prompt 90% of my hike. I'm glad the trails there are marked well and I didn't have to rely on this unit to get me back to my car.

For runners who are interested in recording time and distance in unfamiliar territory, this little unit yanks my big unit. It'll give you a running total time and distance and, for those who can't do division, an average speed. It will not save split times at waypoints nor measure the distance between waypoints on a saved \\"track.\\" (It only measures straight-line distances betweeen waypoints.) I imagine that the Timex Ironman GPS watch system is a much better choice--but I'll never know because my buget's already broken."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointed with Garmin eTrex GPS","review":"Hands off from this piece of junk!

I didn't realize there was a less expensive alternative out there until I started looking for boots for costuming purposes. My requires were a) inexpensive, b) comfortable, and c) something I could wear in and out of costume. I happened upon Bearpaw and was in love.Some reviewers have said that these run small and their toes hit the front of the boot. I can feel the seam with my toes, but I find that's more of an effect of the plush lining than the size. If I push my foot back where it normally sits, then the size is perfect.I dropped one star simply because I placed an order for the Dream model, but instead I got the Eva model. When I went back to Amazon, I noticed that when I add the item to the cart, it said it was the Eva model.

I couldn't figure out why this was happening since there was plenty of space from where my toes end to the front of the shoe.I then compared the BEARPAW boots to my old UGG boots and noticed that the toe portion of the UGG boot tilts slightly upward and therefore does not cause my foot to slide forward.I'd like to return the BEARPAW boots but I'll lose the $16.00 in shipping costs ($8.20 to ship each direction) and I'll lose the 8% restocking fee!

Pretty much one of those movies I'd already forgotten about within hours of seeing it.

But I (as the owner of a spoiled \\"urban rabbit\\") do not necessarily enjoy that part of the book very much.

This is becouse of the stupid things in this game, for example a man taking shot of a tank and do not dying, or being hit by a cannon and the same thing happens. The game characters are always being hit and can't even notice that, they take shot and keep walking. Archers, cannons and anything that can shoot always hits their targets.

Although the books lacks the gloss and color photographs found in some other books, this book is probably much more useful for the cost. Comprehensive and detailed, the book covers every major topic in photography from choosing equipment to techniques in creative photography.Both an ideal beginners and a reference for serious amateurs, this book is designed read before and after a photography session rather than something to be carried in the camera bag.It should be noted that this book makes an excellent companion to The New 35mm Photographer's Handbook by Julian Calder and John Garrett (ISBN 0609804227). After reading the Grimm's book, the Handbook makes a great carry-along reference for in the field."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great first step!","review":"This book is worth a few times its price for the information you get out of it. I bought my copy to give me an edge in an Introduction to Photography class I was taking at college in 2002, and I learned more from the book than I did from the class. In fact, I ended up with the highest final exam score the instructor had ever gotten in that class - mostly because of this book.I recommend this book to beginners. It will take you most of the way to becoming an intermediate level photographer if you study it well. You of course must also practice, but it's a great introduction to the core basics. If you're serious about photography, this will be the (one of the) first of many books you read; not because this one is lacking, but because it's aimed at beginners.For what it aims to do, it does a very good job, and is well worth the surprisingly low price. See other reviews for more specifics about what's inside."},{"rating":"2","title":"An encyclopedic overview of the basics","review":"If you want a general introduction to photography, this book is excellent. I'm a novice photographer, and the Grimms' prose is so clear and their presentation so logical that even I can follow along easily. They assume no prior knowledge of photography, and step by step they walk you through all the fundmentals: how different cameras work, the difference between rangefinders and SLRs, different types of lenses, light, composition, etc. The material is presented logically and basic concepts are explained fully.Some readers have criticized the authors' desire to cover so much ground, but it seems to me that a broad scope is appropriate for a general reference work. If you want more in-depth treatment of a specific topic, e.g., travel photography, buy a different book.The lack of color photos is disappointing, but that may have been an editorial decision made in an effort to keep the price down.In general, an excellent reference work."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great intro to photography","review":"After doing photography my whole life with a point and shoot camera I finally bought a \\"real\\" camera. A Canon SLR that I had no idea how to use. So after a lot of research at the bookstore I settled on this book, and I am very happy I did. It teaches a beginner all the different important functions on your camera that you need to learn and why you need to know it. This book is very concise and detailed. All the functions on my camera are explained in detail in this book. If you have a new SLR that you don't know how to use I highly recommend this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad book - way too much text, few pictures","review":"Avoid this book. It is way too verbose and has relatively few pictures and illustrations (and the few that there are, are in B&W not color). The Kodak educational photography series is MUCH better; Kodak publishes books for the amateur as well as professional. There are other books as well. Definitely skip this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best used as a reference, not as an instructional aid.","review":"I was given this book as a present, and it has remained part of my library. But, for those looking for a book on actual photography instruction, this may not be the book for you. The book contains a lot of basic information about a lot of different topics and it explains things like the difference between 100 and 400 speed film very clearly. Most of the sections may not have been updated since they were originally written (including the pictures!) but new sections have been added as technology has advanced (including digital cameras).If you just want to know generally what exists and the basics of how it works, this is still a good book. But if you are looking for a book that will teach you about the photography while helping you produce more creative and higher quality work , the book comes up short."},{"rating":"2","title":"The photography textbook","review":"I give it four stars instead of 5 because it is not a book for everyone. It will not show you how to be a great photographer, nor will it step-by-step for dummies teach you to compose pictures. It will, however, educate you on the details and basics of photography.I've used a lot of point and clicks, and I've used several SLRs. All in all, even with today's set it and forget it cameras, you can take a good picture but you can't take a great photograph without knowing the technicals of what's going on behind the lens.Start here if you are patient and want to learn what photography is all about."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good intro","review":"This is a great book for those who know nothing about photography outside of \\"you stick film in here and you press this button.\\" The book was logically organized and flow logically."},{"rating":"1","title":"Barely adequate and incomplete","review":"This publication features vague descriptions of photo concepts that makes it useless for reference. Possibly good for beginners, but if you are even an amateur photographer, you need a book that describes more in depth about filters, push processing, lenses, and chemicals. I was slightly disappointed and am still looking for a good reference book. For now, I am just googling concepts that I am trying to research. Works better than this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not really for digital shooters","review":"I picked this up looking for a back-to-basics book only to find that the book doesn't really talk to a modern audience. It's very film-centric in ways that may not help people dealing with the very different choices offered by digital cameras -- that is, it's not going to give you much guidance for either taking digital snapshots or using more advanced technical controls. This really is a book from the early '90s with a 21st century gloss on it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for beginners!","review":"This book is well written and thoroughly explains the fundamentals of photography.

Ms. Armstrong wants us to believe that millions of Christians and Jews who lived in the Middle East prior to 700 A.D. converted to Islam because of its merits rather than the armies of Mohammed and his successors.However, when Christian monarchs swept through the Middle East fighting to reclaim territory it was an historical crime. Real peace means acknowledging the Muslim world's narcissistic claim that, they and only they, have the Divine Right to Rule under their Perfect religion.Try reading Jihad by Paul Fregosi for a dose of reality."},{"rating":"2","title":"Easy but very informative reading","review":"Armstrong's style of writing is very enjoyable. Unlike any other historical, academic or theological texts that I have read, This work by Armstrong exceed other writers, in that once you start reading it, you just can't put it away for long until you finished reading through the last chapter. I finished it in less than a week, it was very enjoyable reading.About it's content, Armstrong is very fair in explaining the crusades from the Christian, Jewish and Islamic viewpoints. Her narration shows that she is not siding with any particular religion or belef, she managed to give fair insight to all sides involved. This is a truly good history book.As a Muslim reader, she has my highest apreciation."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's all about perspective","review":"I agree with some of the other reviewers that Karen Armstrong ignores the earlier wave of Islamic conquest in North Africa and the Levant. While not a dispassionate history, the strength of Ms. Armstrong's work is in its ability to illuminate a different historical perspective to western audiences, most of whom know very little about the Muslim perspective. This is particularly important; the average Muslim, Arab or otherwise, does view recent history as yet another western incursion, and it's important to understand this. By all means read more about the history of Islam, and read too about the Balfour declaration and the British role in early 20th century Palestine. It's important to know more about all these things. Still, Ms. Armstrong has done an excellent job of illuminating the Muslim perspective, and it is for this that 'Holy War' is most valuable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Armstrong","review":"Enjoyable reading, concise, and direct. I forgot to mention informative. I have read four other books and each I treasure."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bored to tears","review":"An incredibly boring book. I read 339 of the 539 pages hoping all the time that it would get better, but it just doesn't. The book also shows a bias to the Muslim side of the arguments. There are some interesting facts in this book and if it had been written in say 250 pages instead of 539, it might have made for good reading. Sorry Karen, but it only deserves one star."},{"rating":"1","title":"Facts and Bias","review":"I only made it through about half the book before I gave up. It is remarkably unpalatable and stunningly biased. After giving up, I wanted to see some of the amazon reviews, many of which I found echo my conclusion that Ms. Armstrong is an apologist of Islam. Nothing wrong with that, but she should be very clear about it and not present the book as a balanced history."},{"rating":"1","title":"Typical Armstrong","review":"The saddest part is that pc colleges will probably put this book on their course, and gullible students who know next to nothing about history will walk away believing that the Crusades are the source of all the woe in the Middle East. Most amazing is the tone and adjectives used: when talking about the Muslim conquests which began nearly 500 years BEFORE the Crusades, and which annexed so many formerly Christian lands, including Jeruslamem, her tone is very upbeat, almost as if to say \\"Allah willed it.\\" When, on the other hand, talking about the Crusades--which were simply a belated response to centuries of Muslim aggression--woe, all is woe! What a massive axe this former nun has to grind!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Are you kidding Armstrong?","review":"I would not have read this book if it wasn't for class. While the author does clearly state her thesis (multiple times), she does clearly make the connection between the Crusades and modern history. As a former-nun, she is very anti-Christian at the moment which impacts her ability to have a triple-vision, and is VERY biased towards the Muslims."},{"rating":"2","title":"Prejudiced reviews","review":"I have noticed that many who review karen armstrong's book & this one in specific, generally expect a complete christian victory & anything that balances the view is considered biased & untrue.It is not a matter of who invaded the other first but what practices did the invader indulge in. Neither Islam nor Christianity condone invasions so we are dealing with a profane subject, a human trait not a religious one. Europeans simply used religion in their invasion of the levant & started a 2 century conflict that does resonate till today in the middle eastern pysche, though it should move on from that point, but obviously there are readers who are displeased to read that during the crusades the muslims were actually more civil than the christians. facts are hard sometimes & some cannot handle it, like some muslims today who think they are right on everything. karen Armstrong always writes with eloquence & clarity, her writings till now are very balanced no matter what some may say."},{"rating":"1","title":"Read the \\"tunnel vision\\" review - I couldn't have said it better.","review":"I was looking for an unbiased factual account of the crusades, and I definitely did not find it in this book. At first, I found myself thinking that the anti-western bias must be my imagination due to my western heritage. However, the anti-western slant became so blatent that I found it impossible to continue reading this book due to the author's wreckless disregard for simply stating fact without bias. I too give it one star for it's only saving grace - the extensive list of references."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great buy for David Beckham fans!!","review":"This is a really interesting look at the years that David Beckham has spent at Man U.

The plot is good and characters great"},{"rating":"2","title":"Continued Briliance","review":"Keith Ablow continues to amaze me, every time I pick up on eof his novels I have to fight myself put them down. Frank Clevenger is one of fictions greatest heros. Ablow has created a character you can feel and connect with. With a plot that grabs you out of the gate Psychopath and keeps you glues to the pages. I anxiously await whatever masterful work that Ablow writes next everytime I finish one of his current masterworks."},{"rating":"2","title":"I Thought Crime Books Were Boring....","review":"That is, until I read this book. What makes Psychopath so engaging is the struggle that the killer has within himself. He is a psychiatrist with a real gift for healing and yet he can't find the strength to battle his own destructive demons. Whereas most crime books and films seem to paint the protagonist and antagonists in stark blacks and whites, this book really makes an effort to show the shades of gray within the two main characters."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a Waste~","review":"This book was such a disappointment! It starts off really slow - and then it picks up and gets interesting but the ending really stinks big time. If you can - read the very last page and judge for yourself. I do not understand why so many readers really enjoyed his writing. This is definitely not Grisham."},{"rating":"2","title":"exciting story","review":"Psychopath is an exciting book. I usually don't read novels that often but this psychological thriller is really spellbinding. It is a shocking tale but since BTK used to live right amongst us it could be true and that makes it even more thrilling. Psychiatrist Dr. Jonah Wrens (The Psychopath) uses his knowledge of the human nature in an intriguing way. Knowledge of human nature: The Germans use the word \\"Menschenkenntnis\\" to describe this gift. Since Wrens is not only a psychiatrist but also a psychopath he manipulates his victims flawlessly, it is almost an art. However, he cannot see his own mental illness. Great novel! 4 out of 5 stars; because I was not totally satisfied with the ending."},{"rating":"2","title":"New to Psych Books","review":"This book is truly intriguing. I have never been an avid psychological thriller reader, but Ablow crafts his characters with such intensity that you find yourself identifying with both the serial killer and the man out to find him. Jonah Wrens (the killer) is more fascinating than Hannibal Lector in the movie Silence of the Lambs (I admittingly have yet to read the novel). He's an unpredictable killer and yet also a gifted healer. The dichotomy of his character leaves you almost sympathizing with him until he kills another innocent victim. Yet Ablow gives Clevenger, the protagonist, real problems of his own, as if to discourage the reader from cheering for him. I have been the Ablow's website ...and plan on reading his other novels - Ablow has converted me to a mystery reader!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of Time","review":"This pathetic book is one cliche after another, dressed up in a bunch of psychiatric mumbo jumbo. The plot is highly unlikeley: a psychopathic serial killer engaged in a dialog in the New York Times with another shrink, who is working with the FBI to nab the killer. Once the plot is underway, you know exactly where it is going to go. There are no surprises here. No suspense. No organic plot development -- the author, when he senses that he needs to end the novel, just plunks down a few convenient coincidences and rushes to the conclusion. The characters are cardboard, although the author tries to make you believe that he is developing them -- giving them dimension, when all he's doing is putting fancy clothes on manniquins. And of course, the serial killer is a Christian religious nut (that seems to be a favored cliche these days). And the ending is simply silly. Save your money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Derivative but individual","review":"There are other psychiatrist protagonists, but this entry finds the hero becoming his own man, not just his own bad habits. Well done."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not impressed","review":"I can't agree with the positive reviews here. This author doesn't thrill me. I'll stick with Lashner, Grippando, and Katzenbach."},{"rating":"2","title":"Right path.","review":"While there were a few flaws or weaknesses this time - some letters fictionally published in the \\"New York Times\\" contained language that I doubt the Times would have accepted under any circumstances, as well as a disappointing lack of character development of supporting character North Anderson - this novel still emerged as my favorite thriller so far this year (with Lee Child maintaining a close second). As other reviewers have noted, forensic psychiatrist Frank Clevenger seems to have quelled many of his personal demons this outing. Just in time to meet up with a character who may prove to be his opposite number. After this, what remains? One could only fantasize of having Ablow & Harris team-up and allow Clevenger & Lector to cross paths."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ablow Rocks!","review":"Ablow is one of the most prolific serial killer writers on the market today. His expertise in the field of forensic psychology is meticulously expressed in his writing. Most of the characters (both the protagonists and antagonists) are case studies in and of themselves. I highly recommend Ablow for the serial killer connoisseur.

This version is re-mastered in a way that reduces surface noise, but, at the same time, removes much of the pianists' tone quality that comes through so well on the original LP release, as well as the more expensive set. Also, this album is lacking the documentation of recording dates that the LP and 'The Complete Rachmaninoff' provide. For the neophyte, the re-mastering reduces the magic of Rachmaninoff's tone. I would expect the connoisseur to be even more disappointed. There are bargains out there, but for this album, you get what you pay for."},{"rating":"1","title":"not what I expected","review":"This appears to be a very comprehensive box set, however, it isn't what I expected. The sound quality is poor. This is understandable since the original recordings were done many decades ago, but still not very nice to listen to. And the recordings are not in any recognizable order, a little Chopin here, a little Rachmaninoff there, a little Debussy, a little more Chopin...

This vacuum is of an old reliable design and will most likely last us for decades. It is no more expensive than our Electrolux we just threw away because 100% of it was plastic.

You won't find a wealth of script snipplets. If you want that, get them off the net. This book is a serious reference manual to help you learn the theory behind JS. When it all boils down, clipping scripts out of books (or off the web) can only take you so far. This book will can give you what you need to CREATE, not just snip & clip.

It contains the best coverage of the browser's hierarchy and object implementation in Javascript that I've seen in any book. Unfortunately, almost half of the book contains reference material that I rarely use.Overall, this book is comprehensive and well organized."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good programming tips, lacks key examples","review":"Although overall a good book, sometimes the lack of examples is very problematic. For example, section 12.2.4 (Javascript in URL's) does not give a single example that shows the URL script inside an href HTML tag. If somebody was not already familiar with this, they may find the context very confusing.Another example is the reference entry for the 'window.onerror' command. The odd syntax of this command almost demands examples. I did not know that the handler function reference was not suppose to have parenthesis around it until I looked it up in a different book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not good for beginner!!!","review":"This book is not for beginners. If you try to learn JavaScript from scratch, this is not the book for you.Try others. I only have little knowledge of JavaScript, I can not understand what this book try to convey. Lengthy description without good examples. It tells you a lot of things you don't need to know.The author likes to compare C/C++/CGI.. in this book in order to illustrate something I don't even care. Those readers who gave five stars to this book have already have great knowledge of JavaScript before they read this book (they forgot to mention that to you) or they are just genius. The only thing I find it useful is the reference."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very useful, a little on the technical side","review":"I purchased this book as a total novice to JavaScript. While it is very well written and delves into the the meaty issues of JS, it is not necessarily to the most friendly book for beginners. If you have the time for a comprehensive approach in learning JavaScript then this book is worth the investment. But if you are looking for a book that will get you started right away with practical examples that teach you by practice and not just theory, then you might want to look elsewhere, and come back to this book when you are a little more experienced. Every serious web developer should pick up a copy."},{"rating":"2","title":"A professional reference","review":"This is not where you want to start when learning JavaScript, but if you're a professional developer, this is the best reference you could have.

You know, the kind that lists the objects, then their properties and has a good index. At first glance this book appears to fill the bill, but after using it for some time I find myself going back to Goodman's \\"Javascript Bible\\". There is something half-baked in the organization of this book that makes it hard to find anything when I'm looking for it.

I knocked it down to 4 stars because of the lack of examples. The text is really good - you just have to already know what you're looking for.For those of you programmers out there, this text fits into the \\"programmer's reference\\" toolkit more so than a \\"teach yourself\\" type guide. If you're familiar with c/c++/java, you know that you generally buy one type of book to learn patterns, principles, and language constructs, and another book that is simply a language reference.

The book is great for reference. However, if you're new to Javascript, this is not the book for you. The author explains concepts in abstract detail. Then, he either doesn't give an example, or his examples are so arcane (i.e., trigonometry or some other obscure math example) that it doesn't clarify the concept he is trying to present. I hope O'Reilly realizes it's missing a marketing opportunity.

Nothing like a Javanese Rhino to make me whip a book off the shelf.

Chapter after chapter of detailed (and sometimes over-complicated) English explanantions would be more interesting with visual examples (like the Visual Quickstart guides, for example).

My review is to share my view on the overall value and worth of watching this movie - none. While the story is somewhat ok, its definitely a made for TV movie, think Lifetime and all its bland lackluster boringness. This is no different. There a certain sheen lacking from made for TV movies; they lack production value pop, acting intrigue and all the other elements that separate the good movies from average movies. While some folks might enjoy this movie, its a relative question to me - there are thousands of movies out there, so why spend your time on a clearly inferior one?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Even worse than the other David DeCoteau films","review":"I've basically discovered David DeCoteau films are like PG rated man eye candy, with a bit of homoeroticism thrown in. \\"Killer Bash\\" has better production values than the other films of his I've seen, but the plot is SOO slow. It misses the major cheese/camp factor of the other films, and that factor is what makes the others films at least watchable. Check outVoodoo AcademyorThe Frightening. The mom in the latter is far scarier than anything you'll find in \\"Killer Bash.\\"To give you an idea of how slowly paced this movie is, the main character looks at a stack of yearbooks and it takes her over five seconds to run her fingers down the sequentially yeared books to find the 1975 volume. Rub your finger on something for five seconds: it's a LONG time, especially to point at a book that's in its proper order."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great show, great extras, poor video quality","review":"As everybody should know already, this is a great show that really deserves to be finally released on DVD. It's great fun to watch and wakes feelings of nostalgia.The extras are quite nice, too. You get a half hour documentary with all members of the cast (except Melanie Chartoff, sadly) and the producers. Then there's audio commentaries for selected episodes, also with cast members, producers and directors. It's really interesting to watch and listen to.There's only one disappointment with this release: The picture quality is very bad. There is a lot of blur, grain and sometimes even vertical lines. ALF and Full House, for example, have much better video quality on their DVD releases - and those shows were video taped, Parker Lewis was filmed on 16mm.In conclusion it's still a great release - but only 4 stars because of bad video quality."},{"rating":"2","title":"can make you feel old and young at the same time.","review":"While I am watching this, I am struck by how the show reflected the hope of the early 1990s, that in that decade the page would be turned to a better era, but it all ended up with Monica Lewinsky, the Spice Girls, apathy, and lethargy. I can hear Corin Nemec doing a voice-over saying this in my mind. Then I think about how the show lost its edge a couple years later, and I would think \\"whatever\\" about the ones after Parker changed his hairstyle and the fun stuff was taken out of the show. And then I think of when this show first came on, and it was such a zinger that really was fun and expressive, which is never easy to come by. It's so thrilling that this has finally arrived.

The only problem and it is a BIG problem is the quality of transfer to DVD. It stinks, I had old copies of the show I had made on VHS while it was on TV and the quality of those after all these years of fading is about the same or better than the DVD quality. When I first tried to watch it I thought my DVD player or TV was messed up, it was that bad. The worst part of the movie are the times when they froze the image and continue on with the talking or audio, at those points you really see how bad the transfer was... frankly I would suggest passing on this one because of quality of the transfer alone.

Starting the day with a children's parade, enjoying pizza and popcorn, buying tickets for a raffle, then enjoying carnival activities, face painting, balloons, and finally ending the day with a barbecue, and concert under the stars with fireworks finale, the family has a wonderful time celebrating Independence Day. The illustrations are a little hazy, very nostalgic and timeless, with colors that depict the warmth and fun of the day. Any child who has ever attended a city park 4th of July celebration will recognize the activities depicted here. The text is short and simple enough to be included in a patriotic themed storytime for preschoolers. This will be a great addition to a holiday collection for which not that many books for children have been written."},{"rating":"1","title":"What the hell is this?

Recommend to property management personnel."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good book","review":"This book is helpful and instructive for what its purpose is used for. I would say it is slightly technical and was somewhat hard for me to read, but for the subject I would not complain about being too over my head.

It is being used to suppliment another class I am now taking."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Textbook Ever!","review":"This is the worst textbook ever published. The content is not addressed in a clear manner, the calcuations are poorly discussed, if at all, and not even accurate sometimes. The questions often cover differing chapters than their location and most disturbing is the lack of accuracy!!! The book wasn't even spell-checked, let alone read for consistancy and accuracy! It is thoughtless to use this as a textbook ... it's more of a guessing game than information."},{"rating":"1","title":"look elswhere","review":"I purchased this printer for the primary objective of printing retail sales labels.The paper is fed into the machine by one larger roller.

The recipes are light and often require minimal prep and cooking time. The menu for Weeknight Wonders on Page 13 is so helpful and gives some great tips for busy people that don't have a ton of time to prepare full meals. For example, using leftovers to create a meal on another night, such as using leftover fish, pork or chicken to make a salad or pasta. I love the Iced Lemonade with Vodka and Mint - it's perfect in the warm Florida summer! The main dish recipes in this book are the best out of the whole thing from the grilled grouper with jalapeno butter, lemon caper shrimp with orzo, and Moroccan meatballs to the braised lamb shanks (these fall off the bone!)and the weeknight chicken enchiladas. You gotta love the banana dippers for dessert - this is so much fun to do with kids on a summer afternoon.

Though I found the plastic coating beneficial during a rain shower, the map was of limited value. Because of its size, street names were often illegible.

Technical jargon was thrown around to make things seem accurate, but was horribly abused. People familiar with TRON will recognize the idea of throwing around viruses as though they were balls.The writing style was childish and often full of word abuse, as has been noted by other reviewers. The characters are undeveloped and all the good guys think and act exactly the same: buck the establishment investigators who make lots of really good guesses. Deus ex machina to the extreme.The amount of belief that must be suspended, especially by someone remotely familiar with modern computers, goes far beyond my tolerance for something that is supposed to take place within the decade.If you want to read some high-tech fiction, read Neal Stephenson. He requires suspension of some belief, but writes much better and has characters with depth."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Gibson ripoff","review":"This book takes what made Neuromancer unique and turns it into cheap suspense. Its technical information is inaccurate, and by trying to stylize \\"cyberspace,\\" it creates a mess of illusion and reality intertwined around a predictable logical path. For all of its bluster about warning us of the dangers of cyberterror, it gives a simplistic view of the situation. As a suspense novel, it is not terrible, with a reasonably compelling character, but between the plot holes and predictability, it is about as suspenseful as reading The Congressional Record. Read Neuromancer instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good solid read with lots of action and suspense","review":"Good plot and a fast moving storyline that is sure to provide terrorists with plenty of new targets to think about. An equal mix of adrenaline and testosterone that feels like a season script for the TV show \\"24\\" - or maybe a Bruce Willis miniseries.The writing is solid but the author has the annoying habit of referring to the September 11 / World Trade Center attacks so many times (nearly every other page in the first 50 pages - and much more towards the end), that this reader got tired of it. It is as if he keeps doing a George W. Bush impression-repeating Sept. 11 as a Mantra, trying unsuccessfully to push emotional buttons without reason-and looking stupid because of it.Not my favorite book by Peneiro, but a good solid read with lots of action and suspense."},{"rating":"1","title":"Patrician II - CD Rom","review":"Hello Out There:If you have a job and work for a living this game is not for you.

This particular book is not more than a collection of black & white news clippings from various newspapers around the world. Quality of the print is acceptable (not excellent) and there are no coloured images. Although the information is interesting, you read the same stories 100 times again because many newspapers apparently wrote the same things about Delorean. Being somewhat disapppointed, I looked at Wikipedia and within minutes found the information and facts I needed, clearly written, not repetitive and without having to pay for it. This is not a bad book, I just think the description on Amazon is not clear enough. Probably a good book for someone who already owns a DeLorean and wants to complete his collection of DeLorean books."},{"rating":"2","title":"Winterberry deep soup bowls; Amazon verified purchase","review":"I was so delighted to get these bowls as we just added the 8th member to our family.

It won the award in 2003. It is written by an author that really knows how to tell a story. The story spans 4 decades of time and is located mostly in Kenya, but switches back regularly to present-day Canada near Lake Ontario. Vikram Lall is a character that you will never forget. Born to Indian parents in African Kenya, we see his life as it unfolds around all the political turmoil in this former British colony. But there is so much moe than politics in Kenya in this book. We actually see how a man can grow from a rather studious boy to one of the most powerful financial figures in the politically corrupt Kenya of the 70's and 80's. It is a remarkable story that captivated me from the first page. It is so well written and the characters so clearly defined that it was like actually stepping back into the settings and to the times. I loved this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"old style baroque","review":"It is enjoyable to hear good performances of music now played \\"authentically\\", but in an earlier style.

The book was too confusing because the events in the book changed a lot and it was hard for me to remember the names and the time. Since I haven't learned much about the history of America I find this book boring. I'm not an American, so I only learned part of its history. The author's writing is like she is telling a story about Benedict Arnold, so she didn't really say that Benedict Arnold was a bad guy or anything like that. One good part about this book is that it tells the events in order like from when Benedict was a child to when he died. So that wasn't too confusing. I know some books that had all the events mixed up. If you like books about history and heroes in the past then I suggest you read this book. I suggest you read this book because Jean Fritz is a pretty good writer, and she wrote many good books."},{"rating":"2","title":"16-Feb-97","review":"This book was great! It tells all about Benidict Arnold. He is a VERY interesting boy. If you really like reading about Revolutionary Heros, then this is a good book to read. Of course you might not be able to call him a hero when you find out what happens at the end. This book tells all about Benidict, before, after, and during the war. Even if you don't like reading non-fiction, you will now. For instance, did you know that Benidict was obsessed with shoes? Or that he killed his own horse because he didn't want to give it to the British? Or that the woman he married was involved in a terrible scandal? Well, if this sound intriguing...

The information inside is not innovative, you can obtain from any basic knitting book out there. Historically, not much present, so why did they print it, who knows.Buy an older edition if you must have this, save yourself some money, you aren't gaining anything by buying this new book other than a fresh looking soft cover.

The description here is also inaccurate on the weight, it's more like 1.4lbs for the pair I assume, I didn't weigh the poles or check other sources.I returned these, Amazon refunded me for shipping the item back via customer service.

If anybody gets bored with this (only 45 mins. in any case), well, you may not be suited for documentaries. The buddhas statues in Thailand, the monkeys in Borneo, the amazing trees in many places, the canyons, the crystal-ice... There's much more to be thankful for than to be angry with.

It provides no new information."},{"rating":"2","title":"Only a starting step for learning the UNIX operating system.","review":"This book is only a tiny part of your very first step to learning the UNIX system for the first time. Although it covers some very important basics of UNIX, it sure is not even close to being a source enough for a complete start to UNIX. This book is not intended for that, therefore if you are someone who would like to have a detailed start to UNIX, buy another book.It starts with some general information about UNIX and proceeds to teach how to log in and out, but covers only the most basic commands. There is too much general information which is more suitable for people who are not familiar with operating systems at all. It doesn't cover any commands for the editors in UNIX, which means you will have to purchase another book. It has around 7 chapters, which could be covered in 2 if you take out all the unnecessary text. It certainly is not suitable for a programmer wishing to get into UNIX fast and complete."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not feeling this album...............","review":"Although fairly new to Grime, I do know what good music is and this isn't a good effort.

Some of the arrangements also sounds a little Karaoke, perhaps because of the INDIE Label, not a major Label. But Diana herself sounds GREAT. AMAZON on the other hand, took forever to deliver this item. At the time I brought it it was only an import.

I am not sure what people were expecting from Diana. This album is exactly what it is packaged as. A love letter..... It is not an upbeat,pop,r&b,disco confection. Instead you get a very laid back, insightful, sweet, relaxing, sexy,romantic album of songs. I think Dianas fans wanted her to return with a monster pop/r&B album. Well, this isn't it. Instead you get a very nice cover album by one of the most incredible ladies in the music industry. Cheers to Diana for creating yet another great listen......

Diana's voice as we once knew it, is gone. She sings mainly from her lower register now, and all of the power in her voice has disappeared. She needs to give up her pride and get serious with a vocal coach, or just give it up altogether. The batch of songs on here don't make any kind of impression, with the exception of Marvin Gaye's \\"I Want You\\" - the only track that evokes the seductive spirit that Ross is known for. I don't know how this project was put together, but I doubt Ross ever spent time in the studio with the musicians who play on the tracks. A couple of the songs sound like they were recorded in the wrong key. The only way this work will sell, will be if she pulls off a remarkable performance of one of the songs on one of her many personal appearances next week in TV Land. I doubt the CD will even break into the 200 Album Chart. Sorry D."},{"rating":"1","title":"When She Was Good She Was Very Good, And When She Was Bad She Was Horrid","review":"....and she's bad here!Diana Ross hasn't put out a consistently good recording since \\"The Boss\\" and the Chic produced \\"Diana\\". She was always at her best when under the helm of strong producers such as Holland - Dozier - Holland (from her Supremes years), Ashford & Simpson, and the one time collaboration with Bernard Edwards and Nile Rogers. They seemed to know how to bring out her strong points and to minimize her weak ones.When she takes more control of one of her projects - watch out! She doesn't do herself justice. Instead its usually an embarrassment, as is the case here.With the long string of substandard recordings she's issued since \\"Diana\\", it doesn't seem likely she'll return to her glory days. But, others (Bettye Lavette, Candi Staton, etc.) have, so maybe there's still a good recording left in her some where."},{"rating":"1","title":"i love you by Diana ross","review":"never one of my favorite female singers, however in this time of everyone coming out of the closet doing standards I thought this would be more enjoyable.

I even rode with her through the RCA years. I have purchased every CD/album she has ever done and I must say I am now to the point of finally giving up. Miss Ross obviously expects us to lower our standards and expectations of what a singer should be, which I refuse to do since I know the talent is there somewhere. She has drifted to the point of being in the no talent M Carey club and expects this to be enough. Who would have thought after waiting all this time she would give us something like this. All of the little pop favorites just don't seem to do it. What a terrible selection of songs, especially \\"Crazy Little Thing Called Love\\" which I think they may have forgotten to put on her \\"Eaten Alive\\" album.Well, maybe in another 7 years."},{"rating":"1","title":"good but not great","review":"Can \\"Miss Ross\\" let someone else produce her albums?

This album made me listen to it once, and sadly put it away."},{"rating":"1","title":"wow this is bad","review":"The fact that this has had no US release was an immediate warning .... however as a longtime fan I figured I would check it out. Boy is this bad. There are a few decent tracks, however the truly awful \\"Crazy Little Thing Called Love\\", \\"This Magic Moment\\", \\"Only You\\" - among many others - make this unlistenable. Miss Ross is a great singer and interpeter - check out the delicacy she approached the Billie Holliday material. She is a producer's singer: Ashford and Simpson, CHIC, Holland Dozier Holland - even Hall & Oates - all were able to take her talent and create - in some cases - true all time classics. This is a mess. Diana, your voice still sounds great - STOP executive producing your projects!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Warm and Sincere album","review":"I Love You is Diana Ross' first album in 7 years. A collection of love song covers plus one new song, it's an album full of warmth and sincerity as Ross sings songs reflecting on the positive side of love. Though her voice has eroded over the years, some syrupy arrangements and there are a couple of songs on there not to my taste (You are so Beautiful, Only You, Take My Breath Away), the drawbacks are more than compensated by the strengths including a bouncing More Today Than Yesterday which harkens back to the sounds of the Supremes, the sexy I Want You, a deeply felt To Be Loved (written by Ross' svengali ex lover Berry Gordy), the lovely Lovely Day, a wistful Remember which sets the tone of the album and my favorite What About Love, in which Ross gives a nuanced and heartfelt performance. Overall, this is a solid comeback for Diana Ross. If you take the album for what it is, it will really grow on you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ms. Ross does it again","review":"Just downloaded this cd and I have to admit I really do like this cd. When I first heard it for the first time I said ok it sounds ok. But after listening to it over and over a great deal of these songs really takes a whole of you. I Want You,Lovely Day,More Than Yesterday and I Love You(All That Really Matters) are truly my favorites, although The Look of Love grabs my attention as well. Overall the diva is back and Ms. Ross is not playing around this time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Diana Ross in 'Stardust' mode","review":"Diana Ross is a living legend, and I think its amazing that she's still recording and selling out shows. But, when it comes to I Love You, even Diana Ross' die-hard fans may not like her very much. Diana Ross is better known for catchy pop songs, great ballads, and quite a few dance hits. This album doesn't contain any of the above. Its a collection of mostly really old songs that, according to her, were re-done by her to effect nostalgia. Well...I'm not feeling it, but if it works for her... I'm thinking that she could have come up with a much better production than this for what is very probably her last studio album. Not that there's anything bad about the songs she chose for this album but they just don't fit her style. She would have done better to re-record newer versions of some of her own hits from the past and a few new songs with a more cutting-edge producer."},{"rating":"1","title":"SAD SET OF REMAKES - WHY?","review":"I have always been a big Diana fan...seen her live a bunch of times from the Caesar's days to the pantages in Los Angeles...BUT this cd is lousy - its like putting together songs that didn't make it to a regular cd release...none are sung with much feeling...and the photos used even credit herb ritts (who pass'd in 2002)...so the whole thing is not meant for anyone but a dyed in wool diana fans.

Sadly, this book will probably follow on Po Bronson's and Jerry Kaplan's as a script for a Hollywood movie.I bought this book because, one, I've been operating as an entrepreneur in Silicon Valley for some time, and, two, I enjoyed Randall Stross's book on Steve Jobs and Next. That book, \\"The Next Big Thing\\", exhibited balanced, accurate journalism.Stross has lost my respect with Eboys, however. Sorry, but VC firms don't operate in this compassionate, humane way, and Benchmark is no exception. The book's message that these guys are motivated by service to the entrepreneur is laughable. The venture business is all about return on investment, and these guys are among the most tough-minded and ruthless in the Valley. To not recognize that most fundamental reality, Stross has either lost his mind or sold out."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too good to be true","review":"I just don't get it.

Answer: Only when it probably knows ahead of time that the outcome will be positive."},{"rating":"2","title":"What professional venture capitalists do","review":"There is a common misconception that venture capitalists are just the lucky guys who get in on winners before the IPO. Stross does a fine job of portraying Benchmark as the value-added 'company builders' they are and not mere passive investors. He gives a 'fly-on-the-wall' account of the Benchmark venture process and lucid examples of the hands-on dedication they provide to each of their portfolio companies. A must read for entreprenuers in the venture process to understand the benchmark they should measure their investors against."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for the layperson on the fringe!","review":"Stross will not bore you with a straight non-fiction account. This is a great book for anyone who simply wants to learn a little more about the guys behind the CEOs of dot coms who have both failed and succeeded. As an employee of a start-up who is not privy to the confidential nature of the dealings with the VC firms that back my own company, I learned a lot about the outside forces and market conditions that can make or break a start up. Recommended reading for ANYONE involved in a start up who wonders sometimes why their Executive team can sometimes be so apparently insane.

Are they possibly as inarticulate, unanalytical and grossly negligent in due diligence (Tri-Strata) as portrayed? Is Beirne really a shill (recruiting by misrepresentation)? Had they not gotten so lucky (eBay) I'd don't know how they'd raise another fund.

Benchmark is among the best of the bunch, but c'mon! a rapid return on investment is what drives them, not some implied gentleman's code.This is a pretty story, well-written, but one that does nothing to capture the underlying dynamics of venture capital today.

E-boys doesn't intend to be the definitive treatise on Venture Capital.

It gives you the venture capitalist perspective on those ventures, and how the standards of investing have changed from the pre-internet time days. This is not a textbook on venture capital, but it is an entertaining peek at how some of the big internet deals went down."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shameless Self Promotion","review":"This book is nothing but a self promotion for the Benchmark internet fund. Yes, these guys made some good investments and are probably very rich, but employing a writer to write a book about themselves is the ulitmate in pathetic ego centric behavior. Anyhow, their investments look pretty poor now that the internet bubble has burst. This book is neither a primer to the internet nor helpful to a budding entrepreneur.

Wasted my money, and loved it. I wont order off this company anymore, because they have to know how cheap the clasp was, they are selling them to alot of people. I for one, use Amazon so much, its crazy. I spend hundreds and hundreds of dollars every month. This is the only piece of jewelry that I ever purchased that I had this problem with, so that tells me that most of thier jewelry is like this, and that is why It was the price that it was, because it was cheaply made, problem is you can sell cheap stuff, but for gosh sakes, does it have to be so cheap that it falls off all the time, in the long run the money just falls off your wrist."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beautiful bracelet--but the fastener is difficult and unusable (made in China I'm guessng)","review":"I love this bracelet, but when I tried it on right out of the box: I could not fasten it to put it on, it did not lay flat when my husband fastened it for me--and it took him a while too.

James Scott Bell's Plot and Structure, from Writers Digest Books, does clearly and coherently what most fiction how-tos do not - moves beyond the bricks-and-mortar of language to the blueprint of compelling and saleable plot. And what makes this even better is the book's upbeat tone, its tugging and insistent you can-can-do-this style; I defy you to read the first twenty pages without feeling compelled to write a novel. This book has earned a permanent recommendation in my workshop reading lists; I have never read a better how-to.Tom Morrisey"},{"rating":"2","title":"Basic Introduction to Novel Plotting and Structure","review":"This book is recommended for beginning writers struggling to get a grip on plot. \\"Literary\\" writers may also benefit by infusing their character-driven stories with structure as instructed by Bell. For writers who have taken a few writing classes or are voracious readers, the \\"three-act structure\\" here is overly familiar and won't come across as surprisingly insightful.This book can be summed up as: 1) Use the three-act structure. It may be formulaic, but it works. 2) Experiment with different techniques--there are plenty of exercises in this book to jumpstart your fiction. 3) Write! It's the only way you'll really learn."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth every cent","review":"An excellent title if you want to know the tricks and techniques needed to grab hold of a reader and not let them go until the final pages of your novel. It's all here, from plotting techniques to structuring your scenes for maximum impact.I'm a published author with three titles in print and yet I still buy and read how-to books, because I believe you should never stop learning. Many of these books are boring rehashes of obvious information, but Bell has just the right combination of enthusiasm and knowledge. You want to keep reading, but you also want to set the book aside and apply some of the techniques right away."},{"rating":"2","title":"If you can only buy one writing book ...","review":"Can't afford a pricey writer's conference? Do family responsibilities keep you from traveling? No problem. James Scott Bell's latest book is the perfect solution. Like a week-long writing course, Bell covers it all in easy-to-read chapters. From the Top 20 Ways to Get Hundreds of Plot Ideas to Stretching the Tension, I'd recommend Plot & Structure to beginning writers for its soup-to-nuts approach, but it's also a must-read for veterans. The advice is timeless."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best writing guides I've found","review":"This book has helped transform the general story idea in my head into a well structured plot that does all the things I wanted it to accomplish.

This is an insightful study of plot and structure, together with practical tips and exercises on how to improve skills.

In fact, any fiction writer will find it of immense help."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book teaches a formula for writing formulaic fiction","review":"If you want to write a cliche-ridden, predictable novel that mirrors the inept style of many mass appeal best-sellers, then this book may help you in that endeavor. It gives practical advice, such as buy a mug that says \\"Writers\\" to keep on your desk for motivation, listen to music to get inspiration for plot ideas, steal well-known plots and give them a bit of twist, write your book and at the last minute change the ending for shock effect. The author assumes that all plots are based on a character facing an adversary and adds little to (possibly detracts from) the Hero's Journey paradigm.A much better option is to read Orson Scott Card's book on Characters and Viewpoint. Card writes a little about plot in that book, but the few pages he devotes to the subject have far more gems than Bell's entire book. Nancy Kress's Beginnings, Middles and Ends is also good."},{"rating":"2","title":"This Book is Simply Terrific, a Real Resource","review":"I have purchased many books on writing and have found most of them to be a waste of money. PLOT & STRUCTURE, however, is a major exception.James Scott Bell has written a truly excellent book on how to structure the storyline of your novel. He writes in a very simple, direct style, and gets right to the point. There is a lot of practical advice in this book that I have already used to improve my manuscript. This guidebook is a great starting point for someone who is interested in writing a novel, especially in the suspense/thriller genre.In short, highly recommended. Other useful books I have encountered thus far are STEIN ON WRITING, SELF-EDITING FOR FICTION WRITERS, and TECHNIQUES OF THE SELLING WRITER."},{"rating":"2","title":"My most tattered book","review":"I reference this so often the jacket is falling off. Not only is the material useful, but it sets you on fire with possibilities. Bell peppers the book with examples from his own writing, which is fast paced thrillers. Every page is inspiring.

He's been able to craft a more engaging beginning and has learned more about traditional structure. He really likes the tone of the book (it reads like a casual instruction manual rather than a textbook) and has a list of published works he can read to see an example of what Bell is talking about.

In one example, he tries to accomodate those authors who outline ahead of time (OP, outline people), those who don't (NOP, non-outline people), and those who do both (a little outlining with a lot of freedom). To accomplish this, the author borrows heavily from recommendations of other authors and provides an objective synthesis of their techniques. This makes his bibliography of writing books and novels so helpful.John DunbarSugar Land, TX"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Must Have Before You Write","review":"If you're thinking about writing fiction, this book is a \\"must have.\\" In order for a writer to write page one, he needs to know where he's going, and how he's going to get there.

It intoduced ideas and thoughts that I had never considered before that am sure will make my writing better.

That's because the first 100 pages inspired me so that I put down the book, got off the sofa (on Thanksgiving Day, no less!) and wrote the first 1,000 words of my next novel. More importantly, I also wrote a more detailed outline than I've ever produced for a book (as an, I thought, confirmed seat-of-the-pants writer). I haven't been this excited about my own writing in years!

As good as it is from that point of view, it is disappointingly slim on Javascript. If you want to learn Javascript, you will need a different book. It also is good about providing the necessary design principles for Web building. It should be on your shelf, if you are a serious Web author/designer/master."},{"rating":"2","title":"Jack of all trades, master of none","review":"If you are looking for a book that covers a large range of material on various Internet technologies, this book is for you. I really came away with a good feel for the basics of HTML, web design, audio, video, display concepts, etc. However, if you want to learn HTML in-depth, look elsewhere. Jennifer Niederst focuses on summarizing a ton of breadth, but gives specific details in only a few instances. This is a great starter book to get you excited about Web technologies, but other texts will be needed for more in-depth learning."},{"rating":"2","title":"Too good to be true","review":"This book, by far, is the best web design book I have ever read. It is perfect for someone who is trying to get into the field of web design. The author has done an excellent job by explaining everything possible a beginner needs to know. The language is so casual and simple and there are excellent examples and references. I would highly recommend it to someone who is considering a good introduction book. Kudos to the author and the folks at O'Reilly for a job more than well done!"},{"rating":"2","title":"An essential for anyone designing web pages","review":"Easy too follow and yet very thorough in its treatment of all aspects of web design. Even those familiar with HTML should find some tricks they don't usually use. It is probably the one book anyone doing web design should own."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hot Dang! That's a good reference book!","review":"The O'Reilly folks have their stiff in order. This is a great reference for any front-end web-building you want to do.

Good stuff!"},{"rating":"2","title":"It's like having an experienced web guru sitting next to you","review":"I wish that I had this book 6 months ago. More than a \\"here are the tags, this is what they do\\" reference, Niederst shows you the solutions to all of the oddball problems that you would otherwise only stumble upon after years of experience. I am a professional webmaster, and people are always asking me to recommend books on building web pages. This is the first one that I've actually recommended. The information in this book is more valuable than books I've seen that cost three times as much."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Must-Have!","review":"I used to have several HTML and Web Design books beside my computer. Now, I don't pile as many books as before because Web Design in a Nutshell guides me through.

It's not intended to teach you HTML but it will help you hone your coding and web design skills. I read this book after learning HTML from Sams' \\"Teach Yourself HTML in 4 Hours.\\" The former provided the appetizer, this book provides the meat and potatoes. It's best feature is the tips and tricks sprinkled throughout each section, particularly as they apply to getting the same effect in different browsers. The book also highlights IE quirks and Netscape bugs for various HTML tags and provides examples for workarounds. Most invaluable are the various tables included in the text: \\"MIME Types and Subtypes by Extension,\\" \\"Decimal to Hexadecimal Equivalents,\\" \\"Colors w/ their RGB and Web-safe hex values,\\" and a full listing of character entities (@=@). You may be able to find this info. elsewhere, but rarely in one location as it is here. I would highly recommend this reference for any webmaster's desktop library."},{"rating":"2","title":"Indispensible reference","review":"Very comprehensive, and a great reference for techie-types who are diving into web design and development. I keep one copy on my desk at work, and one next to my computer at home. Niederst captured a number of things better than most authors: the 216-color web-safe palette, image types, HTML forms and tables, cross-browser compatability, and live space (the amount of space, in pixels, you have to work with depending on monitor resolution, platform and browser).

I still recommend it, but perhaps with another, beginner book as well.If you are computer literate it will help you learn FAST ... rather than wade through lots of nonsense.Read the other reviews - nearly everyone thought it was great, except 2 people and I honestly think they are confusing this book with some other book ...... perhaps they just came out of the nutshell.If you are working in IT you should have heaps of cash anyway so get it ... lol"},{"rating":"1","title":"Great for Audio, Terrible for Video","review":"I used the \\"Advanced A/V Pack\\" for many years and never realized back when I purchased it that S-Video was only capable of 480i Standard Definition (SD) resolution.

It is also very difficult for me to be critical of the authors out of respect for their experience. Unfortunately, that's not where Ogden takes me. I felt as though I were reading about a group of sadistic Boy Scouts in a very bent version of the \\"Lord of the Flies\\"; rather than the United States Marine Corp.

I bought one of these to try it and loved it so much I bought more. It works exactly as advertised, and my hair dries in record time.A couple of other things to keep in mind. The towel itself dries very quickly, so I wash it out by hand, hang it in the bathroom and it is dry the next day. Also, it folds up very small so can be easily packed in a suitcase or even an overnight bag when travelling."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very absorbent","review":"I actually purchased this because I needed a soft towel to dry my 12 pound dog with after bathing him. This microfiber towel absorbs water very well. It i soft and thin and when I use it to dry my dog it absorbs water from his wet hair much faster than a regular towel. The towel also dries out well and doesnt have a weird smell that regular towels get after getting wet and drying. As far as using this towel as a hair towel and not for a dog, I think it would work well for the majority of hair lengths and thicknesses. It is smaller than a regular towel so Im not sure how well you could do the wrap, twist, and throw on top of your head towel thing with your hair, but if you need a towel to help assist in drying out your hair quickly, this will do a good job."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for air drying but not when your hair is too wet","review":"I have very thick, coarse hair and was tired of wrapping my head with the standard cotton towel at home. Plus, the towels were always rough on my hair and would get soggy immediately. I purchased this towel to put less stress on my hair follicles and to improve the drying time.I was very excited that I was able to wrap all of my hair in the towel (about arm-pit length, 4b/4c, coarse) and it stayed put. No problems there at all. However, I noticed that the towel started to get really soggy after about 30 mins. I had to take it off and squeeze it out.I think this is mainly because my hair type holds onto water much more than others and because the towel is pretty small. So, the next time, I just made sure that I squeezed as much excess water out of my hair as possible before wrapping and it was not as bad.I really like the towel but it is definitely not totally equipped to handle all hair types."},{"rating":"2","title":"great towel","review":"Use it in the RV, compact, dries hair good and towel dries quick.

I need two of these towels, because they are very thin, and the first towel becomes saturated after a few minutes, so I have to use a second towel. One normal thicker cotton towel does the job. This towel is also not quite large enough to make a good turban. It creates a ton of static in the dryer with my cotton towels. My hair is not any less frizzy. I tried the \\"plunking\\" method and that did not improve my curls and made my bangs go wierd. So save your money. This is an overpriced synthetic towel.

He explains the common Neumann architecture of a single CPU computer.

From this model of software running on 1 computer, the discussion segues naturally into a network of such machines. Wherein the Internet appears. And its common version, the Web, which many users casually and wrongly assume to be synonymous with it.There is little specialised hardware knowledge or maths required for the book. Indeed, the Boolean logic is shown to be utterly simple. Though, within the constraints of his presentation, the reader is not shown enough to appreciate that from the Boolean logic, one can build up an entire edifice of digital maths.

For example, he explains Servlet Chaining which is supported on JWS, but not on other servers (like Apache JServ). And he doesn't care to reveal that Servlet Chaining is not even a part of Servlet specifications. Sad thing is that Jason (knowingly or unknowingly) tries to make us believe that it is a good feature. When I asked around, the general feeling that I got was that Chaining is a bad practice of writing servlets. I feel Jason should have stuck to general topic of Servlet programming.

Consequently I did not hesitate to purchase this second edition, which I instinctively thought would cover this important part of J2EE.Yet I think I got through Hunter/Crawford's section on Taglibs in around 15 minutes having previously gotten a great deal more out of various tutorials at javasoft, apache and other websites.Still, if you want an overview of alternative techniques around, this may be the book for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect for those who need to know","review":"This is a fantastic book.

I hate that kind of cookbook junk! If I wanted to go on to the web and download some idiot's class to stir in to a servlet, why would I buy a book on servlets? Of course, this is not the only example...If you're the kind of person who likes the \\"Perl Cookbook\\", fine, this book is great; but if you're the kind of person who really wants to know the ins and outs of servlets, try to find some other book."},{"rating":"2","title":"This Book Will Get You Started","review":"If you know JAVA and HTTP this book will get you started on Servlets.

Although it is an okay book on servlets, the reviews here are a bit overdone, and I was let down after finding problems early on in the examples.

From the book descriptions I was expecting a guide to all the luxurious activities and experiences available at the resort with great detail. This guide skims over most Disney attractions and does not provide any information that is not available via disney's website. I would like to see more details and even ballpark prices on some activities. Personal experience testimonies would also benefit the listings in this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cute story","review":"I wanted this book for my PreK classroom.

The EP are too quiet on my bass. The change is fine for E and A , it's ok for D and it's a total disaster for G. Terrible sound, twangy and noisy pizz and bowing (a bit better in this case). I ended up using an Eudoxa G string and it works perfectly. The Spirocore G string on my bass is too thin and sounds very badly. I don't think this is generally true I know people happily using this set. In general I am not impressed. I think I will change the D string as well, Iike the Eudoxas very much. I play jazz and classical music (baroque) and gut strings (wrapped in metal) are the best."},{"rating":"1","title":"Acrylic Bagel Holder","review":"This product is useless.

I devoured Cocktails for Three and excitedly purchased The Gatecrasher hoping for another great read. I was sorely disappointed - by the ending. I throroughly enjoyed the story, even if it is a little dark, until the end. It reminded me of sitting in class as a child when charged with writing a story. I'd write a long, drawn-out story and then get tired and wrap it all up in one paragraph, just to finish. That's what The Gatecrasher felt like to me - Wickham just ended it in one page! There was great character and plot development and then it felt like she just got tired and ended it - very disappointing, especially considering how artful she is at getting Becky Bloomwood out of a bind.

This woman is deceitful, a bad mother, and yet everyone falls in love with her. The author tries to convince the reader that Fleur is charming. This is a 40 year old woman that takes no responsibility for her actions and cares about noone but herself! The only good quality that she shows is that she is beautiful. If that is considered a quality than that is the only quality she posesses. I did not laugh or have a lot of fun reading this book. It made me feel really bad for every single one of these characters and even worse that they never got to see through the gold-digger that Fleur is. As far as they are concerned, at the end she is still wonderful. While the truth is... she never was and she never will be."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a good book","review":"I love Sophie Kinsella's books so I was expecting to enjoy this Madeleine Wickham book.

This made the father rethink his relationship with his son.Great movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Arizona Summer","review":"A high rating is given for Arizona Summer only because it featured Lee Majors. Story-wise, it smacks a little of that Hayley Mills classic \\"The Parent Trap\\". However, the comparison stops there. There are some fine Arizona scenery and good old camping antics. The kids seem like a fresh breath in a weary campsite. Here, the Lee Majors character, represents the tired Arizona outback, an old timer who still packs a punch (ponch) and no shortage on wits and guile even when his knee is not in the best condition. The sublimal part of the story is spiritual, religious and moralistic, like \\"Seven Heaven\\". Good family entertainment for couch potatoes without an agenda. As a person who loves camping out, this is good inspiration for my next camping trip. Camping is a good place for family bonding."},{"rating":"1","title":"inhumane","review":"Please do not torture your children. Send them to camp, maybe even camp in Arizona. Read a story about summer camp in Arizona. Let them watch Raising Arizona. Do not, however, rent or even think about buying this movie.

Bad acting, cheesy set-up, and unintentional moments of humor for those of drunken persuasion."},{"rating":"2","title":"Death World","review":"This was my first time reading a novel situated in the 40k universe, so I attempted to go in with an open mind. I liked how the author was able to give you a sense of the day-to-day activities of the Catachan Jungle Fighters. He was also able to distinguish each member of the unit in some form or fashion. Obviously he spent more time on some than others, but I only had to re-read characters names a couple times when I couldn't remember who he was talking about. Additionally the geography was described well, especially since the planet itself becomes a character in the story. Overall, I enjoyed my first foray into the 40k universe, particularly with this group of rough-n-ready troopers from Catachan."},{"rating":"2","title":"Recommend this book for any serious Java Developer","review":"This book was my first introduction to Java Security.

You're thumbs wont have to streatch for those white and black buttons. Also, they buttons are flat instead of rounded, so you wont start hurting after punching them hard after a while like the old ones. The only thing that sucks about these is the joysticks are made of hard, sharp-edged pieces under a thin rubber cover, whereas the old ones used one round plastic piece. What happens is that, after you've been pushing the joysticks back and forth for a while, the sharp under piece cuts through the rubber (I hate it when I tear my rubbers) and starts cutting into your thumb.

They are not durable in any non-paperweight sense of the word.This is in the context of me also being a SNES guy.

After getting hate mail and international cries of outrage from millions of faithful Xbox owners, Microsoft released the Controller S, a smaller, easier to handle version of the Controller D. Thank you God.

At the time I was caught between thinking \\"What is this guy nuts?\\" and \\"Man this thing is the most awesome thing I've ever seen.\\" Well I went surfing and found it and am now the proud owner of both the pepper & salt mill (both are the same exact thing). Now I don't take mine to restaurants with me, but it is small enough to easily put in your pocket yet use many times without refilling. Who knows, maybe he carried it on him in case he got in brawl, I don't know, but it's quite a nifty device and works well.

They followed up with \\"Becasuse Of You\\" which sounded similar, but sent a different message with its lyrics. However, though both dance tunes were catchy and enjoyable, my favorite on this album was the smooth ballad, \\"Promise Me\\". The whole song is fairly long (about 7 minutes long), but its smooth rhythm and easy-to-remember lyrics make it an enjoyable song for me.

The information in the book seemed really interesting and solid. It contained both background about famous skyscrapers and information about how they are build, and even tips for building your own model skyscrapers, which was great.The only problem is that the illustrations seemed designed for a much younger child than the text. The text is quite advanced, but the first thought when I, my mother, and my nephew each looked at the book was that it was more for babies (or at least 5-6 year olds). If they got rid of the primitive, childish cartoons, this book would easily be worth a 5 rating."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dull.","review":"Though this book does present a variety of different Star Wars collectables, the manner in which it does so is somewhat boring.

However, I find this unit not user friendly. This is the first time I have had to literally read the instructions to see how to set the alarm and then it is difficult with several buttons to push while looking for the very small icon. Also to tune a radio station to a preset is tedious. If you press the snooze button to view the screen, it changes the projection mode out of time projection to alarm projection so the snooze button has to be pressed again to go back to the time projection. If it wasn't a gift, I would have returned it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Limited lifespan","review":"I purchased this item and enjoyed the clock function for about a year.

I was never able to receive the signal for the Atomic clock (My prior atomic alarm clock was able to do this)I also found that you are not able to fine tune the radio volume. The volume is adjusted in increments from level 1(lowest) to level 4(loudest).Also, if you use the radio for the alarm, it always turns the radio on at the level 2 setting, which I found to be way too loud. And, I was not able to set the radio alarm to go off at any other volume level. I even found level 1 to be too loud for my liking for that early morning wake-up.Sent the clock back after 1 day.."},{"rating":"1","title":"This really is the romance genre, not fantasy","review":"I bought this book because I am a fan of (most of) Tanith Lee's fantasies (an exception is her vampire series, which shares some of the same problems). I don't like romance as a genre, but was willing to stretch a point for the Lee story.But--Lee's story is really a romance despite a few fantasy trappings such as ghosts. Or perhaps reincarnations--I wasn't quite sure what was going on. It seems written for women who want relationships to entertain detailed fantasies of same. Complete with a mysterious, temperamental, dominant hero (he's a jerk) and lengthy kisses so ecstatic as to be absurd (it is just a kiss, after all).I read most of the third story, and realized it was just another romance in the same predictable mold. Even though I almost always finish books, I gave up on the rest of this one--I never read the first story.So, if you're primarily a romance reader, you'll probably like this book.

It was called by Winston Churchill back in the 50's the \\"Pearl of Africa\\" for it's growing economy. But that was soon to be no more with the rise to power of Amin. The country is still reeling, decades after he was removed. It is a sad story that has been repeated in many African countries, but the story of Uganda is particularly horrific.This was written while the guy was still in exile and Amin was still in power. It puts you right in the midst of the horror, as it was still happening. This isn't some dry history book. It's the cry of a man who knew Amin personally and willing to tell the world his story at the risk of his own life.

That was the purpose of the Biblical scriptures written in each and every language. Unfortunately, man has, by virtue of ignoring the old God that once formed the faith of everyone, now requires a new face and image because he has become obsolete in these days of man emulating God. By not keeping the tenets that are the function of religion, man has ascended not to the right hand of God but above him, relegating God to the sidelines as if he was a benchwarmer, to be taken off and put in the game, momentarily, for our own use and privilege whenever we might need him, or use him for a convenient excuse. Like the children we torture and warehouse, in the name of morality and justice, God may well have left us to the fate that we have decided we prefer, the self help of leading other people around in the name of God, but without the authority to do so.

It was long and boring, filled with superfluous passages and nauseating accounts of the author's travels. In only one aspect was it informative; it solidified exactly what I am not looking for in a skipper and reinforced exactly how not to treat a crew. Sailors and lovers of the sea would be amazed at the decisions, choices and actions made by the author throughout his trip. For fans of Into Thin Air, the skipper of this boat lacked the same judgement and leadership as the guides on Mt. Everest; fortunately, the stakes were never as high and the results usually just frustration and disappointment for the crew and would-be crew members. It did keep me up all night - wondering what incredulous or pompous statement the author would make next. Painful. Change course and sail away from this book as fast as you can."},{"rating":"1","title":"Of hand-rolled smokes and opera...","review":"Not what I was hoping for in a sailing adventure narrative. I quickly tired of tabulating how many hand-rolled cigarettes the author smoked and how many varieties of music he enjoyed. I kept waiting for the essence of blue-water sailing to emerge in the form of vividly described sunsets and starlit skies. It was also surprising a person would take a boat with as many mechanical problems as the Warrior Queen out of swimming distance of the nearest port. By mid-way through the book the author was out of money and out of crew. This book is essentially a beginner's guide on how-not-to circumnavigate."},{"rating":"2","title":"What's it REALLY like to single-hand across the Atlantic?","review":"John Beattie's book is a true account of his trip from the east coast of England, through Scotland, and across to the Caribbean, in a 35-foot sailboat, often all by himself. His writing is so moving that I almost felt I was along for the trip, and I have to admit I'm glad I was warm and safe at home while he was out there. This book is to single-handed small-boat ocean sailing what \\"Into Thin Air\\" is to Himalayan mountain climbing.

It is so bad and all i have to say is who cares about a little stinkin' boat floating around with a sick man in it. If you have an English teacher who tries to make you read it, don't, because it is an overly-descriptive heap of incessantly boring script with no dialogue and Beattie seems to have a desire to beat his women and drink to no end.

John Beattie is a man who had a childhood dream that wouldn't die because he wouldn't let it. He had the courage to persue this dream to it's conclusion. The \\"Breath of Angels\\" is the story of the realization of this dream. Told with great humour, humility, and a delightful touch of understatement this book reads like a good novel. The climax leaves you to ponder those eternal questions about coincedence or perhaps the god of your understanding working anonymously. This book has inspired me to bring many of my dreams off the shelf and they are now simmering on the front burner. I will never complete them all, but, I now have the inspiration to complete some of them thanks to John Beattie and \\"Breath of Angels\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good book to snuggle up with.","review":"John Beattie should write another book.

I just hope he has more sailing or other adventures to write about soon."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing Travelogue","review":"Quite simply, I was very disappointed in this book. I was hoping for a gripping tale of man against nature along the lines of Into Thin Air or The Perfect Storm, but this book proved to be more travelogue than compelling adventure. Though aspects of Beattie's solo trans-Atlantic voyage were indeed dramatic, Beattie lacks the necessary skill to make the events truly resonate with the reader. I felt like I was on Everest with Krakauer and in a great storm with Junger (who was not even there), yet here I read Beattie's adventures as a dispassionate observer. Perhaps even more disappointing was the fact that much of the writing seemed totally superfluous. I would have liked to learn a little bit more about the difficulties of solo sailing and a lot less about Beattie's fondness for drugs and alcohol and what he had for breakfast every morning. I certainly went into this book with high hopes, but finished it quite disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"A moving story of one man's voyage across the Atlantic","review":"John Beattie's \\"The Breath of Angels\\" touched me profoundly in many ways. His travails with equipment problems and crew incompatibilities are common to many of those who venture onto the sea in small boats, but his descriptions are amusing, heartrending, and inspiring. He evokes the loneliness of the singlehanded sailor, and the terror of a storm at sea without undue pathos.The central theme of the tale is that of the rescue by Beattie of a man helplessly adrift at sea. It was clearly a turning point for the author, and caused me to contemplate what it means to save another person's life, or to owe one's life to another. This is a moving story of one man's voyage alone across the Atlantic, and coming face-to-face with the meaning of life and death. I recommend it wholeheartedly, to sailors, armchair sailors, and non-sailors alike."},{"rating":"2","title":"Spotlight on isolation","review":"This movie is not for the faint of heart. It takes you down a path few of us want to go. Dying is not heroic, or noble or even particularly interesting. This film explores the isolation of the human existence. Don't even think about seeing this movie if you are depressed! The film, through the experiences of one this one individual, shows how we can consistently, and thoughtlessly let each other down, in a myriad of small careless ways. I found it thought provoking, and sensitive. Walking in the path of Mr. Lazarescu, you'll find yourself wanting to, perhaps, break through the isolation and find a way to become more a more aware, compassionate, understanding and caring person.

The film is realistic, with rare moments of humor and also occasional poignant moments, but ultimately is tedious and almost painfully long. Yes, you catch a glimpse into a medical system where no one is really responsible for, nor really cares about, Mr. Lazarescu's life. The situation differs so much from the view we're weaned on, where doctors race to solve problems, that it is valuable to learn about. The editorial comment that one can visualize how \\"suffocatingly slow time must seem\\" for Mr. Lazarescu is absolutely correct, but only because time feels that \\"suffocatingly slow\\" for the viewer as well: I saw this movie in theatre and wished I could have gotten up from my seat (in the middle of the aisle) and walked out."},{"rating":"2","title":"Poignant and powerful","review":"This was a long movie, not only in actual length but *perceived* length. The story of poor, sick Mr. Lazarescu is a tragic - and sadly realistic - one, and we know that it was told at this pace to give us an idea of what it must have felt like for him: sick, nauseous, in need of immediate surgery.We watch, baffled, as he shuttled from one hospital to the next, with everyone agreeing that something needs to be done but other than one of the nurses with him in the ambulance, nobody seems to want to do anything.While this is intended as a critique of the inadequacies of the Romanian health care system, it could just as well be a critique of any U.S. county run hospital, where there are far too many people, and far too few workers.This should serve as a reminder to anyone not taking good care of their health to get with it - you don't want to end up like Mr. Lazarescu."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good acting, honest story, but it didn't go anywhere","review":"PROS:This film was well-acted, raw and honest.I felt that it was a realistic portrayal of the health care system.CONS:It was identified as a black comedy, and I didn't see the humour.I felt like I was left hanging at the end - I wish we actually knew what happened."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can't say yet","review":"Well, I stayed up late to watch this the first time and that was a mistake.

I prefer movies to be somewhat entertaining and not just real.... I probably slept too long to glean anything more than this: that the last few hours of life can be kinda ordinary.I've just read all the above reviews and I guess I should rewatch it...

This book expects a pretty good understanding of C. All in all, very easy to read and very clear code examples.

It was difficult to understand where things were supposed to fit together. Variable types were never discussed in detail, form controls that the authors considered 'simple and well documented' were never discussed in the book (never mind the fact that this was supposed to be documentation, eh?). There was no mention of how to pull up date controls like the Datebook does, or how to write HackMaster applets or so on. It was basically just not adaquate for my learning needs.

I eventually had to look this up in a friend's copy of \\"Advanced Perl Programming\\" (Chapter 14)!What's more amazing is that the book, somewhat perversely, goes into a verbose description of the options for each widget you can create.

I have never used the object-oriented style of Perl programming, and this book also made a good introduction to that.Throughout this book, if you do read it page by page, are many \\"hidden bits\\" of information based on the author's experience, which saved me a lot of time versus learning it all the hard way.GUI design in general is a huge topic, and way out of scope for a book like this.

I've had several vacuums over my lifetime and all have lasted for several years. One of the reasons I bought this particular vacuum is that it is made in USA. I've bought a lot of tools which were made overseas and they don't last at all. This is a very powerful easy to manuever vacuum and it lives up to all my expectations except for one thing. The cord is very thin and cheesy. I would think a vacuum of this quality would come with a better cord. Although it seems plenty long enough, it's made of a thin vinyl material. Otherwise, I would highly recomend this vacuum."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good canister vac","review":"This is a powerful and easy to move canister vac.

Finally the rivet broke off where the latch goes over to hold the cover on. They refused to do anything about it because the warranty was up by then. I originally wanted my money back. I will never buy from this company again. I have an old canister eureka that has fallen down the stairs and it is 10 years old and still works which is what I am using now.

Very much full blooded romantic music, but speaking with an individual voice (much like Draeseke). This music is so good in fact that it's hard to understanbd why nothing else of his has been recorded.

I liked how all the main characters(even the seldom seen kids) gathered around the kitchen table at the end for one long shot that gradually faded into darkness. Patricia Heaton, the sexiest 47-year old woman I've ever seen on TV, is the centerpiece of the finale.

The examples are out of date but the ideas are not. Most finance textbooks say that either markets are efficient and you can't find undervalued stocks, or to just use discounted cash flows to estimate the value of a firm. Well, these reasons are inadequate because they don't investors any practical information, probably causing mistakes. Peter Lynch gives practical guidelines for selecting a company. If you follow his guidelines you'll make fewer mistakes. I especially like his section on famous numbers. Finely an explanation for why the numbers are important. Most books just say things like, this is the debt ratio and you can compare it to the historical past, or to the industry. Peter Lynch provides a context for interpreting financial ratios. The other sections of the book are just as good. I find the most valuable information in the book from about chapter 7 to 13."},{"rating":"2","title":"Necessary read for any investor","review":"Peter Lynch tells about the strategies and types of companies he enjoys purchasing that allow him to beat the market.

Even if the book isn't a traditional step-by-step book that guides you to finding the best stocks, it gives you an idea about how to relate and approach investment.

The book is sort of a guide to investing for the layman, with particular emphasis on what makes for a really superb growth stock that layman would probably notice before professionals. There are many examples, and Lynch is a good writer with disarming humility considering his accomplishments. My one complaint is that he generally avoids nitty-gritty discussions of numbers and how to evaluate whether they are good or bad; I think he figures laymen are scared of numbers, which by and large is true."},{"rating":"2","title":"The essential art of investing (that we all can understand!)","review":"This is my bible!

Also, a new intro does not cut it either. The market over the past 3-4 years, and even a little earlier, is a whole new market. The basics stay the same as far as the Quant work, but new companies (dot coms, techs) and emerging markets (Russia, Euro) are involved.

I don't know about you, but I can't keep ear buds in my ear. Besides that, most of them sound terrible. The KSC35's will sound a lot better than whatever came with your portable. Besides the good sound, they will stay on your ear if you use them when jogging, exercising, etc."},{"rating":"1","title":"Broke them in less than a month.","review":"I needed headphones I could take to the gym, but after having Sony Street Style headphones w/ volume control for a long time, I really wanted headphones with volume control. Well, the loss of sound quality was just barely noticeable in the Koss headphones, they were half the price, and they do have volume control. However, they hurt the backs of your ears after a while, and whatever you do, don't wear them at the gym. I was using a stationary bike, got a little sweat in them, and the left ear stopped working. Oh well...back to Sony for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fast, Got it as promised","review":"When I ordered these headphones, I was expecting to have to wait over a week. I was delighted when I got my parcel just a few days later and in the condition that it was listed online!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh, dear...........","review":"This is the worst headphone I have ever bought.It's actually quite sad. The sound is great. Problem is - on your ears, the little 'phones stick <i>away</i> from your ears.So there is: - NO MUSIC THAT U HEAR - NO ISOLATION - LOTS OF AMBIENT NOISE - NOT HIGHLY EFFICIENTAll in all, great headphones that refuse to let u listen. QUITE ANNOYING. And I shelled out $10 for these. Oh, well........IF YOU HAVE A HUGE HEAD - the problem of the speakers jumpin away from your ears at an akward angle is non-existent. My sister uses these phones, and she loves em. If you're like me, and have an average-sized head, or have an average-to-small sized head without any hair hanging down, these probably won't fit on you very well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good sound, but bad fit","review":"I agree with some of the other reviews that the sound is actually very good in comparison to other in-ear headphones, but that's when I'm pushing them up to my ears with my fingers. I'm giving them 2 star's because I can't get them to stay in my ears. The ear pieces don't conform well enough to my ears to keep them in place."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why I didn't like this headset.","review":"at first i thought it was spectacular. great sound, great idea. then after about the end of one audiobook it shorted out. i had to spend money on a new headset. i was very disappointed. i thought everything i would need for my mp3 would be sent and usable. i feel that even though i got a great deal on my mp3 and audiobook membership that i was cheated."},{"rating":"1","title":"This review is for the KSC-5 model...","review":"...the KSC-5 Earbud Stereophones buy Koss are of very poor design and quality. They do not fit on the ear properly enough to be comfortable and the sound is just horrendous. Using these headphones is comparable to listening to an AM radio and will make even the best sounding cd players sound terrible. There is no bass and the highs are sorely lacking. I suppose if it has any strengths at all it would be the midrange, but that is something that many cheap headphones do not really lack in the first place. Stay away from the KSC-5 headphones and spend a little more money for better headphones."},{"rating":"1","title":"Uncomfortable and over-rated","review":"I bought these headphones largely on the strength of the reviews offered here. Unfortunately, the clips that hold these phones to your ears are not adjustable. One size does not fit all. I wore these for less than half an hour, and my ears are still sore 20 minutes after removing them. On the other hand, my wife wore them and found them quite comfortable.The sound quality is over-rated here, even when you consider the relatively low cost. The sound is thin and scratchy. They would be adequate for audio books and similar material, but I wouldn't enjoy listening to music with them."},{"rating":"1","title":"hmm whats the purpose here","review":"Well the things hug my ear well but the actual ear buds dont stick in your year. They might if you have holes in your ear the size of a quarter. So since they dont fit the sound quality isnt that good. its nice because im a mountain biker and they dont fall off but i would pass if i were you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Surprisingly good!!!","review":"I bought these (and I paid more than here) and am surprised at the excellent sound quality. Even bass is half way decent. The fit on me is very secure and I can move all around and they will never come off (almost...).Three minor gripes: cord is a bit thin (could get snipped easy), and is just a bit too short. (However, the 4'/1.2m length is fine when listening to a portable music device.) Ear cushions would be nice, but they don't stick into your ear too far so this isn't really an issue.If you need just a cheap, basic headset and want something better than the standard earbud, this is for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"While I can't complain about the sound...","review":"Before I bought them, I thought they would fit snugly inside of my ear as others I have bought that were similar to this. The plugs are way too big and fit outside of the ear dangling. I can't seem to get them to fit correctly no matter how hard I try. Like i said the sound is good for a cheap headset, but I expect them to at least fit."},{"rating":"1","title":"It is BAD!!!!","review":"One product I never will recommend to anybody is this one. Sure, a 4-foot cord is a nice little feature, but that only counts if the product works. This unit never worked. When I took it out and plugged it into my cd player, it only played out of one ear, and never fixed. Nothing really worked to tweak this thing back to normal, so DON'T BUY IT!!! IT IS JUST A WASTE OF MONEY!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of Money","review":"Don't believe the hype about neodymium magnets and good bass sound with these cheap headphones. I think the positive reviewers must have been hired by Koss, because these earbuds (or whatever they are) have NO BASS WHATSOEVER--I mean nothing! I compared them directly to a pair of Sony earbuds (not even the best ones), and while I'm not thrilled with Sony in general, the Sony earbuds blew Koss away in richness and bass, hands down. The Koss sound flat and hollow, like music over the telephone. I also bought the Koss UR-15 headphones at the same time, and they turned out to be garbage also. Do yourself a favor and buy another brand. Even if you have to pay more, at least you'll get something for your money."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good read but...","review":"I looked forward to reading the last of the Stormwatch series as I knew it introduced the characters of Apollo and Midnighter - which it did, wonderfully. However, I could have done without the second episode. Stormwatch gets a glimpse of an alternate Earth and an Alternate Stormwatch but as far as I was concerned - so what? Our Stormwatch heroes didn't do anything, just watched the other guys get their butts kicked and brooded about it. And where was Jenny Sparks?? We don't even see her throughout this entire collection. For me, Jenny is the heart of Stormwatch (and the Authority of course) and it's just not the same without her. I recommend this collection for the completist but it's not nearly as entertaining as Change or Die or Relentless."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not all it's cracked up to be","review":"Jeeze, Warren Ellis sure seems like a big Superman fan. Now introducing his second analogue of the character in the form of Apollo (the first being \\"The High\\"), as well as a pastiche of the entire Justice League.At any rate, the story is mildly interesting, though disturbingly anti-climactic. After drumming up the Apollo/Midnighter duo, they're defeated by... talking? How disappointing is that?The second story, introducing the multiverse concept, begs the question, who cares? Stormwatch taps into an alternate reality, and get all anxious about what happens next. They don't do anything and the plot resolves itself. The characters feel a little guilty, but in the end, who cares? Not me.Ellis fans should love this one. But I'm not an Ellis fan. Not after this."},{"rating":"2","title":"chocolate cookie murder","review":"This novel was hilarious yet mysterious and what I also love about Jaine Austen is her love for job and the clever sneaky ways she always seem to get her information and worm herself out of a little white lie like pretend to be a reporter one minute and then a lawyer another.. funnysince i am a lover of cats (at one time I had 20 cats now i only have 10) I love how she adores her cat prozac.Over all it was a fantastic read and i am looking forward for what she and prozac will be up to next."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very cute and super fast read","review":"This was a very, very fast read for me and I like books I can get into and finish.

I'd recommend anyone who likes a \\"cozy\\" mystery with humor and a \\"bumbling\\" heroine to pick this one up!"},{"rating":"1","title":"This Pen For Hire","review":"Was very predictable and a bit on the edge for comments made. Won't buy another. Was recommended by a friend."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best mystery I have read in a while","review":"Give this series a chance - if this 1st installment is any indication of the whole series it should be worth your time.The main character Jaine is likeable - a little quirky when she shares some of her thoughts.The mystery was well written- several likely suspects.If you guess it before the end, surely you won't guess the why and how."},{"rating":"2","title":"fun fast read","review":"The big draw here is the very funny narrative voice, a smart-alecky freelance writer, Jaine, who becomes involved in murder after her note prompts the victim to go on a date with nebbish Howard, Jaine's client and the police's prime suspect. Jaine impersonates a reporter and a detective, among others, to catch the real killer, and along the way she makes a few friends and even gets a date or two! This is a fun read. Though the mystery itself is not demanding, I enjoyed the heroine and her comments about the world around her."},{"rating":"2","title":"What fun!","review":"I read a lot of thrillers but wanted something light and funny. That's exactly what I got in This Pen For Hire. Jaine Austen was so likeable and I laughed out loud many times. I look forward to reading the next book in the series."},{"rating":"1","title":"Incredibly Lame...","review":"I won't waste much time writing this. I'm an adult male so maybe I'm not the intended audience. Sone of my favorite mystery writers are women. Having said that, this reminds me of something written for teenagers. There must have been at least twenty references to the content of cat food and at least as many about the main character's fat ass. I saw the ending coming halfway through.I have no idea why this thing got so many good reviews. Actually I have a suspicion but I will keep it to myself. If you you enjoy good writing, character development, plot, you need to find something else. I know I'm being kind of extreme but it was so, so bad..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun and Fast..........Reviewer: Sucker For Freebies","review":"O.K., so this one wasn't free, but \\"Death of a Trophy Wife\\" was, and after I read that I knew I had to read the wole series. I can see the differences in this maiden effort, but I enjoyed it nonetheless. The plotting could have been tighter, and the villain was too easy to spot, but if I had read this book first I probably wouldn't have noticed. Ms. Levine has really gro wn as a writer between this book and the latest, and I can't wait to read all the others. Snarky, funny M.C., great cat, and a really different point of view. And anyone who has ever been owned by a cat knows that feeding that cat IS a large part of your life!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent - Great Fun","review":"I love books that can make you laugh and Laura Levine does just that with her Jaine Austin series.

There aren't any directions. I may not have hooked it up correctly, but if there is a trick, there should probably be some directions."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wrong book at the right time!","review":"I did not like this book at all. It is full of platitudes and commonplaces. It is a doomsayer's book written by a wisecracker from Yale donning professorial arrogance. There is nothing new here. Everything was said many times before. Professor Shiller: we know what a Ponzi scheme is, you don't need to tell us again. We also now that if the market goes up the media talks about it more. Why shouldn't it? Isn't it the media's duty to report what is new? The book just happens to come out at the right time, and it may be a part of the current market hysteria. The phenomenon her is not behavioral finance but self-fulfulling prophecies. Bubbles are bubbles, and this book is one full of hot, derivative air!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Irrational read","review":"I saw Mr. Shiller on CNN pumping this book and let me say the man is \\"irrational\\". He actually said bonds are a better investment than stocks. Let me see at around 6% a bond will only help my money keep up with inflation. History shows no better place for your money to be but in the stock market. I question any advice from a man who would only invest in bonds. He reminds me of most old school economists who have no understanding of the current market and can only rationalize it as a bubble. If you insist on reading this book may I also suggest balancing it out by reading \\"The New Era of Wealth\\" by Brian S. Wesbury."},{"rating":"2","title":"4 stars only because a bit dated","review":"A must read for anyone who has begun to question the received knowledge about investing and the stock market (efficient market, 12% long range growth rate, etc.) A reality check for anyone who has believed the results of an online calculator from practically any popular \\"individual investor\\" web site and been confident their portfolio will last 30 years at a 7%-up withdrawal rate, and similar fables dished out by the popular press during the tech/Internet boom that just busted.Fascinating book, sounds prophetic in places in light of current economic/market conditions."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Cautionary View of the Stock Markets.","review":"In this well-researched book, Robert Shiller explains how investors are led to speculate as if in the new economy there is no risk of a downturn.He presents plenty of evidence to show how mass psychology and behavior have created what has come to resemble a speculative bubble. Providing extensive statistical evidence, Shiller also shows how economists and commentators in the media justify higher market levels based on theories about the efficiency and behavior of the new stock market. The book concludes with a warning on the serious implications of this speculative behavior and offers some suggestions to investors and institutions to minimize their risk."},{"rating":"1","title":"Needs editing, more structure and substance","review":"Given Shiller's reputation as an academic who has studied financial markets for a long time I expected the book to provide substance to the notion that what we are seeing is irrational exhuberance in the stock market. What we get is a book that gives some broad ideas without enough structure and well thought explanations. Introducing insights from behavioral finance and psychology is innovative but the author does not even provide a coherent explanation of the role they play. I would wait to read a second edition once somebody has made a thorough editorial check. I was basically disappointed. I expected more than I got and paid for."},{"rating":"2","title":"You want to read this book","review":"A fantastic overview of the follies of the investing public throughout history. Should have been mandatory reading back when it was originally published."},{"rating":"2","title":"The most bearish book ever","review":"Shiller has written a book that calls for a huge correction, arguing that people are very irrationally bidding up prices. This book appears to be a response to Dow 36,000 by Glassman and Hassett. They mention Shiller, until now a professor and not an author, and talk about why he is likely wrong. Shiller doesn't really have a response to their arguments that people are wising up to the truth about stocks; they are a good buy and not that risky if you are in for the long run. I was disappointed about that, and feel that someone who wants to become informed needs to read both this book and Dow 36,000."},{"rating":"1","title":"Irrational Exuberance - a great disappointment","review":"I was excited to hear about this book and its analysis of today and yesterday's stock market bubble. However, the book offers nothing new. It hinges on the idea that history is bound to repeat itself. His examination of psychology compared to prior crashes is weak because he only concentrates on the smaller picture. His understanding of the techological advances in the last decade is is even worse. In one chapter he regards the internet as a future form of entertainment, nothing more. He makes no mention of the increasing role of women in the workplace, the drastic increase in mortality rates, etc.. etc.. etc..If you want to read a good book on speculation, by \\"Devil Takes the Hindsmost.\\" By far, a much better book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Long By About 286 Pages (The Book Is 296 Pages Long)","review":"I found Professor Schiller's book painful in the extreme. Most of his conclusions could have been summarized in the first paragraph, or perhaps in a longer magazine article. While his views are based on solid academic research, which is hard to dispute, one could do without the pedantic history lesson and the constant pats on the back for clever questionaire solicitation. Too little attention is paid to the rise of Index Funds and the survivorship bias in the market indexes, as well as the irrationality of the day trader and the Internet market, which further feeds into the Index system. In addition, the section on investor psycology is cursory. One should read Cialdini's book on persuasion to get a better glimpse into what might really be going on in the markets today."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too much of not much new for most of us...","review":"If you already appreciate that markets (especially stock markets) are prone to periodic \\"speculatory bubbles\\" whose primary cause is greed and herd-behavior, then you know most of what this book has to offer. Shiller presents lots and lots of possible causes, but since he can't demonstrate their relative, quantative effect, I see little point.There is no real investment advice save \\"diversify.\\" There was an interesting appendix on using commodities as a diversification, but the conclusion is there are no really good ways at present.Perhaps the most interesting passage was where he described how people hearing his warning lecture just before the 2000 crash, some of whom agreed with him, went out and bought anyway! This brings home the extraordinary psychological power of these speculatory markets.I suppose that researchers or those in search of extreme data might find some interest here, but it seems much-too-much detail (to little avail) for most investors."},{"rating":"1","title":"not much food","review":"not much food in the book overall..a very shallow and general talk, but i found it interesting to see his comments (p220) on the interest rate and other potential risks in the mortgage market back in 2005. some of the points he mentioned are indeed drivers of the recent subprime meltdown"},{"rating":"1","title":"iffy","review":"dude is intellectually dishonest and an iffy teacher. but has some interesting things to say. could be worth your effort."},{"rating":"2","title":"Prophetic","review":"It is unfortunate that more people did not read Shiller's Irrational Exuberance when it was first published. In retrospect, his insights were prophetic. If you are looking for a \\"how to get rich\\" book or a book with specific investing ideas, this book is not for you. If you want a book that will challenge the way you think about investments, this book is for you. Shiller's writing style is clear and organized; he provides real-world examples and statistics throughout the book. Reading this book helps provide a format for thinking about the market and investments."},{"rating":"2","title":"great read","review":"this is a very good book from an economist who has a balanced view on social and behavioral economics.He is one of the very few grounded economist that i know of."},{"rating":"1","title":"Far too speculative","review":"While I applaud Professor Shiller's attempt to move away from the basic idea that capital markets are efficient, I had a lot of trouble with his discussion of psychological reasons for market inefficiencies. The arguments may sound plausible to the uninformed reader, but I believe that most psychologists would find his arguments untenable. They are not based on strong evidence and they often are drawn from research on tasks which may or may not bear any resemblance to investing, e.g., jury decision making. I found this part of the book to be making far too many leaps of faith."},{"rating":"2","title":"An awesome book!","review":"I read the 1st edition of this book, by Princeton University Press, and I think Robert Shiller did a great job at the time of publication. Everybody was dazzled by the impressive performance of the market, and nobody would dare to be against it, none but Dr. Robert Shiller did! I revised the interview he held with the journalist George Will, and it is shameful seeing that Shiller's job, in that moment was not recognized as it should be, but we should know that predicting is fortune tellers' job, and Shiller is no fortune teller... he is a common sensical and brilliant academic."},{"rating":"2","title":"An ovation for Mr. Shiller","review":"If you read this book when it was published, it served as a warning about the market. If you are reading it in the summer of 2002, it will serve as an explanation of the market.

I tried watching this episode in an area without 4g, 3g is a little sketchy - complete failure, tried for a half an hour or so with reload after reload.

I purchased the DVDs and have now spent more money to purchase the instant video so I can watch the missing episodes. Very unfair of Amazon to not mention the missing episodes in the description of the product. Also amazing that half a season is priced the same as a full season.

I think you may be able to attach straps to it to wear it, but I have not figured out that part and there are no instructions on how to do it.

This saddle pad is super if you have an older horse who is back-sore or a fantastic, light training pad for your green horse. I have the pad in pink/burgundy and I hope to get more soon for my horse! The colors are beautiful and what makes the pad even better is that it is reversible! A fantastic offer because it is almost like you have 2 saddle pads in one! Dirt, hair, sweat and marks wash off the pad well and the colors do not fade in the wash.I ride hunter/jumper, dressage, and cross country and this saddle pad has been fine for schooling in all. It does not get too sweaty after jumping cross-country for an hour in direct sunlight!This is a fantastic saddle pad, and you won't be disapointed!"},{"rating":"1","title":"ok","review":"My dog is only a 20# Daschund and within just a few times of using this frisbee it was ripped in half.

From page 183 on, this book is a near exact copy of _Citizen Soliders_. Citizen Soldiers covers the fighting from after D-Day to V-E day, focusing on the enlisted and NCO's. In _Victors_ from about page 180 to the end, the text seems to be lifted verbatim from that excellent book. I haven't read all his D-Day and Eisenhower books, but I imagine that the first section borrows heavily from that. The bottom line is that this is a nice book, but if you've read his other books, it's not new. Think of this as Ambrose's \\"Greatest Hits\\" and you have the idea. Still, on it's own, it's a good book, especially for the budding historian."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Victors: A Great Book","review":"Though I seldom read history books, I thoroughly enjoyed this very interesting account of World War II from D-Day forward.

Most films and many books ridicule those who are most responsible for the success of the great generals: the junior officer. JO's are the front-line supervisors of the war effort, most responsible for transmitting the orders and vision of the great leaders to the fighting men. It was good to read of hardship and heroism for the junior officers and the senior NCOs. These people are the backbone of any military unit. Ambrose does a fantastic job of weaving the stories and experiences of these men into a cohesive tale. Highly recommended for those who have a vague idea of the costs and sacrifice of war, but who would like to learn more. Hopefully, this --as well as Ambrose's other works-- will help those who have never served in the armed forces gain appreciation for America's veterans."},{"rating":"1","title":"A rehash of previous Ambrose books","review":"If you own or have read Citizen Soldiers and D-Day by StephenAmbrose you do not need to read this book.

Stephen Ambrose makes a very valuable contribution to that effort with his work. I have read other books by Ambrose on this subject, and others. If the reader has not read other books by this author, then it should be read with a great deal of attention and interest. If, on the other hand, the reader has read other books, such as \\"Band of Brothers,\\" then don't bother with this one. It is the same, verbatim, through large sections. Frankly, I am surprised the publishing company would allow the same book to be repackaged and sold under a different title.

The book concentrates more on the typical GI of WWII rather then the higher commissioned officers, however there are some good stories of Patton, Bradley, Eisenhower, and Monty. Reading this book has made me take on other Ambrose novels such as D-Day, and Citizen Soldiers. There was never a lull in the book, always taught me something I didn't know before. Like all Ambrose novels, this is a must read, especially if you want a generalization of the war in Europe."},{"rating":"1","title":"Self plagerism","review":"If you've read Ambrose's other books (Citizen Soldier, Band of Brothers, Pegasus Bridge for instance) you won't find a single new idea here.

Therefore, the description of the book on this site as well as others I've seen, is inaccurate and misleading.What this book does have are synopsises of several families that lived in County Mayo in the 17th century and before (1 page long generally) and some basic instructions on how to proceed with your genealogical research.It's not a bad book but I think there are good, free resources on the internet as well as a few paid subscription sites that would be more useful to a person researching County Mayo, where few resources survive before 1901."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good for Mayo","review":"This book is more than I expected---lots of things I hadn't even thought of.

I barely had money to pay for it, but bought it anyway. I'm so glad that I did. When I found it I was going through an identify crisis I guess you can say and it changed my life completely. I honestly thought I was the only chicana in the world who felt that way, because the time I picked it up I was being ridiculed by my friends for being a Chicana Falsa.

But this thin little book is a disappointment. The short stories are wrought with a bitterness and hostility towards anyone who crosses the narrator's path. Serros' tries too hard to convey her narrators as victims -- I even know that you don't have to be a chicana to have family members discourage you early on from becoming what you want to be when you grow up, which seems to be a central theme in her book -- that people in her youth kept holding her back.

Ever since 'Gerald's Game', and from then on, I was a little disappointed with the work that was coming from King. But, I never stopped buying and reading, hoping that the writer of 'The Stand' and 'It' would come roaring back. And he did! I loved this book! I was sorry when it had to end.

Bag Of Bones has the character development that creates constant readers and a rich plot that keeps the reader's mind reaching. If some of Mr. King's more fantastic stories left you incredulous get your hands on this haunting tale that blends the things we know, with those we think about only late at night. I was reading Bag of Bones to relax before sleep, when I found myself checking closets, then reading in the vain hope that the author would let me off the hook. Thanks to Mr. King for a most rewarding 48 hours! If only I could pace myself...maybe next time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Classic Stephen King","review":"I felt that in Bag Of Bones Stephen King recaptured the magic present in his earlier works, such as Carrie and The Shining. It's a love story from a male viewpoint (a rare treat) and is filled with suspense. To the lady who was offended by the rape scene: I don't believe it was the author's intention to degregate women. It wasn't for the shock value. I think it was to illustrate how vile the male characters were who mindlessly performed this act of violence. Art often mirrors life, and while rape is something that no woman wants to think can happen to her, it does. It's a brief scene, but crucial in my opinion, to bringing all of the events together."},{"rating":"2","title":"A different kind of King","review":"Great book!

I mean I have always loved King's work but this one resolidified me as a fan and more proof that King knows exactly what he's doing when he writes.The book surrounds Mike Noonan, a writer, who's young wife dies suddenly. After four years of writer's block and never being able to move on Noonan goes to stay at their summer cabin Sara Laughs in a small (you guessed it) Maine town. What follows is a story about lost loves, new friendships and love, haunted houses and a secret that the town has had hidden for over 100 years. For some it might be long (732 pages) but I found its pace to be so good you end up reading it into the wee hours of the night. This is one of those books I just couldn't put down because I wanted to know the solution to the mysteries.Definetly read this book, in a way it's so unlike King's normal ventures because it has a whodunit feel, that is not common to his novels."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not your typical horror","review":"I will let those who think there is more to a book than just a few hours of entertainment, write more detailed, judgemental reviews.

Repeatedly in the book he'll end a chapter saying something along the lines of \\"then all hell broke loose.\\" Then instead of all hell breaking loose, he goes back to working.I must say that the book IS a page-turner. I wanted to know what was going on, what would happen, but there are two kinds of page-turner. Ones that are exciting, and ones that are like Chinese water torture--where you turn the pages because you keep telling yourself SOMETHING will happen soon!

I cared about the main characters, but the story strayed from them too often. I hated the ending, in the same way I hated 'City of Angels'.

Thoughts and scary dreams--which the scary dreams were few--wasn't what I was in the mood for from a Stephen King book. I guess you could call it interesting reading from certain individuals. If he's going to write horror than do it and not fool his fans with experiments. During the third part of the book, nothing at all happened to encourage me to read any further. I expect murder and mayhem at least--it dosen't have to be constant--just give us a little taste at the beginning so we have someting to look forward to. He's been writing a long time and I know the urge to stray to new horizons is tempting if not irresistible. Stephen King writes horror and that's what I want."},{"rating":"1","title":"I CAN'T THINK OF ANYTHING OTHER THAN BORING.","review":"I'VE HAD THIS BOOK FOR 30 DAYS NOW AND I'M NOT EVEN HALF WAY THROUGH AND I READ IT EVERY EVENING.

I'M ONLY HOPING THAT AS I GET FARTHER INTO THE BOOK SOMETHING WILL HAPPEN THAT APPEALS TO ME TO KEEP ON PRODDING ALONG. SO FAR, SO BAD. MAYBE I'LL FINISH THIS BY THE TIME MR.

I read everything he writes and while I can't rate them all five stars I truly have enjoyed each of his novels to date. What a shock to read Bag of Bones. I kept closing the book and looking at the cover... Is this an Ann Rice novel? It started like King but unlike his other novels I was reading 3 to 5 pages a day instead of 50 to 100. It was becoming an effort. And then it got worse. Let's spend time developing characters, twisting them & then kill them off. Save your money. Don't buy this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"boring","review":"This book takes to long to get into. It's good if you like long first person narratives. The middle was good but the beginning and ends were so so."},{"rating":"1","title":"As the screw tightens and other horror tales","review":"If you think this hunk of badly written junk is something, then you haven't read the tales of the great Southern writer of horror, T.N. His wonderful trip into the unknown called Splattered Raw, was a great novel turned into a feature film, about death, love and chopped off hands and feet. Now that is horror, not one more King creation, brooding over a bat, or a house that needs to be dusted and swept. Get the real master of horror, T.N. and let him create a great movie and get King outta here. VIVA LE PUBLIC ACCESS!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Let Down","review":"Having just finished the novel, I realize that my investment of time has returned too little too late. As I plowed through, I began to think the great reviews may be attributed to the many King deciples out there who simply worship anything with his name on it. Nothing in the story engaged me on any level, as other King tales have over the years. No suspense, fear, insight into the human condition, that the earlier King classics are kown for. The attempt was made by both the author and this old King fan, but it never clicked."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing.","review":"I usually enjoy reading King, with this book I just keep waiting for the end. This book goes on forever and says nothing. There are moments of brilliance but it's painful to get to them. The characters are not very well developed, I've read almost the entire book and can't say I know any of them or want to. I think if the \\"romance\\" between Mike and Mattie had been left out, I could have had more respect for them both . Mike dosen't act like a man of forty, but a boy of fourteen! I don't think the book is \\"Bad\\", but I do wish I had missed this one. Anne and Steven please have mercy and bring the magic back."},{"rating":"1","title":"It lacked substance and excitement","review":"I am normally a big fan of King. However, I was not very fond of \\"Bag of Bones\\". It took 560 pages to tell a short story. The book lacked that certain fire that King normally has which prevents a person from putting down the book. The plot was so slow and mundane that I would put the Book down for weeks and not missing a thing when I picked it back up. This is certainly not characteristic of Mr. King's Novels."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bag of Bore","review":"I love Stephen King. I have been reading him since he wrote Carrie back in the '70's. Lately, I find his books to be getting somewhat boring and hackish.After the overly ambitious and self-indulgent tomes, Desperation and The Regulators; I was hoping for something better.The book starts with a bang and then whimpers along. Towards the end the book fizzles out like a old sparkler. The scariest thing King can come up with is a mean old rich man, a vengeful ghost and a town who seems to share a collective consciousness. When the big revelation is that most people in the town named their kids with names beginning \\"K\\", I wonder; what has King come too?He's done much scarier ghost stories (The Shining), more scarier little towns with a dark secret (It, 'Salem's Lot, etc.) and books that had more menace in their margins than a page of this book.King needs a vacation."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent! Heart-wrenching tale","review":"This book, frankly when I saw the title, didn't really appeal to me. However, when I finished the book, I realised something: King had changed his style. It was a pleasant change and it tugged at my heart-strings several times. Lovely masterpiece! Absolute classic!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome Ghost Story","review":"This is a great ghost story. Stephen King has been seeming to get away from his spooky type of stories in recent years and this book restored my faith in him. I like his other stories as well, but I was beginning to miss the really scary ones. This book is just that. There is just the right touch of the supernatural along with lots of realism. You feel like you are right there with the characters. I could barely put it down. I loved it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"IT TOOK JUST A DAY","review":"It took just a day to read BAG OF BONES because it is such a gripping novel that once u start it its really hard to let it go, at least that was the case with me.Stephen King is at his best in this novel as he had also added a little touch of romance to one of his most horror tales.It was a little harsh to give it 4 stars but i it was just because of a little flaw in the book which i guess all people will agree with the ending.But i guess it was not a love story i was reading after all it was a horror and indeed one of KING's best"},{"rating":"1","title":"It's just me","review":"I haven't read that many books by Stephen King, although in general I do like his books. The reason why I read this book, Bag of Bones, was purely coincidental. I stayed the holidays at my parents house and forgot to bring a book. Horror beyond imagination. So I started reading the dutch translation of Bag of Bones which is Vel over Been by the way. The book didn't do it for me. I wasn't horrified and the story didn't really appeal to me. It was not like the horror I felt in IT or the involvement I got with The Talisman To briefly sketch the story: It's about Jack Noonan a popular writer who after his wife dies starts getting nightmares about his summerhouse 'Sara Laughs'. As he has nothing better to do he decides after four years to go back to 'Sara Laughs' and finds himself getting terrorized by the house and the hostile village people. Sometimes a book is well written but just doesn't do it for me. Thats what I had with Bag of Bones."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible!","review":"I usually can't put a Stephen King book down, this one I hard a hard time picking it back up. It was so boring! The whole first 1/2 of this book, could have been condensed into 1 small Chapter! He really drug it out - I hope this doesn't indicate a change in writing style, because if his next one is this boring I won't force myself through the whole thing, which is what I had to do with \\"Bag of Bones\\". I'm really disappointed, and I've always been a King fan."},{"rating":"1","title":"Like fishing with barbless hooks","review":"As happy as I was to see a new title emerge from the mind of the master, I felt cheated at the end.Though Stephen King can bait his situations with his careful turn-of-phrase, I felt like every time I went for the hook, I got caught, pulled in the boat, laughed at, and tossed back in the lake untouched. After I turned page #400 I knew I had to stay in the woods until the last ghost was flushed out, even though I wanted to leave.Lots of great tricks in this book...I think maybe I'm outgrowing ghost stories. Or maybe they just have to be less 'commercial.'"},{"rating":"1","title":"This novel dragged like the proverbial BAG of Bones","review":"It was the most boring King book I have ever read. I vowed to stop reading after the ridiculous plot of Rose Madder, however I got sucked back in with the promise of a love story and a new direction for King.

Here is it: It's 700 pages in the paperback. I KNOW that Kings takes time to get going... but he does not get going after 100, after 300 but only after 500... and that's just a bit too long. There are however some very good moments in this book. It really got to me when Mattie dies. However i don't think that his racial commentary adds anything new to what's out there already. He can do much better and will, i'm sure... fingers crossed. I still like Stephen King a lot, don't get me wrong here! He's one of my favorite authors."},{"rating":"1","title":"Certainly not one of King's better books!","review":"This book caught me hook, line, and sinker at first. I had my nose in it every night! I was terribly disappointed when the plot began to weaken toward the end with the whole Mattie/Kyra scene, though. King brought in so many characters that the story became a web of confusion. I would find myself having to go back and re-read what I had already read just to keep track of the story line. I ended the book with a \\"That was IT?\\" attitude. Let's get back to the old Stephen King writing style."},{"rating":"2","title":"First King book I ever read","review":"I must admit I was never a King fan, but I found myself in the airport for a long flight with nothing to read and picked it up. I would have given this book 5 stars if not for the end. I had a hard time puting the book down and when I got to the last three or four chapters it took me 2 weeks! to finish it. Very big disappoint for the ending. I finshied it only because I finish every book I start, but I did skip a few pages at the end just to get through it."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's not my Favorite, but it's certainly not his worst.","review":"I've been a King fan since I started highschool and convinced my overprotective mother that I was old enough to read his novels, and in that time the only Stephen King Novel that disapointed me was Bag of Bones. Now, don't get me wrong it's not that I don't like it, and I'm not one of those King fans that think his only good stuff is his trademark horror. I just felt that this one left something out. I often felt annoyed at King's work because they were so engrossing I'd spend the $25 on the book and finish it in a few days, even The Stand (unabridged, obviously) The problem with Bag of Bones was there just didn't seem to be that hypnotic effect that kept me up until 6am reading. It was very well written and an excellent novel, but it took me more than a month to finish it. If you want to be completely engrosed in a King novel read Dark Tower IV. If you just want a good story that you can read at a nice relaxed pace, get Bag of Bones."},{"rating":"1","title":"A very, very slow start, with a good ending","review":"I would like echo the view of a previous reviewer that the first 100 pages could have and should have been torn out. It has to be the dullest thing Stephen King has ever written, punctuated with enough sex to make me wonder if the author is going through a midlife crisis. The last 20% of the book was a fairly good ghost story, but the first 80% drags so much that it was hard to engender much excitement."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing. King can do better.","review":"Sub-standard King. Pace is slow, payoff is disappointing. Not at all near his usual standards. Too bad, because he is a great storyteller. Skip this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where's the Gunslinger?","review":"After reading Insomnia, I wondered if Steven King had become too powerful a writer to use an editor. After all, King himself says he has elephantitis of the mouth. I am glad to see he has gone with an editor for this one. Still, long and dreary with too little action and too much rumination. I sincerely wish he would stick with The Gunslinger series as it is the best he is currently writing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Like a derailed freight train.","review":"First, let me explain the Four stars, even though I wasn't impressed with this story, its still Stephen King, and I couldn't give less than Four stars simply because one flop doesn't mean its over. I started this book with all the gusto I start all of Kings books. This story had so much potential from the start, I thought this was going to be the best I had read, and until I got about half way through it I thought I had been right. All of a sudden it quit, like someone had pulled the plug on a hairdryer, it was just gone. I think it took a wrong turn and like most people didn't want to stop and ask directions. I have always been a huge King fan and have always liked every story. Lets hope the next stays one on the right path, that left turn at Albuerque is always a tricky one."},{"rating":"2","title":"S-P-O-O-K-Y! It Blew me away!","review":"This is the first Stephen King book I have read and actually finished. His characters were just so amazing, and they seemed so real. This book was full of suprises and lots of scares! I am in the 8th grade and I finished the 30 chapter book in 11 days. Now that I have read my first Stephen King book I would like to continue reading more of his books. For anyone who would enjoy reading a thrilling novel I suggest you check out Stephen King's \\"Bag of Bones\\". It's a story that will stick to you and you will definitely enjoy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Haunting","review":"This book has a way of getting under your skin. While it is not a straight up horror story it is a haunting ghost story that has stayed with me longer than most of Stephen King's books have. Read it if you like King but stay away if you are sqeamish about graphic rape scenes."},{"rating":"2","title":"My favorite of King's Works","review":"I am an avid reader of Stephen King. I have found his horror novels to be gripping and exiting. However this book is the best of his that i have read. It is a haunting story, that both scared me in parts and deeply touched me in others. King has proved that he is able to write more than horror with books such as Different Seasons and The Green Mile. What this book does is combines his mastery of the Horror genre with his ability to generate deeply touching literature. King's hardcore horror fans will be disappointed with this book, but personally i recommend this to everyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"EXTREMELY MOVING, VERY EMOTIONAL","review":"I just can't understand any negative reviews this book has received. It certainly is a departure from King's normal style, but is by far his best work in many years. King appears to be concentrating not on the horror of ghosts, mallet-wielding maniacs, or rabid dogs, but rather the more realistic horror of such things as loss, grief, and even love.My only complaint does not target this novel specifically, but rather his style. I wonder why King feels that it's necessary to end his stories on a very bittersweet note (i.e. killing a very endearing character). Yes, tragedy is a very real part of life. But happy endings are too, and it would be nice to get one from King every once in a blue moon.Still a very worthwhile, romantic novel with enough creepy scenes to satisfy readers yearning for the Stephen King of old."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved the \\"Fridgerator People\\"...","review":"I have only read 3 Stephen King novels in my life, Bag of Bones being #3. The other two were Salem's Lot and Dolores Claborne. I don't care for Horror that much and was glad to find this wasn't that scary. It was an interesting read because it took almost all 500 pages to find out the actual meaning of all the goings-on...I found myself coming up with my own guesses several times in the course of reading it. I did like the little messages on the Fridge. I just wondered why the ghosts didn't just bang out their messages on the typewriter. (I guess some didn't know what a typewriter was!) I find myself glancing at my refridgerator to see if I have any spooks giving me messages....All in all this was a good Ghost Story and would make a good movie. Hopefully, SK doesn't have writers block and isn't sick of writing. Was this one of the one's he had in a vault for years?? I guess time will tell!"},{"rating":"2","title":"King is still King","review":"Once again Stephen King has given us as much or as little as we wish to take. In his own unique way, he has left it up to us, the reader, to set our pace and make the story as spooky or scary as we want it to be. When will everyone realize he is the ultimate horror writer, because he leads us down the path only so far, then leaves us there to scare ourselves. Thank you once again, Mr. King"},{"rating":"2","title":"Different yet familiar.","review":"When you think of Stephen King, you think of the weird and more often than not, lots of blood and guts. This book isn't like that at all. In fact for the first few hundred pages, I thought this was going to turn out to be a fiction book all the way through. There is much emphasis on \\"humanness\\" and the normality of things that we do every day. I think that is what made this book all the more frightening in the and and it most certainly does get frightening. From the very beginning the plot twists and turns. You think you know where it is going, but in the end you have no idea as. The book slowly converts itself into a very mysterious and very scary ghost story.As is always the case with King, the characters are great. I liked the first person narrative style of this novel, it fit in very well with the emotion events that the main character had faced and his explanations of them. Additionally, Kyra, the little girl is portrayed very well.In this case, different is good."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gave me nightmares...","review":"Some of King's more recent efforts have been disappointing, Gerald's Game comes to mind. But first with Desperation and now Bag of Bones he has once again proven to be one of the most talented storytellers of our time. Stylistically, Bag of Bones represented a welcomed departure from most of his works. King seemed at home with the first person narrative, a style I hope he returns to in the future. To sum it up I would rank this his second best book, only behind The Stand."},{"rating":"2","title":"Some good \\"old-fashioned\\" King.","review":"I feel like I was visiting an old friend reading Bag of Bones. Some of King's later works (minus the Dark Tower series) have left me wanting these past few years. While I was intrigued with the main character, for the first 2/3 of the book I was wondering where all the scary stuff was. Suddenly my breathing stopped and my heart began to pound. It's all there. I recommend it heartily!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic read!!!!","review":"I had not read any King in quite awhile before picking up this book. But my love of ghost stories lead me to give it a whirl. Well, I found the book to be moving and scary as hell!!! While it would seem the number of plots and subplots would threaten to overthrow the story, King weaves them together wonderfully. I especially enjoyed the scene where...well, I won't spoil anything but I love how King allows you pages and pages to really fall in love with these characters and put yourself in the happy place with them before tragedy strikes. The only negative comment here is about the book's climax. Like many of King's stories it takes a nosedive into \\"what the hell?\\" territory!! Does anyone else remember the King story where the super secret magic weapon was a rolled up ball of licorice? Same feeling going on here. Otherwise, great read!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Perhaps I Shouldn't Have Waited So Long","review":"A bit of background; in my younger days I was a huge Stephen King fan, voraciously reading anything and everything he wrote. Then about 10 or so years ago I began to grow tired of his fare, it began to sound repititious and tiresome and I stopped reading him altogether. Bag of Bones is my first foray back to the world of Stephen King and while not my favorite King book, I was not disappointed. There is no doubt, Stephen King can write a scary tale that will keep you reading and guessing. Bag of Bones is no exception. This novel doesn't quite fall into the \\"horror\\" category, perhaps ghost story/love story describes it best. If I wanted to be picky I could come up with some minor criticisms (especially about the ending), but for fans or lapsed ones like me, Bag of Bones delivers the goods."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another King Winner","review":"Fantastic read full of drama, suspense, a few ghosts, and great emotion. Another King novel that when I finish I am sad not to continue to read about the characters. Highly recommended. Once you've finished Bag og Bones check out 11/22/63- absolutely wonderful!"},{"rating":"2","title":"In a Class by Itself","review":"King's \\"Bag of Bones\\" starts out with a haunted house in the country, but I can't go much further and reveal what this novel is really about without giving the plot away. But I can tell you that it cuts deeper to the American bone than other King novels I've read. The ones about the telekinetic virgin, the jealous Plymouth and the genocidal superflu were quite well done, but \\"Bag of Bones\\" is in a class by itself. In my opinion it represents a new high for King and he is truly at the peak of his powers. I hope he hasn't run away from his fans; I hope he continues to grow and expand as an artist."},{"rating":"2","title":"Maybe not the best, but certainly good.","review":"This book is certainly worth taking the time to read. King keeps on showing us \\"constant readers\\" that he is by far the best literary genius of our time."},{"rating":"1","title":"He's getting more like a machine than a writer, Dry.","review":"I'm sorry that I keep ready his books. They seem to me that they losing there uniqeness. He still does occasionally do a good one, ie: The Green Mile, but Bag of Bones was just not that good. Not scary at all, just kinda there. No real meat in the book, just like he wrote it because he had to."},{"rating":"1","title":"feels like a \\"saver\\"","review":"After reading this book, I got the distinct impression that just like his lead character, King had been keeping this book shelved somewhere \\"just in case\\". I was already one third of the way into the book before anything REALLY good (you know the stuff we buy horror books for)happened and I would only consider that a \\"catflinger\\". I've read almost all of King's work as well as a great deal of horror fiction and I must say I was disappointed. If not for the distinct Maine-isms it almost felt like it was written by an imposter."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not that great, Stephen.","review":"This book is definately one I couldn't place on my top Stephen King books. It just wasn't up to standards. It had everything a good Stephen King book has (a few murders, a few dead spirits that won't stay dead, a few evil beings, etc.), but it wasn't put together well. I found it difficult to understand. There were times during the book I just wanted to close those few chapters into darkness and take it back to the library. I didn't, hoping that the next scene would bring back the old Stephen King, but my wish was never fulfilled. I just pray his next book isn't anything like BAG OF BONES."},{"rating":"1","title":"wrier's block???","review":"once again, Mr. king writes about himself as the main character. Muli-book deals, high paid author, and the inability to produce on paper anything worthy of the consumers money. perhaps it is his notion to continually publish at the holiday season and live off the reputation of his early writing days to land the big bucks. Try working a little harder next time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hated It!","review":"I am a huge fan of S. King and usually love all of his stuff. This latest offering, however, stinks to high heaven. It started off very well but the story never really developed. I never really knew what was going on. By the end I had lost interest. I still love the King and will alway buy his books on their release date."},{"rating":"1","title":"When will you resume your writing, Steve ?","review":"I hope there are other people like me out there, people who read all Stephen King's books, who where disappointed by most of them (especially at the end where obviously SK panicks about finishing his book with some kind of - usually missed - climax), yet who loved \\"Misery\\" and \\"Dolores Claiborne\\" because the only monsters were 100% human. Cujo was very good too.To these people, I advise to skip \\"Bag of Bones\\". Once more, SK puts in some useless \\"Fantastic\\" (a haunted house, can you believe it ?).Still, a few good kingisms (e.g. the CYBERSPACE SCARED ME SO BAD I DOWNLOADED IN MY PANTS sticker which made me laugh for about 2 days).Please Steve, keep them simple..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sleeping pill alternative","review":"Oh Please! This was one of King's most boring books I have read. I did not find anything deep or profound in it like some other reviewers did. But then I don't read King for those \\"deeper\\" insights. It took forever for the story to develop and was altogether too predictable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great writing without a punchline","review":"I read this book expecting the great Stephen King-ness I always do (i.e. The Green Mile, Thinner) and what I got was about 600 pages of....I'm still not sure. What I got was a mish mosh of allegorical characters, good against evil and flashbacks mixed in with real life that I kept reading through in hopes that it would make sense in the end-which it did not! I love Stephen King, his writing style is superb as always but if I'm going to read a 600 page book, I need it to have a point-which this one sadly did not. Hope my next venture into the King's work will be more rewarding, but if you're looking for dramatically creepy and sometimes tragic, all signifying nothing, then perhaps you will be more fulfilled than I was."},{"rating":"1","title":"Couldn't finish it.","review":"The book actually had me until our poor hero is swimming away for his life from two octogenarians taunting and pelting him with rocks. I, to use one of King's most oft-overused descriptions, laughed until tears rolled down my cheeks. I just kept thinking, why doesn't he just climb out of the water and push them over? That and I am tired of overwritten abuse/molestation angles in writing. It just bores me."},{"rating":"2","title":"I loved this book.","review":"Wow! This book blew me away. It's a bit slow at the beginning but once it takes off it really takes off. I take my hat off to King for giving his fans another great choice at the bookstore. Thanks Mr. King."},{"rating":"2","title":"He Did It Again!!","review":"No one writes dialogue quite like S. King. Though I prefer some King books over others, the dialogue is always first rate. He also develops his characters very quickly. The perfect example is the little girl, Ki, in \\"Bag of Bones.\\" I could see this child with perfect clarity when our main character, Mike, first spotted her marching down the road with her cap on backwards and announcing she was \\"mad as hell.\\" In this work his dialogue was exceptionally well written making me laugh aloud, anxious,etc. And I must wonder if Mr. King has had a major loss in his life as he seems to understand grief so well. It is a great book and surprisingly enough a haunting romance. Readers, it is well worth the time."},{"rating":"2","title":"He Scared Me Again","review":"I stopped reading fiction about 1990. Before that, I had read everything available from Mr. King. A recent operation prompted me to buy his book, \\"Bag of Bones\\", because I thought I would be laid up for awhile and I wanted something to pass the time. Boy, was I surprised! After two or three jump starts at the book, I got into it and Hannah hold the door! My wife thought that I was posessed because I was so engrossed in the story.At one point, I was alone in the house, and I had to look over my shoulder to see if anything was behind me. It was broad daylight and I am a wizzened old man of 45(scared like a child) That is what makes a Stephen King novel.My family wishes him a speedy recovery from his recent tradegy."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great read!","review":"I was late to the King party but sinse pickking up \\"The Stand\\" a few years ago have read most of his books. This one pulled me right in and held me until the very end. Although lengthy, I felt it was all very relavent to the depth of the story. The rock throwing incident was truly chilling and really makes you think about how quickly things can escalate. Overall a very enjoyable story but I am glad I didn't read it on a stormy night in the woods."},{"rating":"2","title":"Started out good, but...","review":"I've been a King fan for 16 years. I've read it all (I do have a prefrence for the weird stuff). This book was very good even though it was very different. I was very much hooked, then...not. The day of the Bar-B-Que was were I got lost. Things happened way to fast and not very clearly. Maybe I'll read it again in the future and have a better appreciation for it (as I did w/Carrie...hated it the first time, read it again a little while ago and it was O.K.). Still, so far, Desperation, The Tommyknockers, It, and The Dark Tower series are my favs. O.K., Mr. King, when is the next installment of Roland's adventures???"},{"rating":"2","title":"Emotional journey.","review":"I don't read American fiction very often, but I read in recent days Bag of Bones, which I enjoyed very much, as too I read The Triumph and the Glory, which was magnificence and renown.

I had only read Pet Semetary, and found it silly. But Bag of Bones goes way beyond the \\"horror\\" genre: it is a strong and moving morality tale, a very scary cautionary tale (i.e., beware of saving little girls who wander into the middle of the road), a very sexy romance, a well researched history lesson, and above all an un-put-downable narrative.I was wrong about King. He's GOOD! Let him write more like this!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow I couldnt stop reading this book","review":"This book started out slow and I was hoping it would pick up. Boy did it ever!! There was one part in the book where the main character was confused and so was I, just when I thought I knew if he was dreaming or it was really happening I was slammed back into confusion. I felt like I was right there with the character. At times I felt overloaded with info and wanted to skip to the next page but of course I couldnt. This is one of Kings greatest books. It has everything. heartache, love, lust, ghosts, good guys, bad guys. And I cant wait to see how it ends but saddened to say goodbuy to another good book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Leisurely paced","review":"I think that King has achieved a new level of ability with this book.

I don't care for the horror genre, and this does not qualify for it. I picked it up one day, started to read, and was caught up in it. It was wonderful. I was there, in Maine, transported. An amazing, engrossing, absorbing story full of humor, love, mystery, and charm. This was one I couldn't put down and it was very difficult waiting to get back to the world of Mike Noonan. After reading this book, I went back to other reviews and have found it said that this is atypical of King's work. I'm so thankful I picked up this book and will never forget it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Stephen King's Bag of Bones: A Terrific Ghost Story","review":"As a long time Stephen King fan, I expect to enjoy his books.

I got turned off to his work and haven't read anything by him since. But this book brought me back. It was wonderfully written. King really makes you care about his characters. It was scary, but most of all it was a tragic love story. As you read the book you come to understand the double, or maybe triple, meaning in the title, a nice extra touch. This book reminded me of The Dead Zone, which is more of a love story than a horror novel. I loved that one and I love this one too. I would highly recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent book! Pure Stephen King!","review":"This book is going to become a favorite. Unlike some of the books he's had in the last few years. This one is more like the old King. I have been an avid King fan since high school and while this book is not as scary as the Shining or as riviting as The Stand it is an excellent book. You find yourself turning the pages quickly tring to find out what the secret is in this town. You also want everything to turn out happy but you know that it can't. It is the best book I've read latly."},{"rating":"2","title":"Couldn't stop...","review":"I even fell asleep while reading this one because I was reading for HOURS. I usually have to read a sentence 4 times before I can really understand it, but his writing is so mentally stimulating that I have a picture of the scene as soon as I read the words--and I can't stop. Not too scary--not gory; but an edge-of-your-seat feeling right to the end."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is a very good novel","review":"When I read about Bag of Bones on the back of the novel I didn't think much of it.

This is a must read.

He reveals the pieces of the puzzle little by litte, and even when it gets scary, the novel keeps love as the tie that binds"},{"rating":"2","title":"My Opinion...","review":"This was an excellent addition to the Stephen King collection. The character flow was good and the story was easy to follow. But the ending, like many of his novels, lacked some direction.

This time he gets you where it hurts. King has progressed past just scaring you to death, this time he moves you in the most unexpected fashion. The real story here is about a love that will never die. He is moving onto a whole new level here,and I am honored to go with him. This truly is a haunted ghost story."},{"rating":"2","title":"The New Stephen King lives up to his task","review":"This is a great read. Stephen Kings new writing is just as good as always.... only from a different angle. The characters and plot are a little hard to understand in the beginning but all come together wonderfully, which is the idea. I hate reading books that make everything clear right from the start....nothin to guess and wonder about! I spent my whole birthday lying in bed reading this book it had my attention so much! Three days of non stop reading.... and the end was just perfect. Not all sunny where everyone wins in the end, but enough to not be disappointed. GREAT Book! Full of wonder and suspense."},{"rating":"2","title":"A real gem","review":"This book was mature and well-written, with an attention to detail unique to Steven King. His ability to capture nuance is unparalleled.There were so many random images and \\"loose ends\\" in this novel making it difficult to see how they were all going to fit together, but by the end it all made perfect sense. This is a writer who has so much craftsmanship at this point in his career, it's just a pleasure to read, following him into the dark and knowing that there will be gratification at the other end."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hit me below the belt","review":"Bag of Bones is billed as a \\"haunted love story.\\" Fans of Stephen King may hope for the same quality that haunts his other stories, and not be disappointed. Fans of love stories will find a Stephen King who, while not necessarily a stranger to his loyal readers, may seem unusual. This is a story that could very well have taken place at any time, in any of our most real-life scenarios, vengeful shades aside, and the emotion which characterizes the events of the story is beautiful and heartbreaking."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best edited King book yet!","review":"Finally an editor has taken King's considerable talent and reined it in. For the most part I stopped reading him years ago when his publishers (I presume) pushed him to justify his high book prices by shameless inflation of the number of words used. If anyone doubts this, listen to most of the books on tape versions. But this new book had all my attention. He has the ability, but like Robin Williams, he needs a guiding hand or the point gets lost in the verbiage."},{"rating":"1","title":"The most boring book that has ever been written.","review":"I have always been the most ardent fan of Stephen King; however, this book is the worst that he has ever had the misopportunity to come up with. It took me two weeks to trudge through it. The only reason I finished the book was because I started it.The book was not suspenseful or haunting. The characters were uninteresting and seemed as if they had rather been somewhere else. Mr. King needs to get back to the subject matter that made him the great author, and quit writting books that just sell for his name and no other reason. I would not suggest this book for reading."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too much fluff, writing leaves nothing to the imagination.","review":"How can a writer the caliber of Stephen King write a hundred pages and say nothing? I cannot even get past Chapter 4. I have every book he has written since Carrie. His last 4 books are absolutely intolerable. It is very hard to skip all the pages that really have nothing to do with the main story line."},{"rating":"1","title":"Starts great, then loses itself.","review":"First let me state that I am a Number One Fan of Mr. King. I have read everything he has published - loved most of it, tolerated some of it. This much anticipated story starts out classic Stephen King, giving me the creeps, but halfway through starts to wander and seem to lose its way. The ending was not as lame as say, Needful Things, but I agree that Mr. King should stick with his classic, no-fail formula for success. We love it when he writes his \\"classic stuff\\". Renee L."},{"rating":"1","title":"Smoothly written but disappointing overall","review":"Whilst the book is well written as expected i think it was disappointing overall and just didn't have the same impact or compelling story line as with many of his other works. First and foremost King is a horror writer -this is how he made his reputation and won most of his fans. This doesn't mean to say that he shouldn't write books like 'bag of bones' which are clearly catered to a more mainstream audience but i think there should be a clearer line between his mainstream and horror e.g. his bachman pseudonym would be better utilised to truly differentiate his works rather than just for novelty value. That said, the book is still an ok read and the characters are well developed but i hope King brings his writing skills back to the horror/fantasy writing that he is rightly more acclaimed for."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointing, boring, drivel","review":"This book is NOTHING like It or The Stand.A self-pitying widower (Insomnia) finds himself in a house with a violent past (The Shining).

I almost want to put it straight *in* the dumpster now. It's a pretty good story, although it could stand to be about 100 pages shorter. But there are some possibly triggering scenes in it that I feel are mostly gratuitous. I'm no prude but there are somethings that I feel shouldn't be *only* entertainment. I think the author felt a little guilty as the last page has a sort of apology to it about how even made-up tragedies should be taken seriously. Eh. Whatever.Having said all that -- it IS effectively creepy, to this scaredy-cat at least!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Avoid This at All Costs","review":"I've enjoyed some of King's stories -- The Stand, Shawshank, The Green Mile -- and been lukewarm about a few others. \\"Bag of Bones\\" was, in short, terrible. Most of the book is mind-numbingly boring. Most of what isn't boring is horrifically violent, as we get brutal detailed descriptions of murder, rape, child murder, and attempted murder by sociopathic bullies against anyone who makes the mistake in this book of being a decent human. The boredom and brutality destroy whatever romance King is trying to incorporate. As for horror, Saturday morning cartoons are scarier. Also, the writing is lame; there's nothing clever or sophisticated about his use of language. If you want to read some King, read or reread \\"The Stand.\\" As for \\"Bag of Bones,\\" bag it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not King's best!","review":"I love S.King, but this book was boring, with an incredible amount of detail that made it difficult to digest.

The supernatural played a large part & that didn't bother me until the last 150 pgs or so when it then began to seem very silly.

The book got 1 star because it is extremely good and King throws in all kinds of old characters (Thad Beaumont, Bill Denbrough). The reason the book didn't get 4 or 5 stars is that I don't want to give all you bandwagon King fans another excuse to keep reading his stuff. The only King books you people like are the weak, emotional ones like Rose Madder and Bag of Bones. Jesus! Where the hell were you people when he was writing under Richard Bachman? Where were you people when he was struggling to pay the bills and feed his family?You bad-mouth everything else the man does, so he has to resort to writing the kind of crap that you people will like; not the kind of tales he wants to write.

This book was okay while I was reading it but the more I think about it, the more stupid, self-centered, and smutty it was! I would not recommend this book to younger readers because of all of how smutty it was. I love SK, and you can find many posts from me around, but I definitely will stick to his older stuff! If you like these kind of books, sure read it and try to just think about the writing because it is as good as ever, but I find it a little hard.

It then met the wall of my house. King allows you to hope for things that cannot come to fruition in this sad excuse for literature. He should stick to what he knows best, and give the readers what they want, not pull the rug out from under them in mid-story in the holy name of 'high literature'. This one is absolute rubbish. Well written, but with plot flaws uncharactaristic of what King usually delivers. Maybe getting writer's block would be a good thing for King..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not one of his best...","review":"I was literally beside myself waiting for this book to come out.

I've been reading Stephen King for 20 years (and I am only 31!) and Bag of Bones isn't bad, but it is nowhere near Mr. King's best work (The Stand, Different Seasons, The Dead Zone, The Green Mile). As always, the characters are incredibly well drawn and seamless but the plot is ill-conceived and overall the book isn't very tightly written. Mr. King tackles a very tired genre, the ghost story, and injects more life into it than ever could have been imagined. However, he should have stuck to more of this world (Mr. Noonan and his deceased wife, Mattie Devore, an ugly racial incident) and left the spooks and goblins to children's authors. Like most of Mr. King's ardent fans, I think he is one of the best living American authors, but he does his best work when crafting a story out of real, breathing characters."},{"rating":"1","title":"The verbose Mr. King has done it again.","review":"I reluctantly purchased Mr. King's latest tome due to all the publisher hype surrounding it. I used to be a big fan, but have definitely cooled towards reading anything by Stephen King. Almost all of the reviews stated that he has his old form back. I personally could not find any of the old form in this lengthy, wordy novel! The characters and setting are clear and concise, which shows that Stephen King is a gifted writer. I wish that he would use this gift more productively, and with a little less overwriting! I suppose that a staunch Stephen King fan will enjoy this book, I however,wish that I had waited to buy this novel in the used paperback version."},{"rating":"1","title":"kept hoping it would grab me...no pun intended","review":"finally at around page 250 i didn't have to make myself pick up the book and read. it was a hard job reading this one...a big disappointment..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not my cup of tea.","review":"My third attempt to finish the novel has failed. I like Stephen King a lot for his character building, his scene-settings, his descriptions of characters' emotions and. above all, his prose writing. But what I have never managed to like is a horror story. Okay, a lot of people out there like horror fanatsies, that's why he is the best selling author of the modern times, but to me, SK will always be identified with The Green Mile and Shawshank Redemption. I would love to read more stories like them from Stephen King."},{"rating":"1","title":"At least it's not as bad as Christine","review":"Although I have never read any of Tabitha Kings work, I wonder if she's ghosting for her husband? If this is the new style of the master of modern horror, Jeez, no wonder he's doing commercials these days. I wish he would stick to what he does well, getting into his characters heads, and then killing them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bag of Bones is just that -- slim pickings.","review":"The story is meandering and disconnected. Again King appears to be feeling deeply sorry for himself as a poor-poor multimillionaire author, with another one of his softheaded character authors who gets into highly improbable trouble. This novel seems to have a more than usual high disregard for the reader's feelings (like in Pet Sematary), in that SK is again back to his lame old tricks of killing off just about every good character there is. For shock? Who knows? If there is supposed be a shock value ascribed to this sophomoric treatment of lead characters, it's of the dismally boring variety. I'm just glad I borrowed this book from the library. Though I can't say that valuable time wasn't wasted in reading the sucker."},{"rating":"1","title":"Forgettable....like some bad tv movie","review":"The plot resembles some bad tv movie on the Lifetime channel. It's predictable, boring and overall, it makes me want to puke, considering I shelled out my hard earned cash to buy it.

Better than the TV Movie and I will someday read it again!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent story!","review":"I loved this book. I have read a number of Stephen Kings books and this is one of my favourites. The reasons are the heavy atmosphere of the setting and the story largely involving just the main character.

Stephen King is the master of story telling, that is undeniable. Bag of bones is fun, interesting and creepy work, but when i was reading i thought: you can do better than that. Story is too simple for book that long (in the begining, it dont seem so, but when you read the whole story, you can tell the main plot in one line). This is not a bad book, not at all. Itis very good one. But King could do better than that. First read The Green Mile, Desperation and The Stand and you will see what i mean."},{"rating":"2","title":"SPELLBINDING","review":"This was the first Stephen King book I read, and I was truly entranced by it.

The entire book is filled with a number of conflicts which King melds gracefully together, until the climatic, surprising, ending."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not typical King.","review":"I am a huge Stephen King fan, so naturally I was excited to read his then latest release, Bag of Bones. I was a little disappointed. It can not be classified as horror, which he is best known for. The book focuses on the loss of his wife and his inability to continue writing, with a few ghosts thrown into the mix. If a reader does not read King regularly and is not accustomed to his style of writing, they might enjoy it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Two for oh wo....w","review":"I ran down on this one about page 100. I am a King fan, so I tried, I really tried. Just couldn't keep my eyes open. I feel certain it gets better but I keep remembering John Cheever's comment when asked what books he liked to read: \\"Anything I can get past the first page of...\\" Well, I went many further, but I found this just too meandering, sleepy, and, frankly, a tad pretentious (re. the \\"book world\\").For some reason, I kept hearing Rhett Butler saying \\"Frankly, my dear, I don't give a damn.\\" Giggles. Lights out. Sorry, Steve. Maybe next lifetime."},{"rating":"1","title":"King needs some barer bones","review":"Although the thriller Bag of Bones was a page-turner, in the end I felt victimized by King's overindulgence. The well-drawn characters were likeable and heroic, but the plot became so dependent on psychic wanderings into surrealism, my suspension of disbelief was ultimately destroyed. I have not read a lot of Stephen King, but was totally impressed by Deloris Clayborn (the book; not the movie!). I found The Girl Who Loved Tom Gordon another overlong exercise in silly horror, and after reading Bag of Bones I'm becoming a skeptic. Anyone who has the power to write books like Deloris Clayborn and The Green Mile or a story like The Shawshank Redemption should not stoop to the verbal wanderings of Bag of Bones. I kept wondering if anyone had the guts to tell King he needs a decent editor to make him pare down the excess flesh of his verbage. Bag of Bones was a disappointment; I'll recommend it to no one."},{"rating":"1","title":"King tries to Escape from the Horror Genre . . .","review":". . . and creates a nightmare. I've read almost all of King's books (not the Dark Tower stuff, and I couldn't slog through Insomnia). This book is terrible! I skimmed the last 150 pages and read the Epilogue. The first 100 pages of the book dealing with Noonan and the death of his wife, and then the plot with Mattie and Kyra, prove that King can write straight fiction. I was engrossed in the aftermath of his wife's death and rooting for his involvement with Mattie and her daughter. Even the haunted house part was ok. But merging it all together was horrible.And by the way, someone posted on around Feb.19th, speculating that King's wife, Tabitha King, perhaps was ghosting for him. If this is the result, what an insult! Tabitha King is a wonderful writer in her own right, and I encourage people to read Pearl, One on One, and The Book of Reuben. Don't expect any scariness beyond the day-to-day frights of life."},{"rating":"1","title":"Timothy Grace -Australian creative writer.","review":"I'm sorry that everyone thinks that King is the greatest writer of all time but honestly, I HATE this book.

You get so involved with the books that you absolutely have to know what is going to happen in the next chapter. Is my favorite character going to die? Will they ever make it out alive? This is displayed in such masterpieces such as The Stand and Desperation. But Bag of Bones was the complete opposite. The only thing I found interesting about this book is the relationship between Mike, Mattie, and Kyra. But King then had to go and take away the best part of the book (Mike and Mattie's relationship). After Mattie got killed, I was mad. Their relationship was the only thing that kept me turning the pages. Everything else was crap and Im sorry I wasted my time reading the first 260 pages.

Stephen King needs to stay away from courtrooms and go back to the Dark Tower."},{"rating":"1","title":"Surprisingly Boring, Vastly Overrated","review":"After reading all the good reviews for this book, I picked it up ready for a treat. I've read all of King's books and most of them more than once. But I doubt I'll ever pick this one up again. I don't care how well the characters are written; if the plot is weak, it all falls apart. For me, the most exciting part was when the legal fight started heating up. But if I want that, I'll read Grisham, and anyway, that plotline was soon aborted. By the time the story ended, I honestly didn't care about any of the characters."},{"rating":"1","title":"King falls to \\"Gump Syndrome\\" and blows a great story","review":"It's hard to say why this is such an amazing disappointment without giving away much of the story. Suffice it to say that, as the summary says, King has fallen for the Forrest Gump theory: take a story which is basically escapist fantasy and drench it in cynical pessimisn masquerading as bittersweet realism. There's no reason for two or three of the major, negative plot points near the end, other than a disturbing sign of bitterness and depression on the part of King. A great ghost and love story trashed by a lousy final 1/4 whose entire point seems to be \\"life sucks and then the lucky ones die.\\" Take us back to wonder, Stephen, if I wanted cold hard reality I'd watch the news."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bag of Bones is not his best.","review":"Bag of Bones could not capture me in the first 100 pages and as I read it the more I thought that maybe this is Stephen King's book that he had kept in a safe deposit box all these years waiting for the opportunity to sell it. Like Tom Clancey, more and more we are seeing a lot of book that takes a lot of energy to carry and sometimes not worth it. Stephen King is the best of Horror writers and he needs to return to the basics and keep scaring the bejesus out of us. Sorry, two stars for this one. Four and five for most of his others."},{"rating":"2","title":"New Direction for King","review":"It's a good read. I too had trouble putting it down. King's weaving is so enthralling, I made my wife wait an hour this morning before we went to the store to finish it. Some of his books have dismal ends... (IT's A spider for god's sake.!!)The Epilogue seemed to point to a negation of his own style. I expect that he will be trying new styles in future books. Still, I wish he'd get on with Dark Towers.Mike Oren"},{"rating":"2","title":"A nice surprise","review":"This is not the usual horror story from Stephen King but rather a charming, melancholy ghost story which held me captivated to the very end (which is a surprise to me because I usually hate the endings in Stephen King's books as for example Langoliers or Needful Things)Bag of Bones has less violence than some of King's other recent work, although when it occurs it is genuinely jolting. There is as well an almost overpowering sense of frustration and unfairness to some of the proceedings.This novel doesn't seem to have attracted the attention of some of King's better-known books, which is a shame because it's one of the better books by King. You can even read it if you usally don't like hus books."},{"rating":"2","title":"Undeniably Powerful","review":"If you're reading these reviews, you're probably trying to decide if its worth dropping this book in your shopping cart. I hope you will.I'm a pretty big Stephan King fan; you think I'd be able to see and understand all the elements in his bag of tricks by now. Thankful I can't. He remains an amazing story teller and this book feels a little differant that his others. There's a slow, slow build that breaks out into an overwhelming conclusion.It may be one of the his most satisfying books. He's often focusing on the outside world, and how we're connected to some higher purpose (The Stand, It, Dreamcatcher) but this time he keeps his keen flashlight pointed inward. Of all the locals haunted by restless spririts, the most important one is Mike Noonan's heart. In telling his story, King is at his funny, touching best.I highly recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Is it over? I must have nodded off. How did it end?","review":"The worst work to date from a great writer. Story went nowhere. Characters were dull. Could not have been written by the same man that brought us The Green Mile and Different Seasons. A huge diappontment. The only good thing that I can say about having purchased the hard cover version of this book is that at least I got the disappointment out of the way now instead of waiting another twelve months for the paperback and then being diappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"It hits you","review":"Stephen King must have had writers block himself when he wrote this novel.

Not SK's best effort."},{"rating":"1","title":"My First Stephen King Book, Not a Good Start","review":"This book was a \\"non-scary,\\" slow read, that lacked pizzazz - basically it was a snore.It appeared that Stephen King just sat down and started writing without a story in mind. About half way through the book, he developed a lackluster plot. Towards the end he wrapped things up in such a jumbled, unthoughtful manner that he required a 5 page summary to explain. Ack.If you want to read this book, do yourself a favor. Read the first 25 pages and then skip to the 5 page summary. Then, go out and buy one of his more popular books instead. ;-)"},{"rating":"1","title":"I don't get all these kudos...","review":"Hi,I'm in the camp of the the folks below who didn't get much out of this particular novel. I,too, am a huge fan of King and all his amazing past works. But this one, even though it had its moments, doesn't come CLOSE to some of his other masterpieces (like the Stand). So, I would have to say it's a mystery to me why all these five stars reviews...hey, it's all in your opinion I guess. But if you like this one, try to reading Salem's Lot,the Shining or Pet Semetary...and be prepared to be REALLY blown away. THAT was King's prime."},{"rating":"1","title":"give me a break....700+ pages to say what????","review":"The King is dead, that is, if you are using his last book(?) as an indication of his health. Bag of Bones is tedious, over done, and in dire need of surgery (let's say we amputate 300 pages!). I used the book to help me get to sleep for about a week. I can't remember if I finished it or not. The King is dead, long live the King. They say when a man is as famous as the King he can publish his laundry list and get on the best-seller's list. Well, for goodness sake Steve-boy, please publish your laundry list, it's got to be more interesting than this!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Forget the Tower, Grab this Bag!","review":"Finally, a book worthy of King.

I am happy to say that he has not!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Stephen King's Best","review":"This is the best book I've read in a very, very long time. Until now, The Stand and The Green Mile have been my all-time favorites. But Bag Of Bones has gone to the top of the list. King starts out with a normal believable story and takes the reader, willing or not, on an exciting and wild ride into the world of ghosts, Filled with many little pearls, (\\"Put an egg in your shoe and beat it\\"...

I was a little in awe of the size, does he get paid like Charles Dickens' did- by the word?

This book creeped me out so much; I don't even know why. It was an excellent book and I loved it to death. It was just a little creepy, you know, with the ghosts and all the ironic things that happened, things that were right under Mike's nose and he didn't even realize it. I am going to reccommend (how the hell do you spell that word anyway?) this novel to just about every avid reader I know. I'm sure they'll love it. I got into it so much at the end, that I sat in one place for 3 hours and finished it. Sure I had serious cramps when I was done, but I was glad I had finished it. It was suspenseful and I wanted to get to the end. So buy this book; it's wonderful and you'll love it!!(Btw, I wanted to wish Stephen King a speedy recovery! Hang in there, boy, you've got lots of people (friends, fans, and family) who want you to get well soon!)"},{"rating":"2","title":"I couldn't put this one down!","review":"I thought Bag of Bones was the best book I had read in years.

I became so involved in this book (as I do all of Mr.King's books) I forget everything around me. My husband hates when a new Stephen King comes out because I won't pay any attention to anything else till I finished it. In the book, Mike is like everyone of us, he has the goodness and the evil inside of him. He fights his demons as he trys to do what is best for Ki. I need a new King novel at least once a month."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Good Read for Rainy Nights","review":"Having read most of Stephen King's works, I felt that this is one of his better books...not quite as good as \\"The Stand\\", but almost. I liked the fact that he was not as gruesome in this book as he has been in some of his others. Once he started developing his ghosts' characters, the book was more interesting. As always, King is a little too wordy. I read \\"Rebecca\\" after this book and it was fun to draw comparisons in suspense development. This book has one of King's better plot developments. I can see why it won the Edgar Award."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hard-to-put-down UNTIL...","review":"This was my favorite SK book thus far. I literally couldn't put it down and am now searching for another novel to satisfy my urges. However, with that being said, Bag of Bones ended in a way which was inconsistent with the tone of the rest of the book. This was the best book until page 500, and dropped (in quality) precipitously from then on. Although I highly recommend it, i was disappointed by the ending."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not your usual King....but well worth the read","review":"This is not the kind of book that King usually writes, but boy was it hard to put down. It starts out very slowly and confuses the reader until about a quarter of the way through. But once it hits the high mark, look out! I found myself reading till 2 or 3 am every night. I just couldn't put it down. Thanks for the great book Mr. King."},{"rating":"2","title":"Stephen King is back!!!","review":"I LOVED this book. This is the first SK novel I have dared to read in years. I loved his earlier books (The Shining was THE scariest book I've ever read) but when he started with books like \\"Christine\\" I pretty much lost interest. THIS is the Stephen King I remember!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow.....","review":"Ok. Before I read this book, I had only read 1 of Stephen King's books (Rose Madder) and 1 of his series (The Green Mile). This book is INCREDIBLE. I just couldn't put it down, and finished it in a week. That might not seem very amazing, except for one fact: I am a young teen. I will definitely be reading King's other works as well. Oh yeah: My friends want to read this book as well. And they say youth doesn't care."},{"rating":"2","title":"King keeps growing up...","review":"...not to say that anything besides perhaps 'The Gunslinger' (Dark Tower I) was anything like juvenile... I mean to say that King continues to spend more time on the human and psychological side of horror and, this time, weaves it nicely into the supernatural side of things. Anyone who though the first hundred pages were boring, I suppose, likes only a limited amount of 'story' with their 'horror'. Myself, I cried, or would have if I hadn't been reading in a public place. Far from formulaic, although it does slide in that direction occasionally, this book keeps King, in my mind at least, firmly in the rank of Master Storyteller which he has occupied for quite some time (ever since I read Different Seasons, IT, The Stand, and the Dark Tower series and realised this guy doesn't just do blood, he does mythology.)"},{"rating":"2","title":"In the bag.","review":"I've read a few reviews and seems as though the ones who don't care for Bag of Bones are the ones who read King for the Monsters and the blood and gore. The ones who did like it are the ones who read King because they realize he's more than a good horror writer, he's a damn good story teller. I guess I fit into the latter because I even enjoyed the first 100 pages that I've heard described as \\"BO-RING!\\". In fact I think the first 100 may have been the best part of the book. A man dealing with both the loss of his wife and his career. It's a good read, 528 pages that I read in two days...I never read a book in two days. It's not IT, or The Stand by any means, but it'll keep you interested and guessing. Thumbs up."},{"rating":"2","title":"LOVE TAKEN FOR GRANTED","review":"I bought this book some time ago. I haven't read a King book since The Green Mile. I guess I was burned out....I have read almost all his books. He was part of my life and I enjoyed the ride but I took him for granted. Just like Mike took Jo for granted and was unaware sometimes of her presence. But I enjoyed the book and couldn't put it down. The scene with the ghostly goodbye should effect anyone who has lost a loved one and wish to see them again...it was moving. I won't take King for granted anymore. I will relish our companionship as we both get older."},{"rating":"2","title":"How come I couldn't put it down?","review":"I read it in two sittings (once during the severest thunderstorm in recent Florida history -- Man!

Money and fame definitely killed this guy's talent."},{"rating":"1","title":"A great book to cure insomnia","review":"As a general rule, I have discovered Stephen King writes like a high school freshman who is barely passing English class. Before Bag of Bones, I had read two of King's books. The first one, Misery, didn't impress me. The other one was The Green Mile. The only thing that saved King's writing in that book was the incredibly mesmerizing storyline. However, after The Green Mile, Bag of Bones was a huge letdown. The plot is boring, the writing is pathetic, and it's so drawn out it that it could've (and should've) been edited down to 300 pages. Moreso, if that much-needed edit had occured, Bag of Bones would've had the exact story as the 700+ page version."},{"rating":"1","title":"ahhhhhhhhh","review":"Please, please, enough with the FIVE STAR reviews. That is preposterous. Read IT, The Stand, The Shining, Salems Lot and Pet Semetary. Then, I challenge you people to give THIS thing 5 STARS. King was a superb writer, for a while, he was in such a zone, it wouldn't be absurd to call him the best in the world. In the nineties his stories don't have the fire, the originality, the excitment, the horror...he's burned out. And it's perfectly understandable. NO ONE can maintain that level for 20 plus years. But you people saying things like \\"B.O.B. is his BEST EVER\\" are literally killing me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unreadable and cliched","review":"With Bag of Bones, King brings the word \\"awful\\" to new levels of awfulness. With awful characters, an awful, boring, unneccesarily complicated plot, and awful editing, it simply oozes awfulness from every awful page.Well, maybe it wasn't that bad, but it sure wasn't good."},{"rating":"1","title":"Piece of Junk","review":"This book is slow, boring and meaningless. If you are looking for some horror, chill, or thrill then this book is not worth. It is painfully long, drags on and on without any pulsating or gripping drama. This book does not deserve as much as attention it has been getting."},{"rating":"2","title":"King's most beautifully written novel!","review":"As an avid Stephen King fan, I am enthralled with Bag of Bones. I love the way he weaves in old faces, letting his other characters make cameos in this novel. He compliments his readers through Mike Noonan, a character that to me, is far from the \\"Bag of Bones\\" he claims storybook characters to be. This is a beautiful story, that makes you believe in ghosts. You will fall in love with the characters, and hate the bad guys as much as they do. This is a wonderful novel, and I believe it is the most literary of his books to date. This makes it different from the horror genre - but there are still plenty of scares! My advice - READ THIS BOOK!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Creepy","review":"This book is creepy.If you like ghost stories, with a twist its pretty good.I enjoyed this book , however its not my favorite.The reason I gave it a 4 star is because it maintained my interest."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Reading","review":"King did an excellent job keeping you guessing in this one.

Would make a good movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good but . . . .","review":"Not to take anything away from my favorite author BUT I thought the book was way too long. The story was suspenseful and descriptive but I found myself getting lost in the superfluous background. (And this is someone who has read The Stand at least six times so it's not the length of the book that bothered me as much as the length of the storyline.) Stephen King fans will still enjoy the book but not as much as some others such as The Cell which I thought was great."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bravo, I can finally read Stephen King again!","review":"I fell in love with Stephen King novels after reading Salem's Lot back in high school. Unfortunately, his work started degrading due most likely to the volume being pumped out at the height of his career.When this book came out, I read the reviews posted here and decide to take a chance. After all, it sounded like he was trying something new. I was not disappointed. This novel develops the characters very slowly, much like every other SK book I've loved. But after you learn about the characters and the way they think, the twisting roller coaster ride begins.I thoroughly enjoyed this novel as a former die-hard SK fan. More importantly, I enjoyed this novel as a fan of a good thriller. I can't give it a 5 because those SK books are It, Salem's Lot, and The Stand for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Acquire some life experience before you read this one!","review":"Convoluted...the characters' family ties stretched my credibility threshold in places. As usual, the story starts out in the mainstream, \\"normal\\" mode, and Mr. King smoothly shifts it into \\"spooky.\\" You have to suffer some significant losses to appreciate the realism of this story. Mr. King plucked some of my heart strings; made me laugh and cry. So many mysteries in life, and the beyond is just limited by our perception anyway, so who's to say what is \\"real\\" ~ being haunted can be an everyday experience. (I removed the magnets on my refrigerator door.) Take your time reading this yarn!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"I didn't enjoy this book at all. I never cared about the characters. Usually I can't put his books down, but for this one, I couldn't wait to put it down. The only reason I finished it was because I had already spent money on it. Try again Stephen! Go back to the good stuff like Needful Things, The Stand, or Carrie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bag of Bones was just that!","review":"There is no doubt that King is the master of story-telling. His writing style is engaging and genuine; however, the plot in Bag of Bones is lacklustrous. Bag of Bones is hair-raising and spine-tingling - but only in the beginning. The same scary stuff occurs throughout most of the book without hardly any implication in the story line. The story line does not take a turn until the end of the book. The characters' dialogues are uninteresting and corny. Mattie is banal. The relationships (specifically between the evil townspeople, Sara Tidwell and the Red Tops, and Michael Noonan and his crew) are a tangled web of nonsense. What saves the book is the main character, Michael. He is likeable and substantial. His narratives and thoughts introduce ideas that draw the reader in. Essentially, the book is excellently written, (word-wise), but lacks a firm nourishing plot."},{"rating":"1","title":"You're all killing me.","review":"For the love of God, this is NOT a five star book. Stop it! King has some BRILLIANT work, the best in the world. But you CANNOT give this five stars and have it mean anything, when such masterpieces as the Stand, IT and The Shining exist. What does that make them? 10 stars! Please, I beg you to stop! It's ludicrous. It's a mediocre story at best! I don't have a problem with the length...it's just not particularly inspired!"},{"rating":"1","title":"typical King","review":"Typical King.

A fair warning, it does start a little slow but it's necessary to lay the foundation for a terrific Ghost story. Highly Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely wonderful - intense, dramatic, frightening!","review":"Stephen King, more than any other writer I know, is able to put down fantasy so real that it grips my guts.

As Mike becomes drawn into their struggle he falls in love with both of them and is further drawn into the mystery of this ghostly town.This is classic King, with twists and turns, and his unique ability to weave the supernatural into reality almost seamlessly.This is a book to throw in your own Bag of Bones if you are a fan of King.Relic113"},{"rating":"2","title":"King at his Best","review":"The central character is a widowed best selling novelist, Mike Noonan who is grieving from his wife's sudden and unexpected death.

Sorry to say!"},{"rating":"1","title":"This book should never even have been published.","review":"Stephen King is an excellent author who has written many great books in his career. Unfortunately this is not one of them. If you want to read something good by King try one of his older classics like \\"The Stand\\" or \\"It\\". Better yet read \\"The Green Mile\\" or \\"Hearts in Atlantis\\". These are two of the very best books I have ever read. They are suspenseful and extremely engaging. They are deeply emotional works full of meaning and insight into the workings of society. The characters' thoughts and emotions are very deeply felt. \\"Hearts in Atlantis\\" also has a very moving ending. It's hard to believe that the same author who wrote \\"Hearts in Atlantis\\", one of the best books I've ever read, also wrote \\"Bag of Bones\\" - one of the worst book I've ever erad."},{"rating":"1","title":"The borest book i have ever read","review":"It was one of the stupidest books i have ever read.

A little creepy, when I was 21 years old a 40 year old was not even on my radar. So Mike is the biggest pervert of all them, Did not like his character at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'll stick to his non-fiction","review":"Although I enjoyed the movie \\"Stand By Me\\" I had never read anything by Stephen King. I read his recent non-fiction \\"On Writing\\" and thought it was great. And so when I saw \\"Bag of Bones\\" I picked it up.A good case can be made that the writer Mike Noonan is an alter ego for Stephen King. If so, Stephen King thinks very highly of himself. Not only is Mike Noonan this resourceful hero rescuer, but his devoted sexy wife spends her afterlife being devoted to him, and an incredibly beautiful 20-year-old is hot for him too. What a stud.Early in the book, I thought that the protagonist's wife was actually mad at him, and I thought that the reason for that would be revealed. That made the supernatural stuff scary, and the protagonist's psychology interesting. Half way through the book, the supernatural stuff became ludicrous, and it was clear that the wife was not mad at him and the book was just a bag of mediocrity."},{"rating":"2","title":"Okay novel","review":"This is an okay novel to read. But you really nead to concetrate on what you are reading. This book had alot of good parts and sequences but I really want to know is, what happened to the master of horror Stephen King. Why is he in to drama? But when you are a wrighter, you should pick a genre and stay with it. Readers out there, if you want a heart touched story, get the book. But if you want horror classics, then look somewhere else. If you get it, find a quiet place."},{"rating":"1","title":"He's Done Better Stuff","review":"I know there are people out there who will blast me for what I am about to write, but I didn't feel that Bag of Bones was a particularly good novel. It lacked punch. Normally once I get into one of Stephen King's novels, I'm hooked. I can't stop reading. I was easily able to put aside Bag of Bones. At a good many points, I wanted to skim through the rest in an hour or just return the book to the library. I will admit the ending was good (I never expected the water thing with Mattie), and that line, \\"Give me back my dustcatcher!\\" still strikes me as phenomenal.... but frankly I don't think the book was worth it. I think King is capable of writing a better novel, scary or otherwise. Personally, I'd advise people to buy the book for their collection, but not to bother reading it. On a better note, I really enjoyed The Girl Who Loved Tom Gordon, Hearts In Atlantis, and the first 2 installments of The Plant. What can I say? That's my opinion."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nope.","review":"King on a bad day is better than most writers on a great day. So I cut this book some slack. But, I am forced to compare it to his previous novels (as the reviewer below states, he has some BRILLIANT work in his portfolio.) This doesn't come close to touching the horror, and the captivating page-turning qualities of his earlier work. I LOVE King, and hold my collection of his earliest work (Carrie) right through to 1990 or so (around Misery time) as absolutely SACRED. But I honestly haven't been moved by anything he's written in close to ten years now. Bag of Bones has a ghost and an evil character -- but they seem to lack the malevolence of his past evil characters. And the plot, while interesting at times, seems to just kind of chug along -- rehashing snippets of themes from other novels, with nothing particularly earth-shattering. The crossword puzzle thing was kind of neat, but even that seemed like a tired gimmick in a book from an author who's well finished from his prime."},{"rating":"1","title":"A drag to the end","review":"The most disappointing of the King books I've read. I had to force myself to finish the book whilst asking myself if he really wrote it. The story was not compelling and seemed to lack integration. I might rest on King for a while."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book is trash.","review":"I wonder if Stephen King even wrote this book. It lacked all of the character development and realistic dialogue that he has made his trade mark. In terms of likeable characters, I could have lined all of them up by mid-book and shot them. There's not a likeable character in the book. In addition, this book was a complete cliche. Boo! Hiss!"},{"rating":"1","title":"All (dull) atmosphere, no substance","review":"This book was just interminable. I've read all of Stephen King's books, and this one is by far the worst -- nothing interesting happens in it! This one and Insomnia were the only 2 I've ever had to literally *force* myself to finish, and I only managed that because I'm extremely stubborn. If you're expecting a rollicking good, involving story like Desperation or the Green Mile, this isn't it. It's also no Dolores Claiborne -- I suppose people could argue that not much happens in that, either, but I loved that book -- the characters were *involving* and interesting. I didn't give 2 whits about anybody in Bag of Bones. If you liked The Dark Half and Insomnia, I guess you might like this, but I didn't like those, either, for the same reasons."},{"rating":"1","title":"...Please, Trust me !!","review":"I've been a fanatic of King's work since \\"Carrie\\" and I'm really disappointed about this one (I read it in about 15 days, forcing myself to do so because I was looking forward to get a Good Book after it). The problem about this novel it's not its length but the enormus lack of inspiration that -I'm sure- is the reason of the endless repetitions and the silly, boring dreams. If you love S.K., please, DON'T BUY THIS BOOK!! By doing so, maybe, you'll increase the (few) chances to see our (ex)favourite writer's redemption."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lack of focus","review":"Having read most of King's books, this is the worst of them. The story never takes off and lacks all of the things that make good storytelling good. His characters don't seem to make sense and behave unbelievably and unrealistically. Do yourself a favor and skip this one or check it out of the library if you must read it, but don't invest a dime buying it."},{"rating":"2","title":"captivating","review":"i loved it. i wasn't a king fan anymore but this book took me away. i couldn't help but to read on and on. i can't wait to read the next book."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"...a haunting story of loss and love.\\"","review":"It was a very carefully written work of literature. It has an excellent storyline and the characters are depicted excellently into any reader's mind. This is honestly one of Stephen King's best books in a long time aside from the Dark Tower series and The Green Mile."},{"rating":"2","title":"King's best book yet.Read beautifully by King himself.","review":"I loved this book! Stephen Kings character development is just awesome. I could picture each character in my mind with such clarity.The story had all the elements you would expect from King and then some.I laughed, I cried, I held my breath in anticipation, I was frightened and really pissed off at a couple of the characters.Mr. King did a superb job of reading this book. After listening to the audio version for twent-two hours I was so depressed when the book ended, so enduring were the characters.I will listen to this book again and again!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A good read.","review":"The story was a little slow to start, but once it finally did, it kept me turing the pages."},{"rating":"2","title":"Combine the audio tapes and book for double the pleasure","review":"I listened to the audio tapes in the car, then picked up where they left off in the book, then continued with the audio tapes the next day, etc. Since I had a hard time putting the book down this helped finish it quick. It was very fun since Stephen King was doing the reading on the tapes; I feel I understood the book better listening to him read the book he wrote. It was a different turn for him and I thoroughly enjoyed it. Thanks Stephen."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great ghost story mingled with romance","review":"At first I thought this was going to be wordy and not much of a Stephen King book. Once I got into it (without prejudice or expecting a top SK one of a kind)I began to get into the plot and into the nonstop, can't put it down, real story that I always love about SK. First thing that was great was the romance. I love horror, but when you can add the romantic with the blood and gore, that shows the book is going to be good. By the time I was able to put it down I was done. I flew through reading this like none of his other books, and had dreams about it also!!!! It is definitely a one of a kind. And a keeper! Great job Stephen King!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Not your typical Stephen King!","review":"I was a little leary when the cover read \\"a haunted love story\\" but fear not Stephen comes through again! As spooky as ever. Excellent characters and a great story that got me involved right away. This could bring him many new fans!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely great!","review":"I'm not going to give you a long summary of the plot or a nasty criticism of King's newest. However, I will tell you that King has once again captured the imagination that makes books so great. Yes, it has thrills and chills...sex and fun...and I loved it. The way he describes Noonan's dreams and thoughts...Just incredible. His writing is great (as usual) and the man just amazes me. He is such an incredible American author, and he deserves much more recognition than he has."},{"rating":"2","title":"It draws you in.","review":"I enjoy King's writing, and I found this novel to be quite different from his usual work, but I really enjoyed it. The characters were so interesting and compelling that I was drawn into their story very quickly. Because the reader stays with the main character throughout the story, and perceives event as he does, the novel is able to give clues about what is going on and still be surprising with it's twists and turns. This has been one of my favorite books by King so far."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another good one from one of the best.","review":"I have always loved Stephen King's way of writing, but there have only been a few books that I was as intrested in as this one. I could hardly put it down. It was simlpy mesmerizing. I beleive it is one of his best and one of the best I have read in a long while. He has always been good with his plots and this one is no different. In my oppinion if you like Stephen King, then you must read this book. If only to make your own decision on how wonderful this book truely is."},{"rating":"2","title":"One Of The Best","review":"Surely this has to rate as one of Stephen King's best books ever. It's the only one to make me hide under the covers when the light went out! Thoroughly enjoyed it, and can recommend it to anyone who's got the time to read it from cover to cover without putting it down - so make sure you've got the time!"},{"rating":"2","title":"All the intricate detail made me feel I was at \\"Sara Laugh's","review":"I am an avid Steven King reader. I found Bag of Bones to be compelling, interesting, scary, mysterious and ll of the other words that are so often associated with Mr. King. I love the fact that he often refers to things from his other books and only a true Steven King reader would understand and get it. Bag of Bones seemed like it could be so real yet you know (or at least you hope)it can't. If you like Steven King, I would highly reccommend you read this one. It is a feast for the mind."},{"rating":"2","title":"I didn't want to put it down.","review":"This book kinda started out slow like all of King's books, but when it started, it kept going. I like this book the best so far. I think there should be a sequal to it because I want to know what happens to Mike and Ki. Keep on writing like this and you will have me as your number one reader."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of King's Finest","review":"WOW! I have just finished reading Bag Of Bones in 3 days...had to call in sick one day just to finish. This is by far one of his best to date. There was a shift in his writing, starting with Geralds Game, away from the \\"monster macabe\\". And more into the \\"mind macabe\\" so to speak. With Bag Of Bones he has brought both of those together and totally reinvented himself. This is the first of King's books that had me from the start, like only Dean Koontz and Anne Rice have been able to do so far. I'm now waiting on the movie version :-)"},{"rating":"2","title":"A really, really good book (hard to put down)","review":"I had doubts about buying this book because I heard that I should wait until the paperback comes out but I am glad that I didn't listen because it is a really good book. I somtimes stayed up in bed reading it until the early hours of the morning because I couldn't put it down.It is not a 'typical Stepehn King book' and it is not a 'horror' story. The book is more of a mental horror story and it plays with the mind (and with the characters mind as well).The story is very interesting because it has a lot to do with being an author and it might have some insights about Mr. King feels about his work.Not his best but still very good."},{"rating":"2","title":"A whole new Bag","review":"I have been a fan of Stephen Kings from the first book of his that I read but sometimes he tends to be a little lengthy. 'Bag of Bones' is a bit different from his other books but just as enjoyable. Do you believe in ghosts? Even if you arent' a fan of King, give this one a try - you might be surprised."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliant. Highly Recommended.","review":"I love Stephen King and this is one of his better novels. There is an ominous feel to most of it, as well a a few scary parts. I should warn you, there is one scene, where the reader finds out just what happened to Sara, that some readers might find disturbing. Otherwise, the thrills are mostly psychological. This is not a book to go reading at night - every little noise will keep you awake. I definitely recommend reading this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't live up to a Stephen King book","review":"I bought this book to give Stephen King a try. I have heard for years from friends and co-workers how much they liked reading Stephen King's books. I wasn't impressed at all. The book is approx 550 pages and could have honestly been approx 350 pages. It seemed there was a lot of 'filler' that didn't have anything to do with the delivery of the story line. I also didn't like the ghost/haunting story line. I anticipated it to be more of a suspense book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overrated and trashy","review":"I have read most of King's books with great interest. Now, he just seems to be hacking out the same old thing. In this book, it seemed to me that this story could have been pieced together by reading The National Enquirer and watching the talk shows. I didn't even finish it. Same old thing, over and over."},{"rating":"1","title":"too slow a start","review":"Started out way to slow, could not even hold my interest, watched the movie the other night and it was much better, the part in the book that I did read through took them about 2 minutes on the screen"},{"rating":"1","title":"King needs a more assertive editor","review":"I've been a King fan for years, but many of his recent novels just go on and on! And...so does this one. King's editor really needs to get on the ball. This story could have been told more effectively (and would have been a more enjoyable read) in half the words."},{"rating":"1","title":"MR. KING, PLEASE GET TO THE POINT!!!!!","review":"After 300 pages I am putting this book down FOREVER..Extremely thin plot, routine characters (evil rich-man in wheelchair, trailer-trash single mother, etc.)Critics always complain his books are too long...this time, they're right.Reminded me of FREEDOMLAND, where a 250 page story idea (or 1 hour Law and Order episode) was blown up to over 700 pages!I want to OLD Stephen King back! (Dead Zone, Firestarter, The Stand, Cujo...)"},{"rating":"2","title":"I Had Trouble Sleeping","review":"I just finished the book today. There were times I couldn't put it down and other times I couldn't pick it up because it scared me. I thought I started to hear ghosts like the ones King skillfully imaged in this story. He not only scared me but took me to places and times I have never been and I could practically smell the air. There was more to this story then the usual fright and horror of small town living that hooked me to King's works. It was deeper in the relationships of the charaters and I liked that. I liked the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Stephen King on 'Roids","review":"This book is Stephen King at his literary finest. True, core King fans who love his simple slash 'em style will have to have a bit more patience here, but the pacing is well worth it. King, as usual, has developed characters we will love, characters we will fear, and characters we will hate - with no clear way to tell which of them will survive. Though the soft-cover version is over 700 pages, I managed to entertain holiday guests, care for the kids, and burn through this book every minute in between. Afterwards, I immediately picked up \\"The Girl Who Loved Tom Gordon,\\" and thought - \\"Ha! 219 Pages? Child's play!\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Mr. King should have stopped when he wrote \\"Salem's Lot\\".","review":"In this book, Stephen King refers to the pressure imposed on best-selling authors to write a book a year. Evidently he was referring to his own experience as this is the longest, most tedious drivel I have ever attempted to read. The biggest horror I found was in trying to find a plot of some kind. I even tried skip-reading, but even so was bored to tears.Mr. King is a talented writer, but does not put his talent to good use."},{"rating":"1","title":"terribly disappointing","review":"I bought this book only because I was on an airplane coming home from Maine. I thought it was a good idea to read Stephen King's work again, and hoped that after seeing all the reviews about it, would be a pretty good read. But, like all King books, the beginning is pretty good, and the end is always disappointing. This is the last Stephen King book that I will ever buy. How stupid can one be to think that this is his greatest work? He tries so hard to sound intelligent, but in the end his prose is childish. If he can write and sell a book, every high school graduate should be able to do so as well."},{"rating":"1","title":"One of the most boring I have ever read.","review":"I cannot believe how boring this book is. I suffered through about the first 400 pages over a 2 month period and could not finish it. Many parts are just plain foolish. How did this book generate the press that it did? Whatever happened to books like Pet Semetary and The Shining?"},{"rating":"1","title":"this book goes off into so many meaningless directions.","review":"i swear i will not buy another SK book. i was so disappointed - he has not written a good book since misery. i think this book is about him - he is dredging up books he wrote at an earlier time. i want my money back. i couldn't follow this and there seemed to be a lot of gratutitous sex."},{"rating":"1","title":"I hated it. It twisted and turned and went nowhere.","review":"This is the first time I had read Steven King and I felt compelled to read it because it was a birthday gift. It caught my interest at first but I began to get very disgusted with it because it twisted and turned and went nowhere. Finally I got so fed up I put the book out of sight and I only had 100 pages to finish it but I felt it was a waste of my time."},{"rating":"1","title":"All bones--No meat to this story","review":"The most startling thing about this book, is that Stephen King wrote it. I found it very hard to finish it; it was so boring and predictable. Even the ending when 'everything' was supposedly explained turned out to be bland and just plain silly. Not scary, very predictable, and he took forever with mudane details that did not add to the story at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Somewhere in those 732 pages is a very average 350 page book","review":"I have the feeling after reading many of the glowing five star reviews of this book that Steven King could publish a phone directory and many of his avid fans would rush to it's defense. Somewhere I'm sure there was an editor who trying to convince King to cut 300 pages of \\"filler\\" - I counted 174 pages devoted to the main characters dreams - 174 pages. Amazingly, in 732 very long pages he still has great difficulty adequately developing his characters. I once considered myself a fan but no longer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very, very disappointing","review":"I have read every book Stephen King has written and this has got to be the worst ever. It took me weeks to agonize through it and I only finished it because I started it and hoped it would get better. Now I am reading \\"Wizards and Glass\\" and can't believe the difference in writing, like 2 different people wrote these books. I hope Stephen King will go back to his old style of writing and leave the love stories to the romance novels. He is still the best horror fiction writer ever."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awfully BORING book","review":"I usually love Stephen King books but this is a horribly, boring book. I tried my best to wade through the page after page of boring text but finally gave up halfway through the book and trashed it. Mr. King, you just lost a reader."},{"rating":"1","title":"his worst book so far","review":"ugh! this may not be much of a review but it wasn't much of a book. the plot revolves around a writer that has lost his ability to write.i guess even steven king knew it wan't a good book. i hung in there to the end hoping it would get better. save your time and money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good...until 3/4 the way through","review":"I really liked 'Bag of Bones' until King killed off Maddie, followed by a side of typical Politically Correct heinous white on black rape/murder/racism.The \\"evil racist white guy\\" theme is just so saturated in today's media. And something predictable, there's going to be a movie!It's a shame King's on board the social order's anti-white propaganda wagon.-JS"},{"rating":"1","title":"No Wonder Used Copies Sell for 3 cents","review":"This book is Loooooong winded. There are numerous places where King goes on and one about stuff totally unrelated to anything, such as the passage where the best selling author rambles on about best seller authors and their work. Boring!!!The story is slim. Town's people killed two people generations ago and now angry ghost is out to get revenge by killing one kid from each family. OK.Spooky stuff encompases 10 pages out of the 300. Lame, rambling crap and King's musings on writing and the mistreatment of pop novelists take up 76 pages.CLearly King is so big no one edits his work. Too bad. He has written some good books but this one is blah. Avoid."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hated This Book","review":"I'm a Stephen King fan,but this was the worst book he's ever written IMO.I honestly couldn't even finish reading it.For a writer with King's talent and imagination,I thought the plot and characters were boring and one dimmensional.King's writing style usually makes you care about the people in his books,but the characters here just really annoyed me.If you really want to read this one,I suggest getting a copy from a library instead of spending your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"WHY is not available to US Kindle readers?","review":"Stephen, you dog, I hope you read this. And when you read it, I hope you hear a screaming three-year-old's voice over and over and over.

Was it ghost written? This couldn't be your work.I wish I had been like some other people here and stopped reading after only 100 pages. But no, I kept right on reading because I was enjoying the romance angle of the story. Then Mr. King hits me with his \\"twist.\\" I closed the book on the spot and never re-opened it. I have never, ever, ever done that to a Stephen King book.I love a good twist in the tale. I hate disingenuousness. What a rip-off. Stay away."},{"rating":"1","title":"Like watching your computer reformat","review":"This book is about as entertaining as watching your computer reformat. Like those long trips when you're a kid, and you found yourself asking your parents \`are we there yet? are we there yet?' I never got there until a little over halfway through the book and when I got there I couldn't wait to leave. The book is boring, and only gets a little creepy towards the end. This book sucks...."},{"rating":"1","title":"king's worst story ever","review":"i have been an avid reader of steven king's books for about 7 years. this was the worst book he has ever written. as far as i'm concerned king should go back to writting classics like IT , THE STAND, SALEMS LOT, PET SEMETARY, and CARRIE. when i read this book it was as if it was by a different author. i wouldn't recomend this novel to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ungood","review":"Book was more ungood then good. Usually it's the other way around with King. I think I should get double my money back for hanging in there to the end. My wife who is now on page 21 says she likes it so far. Maybe I should rethink my marriage."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bag of Bones reminds me of William Faulkner","review":"Bag of Bones was a wonderful read. I enjoyed turning every page. I postponed all my appointments just to read this book. The way that he developed his characters reminds me of William Faulkner. Stephen King reigns."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful characters--transported me to another place","review":"As a long-time King fan--since before he was well-known, I've been somewhat disappointed with recent books. None have given me that wonderful \\"transported\\" feeling. With the best of King's books I've dreamed of the characters and the storyline--this one was that way again. The only reason I gave this 4 star is because I felt this bogged just a bit in the middle. I could have done without the whole legal battle. But the beginning captured me completely and led me from tears (a rarity for me) to a giggle to goosebumps and for the most part I felt that way throughout. I suppose if someone is looking for a strictly-horror novel they may not find what they're looking for there, but I found the mix of romance and ghost story to be delightful. Loved the characters! I'll suggest this book to many readers with different interests!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Shivering","review":"I must admit that while i was read it i was sad,afraid and thrilled at the same time.The character of Mike Noonan was excellent and the plots and events as i turned the pages just kept getting better and better.The characters of Sara Tidwell and Max Devore were just horrifying.I finished the book around midnight and the image of Sara standing with her son did not help me get sleep.It is a must read for anyone as it has everything...love,suspense,sadness and ofcourse horror.Another Stephen King book done and i am not yet done."},{"rating":"1","title":"normally i like/love king, but........","review":"this book is about hauntings. a woman with a young girl is haunted by her heritage. a rich ancestor trying to take custody of the child. a writer whose wife is dead, becomes involved. mysterious happenings indicate supernatural hauntings. i thought this was a horror novel. it was not. and as a drama book it wasn't that interesting either. to be King, this was strangely uninteresting. the plot wasn't silly, but it didn't grab me. i wasn't really taken by the characters either."},{"rating":"2","title":"A solid, well told story...","review":"It's difficult to describe it much better than that without writing a lengthy review. In Bag of Bones, King weaves numerous subplots together with the story of Mike Noonan to create a very rich and satisfying story. This one should please all of King's fans, with its elements of horror, suspense and honestly written characters."},{"rating":"1","title":"I GUESS THE MAN IS TIRED","review":"Not the best work of Mr. King. My idol, is (I guess) tired of writing. Or the change from Viking to the other house is doing a lot of damage. See, is a ghost-curse-bloodline story. REALLY SLOW FROM BEGINNING TO END, the story behind the story is lame, the evil is way too stupid, and...well; the worst I have read of King work. It keep you reading to the end, just to see how everything turn out, and if you are like my (a Stephen King fan who will buy all that he writes no matter how awful the book is), then buy it, otherwise do yourself a favor a ask some who have it to loan it to you."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book was boring!","review":"I kept with the book for as long as I could thinking something surreal was going to happen. I have never read a StephenKing book until this one, and I was totally disappointed. I will read one more as everyone deserves a 2nd chance."},{"rating":"1","title":"ZZZZZZZZ. A very long boring story.","review":"If this were King's first novel, he would find himself flippng burgers for a living. At no point in time did I feel a draw to finish this story. Bag of Bones never captivated me, not once. I have read most of King's works and Bag of Bones is by far one of the worst books Stephen King has written. Stephen seemed sex obsessed throughout the whole story, breasts and nipples, even talk of pedophilia when \\"John talks to Mike about getting custody of Kyra.\\" As for being SCARY... looking at my monthly phone bill scares me more. It is obvious that fans of this book have never read King before."},{"rating":"1","title":"Leave 200 pages out","review":"Would've been a much better story if he left about 200 pages out. It was to drawn out - the story lost it's momentum and failed to evoke any real horror."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another disappointing potboiler","review":"King seems to have become bereft of the narrative talent that made IT and SALEM'S LOT horror classics. The protagonist in BONES is a writer who keeps a discard file of literary duds that he submits to his publisher at intervals to fulfill contractual obligations. Could this be an autobiographical novel? I expected more from King's return to his Maine roots and was greatly disappointed. A pedestrian effort at best. Certainly not classic Stephen King."},{"rating":"1","title":"Alot of wasted pages","review":"I am a long time fan of Mr. King. When he's good, he's very, very good but every now and then he comes up with a stinker. In this long, boring story, he brings up the practice of authors penning books in advance - to publish when needed. I believe this is one of those. Don't waste your money on this turkey."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Book","review":"This book is an interesting and enthralling tale of a man dealing with the haunted history of his home and with the recent death of his wife. The narrator tells a strange tale of mystery and suspense; perhaps one of King's best pieces."},{"rating":"2","title":"Superb Writing","review":"I say this because I feel like it was slow, but yet I read it so quickly. The ending was superb, and it was well worth the wait. Probably the best real novel he's written in quite awhile."},{"rating":"2","title":"A real surprise","review":"I was pleasantly surprised by this audio book. I didn't know King read it himself when I popped it in my player. He does a very good job with the reading though. The story is interesting and haunting. I found myself thinking about the story even when I hadn't listened to it for several hours. I think King reads the characters so well because of how he heard them himself as he wrote the story. The last tape has an interview with him that is very enlightening. I enjoyed the whole experience."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow!!!!!!","review":"Bag of Bones is by far his best novel to date. It will leave you hanging right up until the very end."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book, another masterpiece by the King","review":"I thought this was a great story. I couldnt put it down. There were some forshadowing parts I could have done without. But all in all it was another great book by the master. Keep it up S.K. But now on to the Dark Tower :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"A good non-fantasy, non-gore scare","review":"I enjoyed this book and thought that it was scary (in a creepy and not gory way) and also absorbing. I love to read books where at the end of each chapter there is some sort of little zinger to keep you from putting the book down before reading just another few pages, and King is the master of that, in my opinion.Also I had been disappointed with some of King's more recent books, such as Insomnia and Rose Madder, where whole other worlds are created. I find the books that are more \\"reality\\" based much more frightening. I feel that a book is much better at generating fear if you can feel that the events actually could happen, and the plot is not just total fantasy.I did feel it was a bit long and drawn out, but still definitely a good one! also nice to see cameos from so many other King characters."},{"rating":"2","title":"It made me want to keep looking over my shoulder.","review":"The first few chapters were a little dry, but overall it was an excellent book. It raised the hair on the back of my neck and made me keep looking over my shoulder. Suggestion: don't read it in a room all by yourself."},{"rating":"2","title":"realistic","review":"I have read some reviews of this book and the ones that are negative, you must have missed the story line. I will admit i haven't read all of his books because I've seen the movie. He totally captured me with Rose Madder and now Bag of Bones, I couldn't put the book down, it is the best book of the year that I have read, It was powerful and completely realistic, I felt like I was in this world with Michael Noonan, I enjoyed this book and I wanted more, I didn't want it to end.. Stephen King is a true writer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Slow start but hang in there because its worth it!","review":"Bag of Bones at first was as slow as a bag of molases on a cold day! It took me six months to read the first couple hundred pages, but it took me two short days to finish of the last 400 or so. This book takes a twist that you will never expect."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful and Creepy in the same breath!","review":"Bag of Bones, is an awsome Stephen King book. I couldn't, and didn't want to put it down.

I have never read a better book. I was entranced. It's one of those great books where everything is thrown out in the beginning and ties together at the end- like a Seinfeld episode. It'll make you laugh and cry and it has all the great Stephen King charm of terror and sex we've all grown to know and love."},{"rating":"2","title":"King writes an emotion draining ghost story","review":"Stephen King's latest is another in a long successful series of \\"I can't put this down\\" tales which combines elements of books written before, but has a fresh originality about it.Again he writes about a best selling writer (remember Dark Half?).We're in Maine again (that's no surprise).The writer has a house (and a memory) full of ghosts, including his wife's.We do a little time travel around this summer home which is haunted by those who have gone before.The writer encounters new tragedy but, as frequently happens, there is redemption for the writer.Mostly, he just leaves you wondering all the way through how the redemption will be realized and the result is satisfying for King fans."},{"rating":"2","title":"Definately one of Kings best.","review":"Light a candle, turn out the lights and prepare for the marks your chair leaves on your buttocks from lack of movement while reading this book.

People make a big deal that King is turning fifty. But don't forget that Mario Puzo had his FIRST success as a writer with the GODFATHER when he was fifty, and Puzo is still writing like crazy all these years later. So, King, keep \`em coming!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Much more than I expected.","review":"I expected that Bag of Bones would be a typical Stephen King novel. Being a King fan I wanted the gripping, horrifying tale that I wouldn't stop reading. I admit the book started kind of slow; however, around the 100th page it took on speed. Suffice it to say that this is the only King book that made me cry. It addressed the horrors of America's past and it will touch, in some way, anyone with a heart."},{"rating":"1","title":"Daft story reminiscent of the 1970s","review":"We already have one Robert Ludlum. We don't need another. And we certainly don't want to go back to those daft, sub-Bond thrillers of the 1970s, of which this book is eerily reminiscent. The corny, daft story and cardboard characters (three types: tough, sexy or evil - that's your lot) had me thinking of Austen Powers. Except there are no good jokes."},{"rating":"1","title":"What Happened?","review":"After being enthralled by his beautifully evocative \\"Berlin Noir\\" trilogy, it came as a huge disappointment that Kerr has elected to trespass on Elmore Leonard's turf armed with as little wit and originality as this book exhibits. We've met more interesting versions of these characters in Leonard's works and, what's worse is that the reader can see each plot twist come from 50 pages away. Compared to \\"Berlin Noir\\", the writing is lazy and uninspired. The plot line, itself, seems to have been pulled from the B-movie recycle bin."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing for Kerr","review":"I have read a couple other Phillip Kerr novels and found them to be very complete, well researched and truly captivating. \\"A Five Year Plan\\" does not however have any of the flare that Kerr's past novels have. The story for the most part drags, there is no interesting facts or history, and characters that the reader coundn't care a less about.This novel made me wonder if Kerr just published this to get a movie deal. It is missing all the essential parts to make a good novel, but has just a basic storyline that will tranfer to film. For the new \\"Kerr\\" reader I suggest \\"Esau\\" or \\"The Grid\\" which are much better well rounded books."},{"rating":"1","title":"A very disappointing effort.","review":"Since Kerr is the author of the excellent and highly regarded Berlin Noir trilogy, I had high hopes for this title. However, I found this a cheap, sleazy read, hacked together with little regard for the tight, thoughtful storytelling Kerr has proven he's capable of. Plot? Nothing Kerr made me care about. Characters? Uneven, and mostly unbelievable. \\"A Five Year Plan\\" almost reads as it was inspired by Joan Collins, or maybe Nancy Taylor Rosenberg. With the Berlin Noir trio, Kerr has proven that he can write; with this one, he proves that sometimes he just gets it all wrong."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do yourself a favor...","review":"if you want to torture yourself, that is:Read BERLIN NOIR then read this.Or better yet, read BERLIN NOIR then run face first into a brick wall.You will walk away feeling the exact same way as you do finishing A Five Year Plan: \\"What the hell happened?\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Only one suprise is too few for a Kerr Novel","review":"After reading March Violets, I was a Kerr fan. Pale Criminal and German requiem were outstanding and then the slide began. Philosophical Investigation and Dead Meat were just a little off center. The Grid tried but didn't have the snap, Esau slowed and then Five Year plan is the least interesting. Too much moralizing became corny or cant and while four letter words can add snap, in this case they bacame as boring as \\"ahh\\". THere are interesting parts to this tale, but I would rather reread Berlin noir."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Sea-Going thriller","review":"I was struck by the similarity of this book to some of Elmore Leonard's.There are smart people and stupid people , thugs and somewhat sympatheticrogues such as the book's \\"hero\\" , Dave, a recently released convict.This is one of the raunchiest books I have run into in a long time so far as thelanguage used. There are 3 F-bombs on the first page, and the pace keeps up. Thegangsters express themselves constantly in sexual terms. The plot includes pornographicmovie viewing, obscene statuary and other gratuitous titillation.Dave seduces Kate, later finds out she is an FBI agent. The dialog leading up to theseduction is rife with double entendres, references to literature,etc. and is quiteclever and entertaining.

The expensive ones with a grinder either stop working or need expensive maintenance. They have too much plastic components inside them. The quality of their espresso is not better than any Nespresso capsule coffee. The only way to to top this wonderful machine is to go to the HX machines/e61 group with an expensive grinder which with proper maintenance may outlive many of us and has the capabability of giving you the ultimate espresso shot. So Guys save money and time and stop fooling around. I estimated with a machine costing $2000 going bust in 1-2 years if you are lucky it stays working that long will give you 4000 shots of consistent espresso with no harm to this Nespresso machine.

We live in Switzerland, and here Nespresso makes a big deal about efficiently recycling the capsules, and it's very easy to find places to leave them when they're spent. Unfortunately, there's no mention of recycling on the US website.

First, it is an excellent machine; well built, simple, beautiful and seemingly indestructible. Second, it produces some of the best tasting espresso I have ever had. That said, the capsules really are expensive, thus the four stars. For that reason alone, I limit myself to only those times I can sit back and savor the coffee. This is not for bolting down a cup and heading out the door to work. This is for spoiling oneself. In that vein may I suggest a cold night, a thick robe, a good book and a cup of very rich hot chocolate laced with a double espresso. Under those conditions the cost seems minimal."},{"rating":"2","title":"great coffee","review":"This machine makes the best espresso.

The Espresso is expensive but pretty good. My problem is with the reliability of the unit and the bad customer service that Nespresso provides. I initially called them, the CSR took all my information, tried to do some troubleshooting and then said that a Technician will be calling me to send me a replacement and schedule repair of my unit. 10 days later no one called so I called again; the CSR could see all my info and apologized that the Tech did not call but still she said that she needs to troubleshoot the machine again before having a tech call. I told her that was ridiculous. She said because her name will be on the work order she has to trouble shoot the machine again. I asked to talk to her manager; she said he is out of his desk but he will call me within the hour. The manager never called! I will call again and this time I am going to ask for my money back."},{"rating":"1","title":"The most expensive, yet wonderously excellent espresso you'll ever have","review":"It makes a fabulous and consistent cup of espresso, with many varities of coffee to choose from. Its easy, drop in the capsule and simply rinse off the removable capsule drop area. I'm not sure if its easier than a traditional espresso machine. In a traditional machine, you simply pack some grounds into a filter, instead of using a capsule.I emailed Nespresso and found out that each espresso capsule has 5.5 grams of coffee in it, or .19 ounces. Because there are 16 ounces in a pound of coffee, it takes 84 capsules to equal one pound. At $0.49 a capsule, Nespresso is charging $41.16 FOR 1 POUND OF COFFEE.You must use Nespresso capsules with this system, and only Nespresso sells the capsules.

Terms like \\"deterritorialization\\" and \\"rhizomatic processes\\" infest the text to the point where you feel like you're reading some strange dialect of the English language. It's maddening. (2) The author presents a charming but hopelessly naive utopian view of an emerging social world, centered around the sharing of knowledge within cyberspace, that will usher in a marvelous new era of individually-centered democracy and freedom - the notion of \\"collective intelligence.\\" One wonders if Levy has actually spent any time at all communing with the people who populate the chatrooms and message boards of cyberspace - \\"collective intelligence\\" indeed, more like \\"collective prejudice and stupidity.\\" It is completely beyond me how others have found this book to be of any value whatsoever."},{"rating":"2","title":"SOUL","review":"This is a good album, I don't understand were people get off saying anything negative about this man and his music.

The author of the first Demon Diary had to stop writing between the first and second mangas due to his high school entry exams, so they had to get a new author. Kara is still the illustrator, though, so although the writing style has changed a bit (Not much, but it is noticable if you re-read all the mangas over and over again), the pics are still the same as ever. After the untimely death of Mr. Tomato (Poor Mr. Tomato, we hardly new ye), Raenef decides to leave and return once he has proved himself to be a true demon lord. Of course, Eclipse is left to wander around searching for him. Raenef meets a young cleric, Chris(THE SUPERGENIUS!!!!), and is unfortunatly stuck taking him back to the castle with him.

This second part of the series has been just as well written as the first (even though the author of this book is different than the author of the first, but that doesn't matter because the story still follows the first.) I love the teacher/student relationship that is shown in the story. It's so beautiful! I am litterally DYING just to read the next one! (And folks, just because it's shounen-ai DOES NOT MEAN THAT ECLIPSE AND RAENEF ARE GAY.) I mean, if people are bothered by that, then they shouldn't even bother with the book.

A most wrong title: D-Day was not THE climatic battle ( Stalingrad: the most long, bloody, a decisive turning point). Junk book, definitely. I still don't understand how I was fooled into buying it, I should ask Mr. Ambrose for a refund."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad History","review":"This terrible book's problems begin with its titleand don't get a bit better.For the reviewer who cannot understand how anyone could flunk this book, it is called KNOWLEDGE and OBJECTIVITY. The book is flawed in its understanding of troops involved (of ALL nations), their training, motivation, experience levels. It is flawed in what so many others have pointed out as ethnocentricity....the author just cannot stand it that there were other, non-American participants in this action. It IS a decent collection of first-person accounts from American soldiers, but beyond that it is ... as factual history.The reviewer who bought this after seeing \\"Private Ryan\\"....I think it is wonderful that someone is motivated, for any reason, to pick up history books....not enough of that in the USA today...but please realize that, for the most part, both the movie and this book are largely fiction.Well, cold and unfeeling as it may be, at least this guy can no longer write trash like this any longer."},{"rating":"1","title":"hmm d-day","review":"i heard that Mr Stephen E. Ambrose is one of the most regarded US historian so i picked some of his books like Eisenhower , citizen solider , D-day..... Now i know the reason why the American love him , honestly his style is fascinating , but Ambrose's books are just some cheap progandas , kind of novels than facts ,and deeply bias. D-Day is no exception .and since this is one of the most bias book , i wonder can we believe the information it gave ?"},{"rating":"1","title":"deeply biased and misleading: avoid!","review":"Any account that perpetuates the untruth (shared by some of the book's reviewers, apparently)that d-day was mainly a US affair, and US led, with the US troops doing the lion share is insulting to all that took part, GIs included. And stupid. Yet that is what Ambrose does. Some facts: D day and the battle of Normandy were fought by about 50-50 US and UK/Canadian forces(incl some other nationalities); the attack and campaign was planned and led by Montgomery (a British general). It succeeded. UK/Canadian forces held down the bulk of the German forces. Then the US made the break out in the west. The best army was probably the German one. Clear? clear. Read Robin Neillands 'Battle of Normandy' for the best account, not Ambrose's feeble bit of nationalism."},{"rating":"1","title":"Propaganda and patriotism","review":"After 100 first pages I had to stop reading this book forever. The awesomeness and courage of US soldiers is described in a way that makes non-US reader sick. There are nice stories and facts, but Ambrose's Patriotism and gush is too much. Shouldn't history writers even try to be objective?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed this book. Very detailed, very interesting and a rather quick read. The wealth of information is staggering as are the personnal accounts of that day. Recollections by veterans are priceless. A sobering reminder of the price of freedom, a price we will be called upon to pay from time to time..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Captivating book for anyone interested in WWII","review":"This was actualy my first stephen Ambros book, and man am i happy i read it. I found myself reading this book often for hours straight because every line was so vividly detailed and captivating. I actualy finished this 600 page book in a little less then 2 weeks. This is great because most books dont interest me and take at least a month to finish because i just dont feel like reading them. From the first day of planning until the last event of D-day this book will tell you everythign that went on. Highly recomended for anyone who is interested in the normandy landings or even WWII overall."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Most Important Book About the Most Important Day of WWII","review":"After so much (deserved) praise has been heaped upon Ambrose, it's pointless now to cover all of the high points in his study of D-Day.Suffice it to say that this is a book for those who love history and for those who don't; Ambrose is as good a writer as there is today."},{"rating":"1","title":"Putting the Record Straight","review":"Ambrose described an alleged incident on Omaha Beach in which a Captain Zappacosta threatened the British coxswain of his landing craft with a pistol in order to make him move closer inshore. Private Robert Sales, the only survivor of that landing craft has since stated that this was a complete invention. It never happened. Sales, who was angered by the allegation, challenged Ambrose in person and asked him to correct it but the writer just brushed it off. There is much more in this vein - Ambrose rarely missed an opportunity to disparage America's Allies. If this is representative of the standard of his research, then this book should be treated with extreme caution. His sections on the Anglo-Canadian contribution to D-Day are in any case lamentably brief. This is just bad history. There are many excellent works about D-Day, but this isn't one of them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Putting a face to the horror","review":"An amazing book. Reads like a novel yet it is based on the kind of research found only in historical account writing. Ambrose, as the leading expert on the Overlord invasion, weaves together official military accounts, soldier letters, and actual soldier interviews into a wonderful, alive tale of that day. I haven't read anything close to as fulfilling in the terms of D-Day history."},{"rating":"1","title":"D-Day was not the climactic battle of WW2","review":"I have problems with the title of this book - right off the bat it is propaganda which completely distorts the history of WW2. Stalingrad, Stalingrad, Stalingrad- this was the climactic battle of the war- simply - no Soviet victory at Stalingrad, no D-Day, possibly no more Western-style \\"democracy\\". Stalingrad was a D-Day battle a day for five months and the Soviets lost more killed in this one battle than the U. S. did in the whole war. Stephen Ambrose is eloquent but he is basically a propagandist with a very specific point of view. His is the history of the conquerer, and now that the Soviet Union is no longer with us this Ambrosian version of WW2 will prevail. History belongs to those who are winning."},{"rating":"2","title":"Engrossing book.","review":"If you are a history buff, this is a must-read book. Ambrose does his homework and weaves personal accounts into the account of one of history's landmark days. The exploration of both sides of the battle made for good reading. There is no way for a book to capture the horror of Omaha Beach, but this author does an admirable job. I would highly recommend this book to anyone interested in WWII and military history in general."},{"rating":"2","title":"Memory of D-Day alive and well!","review":"Stephen Ambrose has done it again. Not only has he preserved the D-Day experience in an unparralled fashion he has paid a lasting tribute through his research and writing to the men of D-Day. I recommend this book to all those interested in one of the most important days in human history. Well done Stephen Ambrose."},{"rating":"1","title":"One sided, nationalistic story - avoid if you care about history.","review":"Here's the news:less than half the forces on the allied side on D Day were from the U.S. Would you guess that from reading Ambrose's book? - nope. The vast bulk of the volume is devoted to the U.S. experience. It seems Ambrose thinks the British, Canadians etc were just there to make up the numbers.It's just not acceptable for a historian to devote the bulk of what purports to be an account of that day to one national contingent and then call it 'D Day' . To perpetrate that is petty and appallingly parochial. Worse: it's offensive to the memories of ALL those who fought and died for democracy. The American sacrifice was real and doesn't need this sort of thing to keep its memory green. Robin Neillands and John Keegan have both written much better, fairer accounts.If Ambrose had called the book 'the American contribution to D-Day' no one could have complained. As it is, it has no claim to our serious consideration as history."},{"rating":"1","title":"Image over substance","review":"With all the inaccuracies and plagiarism charges leveled at Ambrose, one has to wonder how much of this book to believe. And recollections so many years later, which form the essence of the book, can not be substantiated. So, it might be better to think of this as a work of fiction rather than fact. Plus it's heavily biased toward the American side, as widely noted. And it lacks much of a historical perspective. Still, it's fascinating and can easily be read in a day."},{"rating":"2","title":"What a generation.","review":"This book is typical of Steven Ambrose: well-written, well-researched and absorbing. It has caused me to look at my father's generation with an even higher regard. Some parts, especially the Omaha beach battle description, are not for the squeamish but they accurately depict the kind of sacrifice that these people made. I recommend it highly. God bless America's Veterans."},{"rating":"2","title":"Emotional account of one of the greatest struggles of mankid","review":"Wounderfully written, in the fact that Ambrose told most of the story from the soliders point of view. Especially the stories of Omaha beach (16th,116th)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lets America Down","review":"I think the most disappointing thing about this book is that by focusing on US forces to the exclusion of others Ambrose insults not just other Allied forces but their American comrades as well who I am sure would be shocked and embarrassed by the treatment of their allied comrades."},{"rating":"2","title":"this an good book","review":"I like this book so much.I thought that it was full of important info about the war.

Makes me want to read more about d-day.","review":"Very thorough account of d-day and the planning and thought that went into the attack by Eisenhower, etc. Several great accounts by the men who were there and their individual perspectives. After reading this book I am still hungry for more books about d-day. This book has peaked my interest in military history. One suggestion--get yourself a very good, detailed map of Normandy--many place names (in French) are given and a map is helpful to follow the story."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Greatest WWII History Book EVER!!","review":"The moment I read the first line in D-Day I was hooked. The evidence Stephen Ambrose presents is unpresidented. One of the reasons I enjoyed it so much was the fact that it was real and I was able to understand what my grandfather went through. I owe Stephen Ambrose many thanks for creating this book so everyone knows what really went on."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ugly American Read, Where is Canada and Britain?","review":"If you want a book with a major case of John Wayne syndrome. ,his is the book for you. The mission Involved the US taking utah and omaha beach, Brits taking Gold and Sword and Canada taking Juno. The Canucks shattered the german defences at Juno within 2 hours. Americans spearheaded attacks on only 2 of the 5 beaches at Normandy. you read this book and you'll think Amricans were the only ones that showed up ."},{"rating":"1","title":"A bit biased toward American effort and Eishenhower","review":"I was left with a disappointed feeling after reading the book. There was not much structure in the book, as far as I can see. Eishenhower and Rommel comparison and the details of there personal life are useless. It would have better if some information could be shed on Monty and Bradley roles in this particular battle. There is hardly any mention of the British and Canadian role, even there landing maps, and progress maps are missing. There are hardly any details from the German side. Could have given a chapter on how the battle progressed. The personal histories are too fragmented to be of any use. Overall I feel that the author has tried to deliver a book which captures both the personal side of the battle, and the historical side; and has failed to do either."},{"rating":"1","title":"Prejudiced and selective","review":"The worst book about D-day ever written. Never misses an opportunity to insult the British allies from the highest general to the lowest private soldier, and to downplay their role in the joint effort. Anecdotes are highly selective. Every other book on D-Day gives full credit to all involved.Just off now to brew some tea."},{"rating":"2","title":"When our grandparents saved the world...","review":"In the late 20th century it is almost incomprehensible to consider an evil so pervasive, so oppressive, and so murderous as Hitler's Reich. An entire society brainwashed to conquer the world and to enslave entire countries were not stopped by will power, or flower power, or by mere rhetoric. Nazism was stopped by citizens from every walk of life in the world's great democracies -- the battle for freedom began on the beaches of northern France on June 6, 1944. The Americans at Omaha and Utah, the British and Canadians at Sword and Juno suffered almost insuffrable casualties -- not to mention the hedgerow fighting that followed. Ambrose's book is an account about people, for people. It may give you an identity that you did not even know you had -- the sons and daughters and grandchildren of an entire generation that secured for us every freedom we enjoy today."},{"rating":"2","title":"great story and a great bibliography but flawed in conclusio","review":"Stephen as always gives a great look at the battle which is neither climatic nor as difinative as it was. It fails to look at the german side especially the kriegsmarine alert not to mention the poet paul Verlain...blessent mon coer d'une langueur monotone."},{"rating":"2","title":"good oral history, weak analysis","review":"Ambrose writes very well and provides us with an interesting, though skewed history, of D-Day. Ambrose is strong on personal stories, obviously using the oral history resources very well. However, the book fails when Ambrose analyzes the strategies of and decisions made by the leaders. His analysis is quick, superficial and inadequately substantiated.Worth the read for the stories, but skip his analysis."},{"rating":"1","title":"Narrative with big holes","review":"I liked his use of the soldier's point of view. But, all in all, a big disappointment. He didn't make good use of the maps to tell the story. For that matter, there should have been more maps.The unpardonable thing was the way he treated what happened on the British and Canadian beaches, all of which got a couple of small chapters at the end. It was almost as if saying, oh, by the way, there were some Brits around who landed on a couple of beaches."},{"rating":"2","title":"Compelling book with fresh conclusions","review":"I found Ambrose's narrative of the D-Day invasion to be both compelling and accesible, in contrast to other books on the subject. I also welcomed his new conclusions concerning the \\"German supersoldier\\" myth which has grown up around the \\"popular history\\" of World War II. The desire of so many people to alleviate the German military of tactical responsibility for the war's loss and moral responsibility for its commencement is disturbing, and it is refreshing to hear a contrary voice. I cried many times reading D-Day. It inspired many emotions of horror, patriotism, courage and fear, but ultimately left me with a terrible feeling of waste, as all books on war probably should."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful history of D-Day","review":"I found this book to be a real page turner. The stories of the men involved made it feel as if you were there on D-Day. Definitely recommended for anyone who wants to learn about D-Day."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ambrose's Best","review":"In all of his other books, Ambrose's weak writing gets in the way of great stories. In this book, the story is so monumental that even he can't drag it down. It's his best book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Liar, Liar","review":"This book is a hoax, starting with the title. The climatic battles of WWII were obviously fought in the East - more than one million died in Stalingrad from gunfire, cold and famine (the battle raged for six months non-stop), and tens of thousands in Kursk a few months later (after which the germans could no longer attack). Ambrose knows it, but he chooses to lie so he can earn a few bucks from american \\"patriots\\". Jesus, it wasn't even the biggest american battle of WWII! This is the kind of situation Barbara Ehrenreich so aptly criticized in her book Rites of Blood."},{"rating":"2","title":"Extremely informative, but...","review":"...Ambrose gets a little too sappy at the end. Yes, these men were awfully brave, but I could figure that out for myself. Eisenhower's words at the end of the book say far more than the author's about the GIs' courage and will. All the same, Ambrose is a very readable historian, something we're seeing a lot more of today. His reliance on the oral histories of men on both sides makes for an informative, enjoyable read. With 'Private Ryan' fresh in a lot of peoples' minds, this offers a side the movie doesn't show: namely tales of the paratroopers and what happened once the GIs got to the top of the bluffs at Omaha Beach."},{"rating":"2","title":"The last thing needed is another review of this book but...","review":"Largely because of \\"D-Day\\" and \\"Citizen Soldier\\" and now the opening of the D-Day museum in New Orleans, Stephen Ambrose has revived the monumental debt this country owes the men and women of WW II. His ability to write history like a gifted novelist and his weaving throughout of the soldiers' tale in their own words, makes these two works the best of the written history of the ETO. Hard to imaging one being able to read either without feeling overwhelming pride, humility and a clearer understanding of how much we have lost in half a century.Both are extraordinary books written by an extraordinary historian."},{"rating":"1","title":"An Insult To Veterans","review":"This book is a lazy piece of flag waving, not in any sense an account of historical fact. Nobody reading this would realise for example that most of the Allied troops involved on D Day were not American. The American GIs sacrifice on D Day was genuinely heroic and should be honoured. This kind of nationalistic propaganda insults their memory. Mr Ambrose should stick to the facts if he wants to be taken seriously as a historian.

In this book, she demolishes most of the tried-and-thought-true assumptions about politics, usually taking a more optimistic tack. The thrust of her argument is first, that the American public is not becoming less politically capable (for the most part), and second, that the media pursues its own agenda and distorts the news more than we like to admit. She makes both of these points in a somewhat messy manner, because her topics are all over the place, but it's hard to disagree with her at the end."},{"rating":"1","title":"Informative? Yes. Dry?
