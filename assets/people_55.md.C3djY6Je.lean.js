Myrtle is sloppy often to the point of being disgusting, and eats voraciously and obsessively; there is even a reference to her throwing her bloated stomach \\"over her shoulder\\" when it gets in her way. These comments are ugly and unnecessary, and turn Myrtle into a grotesque oddity.

Since I know that adding connectors always generates some loss of signal I wanted to use a high end, premium connector to minimize this loss.The problem with this connector was that the male RCA plugs fit very loosely into the female RCA jacks on the sub. Every time I moved the sub to adjust a setting the connectors came loose, generating grating feedback from the speaker. I subsequently tried two other adapters, including a $1.99 cheapie and the fit to the sub jacks was tight and true - i.e. the problem was with the Monster adapter, NOT the sub jacks.

It's nice to see the SG team in an environment that isn't the Pacific Northwest and some quarry. The mountains are gorgeous which adds to the feeling that the SG-1 team is on \\"another planet.\\" It's a very enjoyable movie. But make sure you have enough bandwidth to watch it without having the movie reload every few minutes which is very distracting."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stargate was once a wonderful show, now it's just repetitive drivel","review":"I used to love Stargate. But maybe it was the departure of Richard Dean Anderson, I don't know. But the last few seasons have been extremely repetitive and tiresome. Random Ancient artifact saves the day. The Ark of Truth is no exception. The only character that gets any decent character development is Tomin when he has a change of heart. Otherwise it's the same ole tired formula. 1) Find Ancient artifact. 2) magically decipher it despite how ridiculously old and advanced it is. 3) Save the day. 4) Lather rinse repeat. It was bad enough that the first seasons of Stargate dealt with Humans miraculously defeating an enemy that was vastly more advanced and had been in power for thousands of years. But my suspension of disbelief simply cannot tolerate simple humans fighting virtual deities and somehow winning. It is extremely disappointing to see Stargate fall so far."},{"rating":"1","title":"LONG BORING FILLER EPISODE","review":"I HAVE BEEN A FAN OF STARGATE SINCE ITS INCEPTION I HAVE ALL 10 SEASONS, I HAVE ALL THE ATLANTIS EPISODE, WHILE I ENJOY MOST OF THEM, THERE ARE A FEW JUST FLUFFY/FILLER EPISODES THAT THEY DO WHEN A PERSON GET SICK OR CAN NOT BE AROUND FOR AN EPISODE.

Well, maybe."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Wrap to the Series","review":"I really like SG-1's first (if you do not count the ORIGINAL Stargate movie, which was not really SG-1) foray into feature length films. The Ori story line was handled magnificently. I was a little disappointed that the ending (of the movie, not the whole storyline) was not bigger, but it was very well done."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great end to the Ori story","review":"I felt The Ark of Truth was a great finale to the Ori storyline, however the movie was too short and seemed like a long season finale rather than a motion picture caliber movie. The acting was top of the line Stargate SG-1 fare but I wasn't impressed with the use of replicators as a catalyst in the story. The \\"Terminator\\" also made it more cheesy because the replicators could have just made multiple Terminators without the need for human tissue. Why stay in a crab-like form all the time? It is in my humblest opinion that Continuum was a much more polished story, primarily because The Ark of Truth was a quick finish to the Ori storyline. For the Trekkies, the actual Ark of Truth was really an \\"Adjust the Heisenburg\\" matrix style solution to a problem. I highly recommend watching The Ark of Truth just so you get closure for SG-1 prior to Sci-Fi's cancellation of the series."},{"rating":"2","title":"Why end the series?","review":"This was a nice enough continuation of the series but seems to lack some of the polish one would equate with a film. Granted there is more time designated for plot evolution and a bigger budget for effects but it lacked the 'wow' factor.That said, I enjoyed the plot, the effects, the fact there weren't commercials and that Jack O'Neill was back with the group (you can't ever have enough pithy humor or cake!).

I agree completely with the review written by Captain Hornblower \\"captainhornblower\\", so I won't repeat what the Captain said. I will add a little though. Since this was a made-for-DVD movie, one would have expected something more than what ended up being a 1hr 40min TV show without commercials. All the acting was terrific as usual, and the special affects were great, and the subtle humor moments were classic Stargate, but the plot was just gone. It was as if the writers handed over the job of writing the plot as a 9th-grade class assignment. As the Captain said, \\"too simple\\"! The whole Ori problem has been a really cool idea in the last season of SG1, and this movie was the perfect opportunity to continue the cool Ori story, but it just fizzled out."},{"rating":"1","title":"not great","review":"this was great disapointment as the last show for such a great series.It had no plot. It was just a series of random scenes mixed together."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing...","review":"Bellow the quality of single episodes. A reviewer in this page called it \\"a series of random scenes mixed together\\". Add to it that the link between the scenes is weak at best. Even the scenes are poorly conceived. In one occasion a crew fires hundreds of round of military munitions aboard the spaceship without putting a single scratch to the ship. In another one, 2 men move a rock-slab of a several tons by just pushing it. Not to mention Teal'c miraculous marathon, ran at a speed compared to a spaceship. There is some entertainment value, specially considering the link to the TV series. And that is why I gave it more than Zero."},{"rating":"1","title":"horrible","review":"it is unbelivable to see such horror made in 2008, maybe in 1970 would have been (barely) acceptable.If I could give negative star I would have done so."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can I get my money back?","review":"This is an awful attempt to keep SG-1 fans hooked.

But I still like all the actors and hope the producers can come up with something better next time.Thanks"},{"rating":"1","title":"More Stuntmen should have been lit on fire","review":"Not the best thing to come out of the Stargate world, but not hideously awful(but close). Could have been an episode if they had taken out some of the pointless middle 'plotlines'. Made me miss Jack and I still don't like Carter's new hair. The best part was the behind the scene part where they show how they have a gel coating they can put on a stuntman and then light them on fire with a blow torch and not hurt them-at all. That is awesome-better then anything in this movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"1st of many! hopefully","review":"This movie will be awesome of the two that will be released so far.

It's actually the wrap up for the TV series that SCI FI stupidly cancelled (yet has wrestling, that makes sense). The plot in this movie was actually intended to be the last three episodes of season ten and the first three episodes of season 11. Then the show got cancelled so they held off production and those watching the series never had a wrap-up. What does this mean for the viewer. It means that if you weren't watching the series, you may not get a whole lot out of the movie because it relies heavily on what viewers have been watching for the last 10 seasons. If you're looking for a stand alone wait for the next one."},{"rating":"2","title":"SG1-Ark of Truth","review":"WOW. What a great movie. I was sitting on the edge of my seat for the whole thing. As always, you did not know how they were going to save the Galaxy, again. Wish the TV Series had went another year or two to give Ben Browder and Claudia Black some more time in the series since \\"Far Scape\\". Which was a also a great show. But if you have to end it. They did an excellent job in doing it. Looking forward to \\"Continumum\\". When the team time travels and mess all the time lines up. Really looking forward to see how they will fix that mess."},{"rating":"2","title":"I don't think the fans will be dissapointed","review":"My husband is the true fan and the one this was bought for, but I thought I would add my two cents. Really entertaining. A little more violently graphic than the TV show and a little more language as well. The language didn't bother my 8 year old but the violence did. Just something to keep in mind if you watch it with the family. All in all I thought it was very in keeping with the series and worth seeing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Stargate - The Ark of Truth DVD","review":"With the last of the Stargate series, it was good to have one more story with details filling in and completing parts that were left unfinished.

Each of the team members undergoes a personal trial without the physical help or support of the other members. The drama and tension is successfully maintained until the end.

Naturally, another movie needs to be made....how about finishing off the Wraith in a crossover plot with the remaining SG Atlantis people!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome story, only problem is...","review":"It looked TOO good! How is that a problem? Well, when you watch the TV show you get used to stuff looking a certain way.

I still believe that after O'neill left the SG1 Team; She was the new character that saved the Show."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worse than any episode","review":"You'd think the Stargate folks could handle this two-hour-straight-to-DVD medium, since they do many two and three-part episodes. But, apparently, without these cliffhanger-inducing structural constraints, they are completely lost. The replicator battles were particularly mind-numbing ... for how long were we supposed to stay excited about endless machine-gun fire at CGI scrap-metal? It brought to the foreground the biggest weakness of the Stargate franchise: its tendency to fall into the most mindless fantasy-militarism imaginable, in this case through unquestioned adoration of massive firefights."},{"rating":"1","title":"disapointed","review":"So far I have returned 2 DVD's due to corrupt sectors. The quality is extremely poor and the script could have been written by a fifth grader. The movie continues in the same mundane direction that caused the series to fail.

I thought the whole storyline and outcome was excellent. I hope that MGM continues making the Stargate movies for as long as they can."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good movie for a Stargate SG-1 fan","review":"First I would like to say that the production value of this movie is pretty high. If you loved the TV series you will love this DVD movie. Everyone (all of SG-1 heroes) have their parts perfectly played out in the usual style. My only disappointment is that Adria (played by Morena Baccarin) the main villain has very little screen time. I think out of the whole 102 minutes of the movie she has probably around less than 5 minutes of screen time. The plot is somewhat simplistic but it worked as the movie is on a time constraint and puts an inevitable closure to the chapters in the Ori storyline arc. Can't wait for Stargate: Continuum as it will be interesting how SG-1 will outwit and survive Ba'al's trickeries. One thing I have always wondered is what happened to the people of the various planets that were converted to Origin and now having their faith/beliefs literally yanked away from under their feet?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Love the Ark of Truth","review":"Well made. Finishes where the series terminated and tied up loose ends. Much better than most of the series that just end and leave you wondering what the hell happened to ...?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Ending to the Ori Story line","review":"The Art of Truth was an interesting and fast paced ending to the SG-1 Ori storyline, tying up some loose ends along the way. I thought the movie could have benefitted from being a little longer (2 hours or so instead of about an hour and a half), especially since we were left with such an open ending of the regular series. There could have been some more historical scenes and some better explanations of things that needed to be wrapped up from the series. However, overall I feel that the movie is a pretty good wrap up of the story. It definitely had some great music (adding a symphony orchestra rather than synthesized music is almost always better in my book) and awesome visual effects (a bigger movie budget always helps not that the series had bad effects by any means). Hopefully, future movies will wrap up a few more things as well as introducing some new ideas."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must-have for SG-1 addicts","review":"The Ark of Truth wraps up many of the unanswered questions left from the Ori story line. The movie is the same high quality you would expect from a Stargate SG-1 episode, only at feature length and without commercials. We have the DVD set for every Stargate season. We were very pleased with The Ark of Truth, and we can't wait for the next DVD to be released."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ark of Truth","review":"A visually stunning and captivating finale to the Ori storyline. Its packed full of jam, as Vala would say. The special effects are brilliant and exceedingly detailed. The soundtrack is equally remarkable. It maintains a pretty fast pace throughout- this is not a single episode drawn out into a movie but more like a feature length uber-episode. The producers/writers managed to preserve the classic Stargate feel while still making the show refreshing and entertaining. There is an optional introduction for those who have not seen the 9th and 10th seasons, so if you're a little behind with the series you can still follow the movie (though I highly recommend watching the seasons if you haven't). All in all, I really enjoyed the movie and would recommend it to anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Art of Truth","review":"I love this video, I can't get enough of Stargate. I hope they continue to make more direct to DVD movies."},{"rating":"2","title":"Got it and Watched it...","review":"I guess I got it early from Amazon, but watched it today.First of all, I'm a fan so pretty much unless it was a total bomb, I was going to like it...Hopefully, without giving anything away, it was a good story.

I also liked the last two or three seasons. So I was very disappointed when this movie turned out to be quite boring. That is mostly due to the bad script and bad action sequences."},{"rating":"1","title":"Team chemistry not there","review":"I'm a new (and very late) fan to the Stargate Series... catching up on all of the shows via DVD, and bought Ark of Truth, and wow...the first thing I noticed was a lack of chemistry between the \\"new\\" team. It's also disturbing that Lt. Col Mitchell gets the lead the command when Carter has been there the longest. Also, the writer chose to divide SG1 into 3 separate units during their off world crisis. Special effects are ok, but nothing more extrordinary than what we see on the tv show. This could have been a 2parter on SciFi Channel instead.I also usually enjoy DVD commentary on a film, this was basically 90mins of the writer/director patting himself on the back about camera angles and lighting. No insight into the story or characters...perhaps because the story was weak."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice ending to the whole series","review":"The Ark of Truth gave a satisfactory ending to the series. I enjoyed seeing the crew back together again minus O'Neil. What's up with that? Anyway, the story was good and so was the pacing. I really enjoyed the effects and they'll probably look even better once this goes to Blue-Ray, that is if they plan on giving it an HD transfer.I realize many of you haven't had the opportunity to see this yet since it won't come out until March. But let me say I don't think you'll be too disappointed. It makes me want to buy the whole series and start from the beginning again.Whatever you do, buy or rent this movie, especially if you're a Stargate fan."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great movie and a decent length","review":"I really enjoyed this more than I expected.I originally thought it would be the same length as a two-part SG1 episode but was pleased to see it had a running length of something like 1 hour 43 minutes.The whole thing was well done and exciting.My only complaint is why wasn't it released on Blu-Ray?"},{"rating":"1","title":"DID NOT PLAY","review":"WOULD NOT PLAY IN MY DVD PLAYERS DONT NO WHY IT WOULD NOT WORKWILL TRY LATER TO WORK IT OUT ALL SEND IT BACK"},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Poor","review":"The original Stargate movie was great.Stargate: Continuum was also good.(And the plot is such that you can enjoy it without watching 7 seasons of TV episodes)Stargate: The Ark of Truth, however is just plain terrible.The central piece of this movie is the Ark of Truth, but we never are never led to understand it, and it is never really explained.It is simply a magic wand used to tie together a plot which has plenty of progression, but no purpose or direction.The end result is nothing other than un-imaginative dross."},{"rating":"2","title":"Finally . . .","review":"Finally, the Ori saga is complete. Taking place where the series ended and completing the 2 year fight with the Ori, The Ark of Truth is a grand conclusion to one of the best series ever made. It is a fast, thrilling feature length film that complements what has come before without making to too complex. Without giving away too many details, this finishes what season 9 -10 was building to and gives it a grand finale. A wonderful bonus for new comers ... or those that have wandered away from the series in earlier seasons, it comes complete with a featurette, SG-1: The Road Taken, which catches anyone up for the orginal movie. I recommend everyone watch it before seeing Ark of Truth. This movie is the best of SG-1, condensed into movie form, with loads of special effects the series couldn't afford. Any scifi fan will love this. Enjoy!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"More = Good","review":"Please buy this DVD so they will make more SG-1 movies. I would buy it again despite what I'm about to say. The movie had its moments, and was visually stunning, but I couldn't get past the fact that they wrapped up 90 minutes of building story in less than 5 minutes, left major questions unanswered, and just got plain silly at the very end. I miss this show very much, and honestly just about anything is better than nothing, so even though I was pretty disappointed overall this is the only place you'll hear me say it."},{"rating":"1","title":"High hopes but a big letdown","review":"I had really high hopes for this movie, but it seems that the steady slope of quality stories an acting found in the last two seasons of the series continues here. The actors used to take the plotlines and scripts seriously but now it seems that they've opted for \\"campiness\\". A lot of the plot doesn't make sense.SPOILER ALERT: It seems that the weapon sent to the Ori galaxy at the end of seson 10 worked, the Ori are all dead already but they've channeled all their power into Adriel. The Ark, that is supposed to have been missing for upteen thousands of years is rediculously easy to find and decipher. Let's not forget a gratuitous replicator subplot that seems to have been put in just to take up time.There's another bad guy that is just so textbook you could tell what he's going to do a mile off. I'm looking forward to the next movie as it's a \\"stand alone\\" plot but this one got shelved after the first viewing."},{"rating":"1","title":"The ARK a 90 minute mediocre episode!","review":"After a year of waiting, a very disappointing 90-minute episode entitled ARK OF TRUTH is released with a $20 price tag.I had expected the entire story to be devoted to the end of the Ori, but you will find only half the movie covering their final demise. The other half resurrects an old villian from Stargate's past. So what we end up with is a quick conclusion to the Ori storyline which ends exactly the same way as the Anubus storyline ended. The rest of the movie has battle scenes we've seen before in many past episodes as they fight the old villian from their past. And we also get a fight scene with Cameron against an unbeatable foe very similar to the Black Knight he fought in the Camelot episode. Rent it before buying!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not very good.","review":"This was pretty much like a normal bad SG1 episode from season 10. It is not loaded with special effects nor is the acting anything worth ranting about. The clip you see on Amazon with Tealc is about the best acting scene in the whole movie (Hence why its on Amazon).The overall story is completely rushed, you get the feeling that the producers where saying (We have 2 hours to wrap up the Ori story so Move it!) Overal I have seen many SG1 season enders that where better than this movie so that pretty much sums it up the quality.Ben Browder and Claudia once again just dominated the show with there prescence while once again giving lack luster performances that nobody will ever care about.

While all Stargate fans would have preferred an actual Season 11, at least we can now rest easy knowing how the Ori threat was ultimately handled.

It's somewhere between you and your CO (outside).2) You won't get garbled text or munged data from line noise on your phone line. The modem is error-correcting, and the data will be retransmitted. Line noise will cost you speed, not quality (as the manufacturer's review suggests).3) A reiteration of point (1): a line is only as good as its weakest link.

And honestly, I think that these people are too much set in their own thoughts before they read the book. It's true the book is not entirely scientifically backed. But I think they have the right idea in a lot of their philosophy. When we work hard, we wear our body out. When we eat more than we expend energy to account for, we overload our body. There's a lot in life that we don't understand yet. When lab rats are fed a lot less than they normally would eat, why is there a gene activated that allows them to live longer?

Medical limits for blood pressure and cholesterol, for example, are outdated and too high, and the recommendation to skip breakfast or dinner - well we had this before and I think it was well proven that this is not the best way to start or end your day. The authors may have had fun writing this book together, but there is no reason to be proud of it. While I agree that we could all benefit from doing less, with lots of really great books out there on how to slow your life down, and boost your health, this one is a complete waste of time and money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disappointing!","review":"This book reads like a textbook.

I suppose the concept might work with the 1.0X mag which would be thinner, lighter and more flexible?

I've owned the bag for 2 months and recently the buckle used to adjust the shoulder strap's length has broken. I should have seen it coming though since it didn't take more than a couple of weeks before the magnetic snap on the front flap fell off.

I got over that quickly and love the bag otherwise. I love the magnetic closure front pocket with pouches for a cell phone, keys, etc. I put EVERYTHING from my old purse and diaper bag into this one. Love that there are several sections of the bag for mama & baby. I like the back pocket (on the outside of the bag) that has a small dipaer changing pad in it too.

For example, how would it be possible for the heroine to return from the future to a point in time BEFORE she originally left, without encountering her previous self? If you are a sci fi fan, steer clear of this one. For that matter, steer clear if you're a romance fan. This book hopelessly mangles both the sci fi and romance formats.

Is the book still around? No, I just threw it in the stove where it will do more good as a heat source than as any kind of literature. The writing as another reviewer stated was extremely amateurish with extremely stilted dialogue. The characters were lifeless and the plotline was very shallow. Changes from one time to another were made haphazardly with little thought to decent transitions. Definitely pass this book up!"},{"rating":"1","title":"An interesting idea, but","review":"This is a nice book really in need of a good edit. Like a lot of the self-publihsed books nowadays, it is obvious there is talent out there which needs to be helped along by professionals. All of the flaws detract from the whole reading experience, but if you are interested in a fresh, lively voice, try it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Started well but died on the high seas.","review":"Being a fan of revolution era stories I looked high and low for this book. Unfortunately, it didn't live up to my expectations. It starts out with promise. A very bubbly young miss comes upon a man being hanged by a mob for treason......and saves him by claiming he's a friend of hers. They get away on her little sloop but they inadvertenly get captured by the English. Lord Hazard, an englishman, does all he can to procure her return to annapolis. But then that ship gets captured by an american ship. I read half of the book and they were still on a ship......no romance even insinuated about....and the male character very distanced from the reader. I decided I didn't much care if they ever got off the ship and abandoned it."},{"rating":"2","title":"My Love, My Enemy","review":"The story follows the coming of age of a young American girl during the war of 1812 as a prisoner of war caught between her family's patriotism and a growing love for an English enemy. I love the author's ability to inject a feeling of realism - the characters are believable and engaging and true to their time and situations."},{"rating":"2","title":"Crafted with care","review":"Read, for the umpteenth time along with all Jan Cox Speas novels...superb. The author takes you along with the heroin, her love, and her enemy on the journey of a new young country's stuggle to be free. Using a wit sharp with humor and warm with romance, she recreates what it must have been like to be a true patriot. Written with a mastery of the King's English, warmth and humor. Another not to be put down read. You will love her books. The only sad thing is that she did not live longer to write more. There are only a few. Do get all of them from Amazon and read them all. She wrote mystery and suspense along with romance into each carefully crafted book, leaving the reader to imagine things that most modern writers reveal in overly obvious detail. What you don't know is much more interesting and leaves you, the reader to take the path less traveled.

Well known alongside less known operas constitutes a perfect choice. From Verdi through Thomas, from Korngold to Britten and the Russian arias, mastering the variety of languages, and dealing with every single role in a very sensitive way. This unique choice and the qualities of his full, beautiful and warm voice makes one regret, that the entire opera was not recorded with him in the relevant roles, like Thomas's Hamlet for example, or Britten's Billy Budd. It leaves a taste of wanting to hear more of this young and talented Baritone, whose repertoire is much larger than could be presented in one - indeed excellent - CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Focuses on the 1960s","review":"A lucid, in-depth explanation of how the British Treasury functioned, in the post war years of 1946-70. Under both Tory and Labour administrations. Not a dry recitation of tables and numbers. Brittan describes the key issues of the times. Like the repeated devaluations when the pound was floated several times. He explains the oft-thought mysterious innards of how the Treasury collects taxes and then disburses these revenues to keep the government running.Most of the narrative is concerned with the 1960s. Relatively little space is devoted to the immediate post war period, when rationing was still enforced and the British began decolonising their empire, and demobilising their wartime forces. Even though all these would have had great impact on economic matters."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book if you're a Type \\"A\\"","review":"Engaging narrative and thoughts of a 36 year old corporate executive and family man who survived a heart attack caused by his lifestyle.

But there is a point where it is too much. I only watched the first two episodes. I got tired of watching wildly unbelievable events that occur for no apparent reason. I really miss the thoughtful plots of the older Doctor Who's. Amy Pond is great but she is the only part of Season 7 that I like."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dr. Who is Amazing!","review":"Dr. Who is one of those rare series' that has NEVER disappointed me! Made me feel tragic? Oh heck yes! And yet, the tragedy is a stunning and required component to the whole series. There is just SO much depth to this program. There are layers within layers and events that call back to other events and characters and switch them around and play with them and put them back with the wrong colors in the right numbers and it's all timey-wimey and cool and sad and EMOTIONS! And you think I'm babbling and being ridiculous but only because you haven't watched this yet!

I don't think it even told us anything important anyway."},{"rating":"2","title":"What is not to like","review":"Doctor Who + Dinosaurs on a spaceship = awesome.

This is the worst episode of all the seasons of Doctor Who! The creators seem to have thought of an idea and then remembered that the show is only 45 minutes, so it looks like they crammed a big (maybe good) idea into 45 minutes! A lot of the time I didnt get what was happening! There is a few new to the story characters, and it seems like we are supposed to know who they are. I mean what is that about?!? Anyway, I think it could have been better if they put a little more time into it."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointed","review":"I was disappointed with the series this time.

Extremely well written, it is a satisfying episode, albeit a tear-jerker for those of us who loved Rory and Amy. Far better HD quality that I expected to get via a 4G/LTE mobile wifi hotspot connection on my laptop.

The idea is to stream but who wants to watch a show with buffering? Just useless. And the downloading option requires that I download something else first.

THere's also another visit from RIver Song, and what I think was the closest relationship we've yet seen demonstrated between River and the Ponds.

He feels that rewards and punishments are conditional love and their use signifies that adults love children only when they behave in the way we want them to. Thinking like this is why you are not able to go into a restaurant without kids screaming and climbing around.Other ridiculous ideas include indirectly blaming the behavior of the victims of the WTC tragedies on 9/11 on the current school environment and that the Columbine shooting occurs because of the school system.

The nice smooth jacket prevents snags.I purchased each length in a different color so that I can tell how long each one is without uncoiling it.Don't buy this to make your internet connection faster, though. It is unlikely to do that for you given that the length (when compared to your entire telephone line in the wall out to the junction box) is short.

I am very frustrated and angry with SONY as they have not responded to my email inquiries. After finally reaching them by phone, I was told SONY repairs would cost approximately $280 with shipping. I don't think so! I feel very deceived. SONY is now \\"unplugged\\" in my house - for good.It is my understanding that there is a class action suit in progress and I am also notifying the Attorney General in New York.

We were given a Sony anolog camcorder as a gift about 4 years ago. We could not trade it in for a digital and so we decided that one day we would either get a video bridge or update to DV. Our hand was forced when our old camera died. Although I really wanted a miniDV camcorder I thought that it would be more practical to stay with a camera that used 8mm tapes. Well, this camera can use those tapes...but it can't play them back if they were recorded with an analog camcorder.

I called sony they told me that it needs service and they will charge US $216 for labor.This is totally unacceptable for a camcorder which is worth around $330.I just can't believe that a company like sony is charging 2/3 of the original price to fix an error which according to their own mannual can be fixed by users.

After very little use I found that the battery supplied with the camera lasts considerably less than one tape. So, I thought, \\"it's new, it's worth it\\" I bought 2 large batteries, for about $100/battery. The batteries are no longer the problem, after a little more time(less than 6 total hours recorded)the camera dings and flashes what I would only consider to be an error code. Online support was no help, and said send it in. Unfortunately once again, this is a \\"Flat Rate\\" fix, and on this camera it is $211, I don't know if I'm going to pay a flat rate to get it fixed, or play with a hammer and have $211 worth of therapy with it. 2 other family members own this camera, one has never been able to watch their videos and Sony said it is a software problem, but not their problem, and the other family member bought a different product less than 30 days of owning it."},{"rating":"1","title":"DON'T BUY THIS CAMERA OR ANY OTHER SONY!","review":"Similar to one of the other reviews I just read, my camera quit working after 1 year.

Sony has a 90 day warranty for labor, and a 1 year warranty for parts. I was told it would be $290 for parts and labor, but since I was still under warranty for parts, it would only be $233!

This camera was never abused and essentially I paid $400 to record about two or three tapes over the period of one year. What a rip off! This was the first time I bought a Sony in 40+ years and it will be the last. I had an RCA that lasted over 14 years, used extensively and never required service.

I have been very careful with this camera, never dropped it, wet it, or banged it. It was always carefully put away when not in use, so I know my treatment of this camera was not at fault, but now I have a useless piece of equipment and in order to repair it my only option is to send it to Sony for a minimum charge of $232.00 plus shipping. There is no authorized repair center in my area or even within a 150 miles of where I live and those repair centers that Sony listed will not touch this camera. If you do purchase this camera I recommend also purchasing an extended warranty.

It was a good camera while it lasted - exactly 13 months! The manufacturer's warranty is one year, and alas, I did NOT purchase an extended warranty. I took good care of it, and always stored it in a case. I used it rarely, to tape wrestling meets and other school events. I tried to use it the other day for the first time in a few months, and the LCD shows no picture - only horizontal lines.

Go elsewhere to save yourself a major disappointment (and more chilly nights!)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good for a season...","review":"I have purchased three Sunbeam Warming blankets over the last four to five years, and one thing is consistent...for the first year, it works like a charm. However, after the first year, the quality and consistency of heat begins to diminish exponentially.I really never paid attention to the number of blankets I was buying, as I just would buy a new one if it was not heating properly. This year, I noticed that I have three queen sized heating blankets (one on the bed and the other two in bags that I have never gotten around to dropping off at GoodWill). Then it hit me, every 18 months, I am spending $139 for a blanket. Someone has to have a better quality blanket.Next year, the blanket on my bed should begin to go out (as Sunbeam is SO consistant). So I will purchase another brand!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"We received a Sunbeam electric blanket as a gift and after one year it stopped working, we bought another one and I even bought the electric throw, one year later they both stopped working.Very disappointed in Sunbeam products after 3 products with the same problem of no longer working after a year, it is definitely a product problem.Do not buy this product!"},{"rating":"1","title":"not good at all....","review":"The first 2 albums \\"Zipless\\" and \\"Two to tango\\" are really good!..

All three albums were released in 1966, arguably the best year in modern recorded music.What I like most about S.R.O is that it brings back so many childhood memories. Everytime I hear the opening chords of \\"Blue Sunday\\", it's the summer of 67' again and I'm heading to the ice cream stand in the back of my parent's 1966 Vista Cruiser wagon, with S.R.O playing on the 8-track tape deck!

I'd read everything I could about the other musicians on the album covers, so I am just a bit disappointed that in his updated liner notes Herb Alpert gives almost no recognition to The TJB; in fact, at one point, he tries to pass them off as an ever-shifting lineup when almost every original cover shows the same recognizable faces...these guys deserve their due and it's sad that even now they're relegated to being faceless session players...Sorry, Herb, but what are these guys doing today?

This new and enhanced equipment allowed for Curly M.C. to add different sounds to his trademark style. Many of the songs feature a sample from the classic work \\"Carmina Burana (o Fortuna)\\" by Carl Orff. When you hear it, you'll recognize it. The new energy the music delivers combines for a passion in all of the songs. \\"Gravity of Love\\" has a line that says, \\"The path of excess leads to the tower of wisdom.\\" This is actually a quote featured in the cover sleeve of the MCMXC a.D.

I explained I really and truly needed CLEAR labels.

However, I have had the game for a few weeks now and I am unable to find any way to get the pictures to the size they need to be for the game. I have gone to numerous places, even emailed the company asking if they had any idea where to get the pictures made to the size of 1in. X 1 1/3in. And they didn't have any answer for me. So I have been so disappointed that I am unable to use the game if I can't figure out a way to make the pictures. There doesn't seem to be a way to crop the pictures on my computer either.

I mean so bad it distracts from what you are reading. the author has a biography saying she was a prolific romance writer, clearly they don't need people who can really write english properly. and pages and pages of preaching-bible quotes etc...the characters aren't even that likable so definitely does not make continuing to read the series worthwhile."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good mystery, too much religion","review":"This is a reasonably well written murder mystery. Some parts are unbelievable and not true to how life situations would really be handled. However, I got the feeling that the real purpose of the book is to convert people to the Christian religion. At first I thought maybe all the religious references were because the dead couple were ministers and you might expect that from their children. However, it is soon clear that most everyone in town, except maybe the killer, was reading the bible, spouting their views, etc. I have nothing against people having their own religious views, but this is not what I read a murder mystery for.

A few glitches, but not bad.The story itself seemed to be more about why God would let some things happen than what actually DID happen. As a murder story it didn't entirely hold together, which saddened me because I think she had a good idea and some good characters, but they got over shadowed with the heavy handed God stuff. Not being a religious person it grated really bad for me and I found I skimmed a lot of things. I managed to make it thru this book, but went ahead and deleted the second off my Kindle.

The book begins with the murder of a beloved couple on Cape Refuge. Their distraught daughters are determined to learn the truth about their parents' lives and brutal deaths. Intriguing! But then author looses focus and starts putting her characters in jail so she won't have to weave them into the plot. One of the protagonists spends the whole book behind bars, and he never even consults an attorney. Unbelieveable! A good portion of the story is devoted to the characters' relationship to God, which may please some readers, but in reality, it acts like a filler so the author can keep the readers busy, and hope that they won't notice the glaring lack of a substantive story.

What could have been a decent mystery is totally ruined by the insertion of religion in nearly every sentence. If Ms. Blackstock wants her books to reach a wider audience then she needs to tone it down a lot.

This is a question that was asked, but not fully answered in this mystery novel by Terri Blackstock. It is an unanswerable question, really.I did enjoy this novel. It was quick to read, and parts were extremely suspenseful. However, the police officer, Cade, although likable seemed to be a bit slow on the uptake. I came to the conclusion that it would be extremely easy for anyone to be framed for commiting any kind of a crime in his town because he didn't seem to look far below the surface.The book reminded me of a \\"Jessica Fletcher\\" kind of mystery with similar kinds of characters among the suspects and police officers. It had a Christian/spiritual aspect that was quite interesting, particularly when you saw how one character's prayers when things seemed hopeless seemed to turn the tide.I'd like to read the remaining books in this series."},{"rating":"2","title":"Riveting, High-quality story telling!!","review":"This is the first Terri Blackstock novel I have ever read. I noticed one previous reviewer giving negative remarks because of the presence of religion in the book. (...)

At first we thought the original battery was bad, but we already used several of them and they all run dead after a couple of months (without actually being used to find the keys). Needless to say, if you're the kind of person who looses your keys, you won't be remembering to periodically replace the batteries until it is too late, pretty much rendering this device useless.Pros: works for a couple of times.Cons: never works when you actually need it, as batteries run out after a couple of months (even without use).Bottom line: don't rely on this product to find anything."},{"rating":"1","title":"Surprisingly Poor","review":"1 star = Not usable.The \\"beep\\" from the tag is very low.

I ordered the product and though it works, it is only 70% of the time and one has to be directly within inches from the item a tag is attatched to. The beep is so very faint, if you have any hearing abilities...DON'T GET ITEM. It comes with a really cool magnet holder that sits on the fridge so that you know where the remote is at all times.

At first I was eager, since it listed all the features I was looking for in a phone. But as soon as I put my hands on it, I was disappointed at the level of performance. Picture quality was awful, I couldn't use the music player or connect the phone to my computer, and too slow. I took it to T-Mobile, they tweeked it a bit, but problems kept on coming back. My computer and laptop are both Mac, and for some odd reason it refused to connect. Some pros were: Battery life was good, Office applications were bonus, though since it was not connecting to my computer I didn't see the point of trying to use it if I can't transfer it. E-mail service was good, and you can add 3-4 email addresses and works well. Still after paying $375 for this phone I was less than impressed, so I returned it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome","review":"Best purchase, got tired of carrying the palm pilot and phone and love the capabilities it has, its limitless.

In the span of those three months, my t-mobile wing has become completely unusable.At this point, if I had to call 911, it would probably take me about 5 minutes of either waiting for the phone to actually go to the phone application, or 10 minutes if I got impatient after waiting two minutes and decided to turn the phone on and off in hopes that the phone will somehow decide to work.This is coming from a techno geek who thought it would be cool to have the latest and best phone. I even read the manual, and have never dropped it once.Did you ever wonder if one day technology would go too far and make a phone that was too complex, to the point of being unusable?This is that phone. Never again will I buy a smartphone, I'll just stick to the 19.99 ones, because after this all I care about is having a phone that works."},{"rating":"1","title":"Under-powered","review":"I have been using the T-Mobile Wing for about a week now and it is a disappointment. With only a 200mhz processor and 64 mb RAM, it often runs out of available memory and applications hang. If you are looking for the full functionality of a PDA, then this falls short of it's potential.My previous PDA was an Ipaq 4155 running Windows Mobile 2002, and needless to say, that PDA was faster than this device."},{"rating":"1","title":"Far cry from the MDA","review":"I was happy with the MDA and thought this would have been an improvement on the old product. Not so. The OS is completly unstable and is constantly locks up when syncing or recieving a call. Hopefully a firmware update will be out soon to fix this. The buttons are overly sensitive and I am constantly hanging up on people or calling people inadvertantly. The grip tight coating makes it easier to hold onto, but is impossible to retreive out of your pocket if the phone is ringing. I do like the PAN capability which allows you share your EDGE internet with other BT enabled devices. It actually is quite handy. Other than that this is a dissapointment indeed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Garbage Phone","review":"This is the worst phone that I have ever had. The phone has some really cool features, but the overall usage of those features makes this phone totally garbage. T-Mobile should be ashamed of themselves for even continuing to sell this phone. It freezes up like a computer. Sometimes the touch screen feature on the phone works, but most of the time it doesn't. God forbid you want to power the phone off, you have to hold the button for an extended period of time. And then on top of that, you lose recent text messages and other information. Forget about answering an incoming call. The phone rings, however you aren't able to answer it. And you can't even see who's calling. If I knew about this phone beforehand, I would have never purchased it. My advice to anyone looking to purchase a new cell phone, visit various sites to see what the customer reviews are. They are the best indicators as to whether a phone will work for you or not."},{"rating":"1","title":"Is this thing actually supposed to be new?","review":"Imagine that, T-Mobile will do a free phone for new service that they discontenued months prior.

It called people randomly all the time. The screen stopped working after a year only. At $300 I would think I'd get more out of it. I was carried away by the hype when I purchased this phone, but I will never buy this phone again. The internet processor is very slow so if you're getting lost, you'll get more lost before you can get the right directions. Anyway, I called about possibly getting it replaced but was told I had no insurance, which wasn't even offered to me at the time I purchased. I was told there was no insurance I could buy for this phone. Insurance won't help anyway because I was told I would have to pay about $150 to get a replacement phone! Such a waste of money! I'd rather buy a new Nokia!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great phone, best deal in 2007.","review":"The only thing I didn't like about this phone was it's 201 MHZ chip other than that it's 5 stars, for today's PDA technology. *****Pro's:Silding keyboardslimer then other pda'sBattery life is O.KLots of features, more than meets the eye.Lots of camera features.Con's:I bit hard to set up Windows live.Wi-fi is not the best, but Edge-tech is better on this phone.Camera Quality could be better201 MHZ chip, could be higher but it's o.K.A little slow on video playback."},{"rating":"1","title":"cool phone/ horrible service provider","review":"the phone is great for quick texting with friends, reading e-mails, passive web searches, and reviewing documents. you may find out, if you're wanting web speed, this is not the phone for you.Combined with T-Mobile's horrible customer service and the inability to troubleshoot after being on the phone for 2 hrs. In addition if your phone ever becomes defective do not expect to got into a T-Mobile store for a replacement like you can with other carriers. You May instead expect to not have a phone for 3 business days (no they will not ship on Saturdays), pay a $15 shipping fee in additiion to the $5-$7 you each month for insurance and of course to replace your phone you will need to pay $50-$150 (depending on the \\"type\\" of device) if They find that it is damaged vs. defective.but dont worry you can dispute the false \\"damage\\" charge with your cc company so that they have to prove the \\"damage\\" and voila! 30 days later you get your $50-$150 back."},{"rating":"1","title":"I hate this phone, it suckes.","review":"I got this phone last summer, and i thought i made smart decision, but i was wrong.I really hate this phone... mostly because its really slow.And i hate the touch screen.... like when i am talking with someone,this phone calls some other people too bcz my cheek push the screen...and, it does not react soon, when i open the slide,it takes forever to show the appropriate window.anyways, there are so many reasons why i hate it.I would rather choose really basic cell phone than this.Good Luck"},{"rating":"1","title":"does not work at all, total piece of junk.","review":"Blade is not straight and it cuts a spiral down the wire. cheap chinese crap.

Next thing to go bad was the right ear cable. A few pulls from being caught under my chair wheels and now I have the cord taped in a vertical direction onto the back of the ear cup in order to connect the internal wires.

There is no concern whatsoever for the so-called food provided by the cattle and chickens which are first loaded with chemicals detrimental to them as well as to us, and then literally sacrificed for the fast food industry.

That begs the question - is it worth $40+ for a used copy or $100+ for a new copy?The answer is a resounding YES! I have Harbeth speakers, Creek amp, Cayin tube SACD/CD player and Audioquest interconnects - not a bad system. And this album sounds absolutely stunning on it. I A/B'd this against the old CD version I have and the difference is night and day. This edition sets a wider and much deeper soundstage, has crystal clear sound, and makes you feel as though Johnny were performing right in front of you.

Why? Because it has a nice snug fit on both sides. This makes it much more stable in the Euro/Schuko socket unlike the flat 2-prong ones that in my experience tend to have a loose connection or even fall out of the socket - esp. if yours is a heavy cable or if it has one of those AD/DC converters at the plug end pulling down on the adapter. Plus, this adapter has a nice lip which makes it easier to pull out of the socket. Good quality for the price. I paid mine $2.50/piece shipped -- make sure you don't overpay as there are many merchants selling at very different prices, some as high as $10/piece with shipping included.Lastly, keep in mind, the schuko socket fits most European countries but not all - most notably UK, and Italy which have their own plugs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not compatible in Italy","review":"I wasn't able to use this power adapter while on my trip to Italy.

There is a 3 speed gearbox, and a drill to driver switch that locks out the clutch, allowing you to save your desired clutch setting but turn it off for drilling operations. tne case is large enough for the drill and my impact driver and the NIMH batteries really do have better run time than any Ni cad.

I received this drill second-hand as a gift, and I'd be pretty lost without it.So my review's for the ladies like me... even if you've never picked up a drill in your life, this one's easy to use, hard to screw up, and very reliable.

I purchased this specifically to get the heavier wire for my high current application, and the difference in voltage drop between 20 AWG and 24 AWG is a factor of 2.5, which at 500mA of current means the total voltage drop will be 150mV instead of 60mV. This is a misrepresentation by the seller, pure and simple. Belkin, L-com and perhaps others have cables with the heavier wires if that is important to you. For most applications it will probably work fine."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for the price.","review":"Would highly recommend for the price, saved me some money, other stores in my area wanted 15-20 for a printer cord.

Menzies visited 120 countries and over 900 museums and libraries in the course of his research, and has assembled a surprisingly persuasive account that suggests how China's foothold in the American continents could have been established, then lost due to the turmoil following the Emperor's fall.

The DNA sequeances the two groups share show common ancestors more like 12,000 years ago (or 600 generations ago).

Along with that comes a question: would Columbus have told Queen Isabella that the Chinese really discovered America? I do not think so. It is prefectly logical that these voyages were kept secret by not only the Chinese (due to radical shifts in China) but by explorers who wanted to take all the credit. Academics are quick to criticize Menzies, mainly since he departs from their own developed theories. Dismissing this book out of hand is reckless and short sighted. One other key factor is Menzies' intimate knowledge of the seas (winds, currents, etc.), which most land-locked academics lack.

It takes a true historical set of events, well-documented in and of themselves, and then extends it into fantasy using 'sources' that have been found, if you do your investigation like a number of academics have, to be either complete misinterpretations or unsubstantiating evidence.Mr. Menzies is not a serious historian.

Unfortunately for his analysis, the Chinese used that character to also mean \\"a lot\\". Proof of this can be found in money from the era which included a gold figurine no larger than a redskin potato labeled \\"10,000 ounces\\".If he cannot bother to get a basic translation correct (as opposed to relying on transliteration) without bothering to question why China would have ships and fleets way out of proportion to what one would expect, what does it say about the rest of his analysis?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Interesting but unconvincing","review":"Having read Charles Hapgood's \\"Maps of the Ancient Sea Kings,\\" I was fully prepared to accept Menzies' thesis that the Chinese discovered America in 1421.

Thepublishers know their target markets, I guess. At firstglance, it looked to be a semi-serious popular historyof the last voyages of the great Chinese exploration fleets,a topic which interests me, so I bought it. What adisappointment! The author mutilates logic, history, biology,and linguistics to support his notions of what the Chinesemight have done. The Chinese navigators probably did dosome of the less ludicrous things that Menzies suggests.But the intellectually dishonest style of the book actuallymakes me *less* inclined to believe it. I would recommendthis book only to real fans of pseudo-science, who willfind many hours of amusement playing spot-the-fallacy inthe 600-odd pages. You have been warned."},{"rating":"1","title":"interesting at times but logic is weak","review":"Overall I did not like this book. The premise is interesting, and there may be some truth in some of the points made in the book, but I was dissappointed with the weak reasoning, and the exaggerated tone of the book.

I will avoid this author in the future."},{"rating":"2","title":"new look at history","review":"1421 is one of the best written histories I have ever read.

The books own \\"facts\\" don't even hold together and are contradictory. According to an account on NPR, at least one of the maps has been revealed to be a fraud created expressly for the book and another is believed to have been created more that 100 years after the author suggests not but Chinese but by Jesuits and later doctored to add Chinese characters and eliminate the original Western language and references."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Fine Work of Fiction","review":"Yet another one of those books that had all the markings of something I would rather use as an assault missile from my deck when the neighboring children get too loud as I'm trying to read.I wish I could give this a great review. Had Sir Menzies filed his work in the fiction section where it belongs, I may have. But unfortunately, a history this is not. I don't need to give you specifics as they are too plentiful everywhere else.All I can say is that I really enjoyed the book for many reasons. Among them I now know that literary talent is judged not only by its product but also by its categorization."},{"rating":"1","title":"Written in a vacuum","review":"This book is written in a vacuum. For Menzies to make his thesis persuasive, he has to first of all engage consensus understandings of the historical past he's trying to revise. By not acknowledging longstanding and well-established views that challenge his outlook, Menzies can present his \\"findings\\" as if he were the first person ever to take an interest in the maps and other artifacts he uses to build his argument. The book is like a detective story with Menzies as the intrepid investigator, fully oblivious, it seems, that many others--and some much better qualified--have studied the evidence in question and given it a very different interpretation. But I doubt he wishes to persuade real scholars--that would be much too ambitious a task."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'd be rich, had I written it....","review":"I am Chinese, and believe it or not, I think that this book is ridiculous. Yes, of course, it's 'neat', this idea that the great America was discovered by someone from China...but let's be real. I want foreigners to respect and take my country and culture seriously. Making up a fairy tale such as this one is not the way to achieve this.Having read the book, I will admit that the author spins a good yarn; he's very convincing.

As a History major and one interested in things of this sort, I believe I can provide a good review. This book is absolutely absurd. He makes his claims based on speculations, false evidence, and speculates some more. He uses a fake map to present his claims, he talks of statues erected in Africa (not America), and he says he knows about these things because he was a military sub person. WHAT?! All in all, I would say stay away from this book. Don't waste your time. If you are interested in nonwestern or Asian exploration and discovery, there are plenty of scholarly works out there: When China Ruled the Seas: The Treasure Fleet of the Dragon Throne 1405-1433 by Levathes,The Making of the Chinese State: Ethnicity and Expansion on the Ming Borderlands by Leo Shin, and The Eunuchs in the Ming Dynasty by Henry Shih-shan Tsai to name a few.

Therefore, I knew outright that the fellow writing this book was obviously all wrong about Europe being gun-free in the first few decades of the 1400's. And during the 1420's there was a truly-fine Muslim civilaztion in Spain as well as Byzantium's accomplishments (which also included amazing architecture and a strong, literate government with many different bureaus more than a match for China's government at the same time). Europe was often an actually outstanding and advanced place to live in the ealy 1400's contrary to all the author tries to make us believe otherwise. Why this man wrongly wants us to believe China was such a better place shows how either badly informed or sneaky or deranged he is (or all three)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Misinformative about Europe in the early 15th century","review":"Menzies makes several foolish claims, like that Europe was so technologically far behind China in 1421. For your info Menzies, the Byzantines of Europe had Greek Fire, a weapon that could enable flames to travel on water. It was this instrument that kept Muslims from invading Europe for centuries and it was far superior to anything the Chinese ever invented. Menzies also claims that the European armies of 1421 had no guns. Couldn't be further from the truth on this one. By 1390 Europeans from one end of Europe to the other were getting outfitted not only with guns but canons too. And Europe was already flatout in the Renaissance in 1421, they weren't on the eve of it as Menzies ridiculously claims."},{"rating":"1","title":"Is Menzies ill-informed or just a rotten liar?","review":"Where on earth does this guy get this messed up info on Henry V of England?It is totally disprovable Menzies's really dumb assertion that Henry V did not have guns in his army in 1421.

And I think this software isn't useful at all beyond the textbook. This textbook is not well-organized logically, and it doesn't state well the reasons of some methods and algorithms and how they come, and it has some concluson that are built upon nothing. Besides, it takes a lot of time and efforts to sort through the many useless words, sometime you just feel that the authors are just trying to increase the volume. There are some good methods, but the textbook state it in a way that after some time, you won't even think of what they are about.

However they do mount securely and perform as expected.Two things to note, the conversion kit does not come with any instructions so you have to figure out how to actually mount it. Hint: the \\"D-shaped\\" button at the base of the camera lens releases a small ring at the top of the camera lens by a small turn of the ring. This is where the adapter mounts.The other item is that at full wide zoom, the corners of a picture may be obscured when using a filter with the hood in place.

Unlike many books written on specialized areas of photography that are difficult to comprehend, this book is easy to understand and does not confuse the reader with highly technical information. Instead, The Art of Infrared Photography sets forth in a clear, concise, detailed text, exactly how to adapt this wonderful film to your individual style of shooting. The author guides you step by step with true understanding of the medium, as if you were taking a photo course given by an inspired instructor. The added bonus of a breathtaking portfolio of images by the author will motivate anyone to grab their camera, load up with infrared film and rush out to create a new world of high contrast, dream-like images. Without a doubt the best book on infrared photography on the market."},{"rating":"2","title":"EXCELLENT BOOK ON INFRARED","review":"This book has now become my primer on infrared photography. What a well written and photographed book. Mr. Paduano's book has been in print now for 20 years and it is easy to see why.He truly is a master of this medium.The text is well written, thorough and easy to follow.Detailed text and images are contained in this edition. Covers black and white as well as color infrared. Chapters on filters,exposure and printing take the guess work out of this mysterious film.

This is not the case with The Art of Infrared Photography . It starts at the basics and works its way masterfully into the technical.

I won't put any more effort into writing this review than the author spent on the book itself. So this is going to be short and sweet! This book is a glorified magazine. Worth $14.95 - tops. The pitfalls of bookbuying online, I guess. You never know what you are going to get. Anyways, most the book comprises photographs that actually discourage me from bothering with infrared. The text portion, however brief, is nothing more than a bland introduction to infrared. The uninitiated might even be led to believe that Kodak and Konica are the only game in town in infrared films. Throughout the book the author treats these two as the \\"Coke and Pepsi\\" of infrared films.

And the wish- which one must assume was for a sibling?The art was so busy, it was hard to see that the beetle-orphan was cowering under a leaf with a snowman. There were big gaps in the plot which I guess was necessary in order to allow for a rhyme scheme. I imagine that it would be hard for a child to piece it all together on her own.That said, I'm sure it would work well in the context of the series, but it does not stand alone as a story.It's a rather vague poem with spazzy computer art."},{"rating":"2","title":"Too cute!","review":"I love this spider.

But the rest?","review":"Mention the word \\"Sabrina\\" to the average listener in the United States, and most likely you'll get a blank stare followed by a \\"who?\\" But in Europe, she's an Italian performer whose sex appeal and body curves helped her achieve a string of modest dance pop hits in the late 1980s. \\"Boys\\" compiles those singles with a few remixes. The obvious higlights are the title track and \\"All of Me,\\" which is three-and-a-half minutes of dance pop bliss by writers/producers Stock Aitken Waterman. Elsewhere, though, the CD falls apart--and fast. The production on many of the remaining tracks is embarrassingly dated, which wouldn't matter if Sabrina could actually sing (she can't). Stock Aitken Waterman fans will want to pick up \\"Boys\\" for \\"All of Me,\\" but there's not much else to recommend to casual listeners."},{"rating":"1","title":"The definition of conformist!!!!!","review":"First of all id like to say that i myself believe in jesus etc. but this anti-conformist blanter is exactly what defines comformity today.

No one escape conformity, evryone is conformed to something. Don't project some false imagery of being some who wants to turn the fictional tide and speak out against \\"conformity\\".

Loosely based on Merlin's experience in a \`vaguely similar enterprise' the book tells the tale of young actor Kurt Mitchell, who mortgages his future for the chance to work alongside a number of Hollywood legends. Too late Mitchell discovers just how painful (in more ways than one) that experience will be.Surrounded by the celebrity elite, our hero finds solace in his surroundings (beautifully articulated by Merlin) and a handful of noble working-class chums. But like the spoiled children they are, the film's \`stars' continually demand center stage and in doing show shine a spotlight on their pathetic and immoral behavior.At times amusing, at other times disturbing, Montezuma is always interesting.

She walks, heel toe, heel toe, up and down the hall feeling the funny, glip-glop. This curious little girl wants more then to see what sounds they make and what they look like, but what they would do if thrown down the trash. Out to play, to eat, and games with her new boots, Hannah experiences the creativity she can have with her new red boots.I think it is just a story that was made to amuse children, not to really teach them a lesson. It's cute and playful, with many emotions included."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rave","review":"Out of the 5 of his albums I have, this is the one I keep coming back to and the one I'd recommend to listeners who want an initiation into his world.

This volume steers clear of the longer, more improvisational pieces found on volume two, and focuses on, as the title suggests, songs. He continues to develop his own voice while incorporating the styles of Bill Evans and Wynton Kelly into his work. At times classical influences dominate the music, but as on his past work, it is tasteful and refreshing. Again giving impressive suppport are bassist, Grenadier and drummer, Rossy. His choice of covers gives an idea of his range of influences, from new rock gods, Radiohead to Rodgers & Hart to British folk troubadour Nick Drake. All in all another fine recording for Mehldau and his trio."},{"rating":"2","title":"exit music","review":"By far the best moment of this record is brad's version on radiohead's \\"exit music\\".....but this is NOT an one piece album.

The sound is incredibly clear and I really enjoyed the drum riffs. I continously had the idea that this was a soundtrack. There are so many images.

I'm having second thoughts since I've heard Mehldau's) and some original pearls such as Song-Song.Of the four \\"Art of the trio\\" albums this is definitely my favorite.I would recommend it to any Jazz fan.

As other reviews have said, it's introspective and quite emotional. However, lest it seem that this CD is bluntly maudlin, it should be pointed out that each note shimmers with emotion as opposed to dripping with emotion.

Since I had already read the first Cape Refuge book and liked it, I thought this one would also go lightly on the Christian aspect. However, I was VERY wrong! There was way too much emphasis put on God, praying, etc. and not enough emphasis on the story line itself. I skipped over many paragraphs and even pages at a time just to bypass all the unneccesary parts in order to get at the actual story. I gave the book 2 stars simply because the basic story line/concept was good...all the rest, I could do without."},{"rating":"1","title":"Southern Srorm","review":"One of the worst books I've ever bought.If you are looking for christian values read the bible."},{"rating":"2","title":"Inward Morning is fantastic","review":"After years of studying philosophy, this book stands out as my favorite. Bugbee writes in a journal format. As a result, readers see the development of his ideas. Unlike much philosophy, we get to see the person behind the words.

When she comes to that discovery three quarters of the way into this book, I started to wonder if I had accidently grabbed the wrong book to finish reading. The guy is an idiot about women (juggling wife/mistress), child rearing (his daughter), business (his mills), character judgement (his foreman), human rights (child slave labor) etc. etc. etc. Charlotte, too, is quite poor spirited although that could be explained by realism --- but who wants a lot of that in a regency romance?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great story","review":"What an amazing group of people and an amazing band, with an amazing singer gone too soon.

When Mia was killed I was devastated, and if it had been exploitative it would have put me off. Luckily it was handled beautifully, with the movie being more than half exclusively about the band and how they were part of the burgeoning punk scene in Seattle. I particularly loved the interviews with Joe Spleen, who is just an amazing and under-rated musician. Also the obscene amount of live footage they dug up is incredible! A well crafted, moving roc-doc, and a film that I believe would be enjoyed by nearly anyone, Gits fan or not. A definite must see."},{"rating":"1","title":"A disappointing and patchy account which omits too much","review":"Although describing itself as a noble attempt to produce a concise and compelling account of Britain's history in one volume, this book lands wide of its mark. It reads like it was written in a hurry. It begins with a stodgy account of English history through the lives of its kings and queens up to William IV. Thereafter it consists of a series of poorly written essays on various aspects of modern British history. The account of the First World War is dreadful. Its saving grace is the quality and choice of illustrations"},{"rating":"1","title":"A poor story of Britain","review":"Yet again we have a book that confuses England with Britain, with virtually no reference to pre-1707 Wales, and a token reference to Scottish history.This is a pity as Roy Strong writes well and of course there can be no doubt that the history of English Kings and Queens is a glorious one.For a more honest account of the history of this fascinating island, read the Oxford History of Britain."},{"rating":"1","title":"not good service.","review":"ordered it three weeks ago, at least, still have not received it. don't even want it now.Regardsdennis"},{"rating":"1","title":"UNREALISTIC","review":"This book is full of exaggerations about Turkey.

If you read this book, the REAL Turkey (as it actually exists) will be a pleasant surprize to you. So read it and go there and have a real shock!

The humor is both crude, surreal, deeply sarcastic, slapstic and dry all at the same time. There is incredible satire here, but in an innocent way which seems to acknowledge reality without having a harshly critical attitude towards anyone. You can't come away from watching Father Ted without somehow having sympathy for the foolishness and innocence of it's characters. Ultimately, it is a gentle mockery of the irish church for the stereotypes that everyone knows are largely true.

Outrageously Funny!!!!!","review":"Father Ted has to be one of the most brilliant British comedies ever. It's up there with Black Adder and Fawlty Towers in the madness and the sometimes very twisted story lines. These comedies paved the road for future generations of truly twisted American shows such as American Dad and Family Guy. Sadly the show ended too soon but the memory lives on by giving us hours of laughter."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fecking brilliant!","review":"The series explores the antics of a trio of priests and their loyal if insane housekeeper stranded on Craggy Island (just of the coast of Ireland, \\"where they dump the old glow in the dark\\"). When I first saw the trailers for it I thought it would not be that funny, but a friend convinced me to watch an episode. The blend of the surreal story-lines and tight scripts make it a comic masterwork.

They only sent half the number of boxes as advertised, then got nasty when I asked for the rest. First, they denied their own ad said what it said, then they insulted me when I sent them a link to their own ad. Finally, they told me \\"just too bad\\" as they had meant only to say 12 boxes instead of 24, and they told me they would neither refund some of my money or send the number of boxes advertised.However, Amazon then got involved and gave me my money back. Thank you Amazon.Anyway, this is still the king of pudding, just be careful of who you buy from."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wrist Blood Presssure Machine Oregon Scientific Monitor","review":"I loved the large digital print but was unhappy it was not calibrated correctly.

Don't waste your money."},{"rating":"2","title":"The high aesthetic","review":"This is a beautiful CD that perfectly mirrors the artifice and surface beauty of the Victorian age in which Oscar Wilde lived. Yet underneath, there is a current of secretive discord. This album portrays the double-standard of life with majestically orchestrated string pieces and desolate solo pieces arranged for piano and oboe.The main themes running throughout (the Constance/home life, the Bosie \\"Ah, Leave Me Not To Pine\\", the desolation/trial theme) all return intermixed with each other, creating a fantastic panorama of sound.Why four stars? Ms. Wiseman's work is wonderful, yet towards the end becomes a bit repetitive. However, for any fan of the movie \\"Wilde,\\" this soundtrack is a must have!"},{"rating":"2","title":"John Williams calls this \\"one of the finest ever written\\"","review":"It is no exaggeration to suggest that some of the tracks on this soundtrack are among the best ever created for the screen. Debbie Wiseman's other sountrack music is more or less memorable, but she really outdid herself with this one. Clearly very inspired. The pathos in some of these harmony themes is absolutely soul-shaking.David Rehakauthor of \\"A Young Girl's Crimes\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Drive OK, but USB connector too short","review":"Nothing wrong with the speed or durability of this drive. Amazing size considering it's capacity.But one fatal flaw is that the metal USB connector is too short. This is because there's a non-removable plastic collar on the base of the connector that prevents you from inserting the drive fully into many USB slots.I bought one for my business's Helpdesk and we've tried it on several Dell PCs and laptops and it only works in 'some' rear panel USB slots. This is because many slots on laptops and the front of PCs are recessed and the Kanguru simply won't seat fully. Kanguru needs to fix this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money","review":"Ethernet (and the tcpip protocal) is designed to handle poor signal quality.CAT 5 cable uses a TX and RX line twisted around individual grounds!!

I bought several in different lengths and colors, so I can tell how long it is by the color."},{"rating":"1","title":"Love the watch, hate how it falls apart","review":"I love the looks of this watch -- sporty, but not as bulky as most running watches. I wear it all the time. However. . . this is the 4th one I have bought. I like it so much I keep hoping I'll get one that lasts. Two of them have had the \\"stop\\" and \\"start\\" buttons fall off and one of them had the band disattach itself. I have not mistreated my watches. There seems to be an inherent flaw.

Your price is great -- hope I get my money's worth out of this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent...","review":"A wonderful sequel to a great movie. Amazing fight scenes. Several of our favorite characters return. I'm not sure if someone who hasn't seen the previous movie will enjoy it as much as someone who is already familiar with the universe would. Definitely a must have for cyberpunk anime fans out there."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great intructional video","review":"Whether you are beginning or not, this video will help give you a fresh and more informed approach at doing a drum solo. Drum beats are explained and moves for each are taught. A manageable and interesting choreographed part lets you put it all together. Nice pace, not too fast for beginners and it doesn't get boring for advanced dancers, and the lessons are short and digestible. The Bonus music cd is awesome...all of the tracks on it are great. Cute bonus feature of Sonia and Issam in Cairo. A must have for your Bellydance intructional collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"Combinations for specific rhythms!","review":"Sometimes rhythm identification can be tricky because it seems like many of the rhythms most used in bellydance have a plethora of names for the same thing. This was a good dvd to teach one how to gain the confidence to improvise.I like how she was able to give a combination to try for each of the rhythms she presented. After trying this dvd I was able to turn on some arabic music and identify some of the beats, the combinations she taught were easy to apply and remember when I heard the familair beats and having those combinations to start with gave me more confidence to be able to hear for those rhythms and begin to create my own combinations.Another good drum solo dvd is 'the heartbeat of bellydance' with Jenna. She presents a different set of rhythms and gives you 3 levels of choreography to full songs with some tips on how to improvise. These dvds are great together because they contain different sets of rhythms and you can expand your dance vocabulary."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why Is She The Princess of Drum Solos?","review":"She has no rhythm. Watch her when she's doing simple 4/4 movements. She doesn't hit the beat. All her drum solos are canned and have probably been spoon fed to her, as she does the same thing every time. This is the routine she calls an \\"improvisation\\" at every show.I give this DVD two stars because I learned one combination from her, and learned two moves by watching her take lessons from the real stars for thirty seconds. Incidentally, the music they chose for the Cairo sequence sounds Turkish to me...but I wouldn't commit myself either way. This DVD is worth renting or borrowing if you can get your hands on it, but until they start selling them used for four dollars, go buy something else."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bellydance - The Art of the Drum Solo","review":"très bien,mais j'aurai voulu voir plus de démonstration de la part du derboukiste,tant pis ce sera pour une autre fois je l'espère.à bientt."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ok, not as good as some, but could be better","review":"Drum solos to me are terrifying as there is so much to them, and the horror of repeating a step too many times or starting out too strong and having no where to go encouraged me to try a video. It doesn't explain things as well as I would like, but its better than some (cough*Rania* what on earth is she doing?!!) The extra clips are fun as well!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Muy bueno!","review":"Es un video al que se le puede sacar mucho provecho. No solamente te provee los pasos para bailar al ritmo de la percusion, sino que te explica los diferentes ritmos. Tambien se incluye un cd con musica de tabla solo para practicar por tu cuenta. Es un buen video aunque recomiendo mucho mas otro que se llama \\"The Heartbeat of Bellydance\\". Si usted es como yo, los querra los dos. Si debe escoger solo uno... yo voy por el otro."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Drummer * Mediocre Dancer","review":"Great drummer and useful info about Arabic rhythms, but Sonia is a very medicore dancer.I was surprised, then not surprised that Sonia was chosen for this teaching DVD as it appears she is Miles Copeland's favorite dancer. She is gorgeous, but by far the least talented of all the Belly Dance Superstars.Was she chosen for her beauty?Was her fee less than the other dancers would charge for making this DVD?This might be a good teaching tape for beginners though and the CD music included is a nice bonus."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best!","review":"This DVD is what all bellydance DVDs should be: you learn not just the basic movements, but also to which rhythm you should dance the movements to. The setting looks exotic (I think they filmed in Egypt), and at the end of the video you really have a greater understanding of the dance and the music, plus all that you have learned was building up to the finale choreography! I looked and looked and can't find anything better.Each segment starts with Issam introducing a rhythm, and he shows you the rhythm on his tabla. Then Sonia shows what you can do with the rhythm. She starts slow, do a number of reps, then Issam joins in and drum while you do the movement at tempo.I wish other kinds of dance videos are structured like this!"},{"rating":"2","title":"good for beginners","review":"Sonia is a good teacher and explains the moves/steps well for beginners. The downside is that the dvd isn't broke down into chapters and you can't just work on the choreography once you have the technique down. Otherwise I would have given it 5 stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"deal breaker","review":"not only did the tone of this book totally turn me off, but - let's be honest - if i want to read a book, i will buy one. i have heard there are millions of them; some quite good even. but when i buy a comic book, i would like words associated with pictures - not just words for many, many pages. stopped reading cerebus after this one - which is a shame, as i liked it a lot up to here."},{"rating":"1","title":"Weak because so much is not comics","review":"The weaknes of this book (and sections of Ricks Story) is not its controversial content but the fact that Sim basically rejects the comics format (which he does well) for page after page of dense badly written (though not as bad as the section in Ricks Story)prose with a single illo per page.

It continues with other songs and goes back and forth between musicians and dancers. You cannot select tracks! All the music is on track 1 and it just continues. If you select track 2 or 3 it is the screen colorful visuals but they only play for about 1 minute.This would have been much better if you had a menu to select each track or screen visual. The music isnt that good either. Track one is about a UFO. This disc is just ok.

They also have different personalties and true ove for each other.

Once you start to think you know the outcome of a situation you end up for a big surprise. I would recommend this book to a person that loves to laugh and loves a good novel."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Reading!!","review":"This book was based on 4 men and what they go through in life as they mature and find love down the road. It was very interesting seeing all the road blocks that were put up and what the men did to get out of the situation. The book has a nice ending and Maurice definitely gets what he deserves at the end. I would have liked to know what happened when Maurice found out the situation he put himself into at the end. This book is a definite page turner."},{"rating":"1","title":"A waste of your time and money","review":"I recently purchased Mr. Weber's book at a local bookstore because of a wonderful review that I found about it. As I began reading the book, it seemed promising. However, the more and more I read it, the more let down I was. I didn't expect the book to be great, but I thought that it would at least be believable. I felt more like I was watching a bad Jerry Springer rerun than reading a book. I found the book very to be very stereotypical in its portrayal of young black males. I may just be a young college student and by no means a literary critic, but I believe that there are much better black authors out there."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Good Book","review":"This was an awesome book.

But it was so soft and so predictable it was like an episode of The Jerry Springer show."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yeah...In ALL The Wrong Places","review":"The book had its good points. However, the character that proved to be the most interesting was the one who was most warped. It had some interesting plot twists, but all in all was incredibly predictable.

A must read!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"In ALL the Wrong Places..","review":"This book was very interesting. I was lead to beleive that it was a comedy and was kind of disappointed because it wasn't all that funny to me. Of course some parts were hilarious, but I felt the content of this book somewhat hard to beleive. I dont want to give away the story, but how can everybody go on blind dates, and nobody ends up with an unattractive person? Unbelievable. But, it was a very good book, besides that one little factor, and I did love the ending. I look forward to reading other books by Carl Weber and I recommend this book to everyone who reads this review!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"great subway read","review":"If you read books on the subway be prepared to keep reading Lookin For Luv well after you have arrived at your stop. Usually I only read on the subway but I couldn't put this book down. It is mad funny. People were actually giving me some strange looks because I was laughing out loud. It's a great book because it has everything, comedy, drama, and a great \\"Luv\\" story from a male perspective. I could identify with the struggle these brothers were going through with their search for the right woman. Like I said if you read on the subway this book is perfect! Oh by the way I love the main characters name{Kevin}."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just Another Fairytale!","review":"I must say...this book was fun to read. I loved all the drama and the build-up of the plot in the story. I was very into this book, however, I think the book went south towards the end. It lacked reality. This book is great if you want to escape into a fantasy world where everything is perfect. Unfortunately, we don't live in such a world, so the book really was very out-of-touch with reality. I don't know where these perfect people live--with their perfect lives and happy endings, but it was entertaining being a part of their \\"little world\\" temporarily."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing Exciting","review":"I am HUGE fan of Carl Weber. I have read most of his book. But this book was totally...cheesy and not at all well written in my opinion. I was bored from the very beginning. The characters were so immature. The storyline was not at all captivated. Although I read the entire book, I did not enjoy it all. Don't waste your time with this one. Carl has plenty of fantastic books, but this is definitely not one of them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love these things!","review":"I buy these gadgets as gifts.

After only three applications I had to throw the bottle out. I lost more than an inch off the bottom of my hair.

I would recommend using this as a body wash only."},{"rating":"1","title":"This smells good on first whiff, then smells disgusting.","review":"I tried this out at my sister's house before buying any. When smelling it out of the top of the bottle, I thought it smelled great. But once you get it into a lather, it smells like a lemon cleaner--terrible. Also, I would not recommend using it as a shampoo--left my hair greasy and tangled. Doesn't foam under water like the Cinnamon Buns either, so its not really good for a bubble bath. Skip this one, and get the Vanilla Birthday Cake or Cinnamon Buns 3 in 1 instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as expected","review":"The clamps are large.

The actual width of the cable is 0.560 inch (14.23 mm) the clamp space for the cable is only 0.504 inch (12.80 mm) wide. Not enough room to hold the cable flat. The clamps pinch the sides of the cable and ends up looking worse than no clip at all.

I bought two Pixters for my 8 and 4 year old sons, hoping they would keep them occupied during a long flight from Texas to Manchester (U.K.) but other than the first few days of opening the Pixters, I don't think they even turned them on again, and the games now languish in their bedrooms, untouched. I will be turning them into Goodwill shortly, or to a children's charity so that some other child may enjoy them. So, unless your children have been denied the *wonders* of other electronic games, I wouldn't bother with a Pixter.

The Midrash approach was used by all the ancient Fathers of the Church in interpreting the Old Testament and the Divine Plan. However, they knew more than anything that if Jesus was not raised, their faith was in vain. This is the typical trash derived from the Western scholastic tradition that wants to lead people astray from God's mystery, power, and majesty.

Please??"},{"rating":"1","title":"A False Dilemma","review":"There is another explanation that is more plausible than either literalism OR Spong's implausible interpretation. It normally took days to die of crucifixtion. Jesus was up there only for a few hours. Then his tomb was found empty, and later he shows up at his friends' hideout. They all agree that he was solid, fleshly, and wounded, with nail holes in his hands. He begs them to give him something to eat (!), and then leaves, intending to rendevous with them again soon. Isn't it far more plausible to suppose he managed somehow to survive the cricifixtion, than that he was magically, supernaturally raised from the dead? Hello? People have been known to survive wounds far worse, including multiple stab wounds and bullets. Notice his friend, Joseph, is the one who took away the \\"corpse.\\" Notice also the friend who gave him some substance to drink up there, after which he swoons.

Spong does not, as they claim, deny the Resurrection. (Neither would Spong ever disrespect the Jewish religion, as one reviewer here seems to do.) Indeed, to deny the Resurrection is to deny Christianity; this Spong agrees. But he does differentiate between the Divine Resurrection and mere bodily resuscitation. Read the book to find out why."},{"rating":"1","title":"An arrogant attack on traditional Christianity.","review":"John Shelby Spong would be an engaging, thought-provoking scholar if he were not so full of himself. While his argument for a metaphorical reading of the New Testament resurrection accounts bears some weight, his condescending treatment of people who believe the stories report literal history blunts his case.Spong thinks so highly of himself that he assumes if he can't take the accounts literally, then no intelligent person could. Those Christians who do -- which includes not just Fundamentalists, but also evangelicals and most mainline Protestants -- will read this book with the clear impression that Bishop Spong think them frankly stupid.It's not an effective way to win converts to one's view"},{"rating":"1","title":"A disappointment","review":"As a person who grew up in a very strict fundamentalist pentecostal church and have serious questions about fundamentalism I have enjoyed reading Spong's other books especially \\"Living in Sin?\\" and \\"Rescuing the Bible from Fundamentalism\\". I don't agree with everything Spong says in these books but at least they have given me a different perspective. However, I found this book to be weak in argument and poorly written. What I don't understand about Spong's argument against the resurrection is he thinks its physically impossible for Christ to rise from the dead. If God is God then why should s/he be confined by natural laws. A God who has to conform to the laws of the natural universe is not truly God. This book has made me realise that Spong is not a Christian as he claims but a humanist, or worse, a Christian who has lost faith in God."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great.","review":"I love this camera, it takes awesome pictures and it came in the quality it was described!i would definitely reccomend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fun camera, but very cheaply made","review":"After one day out of the package, and no photos taken yet, the multiple/single exposure tab or switch on the back was broken.

The language of, say, Costa Rica and that of Mexico have deep differences. If you are serious about addressing the needs of learners with different destinations, then you have to do more than just offering an alternative to Castilian Spanish. You have to give us, the learners, a course that provides the local language we need, so we can communicate.

While the author uses multiple sources, including many from Oklahoma lawmen, when the story reaches the critical time of the Kansas City massacre and afterward, he relies almost solely on information provided by the FBI, which is completely unreliable. Most eyewitnesses did not place Floyd or Richetti at Union Station at the time of the killings. The federal prosecutor refused to try Richetti in Federal Court because of lack of evidence. He was then tried in state court, found guilty, and executed. Pretty Boy Floyd died from two .45 caliber gunshot wounds to the chest. How does an individual fleeing law enforcement officers get shot in the chest? The more one thinks about this incident, the more questions arise. It is a shame that the truth will never really be known about what happened at Union Station or about how Charley Floyd actually died."},{"rating":"2","title":"SUPERB BIO!","review":"This is without question the best biography I have come across in many years.

I always want to find something positive to say--it was good having more of the characters that I really like. The price is too high for this book in a Kindle format.

The first two tracks, \\"Television\\" and \\"Fading\\" effectively provide chilly landscapes of hyperactive drum beats, eerie synths, and an overall dark and etheral environment I haven't experienced since Portishead's debut. But, boy, is it a steep dive from there. Tracks get repetitve when there should be variety. The record gets boring when it tries to be mellow. And the lyrics, sung in a spoken-girl voice by lead singer Nina Rambsy, are simplistic and embarrassingly plain. \\"Baxter\\" gets the mood and feeling right when it wants to, but it's way too uneven for me to recommend."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I thought it was","review":"I had high hopes after all the good reviews.

I reserve the perfect rating of 5 for an album that I will play all of the way through whenever I play it, whereas this has a couple of songs I didn't much care for and tend to skip.

While they do make some nice cables, in some cases they offer no real benefit over inexpensive alternatives. The best example is digital cables. Anyone familiar with IEEE 1394 (otherwise known as I-Link or Firewire) should know that there is built-in error correction that can deal with any small amount of noise introduced into the digital stream. Since this corrects any minor errors, there is NO difference in quality between an adequate digital cable and an outstanding one.Do yourself a favor and purchase an inexpensive Firewire cable for as little as $4 instead of wasting your money on the $50 version. Out of respect for Amazon.com I am not going to tell you where to purchase, but any resourceful shopper should be able to find them using the search engines.Now analog cables.....that's a whole different story :-)"},{"rating":"1","title":"MOnster is wasy too expensive...","review":"I have just returned the Monster IEEE cable [...] after comparing it side by side with an inexpensive [...] cable.

I think they are most known for their stereo cabling which is of much higher gauge than generic speaker cables, and they have great cables for the RCA in and out jacks as well.

Most of them are not even good poems. They are the likes of that which you might see a 10 year old write. I don't know why he bothered to write a book when he contributed less than half of it. But if you like crap \\"poetry,\\" then you might enjoy this book.Secondly, Mr. Ayers doesn't seem familiarised with the precepts of economics. He says that all children are entitled to a free and high quality education, all while dissing private schools. However, he fails to understand that you can have free OR high quality, but not both.

Although it does do well without one you'll find there are times that an external light would be appreciated (it doesn't have any light at all which is why this reveiw is only getting a 4 not a 5 star).The digitals are really good. However, you do have to play with it to find the best resolution. The average pictures are o.k. and you can get more on your stick but the pictures are a bit fuzzy looking.

Outside was ok..but as soon as you took any inside footage, the grain was just awful, and the audio only picked someone talking from within 5 feet...any further than that forget it. Also, the auto focus tends to fade in and out. I took it back for the TRV22 and now I can see why this camcorder gets such rave reviews...it just works, and works well. Video, both outside and indoors, was perfect, the touch screen is cool and works great, the auto focus is always right on, the sound is great (no motor noise) and the size,not the smallest available, but it's still acceptable.

I bought this book to get a sense--from Jean Rio Baker--of who she was and why she converted to Mormonism, but the factual errors and value judgments cloud the book's credibility so much that it did not really address those issues."},{"rating":"1","title":"Slow read...and not as interesting as I hoped","review":"It was very hard to get into this book. It was dry and I did not feel the story was told in a way that captivated the reader."},{"rating":"2","title":"Faith and Betrayal","review":"I was so glad to be able to read this book. I have a Great grandmother who was put on a ship at the age of 13 from Denmark, sent to the Mormans all alone, no other family member came. Her mother and father divorced in Denmark, over this desire of my great grandmother's mother to join the Mormans, she herself never came to America. This left my Great Grandmother to fend for herself. I had never been able to understand how this could possibly have happened, until I read this account. Like Jean Rio, she came to dispise the Morman Faith and her descendents in general refered to themselves as \\"Jack Mormans\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent, Well Researched Book!!","review":"I just finished Sally Denton's book and I found it to be a fascinating story that was both heartbreaking and heartwarming in different parts. I'm not quite sure what other reviewers are referring to when they state that it was not factual. If you know the TRUE history of the time period when Brigham Young was the prophet and in charge of Utah, you'll find that Denton's book is right on. For some of the \\"minor\\" errors, one has to remember that Denton used mostly journals written by those who lived back then and much was written as seen through their eyes. Good book!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I Feel Cheated","review":"I was anticipating a wonderful diary of an amazing journey by an Englishwoman of privilege over the Western Plains of the American West--what I got was a narrative history of the Mormon religion and its ups and downs. Having read many diaries of Pioneer women, this one attracted me because Jean Rio started out in England with a small fortune at her disposal. I was disappointed that so much of the book was wasted on Brigham Young and so little of it on Jean."},{"rating":"2","title":"I like it!","review":"The watch is comfortable, & easy to read. My only complaint is that I wish the watch band were a bit longer, I have mine hooked on the next to last hole, and I'm not that big! I love the color. It is easy to use. And thank you to the person who set the watch for my time zone! It was ready to go from the box. I've received several compliments on this watch already."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wow, this is really bad","review":"The only good thing about this book is that it was short. Even in writing about a great man with incredible contributions to our country, Gary Hart repeats himself over and over and over and over again. OK, the Monroe Doctrine is important, I GET IT!I read about 2 or 3 presidential biographies per month and I cannot remember a book as bad as this. If you want a quick view of James Monroe, you can read the first chapter and skip the rest but this book is not good for more than that."},{"rating":"1","title":"This slim biography has all the finesse of an eighth-grade history report.","review":"Poorly written and repetitive, the author (yes, he's that Gary Hart) manages to make 150 pages of information feel padded. His tendency to jump back and forth in time is sloppy and confusing. And did I mention it's repetitive? If you're interested in a summary of Monroe's life and achievements, simply read the conclusion of this book. It tells you everything you need to know--just once."},{"rating":"1","title":"Playboy Gary Hart -- a Historian?","review":"All of the titles in this series that I've read so far (six) are admirable efforts, and worth reading. This one is a waste of money. Seek elsewhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"rchaupt","review":"I don't often write reviews, but I thought this book deserves one. Having read over 10 of the books from the American President Series, this is the weak link. I was skeptical by a book authored by Gary Hart, but I trusted the series since all the other books were solid works. Hart quotes Henry Ammon so much that you may as well read Ammon's book on James Monroe, published only 15 years prior to this. Hart also repeats himself often. Although this is a minor complaint, the chapters could use some subdivisions. Again, if you are looking for a good biography on James Monroe, you'll probably want to read Henry Ammon's version."},{"rating":"1","title":"Failed Results","review":"Failed to work as promised, did not alter whiteness at all.

The jungle itself becomes real as the reader is immersed in the sounds, sights and smells of the bush, the plants, the animals and the river. And, of course, there are the shadows which move among them! Gregory, broken in spirit, seeks healing in this tropical retreat. We find that it permeates our spirit as well. A perfect read for a hot August weekend!The writing is so beautiful in its descriptions, taking the reader right into the jungle, that I sought and read other books by the same author. Unhappily, I failed to find any with such extraordinary lyrical power.

What I can not stand is the lint that comes off of this thing, it's crazy!!!It EVERYWHERE in my house, everywhere! Big, huge lint balls EVERYWHERE! It gets on my pajamas then in my bed, bedroom, on my rugs, in my den of course, on all my furniture, but worst of all it gets in my MOUTH and UP MY NOSE! I'm completely serious and not exaggerating.

Per the user guide, I checked the blanket for any obvious defects and unplugged and re-plugged the power cord, to no avail. Only half the blanket got even somewhat warm through the night.

I do NOT wash them nor do I misuse the blanket. Frankly, they just don't last.I changed the bedding today from Spring/summer light to fall/winter colors and tried two Sunbeam blankets I had in storage--just in case.

We are pleased that the ramp is sturdy, tough enough for adults and older children to have a couple of turns.We have found other uses for the ramp as well! It is fun to send balls and cars down the side wheel tracks and even when the car is put away, the kids love crawling up and climbing the child-friendly stairs. We keep the car put away when lots of kids are playing in the basement unless an adult is supervising the extreme coaster. It would be very easy for the rider to mow down anybody or anything in their path!"},{"rating":"2","title":"BEST TOY EVER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","review":"This is the best toy and best money we have spent on a toy.

He loves cars so this was a great match. We thought he can always play on a swingset at a park or play school. The fun factor is tops in rating. Not sure there's much in the educational value. Since we have only had it less than a month I cannot rate it's durability. I must say I compared another version and I am glad I chose this one for sturdiness and safety.

My son, only 2 years old was very badly injured (broken leg in two places) due to being run over by another child as they came down the ramp. Have now been to the doctor on 5 occasions over 5 months and the damage is still evident to his bone. This is not a safe toy period. The ramp up the middle of the toy is not a safe place to enter the ramp, the sides at that the kids slide down does not have any rails, and the speed that the car reaches as kids ride down the ramp is too excessive.

The cases are sturdy, but I received one with the snaps missing on one of the back corners. Specifically, the female snaps were missing the insets that create the pressure on the other matching snaps.

They rip fairly easily. I originally got them to try to keep my 1 yo son out of our DVD collection. In the end, that proved impossible. They don't hold up particularly well to abuse. They come flat, and you assemble them through the use of button snaps. However, these snaps don't hold too well, and frequently unclick. If you were using these to store DVD cases that you didn't intend on returning to very often (old movies you don't watch very much, ect...), I would say these are fine, but they won't hold up to frequent uses of opening and closing.I rated a 4, because they are decent for what they are, and you can't blame a cardboard box for being cardboard, this is cardboard, and it is about as strong as such, it will do what you need as long as it is more long term. Otherwise, expect to replace a couple every 2 years or so."},{"rating":"1","title":"Junk","review":"Wow, how anyone can give this 5 stars is WAY beyond me.

The boxes snap together in seconds. They seem flimsy but once filled are firm enough to stack 2 or 3 high; I wouldn't try for higher. These are the cheapest solution for DVD storage that looks well, but since inexpensive, they are rather fragile. Despite some ads that refer to 'leather' these are made of library paper over cardboard - so don't get them wet, and don't drag them over each other or the paper will fray. Caution: We ordered lots of them and several sets were badly damaged - frayed or crushed corners. AMAZON* was very quick to replace them.

I still like the boxes, just be aware that there may be some problems when you put them together."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shallow Assessments Cloud And Demean The Genre","review":"This survey is the weak link in Routledge's stellar 'Genres in Context' series. The author's assessments of what he considers fantasy classics (Chapters 2, 3, 5, 6, and 7) are more perfunctory summaries than perspicacious critiques; the reader often has to construct thematic concerns from the motifs and details which the author haphazardly limns. The one chapter devoted to the history of modern fantasy (Chapter 1) is woefully inadequate, failing to inform the uninitiated reader of the true depth and breadth of fantastical writing. (A comparison to Brooks Landon's supernal post-1900 science fiction survey - also from the 'Genres in Context' series - makes the lacunae in this survey all the more evident.) This tome - if in its brevity, it can be called such - serves only as a poignant reminder of the dearth of comprehensive and pensive scholarship on the fantasy genre."},{"rating":"1","title":"sorry a tree had to die for this book","review":"this author better stick to his day job.

I'm giving the soundtrack album 4 stars, however, for 2 reasons. One, I don't care much for the ELO tracks except, of course, for their duet with ONJ on \\"Xanadu.\\" Number two, is for what was omitted, as another reviewer alluded to. The songs Olivia sang at the end were all great but most were left out on this album. And I had the 45 of \\"Suddenly\\" and really enjoyed Olivia's version of \\"You Made Me Love You,\\" okay, it's no Judy Garland but Olivia does give the song her own interpretaion which still is quite satisying. And her duet with Gene Kelly on \\"Whenever You're Away from Me\\" is spectacular, a big-band, jazzy sort of number. One can only hope that Olivia puts out soon an album devoted to big band and jazz covers. Anyway, this album is a must for ONJ fans! \\"Suspended in Time\\" is one of her best ballads."},{"rating":"2","title":"Call me goofy","review":"Call me goofy but I so enjoyed this CD. I've played it quite a few times since I purchased it. I have the original vinyl albumn around here somewhere but forgot all about it until I was wandering around on Amazon and saw this. I haven't hear Cliff Richards in years. Is he still alive? I was sorry that there were so few songs, I wanted to hear more. I usually land up listening to it twice each time I play it. I also enjoyed the movie because it was so stupid. Roller skating muses anyone? Now I'm in the mood to go see the broadway production. I wonder how that cast albumn will be. Maybe Amazon should offer a twin pack with both versions. Will anyone be able to compete with Olivia Newton-John?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic pop album/weird movie","review":"This is one of the few soundtracks from recent decades worth owning. It works as a cohesive whole, whether you've seen the film or not.The film is flawed, but it's still worth seeing. There are so many interesting visuals, and a quirky story juxtaposing pop culture elements from different eras (classical mythology, 20s art deco architecture, 40s jazz, 80s rollerdisco, etc). This freakiness is probably the reason many \\"orthodox\\" reviewers dismiss the film altogether.Another song missing is \\"Fool\\" which appears at the end of the film, and is a collage/medley of the song \\"Fool\\" sung in different styles (e.g. country, disco, etc). This was another of the bizarre mix-n-match songs like \\"Dancin'\\" that combined different styles of music within the one song. Shame it's missing from the album."},{"rating":"2","title":"A memory from my childhood","review":"I saw Xanadu the movie when I was 10, and I thought it was wonderful. OK, I know that the critics didn't agree, but hey, I was 10! I think I actually saw it twice in the theaters. And at some point shortly thereafter, I got the record. Olivia Newton John on one side, and ELO on the other. (Yes children, old people records were two sided.) I think I wore it out!I ordered this from Amazon last weekend and have listened to it a dozen times so far. The music is just fun! It's happy and cheerful, and it reminds me of my childhood.

It's odd because \\"Drum Dreams,\\" \\"Fool Country,\\" and \\"You Made Me Love You\\" were all issued as B-sides, so the music IS available. And I always thought it would be cool to have the full-length mix of the title song as seen in the movie. Oh well, the original album still has plenty of merits."},{"rating":"2","title":"2nd Best Soundtrack","review":"This is my 2nd Favorite All Time Movie Soundtrack. Grease is my favorite - see any connections between the two?"},{"rating":"2","title":"An Overly Maligned Film","review":"The early 80s were a turbulent time, pitting the end of 70s innocence against a darker, more complex era to come. The last great hurrah for a film who's sole purpose was to remind us of the magic of music, dance and film is XANADU. Rather than revile it's eccentricities I find myself gliding through the cool, surreal ELO music and that singular voice of Olivia Newton-John's. This was a product of it's time. Absurd and trite? Possibly, but also a tremendous achievement against today's gritty urban music and pre-amped and overtly manufactured pubescent rock starlets and boy-teams churned out by Disney and their ilk. Music that soars and captures emotions, rather than pounding back-beats."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great talents; musically interesting and entertaining","review":"What an incredible combination of talents -- ELO and Olivia Newton-John; ONJ and the Tubes; ONJ and Gene Kelly. This is Olivia in her prime with some great songs written by long-time producer John Farrar, including the classic \\"Magic.\\" She sings one of her best-ever ballads, \\"Suspended in Time.\\" The ELO songs are equally infectious, and the combination ONJ/ELO on \\"Xanadu\\" can't be beat."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't spend extra!","review":"One star isn't for the soundtrack itself, it's for the quality of the packaging. I was hoping that by buying a re-mastered import I'd get a little something in the liner notes. There ARE no liner notes, no lyrics, just a single sheet of flimsy paper with the song titles on it. Buy the domestic; even if it's the same stuff it's nearly 10 bucks cheaper."},{"rating":"2","title":"Really long, long, long time fan","review":"I have liked ONJ since junior high school back in the 70's I think the first time I ever heard her she was on a jukebox in Wisconsin Dells it was either Please Mr. Please or Let It Shine and I have followed her career since I have most of her U.S. albums and all her movies. Xanadu has the best music I think out of all her albums, my favorites are Magic and Xanadu. I like Suddenly too, I really can't pick because I have never heard a bad song out of her. I saw her in concert for the first time in 1999 live and the first song she sang was Magic and she still looks like she did back in the 70's if anything she's gotten better looking and is as warm and nice as I had always thought."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great soundtrack to a horrible movie","review":"Even by liberal-schmaltz eighties standards, the film \\"Xanadu\\" was unbelievably bad. I suspect the powers that be at Paramount knew this, and made sure the soundtrack would be killer. Fortunately, it is. The combination of Olivia Newton-John and ELO may sound weird, but it actually works quite well. John Farrar, Olivia's long-time producer, outdoes himself on the hypnotic \\"Magic,\\" while Jeff Lynne and his cohorts kick in the rousing \\"I'm Alive\\" and \\"All Over The World.\\" The Tubes make an appearance on \\"Dancin'\\", a strange juxtaposition between '40's swing and power pop (again, a combination that works well), and the obligatory duet, \\"Suddenly,\\" between Olivia and Cliff Richard, is a lovely ballad with surprisingly intelligent lyrics. Things come to a climax with the Olivia/ELO title track, where Olivia lets as loose as she can (\\"Physical\\" aside, she's never been a belter). Watch the movie only if someone bets you, but the soundtrack is definitely worth your time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Short Shorts and Roller Skating at it's best!","review":"Oh Xanadu! Xanaduooooo! For the most part it's your usual musical plot without a whole lot of substance but Xanadu has something about it that heightens it froms its bad cheesy level to something great! My favorite scene was the dual between the 80's rock and the 40's big band, and then they combined to create sweet mush. I know alot of people say the it's one of the worst movies made but you take the songs away from it and you have some classic 80's tunes. I myself can be very critical of musicals but Olivia made me sit and shut up. Xanadu doesn't always get the deserved credit but through all that cakey exterior lies the heart of the 80's and most musicals."},{"rating":"2","title":"Olivia's the Best!!","review":"The movie that this soundtrack is from bombed at the box office in 1980 and sucked big time! But, the combination of the song Xanadu and Olivia together was \\"MAGIC\\". Olivia's vocals are absolutely breathtaking, and I still remember back in 1980 when she went on the t.v. show, \\"Solid Gold\\", and was singing some of the songs off of this album, including \\"Suspended\\", which at one point during the show while she was singing it, tears started coming down her face (she must have been relating to something in the lyrics to this song). Go ahead and get this, you will love it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good book, good message","review":"I have three kids (9, 7, and 5), and they all love this book.

And, yes, kids are prefectly capable of understanding what the book is about if you take a few extra seconds to talk to them about it.Some of the comments complain about brain-washing or parents having an over-active drive for their kids to succeed. I think that is off the mark. The point of this book is to teach kids how to accept and deal with change in a positive, proactive manner. It serves as a great reminder for me as well. These are life lessson we ALL need.The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is that it is a bit long.

Included you will find the heart break of being a single mother (JOEY), the pain of the children involved (DONT MAKE ME GO TO SCHOOL), the comittment of faith (FOREVER YOURS) and the apologetic heart (ITS MY WAY). This easily could have become a greatest hits package if more than the title track had been released as a single.

I don't believe that the resin ever reached the cracks. It looked just the same as it did before the repair. I used some other product several years ago on a similar bullseye with outstanding results. The repaired area looked like no damage had ever occurred. I believe the problem with the Permatex product is that the resin is too thick to be pulled into the cracks, even after creating the vacuum. The resin needs to be very low in viscosity and low in surface tension to flow into the crack. If the resin never flows into the crack, the crack will always show. I called Permatex and they said that maybe the product was old, so I went back to Auto Zone and they gave me my money back. I wish I could remember the brand of product I used several years ago when I had such good results.

If you are interested in understanding the sources of anti-Semitic thought and race theory as phenomena that culminated in the Holocaust and other modern manifestations of the genocidal impulse, this book is a must.

Because Jews were absent from England for three centuries the English had only the bible and their imagination to inform them about Jews. The Christian bible promoted negative attitudes and the belief that the messiah would come when all Jews became Christians brought up interesting complications that to this day disturb the Vatican! Christianity, the religion of love certainly produced plenty of hate. The analysis of Shylock is extremely interesting and contrary to what we learned in school.

I returned two pair of bluetooth headsets before realizing, by reading chats, that you can not listen to music via bluetooth on the iphone. The phone portion works just fine. For some strange reason, apple has not corrected this programming problem. My guess is that they may seek to develop their own bluetooth headset, but don't want all of its existing iphone users to already have purchased an existing product. Okay, call me cynical. I bought the bose on-ear headphones instead and even though they are wired, they sound absolutely fantastic. Actually, we have the original over ear quiet comfort, but the headphones sound even better. The bose noise cancelling is amazing, which is very important for a NYC commuter.

After 2 months the headset and the audio streamer no longer recognize each other. The lights on both devices indicate that they are in pairing mode, but they do not pair.

A major problem is when the unit is charging, and you unplug it, the power is on and if you forget to turn it off, it will burn down the batteries are dead for when you need it.

It is comfortable (as much as anything can be on your head for that long).It connects very easily and holds the connect perfectly up to about 8-10 meters before begining to drop out. Setup was a breeze.The blue tooth works perfectly with my AT&T; Tilt phone. It puts the music on hold and answers everytime with no problem.

I originally bought the X5 to be used with my Nextel Bluetooth phone. Unfortunately, the phone did not support A2DP stereo audio streaming. Then on top of that the audio streamer that comes with the headset required a 3.5mm input. My phone has a 2.5mm input. I purchased a 3.5 to 2.5 adapter; however, when I attempted to listen wirelessly I only heard sound from one ear only. I contacted Blue Ant customer support and was told that the audio streamer works best straight into a 3.5mm input and that I would need to try a different 3.5 to 2.5 adapter. I have since decided to use the audio streamer with my HP iPAQ's windows media player. The sound may not be the ultimate but it sure is good enough to warrant not having wires while I'm in the gym doing my workouts."},{"rating":"2","title":"excellent quality","review":"Firstly i want to comment on how much stuff you get in this package. you get two mini-usb to big head usb cords that are used to charge both the streamer and the headset itself. both of them charge to full power in an hour and a half. pairing them is easy, and connecting them via bluetooth is a breese. they fit comfortably around the ears, and are very easy to get use to. i am not a sound expert, and have never bought headphones that cost more than 20 dollars, but i just want to say that they are very good quality. the streamer appears large but is in fact very light and can easily fit into a pocket that is capable of carrying a 20 gb mp3 in it. the microphone is detachable and works as in the description and the sound quality is as good as your reception is. my friends had no trouble hearing me. the volume gets extremely high for wireless headphones, being recorded at a total of 92 dbs. great buy from a first time wireless headphone buyer."},{"rating":"1","title":"No to BluAnt X5","review":"though I tried, and even got my son to set it up, I can't keep it working. then the batteries died and I didn't even get 5 hours out of it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Battary is everything","review":"Overall a nice idea but in reality the short life time of the battery is very annoying... because of all the recharging (the headset as well as the bluetooth station) I am currently using more often my old wired ones.

He also loves to hear the music that plays when you press another of the buttons. Each button does something or says something, but he loves these two the most. I think it is cute that the phone rings and when it is flipped open, sounds or voices are heard, as if you were answering your own phone.

It also includes four songs from \\"Most Happy Fella\\" as the show was scored three years before it opened.Fans familiar with the finished products will find the earlier versions of these songs fascinating (the older lyrics from \\"A Secretary is not a Toy\\" are a hoot), while people unfamiliar with these songs can still appreciate the talent of the genius who wrote them.

Instead of the usual \\"teens in peril from masked killer\\" flick so prominent in the 80's, \\"Scarecrows\\" actually has a unique story, aimed at an adult audience.

I was impressed being the movie takes place entirely over one night. Too bad the makers weren't able to deliver on a decent storyline. In fact, I recognized some themes in Scarecrows present in more contemporary Horror films (such as the scarecrows duplicating the voices of the robbers and the vines from 'The Ruins').

It is inappropriate for me to review it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Baaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaad","review":"Sooooooooooo pointless and boring. I wound up fast forwarding just to see the kills after 30 minutes of aimless wandering around and utterly ridiculous dialogue between the characters. I am not even going to go on about what the film is about, just that it was so extremely boring and uneventful that I wish I wouldn't have spent ten bucks to buy it because of the rave reviews."},{"rating":"1","title":"Let's not sugar coat this review....","review":"I can't believe after fourteen editions of this book, the quality is still so poor. First of all, this book is too simple even for a high school AP economics class (the one I'm in now). The examples are stuipid and uninteresting. Secondly, this book is difficult to read because of the font type, the graphics and other things annoying to the eye. This means reading this book will put a student to sleep. Thirdly, one look at the table of contents will reveal that the book is totally out of order. It jumps into macroeconomics without saying anything about supply and demand essential to microeconomics (that's later in the book). Lastly, reading this book will not increase your knowledge of economics unless you attend the lectures. So reading this book on your own will only make a vague impression of what's said but no understanding. So, teachers and professors, do your students a favor by choosing another textbook."},{"rating":"1","title":"The album entitled 'Everyday\\" NOT what it seems!","review":"Regardless of the album cover which depicts a picture of James Taylor as well as his name, this is NOT James Taylor. It doesn't even appear that he sings on any of the songs, although the back of the cover does give him credit for his work. It gives no indication of who is actually recording the album. This was produced by a German company and labeled LT Series. If you want JT, DON'T buy this album. If you just like his music and can't afford the original, go for it but be warned! Amazon - you dhould really examine your products before you list them. This was incredibly deceitful and definitely false advertising. The description should be clearly labeled that this is NOT James Taylor. Shame on you!"},{"rating":"1","title":"What is this????","review":"This is not early JT. I'm not certain who or what it is. But, it is garbage in any event. Don't waste a nickel on this. I pitched the cd and re-used the case. I believe that there are laws that prohibit this sort of misrepresentation. Maybe they don't apply to a Canadian label, but they should. Even if this is somehow an old Flying machine demo with someone other than JT doing the vocals, they are poor, and why isn't this indicated anywhere? In fact, there are no credits or details anywhere to be found. Very sleezy. They suckered me. Don't let them do it to you. Amazon should pull this product and not support rip-offs like this."},{"rating":"1","title":"James Taylor Everyday aka The Letter aka Listen With James","review":"I agree with another reviewer \\"Beware! If you're buying this CD to hear the three \\"rare\\" tracks (Everyday, The Letter and You're the One I Love) that don't appear on any other JT release, please note that these are NOT performed by James Taylor! The song Everyday is NOT JT's cover of the Buddy Holly tune, it is a different song, and these 3 tunes are performed by an unknown (mediocre) singer whom I cannot identify at all. The remaining 6 tracks can be found on the 'Original Flying Machine' CD, rendering this CD release completely useless.\\" This CD, another titled The Letter, and a third titled Listen With James are exactly the same! Glad I only paid a couple bucks for it - it's not even worth the trouble of sending it back."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't bother with this imposter","review":"Avoid this one.

My body was very low on DHEA and alarmingly high in cortisol levels. The resulting symptoms were fatigue, evening anxiety and increased midriff fat.It was recommended that I begin on small doses of daily DHEA and include Seriphos daily at dinner.Now, I am feeling much better with much reduced fatigue and anxiety and now, the midriff fat is disappearing."},{"rating":"1","title":"May have hurt, did not help","review":"I took Seriphos for eight days, primarily to lower cortisol levels and promote sound sleep. I did not test cortisol but found that my nighttime awakenings got worse with Seriphos. The label warns about \\"mild insomnia.\\" I tried different dosing strategies.My integrative medicine physician advised me to try it but after the week on it told me to stop.It was a somewhat expensive trial: about $26 with shipping from Amazon."},{"rating":"1","title":"Did Not Work For Me","review":"After years of sleep issues, I quit worrying as long as I felt o.k & had enoughdaytime energy. However, a year ago I was diagnosed with early stage insulin resistance andas I exercise, follow healthy diet, have no family history of blood sugar issues, my M.D. agreed it was due to not getting enough uninterrupted sleep, which affected my metabolism. As I had tried every sleep recommendation known to man. and traditional medicine had no answer, I finally went to chiropracter who did saliva test for adrenal/cortisol issues and put me on Seriphos. Though it seemed to help many people, after taking it for 3 weeks--- my sleep got worse - I couldn't even get to sleep and had this problem for two weeks. After reporting this to Chiro, she told me to stop taking it -"},{"rating":"1","title":"pining for neesby","review":"I have taken the ts neesby seriphos for close to a year. It was life changing in providing me with additional quality sleep and allowed me to wake up feeling rested - something that had not happened for years. When the neesby seriphos was discontinued, I switched to the interplexus seriphos, but did not find the same results. My sleep was filled with intense nightmares and shortened by an hour or so. I kept taking it hoping the nightmares would lessen, but I dreaded falling asleep so much that it added to the insomnia problem. So, I am, once again, in search of a \\"natural remedy\\" for insomnia."},{"rating":"1","title":"Could not sleep","review":"Seriphos was prescribed for me to help my adrenal fatigue.

I took the recommended dosage before bed and had a terrible, restless night--a pattern of sleep that was altogether different from my ususal form of insomnia. After re-reading some of the reviews that suggested taking Seriphos during the day (well before bedtime), I tried that as well, but had the same type of disrupted sleep. The reviews indicate that this product may not work for everyone, but anything is worth a try when you are experiencing chronic insomnia."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best guide to rivers in Maine","review":"This is the guide book to get if you are thinking of doing a river trip in Maine. The information in it has been thoroughly checked and is very accurate. It tells you if you need permits for campsites and even tells you the quality for those sites. It has excellent detailed descriptions of all significant rapids and even suggests the best route to take. It has every conceivable trip from a half-day to a week or more. As a professional in the field, this is a book that I rely when planning any canoe expeditions in the state."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your time or money","review":"It may look nice but it is junk - the doors are warped, the screw holes were either too big or too small and after 6 hours or more of putting it together it was a huge disappointment. One side is warped and trying to put it together the cams bent, several of the boards were cut too small and all that holds them together is glue. There is over 250 pcs in the box, we are experienced at putting things together and this was a nightmare. It is poorly cut, poorly built and not worth the effort it takes to put it together."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst movie ever","review":"Do not waste your money. This movie was horrible. Bad acting. Bad story line. Absolutely horrible. I wouldn't sell this to anyone for a penny."},{"rating":"1","title":"a bunch of depressed artists","review":"I was disappointed with this book. I was expecting more inside studio shots, with details of how the artistswork. Instead I got photos of really depressed looking artists that did not look like they enjoyed their work.I would not recommend this book as a source of inspiration for anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Avoid!","review":"It says it was published in 2003, but it feels like it came from the 90s. Everything in this book feels amateur and rushed (some images even have the Mac's cursor left on them!). A lot of the images are pixelated and blurry too. I have no idea what that 5 star review before me was on about when they said \\"showcases many of the top digital cartoonists and comics artists working today\\", because it would be more accurate to say it showcases many of the artists who are doing so poorly that they would accept to be published in any sort of book.This book is basically a guide to everything an artist should avoid, and that is probably the only good use for it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful Pan","review":"I don't know who can NOT love this beautiful pan. The towel and pot holder are really nice too. The pan heats up evenly and is a perfect mix between non stick and stainless steel. The only problem I have with it is... I'm having a hard time keeping the nice smooth finish of the interior. Don't ever use anything other than a sponge to keep the pan regardless of what the instructions say, it WILL scratch."},{"rating":"1","title":"Kid's Italian","review":"It was not an appropriate choice for teens - maybe for small kids, but my teens seemed insulted."},{"rating":"1","title":"interesting people, poor production","review":"It was really great to listen to writers in the business, but the host was not a great speaker and the production quality was bad."},{"rating":"2","title":"An excellent introductory on data modeling","review":"This is an excellent introductory text book on data modeling, but I bet even experts will find it useful. It is amazing how much information this short volumn contains. It has an exceptional treatment on E-R to relational tables mapping. It also provides a catalog of E-R diagrams that is extremely useful for learning"},{"rating":"1","title":"Just a Beginner's Book","review":"This book gives a concise summary of elementary data modeling concepts that can be found in practically any textbook on the subject. It may do for a beginner in a hurry, but for someone at all familiar with the topic, it simply rehashes very, very familiar material.In fact, I could have titled this review \\"The One-Idea Book,\\" because the only original (?) idea I found was the suggestion to implement optional 1-to-many relationships by using a composite table."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing to it and outdated","review":"Well the book is certainly short - I finished scanning it over a weekend. By the first hour I realized that I didn't really want to read it carefully.Overall the book reads like it was designed as an undergraduate text book -- an academic view of data model with little of use to a professional.Most of the treatment is very outdated. The E-R diagrams are like nothing modern I've seen and the book apparently is pre-UML.I guess if you need a very basic introduction, this book might be useful, otherwise, stay away."},{"rating":"2","title":"At last - My Early Burgalary Years","review":"I know this Cd has been avalible for a few years, but due to a horriffic price over in Britain, I finally got it through Amazon at a very reasonable price, but enough brown nosing. This CD is class. It's so good to hear \\"nobody Loves Us\\" getting another chance, after being stuck on the B-side of \\"Dagenam Dave\\", because it truly is one of his finest moments. and its a song even non Morrissey will like. As is \\"The Boy Racer\\", although not a rarity, you know a song is good, when my girlfriend sings along to it. (She's not a big fan!) \\"Boxers\\" too is hardly a rare track, but it is another example of his best work. Other highlights are \\"Cosmic Dancer\\", the funky \\"Sister I'm a Poet\\", \\"Girl Least Likely To\\" and the vintage Morrissey of \\"I've Changed My Plea to Guilty\\". Well, if making top class songs is something to be guilty about, then it's a life sentence for Morrissey."},{"rating":"2","title":"More Proof If You Need It...","review":"A stunning compilation of cast-offs and B-sides that shows the Mo is still unsurpassed master of reflective, well-crafted pop music. The instrumental work is stunning too, with several tracks carrying perfect evocations of the full \\"Smiths\\" sound. A perfect complement to \\"Bona Drag\\" in your collection..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Morrissey did WHAT again?","review":"What Morrissey did was put out another weak release of songs from previous album in an attempt to get a little cash from these Morrissey fans who will buy absolutely anything he releases. He hasn't done anything worth wild since Your Arsenal. Everything sounds exactly the same and his music style is totally played out. This album is very boring and deserves less than 1 star. I'm surprised he didn't add Moon River to this album. Obviously there was no rhyme or reason for this album. The song selection is clueless to me? What is so rare about putting a song that was on his last album on this album? Please...Morrissey fans...GIVE IT UP. His music is awful now."},{"rating":"2","title":"New Fans Rejoice","review":"For new fans this CD is a must. You get so many great Moz songs that if you are just a casual listener you would not have. From Michael's Bones to the classic Nobody Loves Us, this album is a must. Old fans of course must buy this to get the new version of Cosmic Dancer and the video of Sunny, and even a multi media message from Moz himself! Classic."},{"rating":"2","title":"must have!","review":"You have to listen the song \\"nobody loves us\\" Amazing! plus you get all the lyrics for the english inpaired."},{"rating":"2","title":"MY EARLY BURGLARY YEARS : a solid compilation","review":"there is nothing new here to Morrisey fans (besidesd a newly recorded live version of \\"Cosmic Dancer\\", but overall this is a great collection of songs that showcases his fine voice and lyrical talent. \\"Swallow On My Neck\\" has always been an underrated gem of a song. the same applies to \\"Boxers\\" and the live version of \\"Jack The Ripper\\" which never fails to send shivers up my spine whenever it's played."},{"rating":"2","title":"Morrissey returns with a strong set of B-side gems.","review":"Morrissey has once again scoured his repetoire of recordings and created a winner---an album which, as a whole, manages to surpass its constituent parts. It's no Bona Drag, these songs are primarily B-sides and out-takes; But for the most part, My Early Burglary Years is a refreshing trip down memory lane for the true Moz fan, and still a pretty darn good disc for the uninitiated as well. Nobody Loves Us, Sister I'm a Poet, and Sunny are vintage Moz."},{"rating":"2","title":"A solid album","review":"This cd is really good collection of b-sides. i like it alot. then agian this is morrissey. morrisey put's out good music."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mozzer's melodious and melancholic mediocrity","review":"What? Another compilation of previously released material? It seems that the public can't seem to get enough of Morrissey. \\"My Early Burglary Years\\" contains many familiar Mozzer B-sides, and some of these tracks (such as \\"Sister I'm A Poet\\" and \\"Cosmic Dancer\\") only partially redeem this otherwise bland effort. Where is the Morrissey of old? Where is the erudite (and original) angst found in his former CDs, like \\"Viva Hate\\" and \\"Vauxhall & I\\"? If he plans to release more mediocrity, then Moz will find that one day, the world won't listen."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sam Tsoutsouvas (Narrator)","review":"There is no imitation for Tom Peters. Having someone else read his book out loud is like someone reading Maya Angelo's peotry - flat, uninspired, and ineffective."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works as expected, can't change combo","review":"I have one of these at work and it seems to work as expected. They include some adhesive hard plastic spacers that stick onto the end of the lock so that it is snug against your computer. I haven't had any problems using this on my MacBook Pro.Note that this unit has a factory set combo, you can't change it. TheTargus PA410Uallows you to change the combo, but according to the reviews seems to be plagued with changing the combo on its own. So if you can figure out a way to remember or write down the combo (I store it in an encrypted file on my computer) then this is probably the way to go if you want a combo lock."},{"rating":"2","title":"Stuck shut after 5 months","review":"After 5 months, it stuck shut and could not be removed. I had to jimmy it with a pair of pliers (standard, not needlenose) and a flathead screwdriver. Took about 2 minutes. Unfortunately Amazon won't let me change the four-star rating I gave it after only 1 month."},{"rating":"1","title":"CHEAP PIECE OF JUNK","review":"I bought this item in a different length and all I can say is this is nothing but a piece of JUNK. It's so cheap (the materials and workmanship) that it fell apart when I opened it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good but can not change the key","review":"I bought it and later I discovered that I can not change the key. Good product but bad info about that it can not be changed."},{"rating":"1","title":"terrible design, stopped working upon first use","review":"This lock is poorly designed. Upon setting a new combination code and attempting to plug into my laptop, found it very hard to turn dials away from my code to engage the lock. Once removed from laptop, the lock somehow reset in the locked position and my code would no longer work. Followed all the directions. Also the lock is quite wobbly on the computer, even with the supplied spacers. Buy the Kensington keyed lock instead; you won't regret it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Whole season compilations - PLEASE","review":"I recently bought the \\"Best OF\\" dvd and was freshly blown away by the genius of Drew's comedy. The episode showing Drew \\"blowing\\" his promotion had us literally falling on the floor with laughter (again) - it may not be sophisticated but it is great physical comedy. We will be anxiously waiting for the full season DVD's. PLEASE!A separate DVD with all the great musical dance scenes would also be great."},{"rating":"1","title":"Drew Carey Show","review":"Well, thier are a lot better episodes out there. Like any involving Michael Gross from Family Ties and his alcholic wife. The only two that shone at all were the 4 and 5 episodes with Adrienne Barbou, not due to her, she just happened to be in them.There are 6 episodes, and the first three are kind of stinkers,4 and 5 are good, and episode 6 is a special effects goofy deal.The DVD reflects poorly on a hilarious series.Im kind to give it a 2, and it pains me, because the show was one of the greatest ever."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love this show!!!!!!!!!","review":"This show put Drew Carey and Cleveland on the map. I can't wait to get the complete first season when it comes out! These episodes are pretty good ones, but definetly not the best. Just wait for the actual season's to start coming out on DVD, then you'll see what I mean. But this is ultimately a great purchase for any fan of the show, or Drew Carey for that matter. Get it if you just can't wait for the season's to come out on DVD, or if you just need a quick fix!!!! Cleveland Rocks!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Very low quality product","review":"I bought this for 49.99 at an outlet store and feel I got ripped off. The finish is peeling off from day one. At first I thought it was the protective plastic that you are supposed to peel off. The radio reception is much worse than my other Eton.

I went from being confused about Java to having a clear as day understanding of the language. Simply put this book teaches java using the english language, using methaphors we all know and understand, all while keeping a lighter side to things. I've bought about 3 or 4 books on java before thinking they were good and I could use them, but as I delved into the \\"teaching\\" I later found that the more complicated the chapter got the more confused I got. I have also finally found a book which does not isolate me from the java classes by building their own intermediary classes which handle the final code. Here, you deal with the code itself, not some bundled java classes which you are required to import in order to compile the example. Mitchell Waite did it again!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The BEST book for learning Object-Oriented Design!","review":"This is the best book I have seen yet that truly encapsulates the whole design process in an easy to digest format. The important thing to emphasize is that the design principles that are conveyed here can be applied to anything. I thought I really knew what Object-Oriented Design was until I got this book. This book explains in detail all the requisite information on techniques and tools in implementing good design decisions. I am requiring everyone at my company, Q - interactive, to read this book . This is a 'must-have' book for your reference library."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wordy and Boring!","review":"I agree with one of the reviewers who wrote that the book is wordy and it does not worth over [money]. Only one-third of the book is educational, the rest is junk. The author wants to be funny and all that does is to make me irritated at all the jokes and the pizza and the elephant stories. If I want to learn how to do something, I'll look to the instructions in a manual, not some \\"comic book want-to-be\\". I would not recommend this book to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stay away from this book","review":"Too much junk and the way this book is organized makes it not easy to understand.

Well, he is my ex-husband now, but I did get something from the divorce - Coupling. This is a savvy, funny, intelligently written and acted series.My husband also thought the Americans copied Friends from Coupling, but those are fighting words. I should have brought him to an American bar, as he was considerably larger than me to pop him in the nose. Both series are funny and both series are different and I love them both.I like the interplay back and forth - and the relationships; but I don't want to give away anything, even at this stage of the game. I would highly recommend at least getting series 1 through 3. But don't get series 4, as a main character left the series and the comedy went downhill after that."},{"rating":"2","title":"sleepover","review":"Of the many items to come from the UK, 'Coupling' is by far one of the best. As a kid I grew up watching 'Are You Being Served', 'Fawlty Towers' and 'Red Dwarf' on PBS on Sunday nights. Now I am able to enjoy a recent comedy that most likely targets my 'Seinfeld'-watching demographic. Though it only lasted four seasons, each and every season is extremely well-done and hilarious. It manages to be all about sex, smartly and realistically, without being ridiculously over-the-top and gratuitous in its humor, which American sitcoms tend to be when it comes to sex humor. The two main characters seem to depict the typical male and female archetypes, while each of their two friends represent the dramatic polar opposites of the spectrum, both male (suave and well-endowed vs nervous and awkward) and female (poor self-image and manic vs nympho and svelte). If you like laughing, watch this series!"},{"rating":"2","title":"at last","review":"I have waited years for this complete set. I discovered the series on BBC AMERICA. The chemistry among the cast is amazing. The interplay among the threesomes is spot-on. The writing is witty and the delivery is British underplay at its best. That statement should not in anyway undercut the superb use of physical comedy. The sense of timing, the odd quirks of the characters, the arc of the stories over the four seasons is outstanding. I was a great fan of FRIENDS but this series raised the bar on the \\"unit cast comedy\\". My only complaint is the recast in the fourth season. The new guy hadn't time to catch the rhythum of the other cast members. The extras are amusing and informative and the bonus DVD made for a wonderful night of British comedy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hilarity!","review":"I checked out this show after seeing Jack Davenport in the Pirates of the Caribbean movies.

The witty banner, funny jokes, and splendid storylines make this show a must see."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the funniest sitcoms ever!","review":"Written in a Friends-like format, in a British and more about sex way, and in my opinion it's way funnier! I would have given it 4 1/2 stars if I could have for losing Jeff in the 4th series, but based on the price you are basically getting series 4 for free, so still totally worth it to buy them all in this set!Although definitely adult content, it's hard to remember the last time I laughed out loud this much, so I can't recommend it enough."},{"rating":"2","title":"Superb British humor (or humour)!","review":"Coupling - The Complete Seasons 1-4If you like British comedy (you have to think, but don't worry, not too hard), \\"Coupling\\" is unquestionably one of the best of British TV. \\"Brilliant\\" as the character Jeff would say. (OK, skip it if you're easily offended with some bawdy language.) If you saw the short-lived American attempt, or have heard it is the British \\"Friends\\", forget that. This is far, far better. The only pity is that this and another BBC America gem \\"Chef\\" (with Lenny Henry) didn't continue on for many more years.As Steve (Jack Davenport - who you can also see in \\"Pirates of the Caribbean\\") says in one episode, \\"This is NOT an American sit-com!\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not just about sex","review":"I am not sure why this is sold as being a show only about sex. Maybe because half the cast is male? And that is all men think about? Or at least that is one of the real issues satirized by COUPLING, since its main focus is not sex (which it would be if it were only about the men) but instead the Gender Gap. The show makes fun of everyone--bimbos, mimbos, over-analyzers, low-self-esteemers, etc., all in the contrasted light of how men think (sometimes) differently than women and vice versa. Hilarious. Brilliantly plotted. Smartly scripted. Delightfully acted. Each episode from season two onward is a surprise and a delight."},{"rating":"2","title":"Coupling","review":"This comedy series from the UK is HILARIOUS!

Highly recommended!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Seasons 1-3 AWESOME, Season 4 SO-SO","review":"Seasons 1-3 of this comedy are an amazing example of ensemble work and the writing was FAR cleverer than that of \\"Friends\\" to which it is so often likened. The 4th Season became flat after the loss of Jeff (Richard Coyle) who went on to pursue other things. The replacement character of Oliver was not well-suited to the ensemble, and one got the idea that some of the other actors were ready to move on as well. But the collection as a whole is well-worth the money spent! My husband and I watch it together and HOWL!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Coupling one of the funniest comedies ever!!!!","review":"This show is a pure laugh out loud great time.

I thought that's perfect size to fit all my travel stuff on top of my carry-on bag. However, when I opened the box, I was surprised to see this little hand bag..

The information on the website is incorrect.Another problem was the color. I ordered \\"true blue\\" but the only thing that was \\"true blue\\" was the gorilla attached to the bag.

I took it on many tours of Europe. For the most part I wore it as a cross shoulder bag. But after a while, especially if you keep lots of stuff in your purse to weigh it down, it starts to irritate your neck and shoulders. This is when I convert it to a backpack to relieve the stress. Love, love, love this bag. There is a new version of this bag now. It no longer has the Velcro flap compartment on the front, but a front zip compartment instead. A nice change. I was always weary about what I put in the flap compartment. That was the least secure part of the bag. Looks like they fixed this problem by converting it to a zipper front.Eventually my bag frayed an wore out and I had to throw it out.

The inch and millimeter scales are printed on the sides of the hexagonal bar that slides through the casing.

On my unit, only the scale marked 0, 3, 6, 9... millimeters was correctly zeroed. The marking for 1mm on the adjacent face of the bar (1, 4, 7...) corresponds to an actual 2mm measurement. The 2mm mark corresponds to a 3.5mm measurement -- 2 is more than 3! The scales for 32nds of an inch are similarly misaligned and non-zeroed. In fact, on my unit, a perfectly bald tire would have a groove depth of negative (a protruding groove of) 1/32 inch!

But; that is the only time I use this saw, and have had to buy a real (Bosch) jigsaw for every other kind of cut. The orbital mechanism is a hokey little spring that fell apart in under an hour of use. The base plate is ridiculously weak and ineffective. Don't think you're going to make a square cut with this saw; the base plate hopelessly wiggles, and there is no blade support what so ever. Also; the trigger is too big, when you go to pick up this saw your fingers turn it on because the trigger is for three fingers, not one. For the occassional scroll cut it is somewhat usefull, but for anything else it is hopelessly useless!"},{"rating":"1","title":"trash","review":"Good luck making a straight cut, this thing has too much blade wiggle.

I'm assuming this is the issue again, but I've decided that this is not worth my time and have decided to buy a different manufacture's saw.

I'm Catholic and I can't understand why other Christians would have a problem with their children learning to respect God's creations. I'll admit the animation had its problems and the songs could be a little hit or miss but overall this was a great movie with a good story and good morals. Oh and one last note, the parents who complained about Balto's daughter's attitude should really have finished the movie to see how the young girl grew"},{"rating":"1","title":"Balto II, ok for little kids","review":"Balto II: Wolf QuestThe good: Songs are well composed. Mild story plot that will fit the minds of little ones.The bad: Cheesy animation (the movments are sometimes awkward and jerky. The some computer animation do not blend well with the hand-drawn). Very weak story and plot. Awful conclusion that will leave you \\"That's it?!\\" and \\"Why did that happen?\\".Balto II Wolf Quest is a movie that only children 3-9 will love. I don't see it as a very good movie unlike the first one, Balto. If you want something for the kids, this is an ok pick. But I don't recommend it for older audiances."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pathetic!","review":"I really liked the original Balto but, this shouldn't even be called Balto. It is mostly about his \\"Precious\\" daughter Aleu.Right, this film is dumb because this old wolf says to balto \\"You are not a wolf it is your daughter who is.\\" Eh? How? If balto is a half wolf Jenna is a husky how can Aleu be a wolf? She would only be a quarter of awolf if you think about it.This film has nothing to do with the first movie. You could'nt call it a sequel. Aleu is bratty and thick. \\"Hey maybe that guy who's gonna blow my head off wants to adopt me\\" Oh yeah!Also just cos a puppy howls a lot does NOT mean its a wolf. loads of dogs do that.Its so stupid with all these dodgy spirits flying around and Steele in his wolf form.Pitiful!!In fact its soooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo pathetic actually very funny!!But, really it is Insulting a hero to the animal world."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointing sequel","review":"The original Balto was a great film and is very worth seeing - a great story making for a superb family film. The sequel is anything but worth the time or money. Poor animation is the least of the trouble. It is silly propoganda of the worst sort. Even for one who cares about the earth and her inhabitants - this film is pitifully manipulative, poorly written, and an insult to its prequel. Skip it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Um yeah....no.","review":"Why do these companies insist on copying Disney's stupid idea to make OVA sequals to all of their best(and worst) movies. The original Balto was a great and wonderful feature that told a true story and held its self well enough on its own. What I don't understand is why they felt they had to tarnish the film's reputation with cheesy animation, bad voice acting, rediculous diologue, and bad musical numbers. That's right, Universal went and added one song sequence after another with this mess of a film. If you like cheaply made sequels to great films then you'll enjoy this one. But if you want to see a better movie, watch anything else."},{"rating":"2","title":"Balto 2 Wolf Quest is a very touching movie","review":"Balto 2 Wolf Quest is a great and touching movie for any parent and child.It tells about how parents think of there children, and helps explain why it is so hard to let them go.Balto explaines to Aleu why no human want's to adopt her and she gets upset and runs away from home not knowing that Balto and herself are supposed to concur a quest to help Aleu find out WHO she is.It is a very touching story that is well thought out and the music is just as good as the movie.I strongly recommend this movie to any parients and animated movie lovers alike it is just as good as the first BALTO."},{"rating":"2","title":"Balto 2: Wolf Quest DVD & VHS","review":"Well, if you have seen the first Balto this is just as good! Different voice actors so it's' hard to get used to that but otherwise the movie is 100% GREAT! It has some VERY cute scenes that are very different from the first, including a singing rat, a more magical/native approach and, different animals. The puppies are also VERY cute and like the first one it was very well animated and they captured the movement of the animals very well. I HIGHLY reccomend this movie to kids and adults that are fans of dogs, animals and animation. Way to go Balto on a second wounderful film!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Stopped watching...","review":"I rented this movie from the video store after my 4 year old son saw the original Balto movie and we enjoyed it. But this movie was awful. Balto kept having frightening, creepy dreams throughout the movie (my son doesn't scare easily, but he was scared), Aleu (Balto's daughter) was awful to her parents, but the spiritism/animism was too much and we just turned it off. I won't let this kind of trash influence my child's beliefs.NOT recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"I mean common.","review":"Okay, this movie dumbstrucked me. We don't want our children learning alue's personality traits, such as screaming and yelling at her father and telling him 'I hate you' and running away. Oh, and religon lies with the parents telling them whats what. We dont need this alaskan totem who-ha. Mother sun sister moon brother wind. Stupid,Stupid STUPID! The ghost thing and the nightmares scared my daughter. She was so afraid she had to have me sit in the room til' she fell asleep. This movie is pure trash. No one adopts alue cause she 'looks' like a wolf. How realistic is a red husky anyway? lets have alue be the leader of a pack of wolves so she can lead the to a hunter and get them all killed thinking the man would adopt her. I advise you to keep away from this movie, and your children, unless you want to watch them to sleep, from being so afraid."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for young children","review":"Considering that the real Balto lived out his days in Cleveland, Ohio, this story has nothing to do with the first movie. The use of David Carradine for the old mystical wolf was appropriate because the story reminded me of a bad episode of \\"Kung Fu\\" from the 1970s. The story defies logic and is full of mystical nonsense and scarry sequences that scared my four-year old son.Skip this one and rent Balto III instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"A-loo","review":"One word..This film is holy carp!What happened, a fantastic film ruined by a cheesy off topic, money making pile of poo!! How? The animation is CARP, the music is CARP etc. It is a cheaply made copy of tlk2. Disapearing animals, magical spirits, and a theatre (or something) inside a cave! The plot is weird ok.. If a husky and a half wolf have puppies how can there daughtter be a wolf? Precisley! She can't, also if a mutt howls, how does that make her a wolf? She looks like her father,and everyone would want to adopt a daughter of a hero! She looks like a husky anywho. ( who has ever seen a red husky?)Overall its pretty rubbish. Oh yeah when \\"a-loo\\" becomes leader of the wolf pack she'll probably get them all shot by hunters as she thinks they might \\"wanna adopt her!\\"Rent it 1st for your money's sake!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A sell out of the Balto name","review":"I watched this movie with my son, hoping it would be like the Balto story that he is reading in school and boy was I shocked. This movie is terrible, with the child dog acting with tremendous disrespect to her father and some really unnecessary \\"scary\\" scenes that add no value to the movie and only serve to drag on this terrible film. It pained me not to just turn it off and see it through to the end. And if you are a Christian, forget this movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Lesson in Earth Worship","review":"If you want to get your children catechised in Earth Worship using characters from a prequel, this is the movie for you. Rather than enjoying a movie with a sensible theme (adolescent daughter rebelling against her father...though that is hardly sensible), you are given a lesson in Earth worship with praises to 'Father, Son and Sister Moon'. We fast-forwarded through half of this crock.Please, let the parents instruct their children in religion.

Background animation: good. Character animation: TERRIBLE! I didn't even know it was Balto at the beginning, and they made Aniu look horrible compared to the Aniu in the original. The skies are real-the animators where too cheap to make an effort to paint skies. The replacement voices: WAY OFF! And Balto 2 was a musical! Balto wasn't! And the movie has bloopers on every frame. One more thing, the story was unrealistic! The only good that comes out of the movie is the puppies and Nava. Nava was awesome. the pups: Aleu, Saba, Ruby, Kodi, Dingo, and Yukon, were cute. Oh, and the soundtrack was beautiful."},{"rating":"1","title":"A real disappointment compared with the first Balto movie","review":"My daughter adores the first Balto movie, and I'll admit that I never tire of it either; in my opinion, it's one of the best children's animated films around. If you feel the same way, you'll probably be disappointed with Balto II: Wolf Quest. The animation is different and not quite as good, and the voices are different, and even the characters are depicted with less finesse, so none of the characters look, act, or sound quite \\"right\\", compared with the first movie. Even the premise of the movie seems inconsistent with the first movie; Balto is portrayed as a self-loathing outcast, whereas one of the strengths of the first movie is the subtle, natural way it shows Balto coming to accept the positive aspects of being half wolf. Balto II lays out its morals with a much heavier hand, as well; you can practically hear the clunking of the plot as it unfolds. I don't think I'd even recommend renting this video, let alone buying it."},{"rating":"1","title":"poor excuse for a sequel","review":"I had high hopes for this sequel which is why I actually bought a 2 disc set which included both the first film and this sequel. In a way I am glad I got them both, now I can warn others to stay away from the sequel and stick with the original. The first Balto was great...great and simple story...my 2 year old loved it from beginning to end.The sequel; however, had too much humanism and naturalism themes in it that I as a Christian parent do not want my daughter to be exposed to at this early stage...and fortunately, half way through she was totally bored with it and begged to see the 1st Balto. There are also many frightening elements in the movie that does not make it a good movie for little kids, I'm talking about spirits that appear as real animals than whoosh disappear into thin air...overall even as an adult, I thought the movie was very boring and this is coming from someone who loves cartoons!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The absolute pits","review":"This movie was not as good as the first. most of the time, it got boring and bland. All the action scenes were pushed together and left the last part of the movie seem lame in comparision. I like it when the problems aren't solved quickly. Every situation was just nothing compared to the first movie's action. By the time the movie ended, I was getting sick of all the music they played in the background. It was supposed to be at least part action, but the music totally ruined it.

The cord is quite long 10ft or so and has a funny plug that sits at a 45 degree angle. At least it isn't a massive power block. There is a master power switch on the side.

Things don't get fixed up right away, healing takes time, and the ending, not to give it away, but you leave satisfied. Overall, the book was written very well, and is a great representation of the post-apartheid era in South Africa. Well worth the read.

There is a cut out just below the midsection of the top shelf where the TV sits. You cannot put a center channel there. I do not know why they ate that much useable space.

In fact , some of the melody lines for these songs are quite different and can take a few listens to get your head around if, like me, you're a singer and want to sing along.As a drummer, I've found this album to be a great way to practice this style of playing .It also features the great Earl Palmer playing drums and the punchy, riff driven arrangements of Neil Hefti, who did such a fine job on the SINATRA - BASIE album.Any Frank fan who loves the swingers could not go wrong with this album, SINATRA-BASIE or SINATRA AT THE SANDS .Recommended , though on the short side time wise at under 35 minutes."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great computer","review":"I love this PC...The unit isn't cheaply made at all..I love the huge hard drive and the dvd and cd writer drives.

The bad news is that within two weeks, they began to peel up, the clear film beginning to curl, and the sticker underneath turning white. In essence, the only label of the ones that I replaced where there is still a visible letter on it is the \\"V\\" key - the other three are long gone, and this was the case within a few weeks after purchase. Great idea, but zero durability."},{"rating":"2","title":"nice job boys","review":"This album is reminiscent of Pavement but not so much as to be distracting...plus its far better than anything since Wowee Zowee, because it ain't tryin' too hard. It has a surface, simple country-jangle flair at first listening but its really quite dense with background noise and road angst. You never get the feeling that they're trying to be better than the genre they're either immitating (or whatever it is they're doing)...the irony is way way way in the back, where it belongs, and earnestness at the forefront. I bought the CD for the song Smith and Jones Forever (that song alone is worth the bucks) but there are other nice tunes to sing along and scratch your head to. Wow, this is a good album.

And a couple of the tunes are not completely unbearable thanks to decent guitar playing, but I think 2 stars for this CD is more than generous.If you like music that's raw and offhanded and on the improvisational side I strongly recommend checking out Akron/Family. Akron/Family are far better musically than Silver Jews but are not completely dissimilar."},{"rating":"2","title":"Phenomonal Album","review":"This is the ultimate in laid back folk rock. The guitars are powerful but relaxed, the lyrics actually mean something, and the vocals are hollow and bold. \\"Now you know my two middle names are wrong and right\\" is to this day my favorite song lyric. And there is plenty more included. Listening to this album is like eating a warm turkey sandwich at five in the morning on a winter day. It is filling, wildly impressive, and truly one of the best albums I own. Plus, you really can't beat a name like Silver Jews.

Initially sounding half Austrailian and half South of the border, it evolves into something from the South Bronx or an early version of his \\"Insider\\" character- Jeffrey Wigand.

Sadly, there wasn't, nor was there a reason to make this movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Get a thesaurus...","review":"...now look up awful. There are not words to describe this crime against cinema.

Look into your hearts, filmmakers...Why do you even bother?"},{"rating":"1","title":"What a waste of film!","review":"If I could give this video zero stars I would. The one star goes to Russell Crowe at least he tried to make this film believable. I had one problem with Mr. Crowe's performance he couldn't get the accent straight was it a New Yorker accent? I felt he was just falling into his own natural Australian accent. I would think at least he would provide a better performance; not what I was looking for, especially after his brillant turn as Bud White in LA Confidental. Selma Hayek was just scenery. The characters in this film did nothing to endear themselves to me. I rented this film and luckily I had a free rental coupon. Don't waste your money on this! Moral of this story: rent LA Confidental."},{"rating":"1","title":"Crud Galore","review":"Whoever counselled Russell Crowe to take on this role needs to be shot and Crowe needs to rethink keeping that person on staff.Crowe is so much better than this cheesy material. Thank God in the past few years he has been getting much more juicier and respectable roles offered to him that showcase his immense talent.As for Salma Hayek, never liked her and possibly never will. She was much too annoying for my taste and I never did get any sense of natural chemistry between her and Crowe. Perhaps they both knew what crud it was and did it only for the paycheck, not caring about even attempting to make it believeable.The actual premise could have been interesting but all the powers-that-be created was a very forgettable waste of good film."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointment","review":"Well I should have known...any movie with Salma Hayek usually I have not liked. I wanted to add this movie to my Russell Crowe collection and it was a mistake. I didn't think he could make a bad movie, but, this is it. He was fine in it...although I miss his Australian accent,but, the movie itself is just plain terrible. It was a waste of time to watch and I would give anything if I had not wasted my money too,but, we learn from our mistakes. This entire movie consist of these two people fighting, making love, fighting, making love, making up and then starting back over again only to finally figure out, HELLO, that it isn't going to work between them.

I so wanted to reach out and shake some sense into both, demanding they grow up. There's only one scene where I felt the characters became real, and that's when they decide to get married and as a lark are interviewing people on the street about love/marriage/relationships. It's as if the actors finally relax and are being themselves. Otherwise, turn down the sound and simply enjoy looking at two beautiful people. Make up your own dialogue. It'll probably be more interesting than what's actually being said."},{"rating":"1","title":"ICK!!!!","review":"This movie was just awful. It was an attempt at an artsy kind of film, almost with an independent look, but it didn't even cut it as that. Aside from that, they just kept separating and getting back together too often and too quickly to be funny; it was only annoying. I like Russ Crowe, he was superb in LA CONFIDENTIAL, and even good in THE QUICK AND THE DEAD, but this movie just didn't make sense at all. To close, don't buy this movie; rent it, and only if you MUST see it."},{"rating":"1","title":"For Russell Crowe fans","review":"Honestly, I watched this movie for Russell Crowe. If that's why you're here, rent the movie and watch the first ten minutes. After he's finished licking Salma Hayek's toes, hit rewind, then play. Repeat a dozen times, then return the movie. The story is sour and depressing, and follows a doomed relationship. There are enough doomed relationships in the real world that I can't find a fictional one entertaining. On the plus side, Russell does a nice subtle New York accent."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ummm...not Russ' best work","review":"I must say that I was truly dissapointed after watching this film. It almost made my cry to think Russell Crowe would even consider making this movie. He was excellent in it, but the story was not very good.

I wouldn't recommend this movie to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Stinker!","review":"I love Russell Crowe as an actor, but even he couldn't save this stinker of a movie.

Avoid this one, folks!"},{"rating":"1","title":"what a pity!","review":"What a waste of money, time and talents...

I think she can, but honestly, we have yet to see it, and if she keeps making nonsensical movies where all she does is flaunt her bod, it ain't gonna happen. I mean Russell, who can do so much better than this drivel. And I mean me, who wasted 99 cents on the rental fee."},{"rating":"1","title":"Salma gives good body","review":"A pleasant film if you like to ogle Salma Hayek's bod.

After YOU pay for shipping it back with a return authorization number and a copy of a repair estimate from a service center they authorize, they evaluate your claim and determine if they will replace it. They are liars that obviously don't stand by their equipment!We tried to return it to Radioshack and the guy wouldn't take it back - said he'd had multiple issues with them.Monster seems to be a marketing savvy business that overcharges for lawyer-inspired drivel that they never intended to back up.

I can't notice any difference in my picture quality. I figure it can't hurt and can only help.I do like the ergonomic features. Certainly color coding and labeling of which plug is for what piece of equipment is great! No more searching for the right plug.

It arrived without incident, I hooked it up and so far so good. It basically a power strip with labels that also happens to be purple... for the \\"neato\\" effect I guess. Anyways, no idea if its worth more than your run of the mill surge protector.

Jance sticks to her winning formula!","review":"This series keeps the ingredients that made it a winner from the start: a divorced detective that has lots of money and loves McNaughton's, a partner that only eats healthy food and lives with his two kids, a lawyer that was \\"inherited\\" together with the money and an obnoxious reporter that hates the detective's guts due to past rivalries. This mix makes the Beaumont series a highly enjoyable one. You can read each of these books in a few hours non-stop and be eager for more!If you are not interested in reading the whole series you can still read this book alone, sine there is enough background information in it to fully enjoy it. Nevertheless, I would not recommend reading Injustice For All (if you are planning to read this one too) after Trial By Fury since the latter has information about the ending of the former.It is hard to say which series is better, J.P.

Buy one from a company that will exchange a defective unit for you.Battery life is horrible. Garmin says 10 days at 30 minutes a day, backlight off. Very funny. Can't read it with backlight off. Seems like battery life is about an hour, regardless of whether GPS is on or not. And it's rather sleazy for Garmin not to give a realistic spec on this important issue.Bottom line: I love it. But I have a nagging suspicion that in six months, Garmin will be forced to come out with a unit with a decent battery."},{"rating":"1","title":"Spontaneous Hard Resets","review":"I bought a Garmin iQue from Amazon a few weeks back. All seemed wonderful. I discovered however that the unit would do a spontaneous hard rest in my pocket. After losing all my data multiple times, I called Garmin. They had me send the unit back to them. I had to pay shipping costs.The new unit, to a lesser extent suffered the same problem. In addition, the new unit would not turn off the GPS system. When the antenna is down, GPS tracking is supposed to go off. Not on this unit though. And GPS tracing sucks up battery juice.I called Garmin again, and again I was told I had bad hardware and to ship the unit back.Enough, was enough. I returned the unit to Amazon.Amazon was wonderful. Garmin's product was abysmal."},{"rating":"1","title":"Frustrated customer","review":"STAY FAR AWAY from the product! Purchased first one and had to return because of a defective sd card reader. Recieved second one and have been unable to download maps by syncing with computer. Loaded maps via sd card slot on computer instead. Recently lost voice prompts and pda will no longer sync with calendar - lost connection. Garmin tech support has been unresponsive - cricket, cricket. I am seeking to return for refund and will purchase different brand than Garmin."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"The alarm clock on the date application does not work.The gps receiver is too weak. It takes too long to lock in to satellites. I took a three-mile trip on busy streets testing the system. I got home before the iQue locked in on my position.The map data is out of date. I have used other mapping software for 3 years and am almost always able to find an address. The addresses I found 3 years ago aren't available on the software included with the iQue 3600The battery life is in adequate. Based on my experience, it only last for 30 minutes using the GPS.The interface is too complex.The ique won't pull out of the cradle without making a disturbing click. It won't life straight up or out. The only way to get it out is to lean it forward then pull."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor user interface!","review":"I can't believe so many people love this product. I love electronic gismos and rarely need to use instructions to figure how to work things. It took me for ever to figure out and too load maps. Once I got it working, it worked ok, but not great. Besides being hard to set up, it had three major problems.1) Poor user interface. Hard to figure out how to use. Can't use while driving.2) Short battery life. I many times lost important data because battery ran out too quickly.3)SD card slot doesn't hold card well. I loaded east and west coast maps into device. Went on vacation. When I came home, I used it as GPS and wondered why no detailed maps where there. My card fell out without my knowledge."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointment","review":"I also just got this unit and was unable to install the maps. Finally got through to Garmin tech support and they told me the cd's were corrupted and I'd get replacements end of next week. To add insult to injury, Amazon dropped the price since I ordered it 9 days ago."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's not reliable and crashes too frequently","review":"I've had my unit about 3 weeks - when it works, it's great - but it crashes almost daily and I'm sending it back tomorrow to Amazon.com. Also, when it crashes - you lose everything. I have a back-up on my computer, so I can reload everything again, but it's a big hassle. It really let me down this week when I was travelling back through Oregon and it just died. The developers need to go back to the drawing board. It has the making of an awesome piece of equipment, it's just not reliable and has too many problems."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible PDA - Okay GPS","review":"If you have Outlook 2000 or later, do NOT purchase this. It is NOT compatible at this time. It will NOT download/sync correctly. Only have 32 MB - 28 leftover for storage. Lots of problems with this model. Skip it. Wait until Garmin get their acts together. Horrible return/support policy. You pay top dollars and still get a horrible PDA. Don't know where those expert reviews get their units. Recommendation for a PDA/GPS PDA? Get a Pocket PC Phone Edition (next generation is due out) and then get the Bluetooth GPS unit with it. You not only get a GPS enabled (wireless - bluetooth/802.11b) PDA but also the phone. More importantly, with Pharos, you will get REAL TIME traffic information based on your current location (if you are in the 16th largest SMSA's). If you can't wait for the second generation due out soon, get the ATT pocket pc for $99 and get the wired GPS accessory for $200. You STILL get a better product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Poor Quality","review":"The unit worked as it should. But the quality is very bad. After I left the unit sitting around for a month or so, the GPS' battery discharge by itself. In order to get it running again, I have to recharge it and then reboot the device with a pin. I had to reboot the unit a few times already. After using the GPS for a few times, the voice is not functioning; no voice guidance. Then the backlit for the screen malfunctioned. The screen cannot be seen without the backlit. Amazingly, the backlit came back to life after a few months of rest. As of now, the voice is still mute.The sync. with the computer does not work either. I have only a few cities stored on my SD card. I cannot use the unit outside those cities where they are not downloaded to the SD card. Each map software has its unique unlock code. Even though you can get somebody to copy the map data onto a SD card for you, you won't be able to use it.If you don't want any headache, do not buy this GPS. It is nothing but trouble."},{"rating":"1","title":"Served me well until...","review":"I've had my Ique (aka Betty) for several years. It's helped me to go across the US several times, and then some. It has its quirks, and frequent crashes, etc - it's definitely not a turn-it-on-and-forget-it gadget. However, like the previous reviewer said, their software is not Vista-compatible - meaning, you can't sync your data (incl. map source) with your PC, rendering it useless unless you stick with XP! As far as I know, neither Palm nor Garmin plans to make the Palm Desktop Vista compatible anytime soon - which probably signals the end of the wonderful Palm OS... :("},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than expected","review":"For biz travel, I quickly became addicted to the convenience and efficiency of the NeverLost system. The iQue is sleeker, more precise and user friendly. Our family was so impressed, we immediately bought stock in the company. If Garmin wins the contract(s) to factory equip major auto mfg's... look out.Per other reviews, the auto kit and minimum 256K card are essential. The manual is sparse (and conflicts with the CD and online guides.) The product itself is better than advertised. Practicals- not just geeks, will enjoy and use frequently."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Well Designed -- Easy to Use right out of the box","review":"Bought myself an iQue for my birthday -- cheaper than buying a new car to get the nav unit that I coveted. The unit is very nicely designed, with excellent printed and online documentation. The setup was a breeze. (The only hitch was doing the initial satellite acquisition -- you really need to give it a hint about your current location). After reading the document for 30 minutes, I was in business. The unit works great. Satellite acquisition takes 1/2 a minute at most. The integration with the other palm applications (address book) is nicely done. I highly recommend this unit."},{"rating":"1","title":"They have design problems","review":"I am going on my third pda in the last 3 months. Can't keep the gps operational. They know they have hardware problems in this area. On the up side, the palm side seems to be fine and they have good customer service."},{"rating":"1","title":"Difficult to use","review":"I purchased this item for my husband for Christmas. He already had a palm and is quite computer literate. Neither one of us has been able to figure out how to use the navigation system. I tried to call Garmin for some assistance but gave up after being on hold for 45 min. I'm sure this is a great product once you've mastered it but it has been a very frustrating experience for us."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not ready for market","review":"I spent 4 or 5 full days trying to set this up for my father in law. First of all, there were no detailed instructions for the unit. You had to go to the website to download them. We had to call Garmin many times during the setup, and a few times were told contradictory information from the instructions. This is not an easy piece of electronics. Not recommended for anyone who doesn't want to devote a heck of a lot of time to it. We never really got it up and running."},{"rating":"1","title":"Condition of Garmin","review":"It is difficult to give this product a good rating because it has not worked properly since we received it.

When I brought this to the attention of Garmin, they admitted the bads performance, and suggest loading a new updated driver, which I did. Still no improvement. I would hate to be lost in the woods and have to depend on the GPS to help me.Do not buy this product unless they imporve the batteries"},{"rating":"1","title":"Lousy software, lousy support! A BIG ZERO","review":"This unit, while attractive, is relatively useless without the included Windows software, which allows you to download the 'detailed maps'.Unfortunately, Garmin seems to have taken a demonstration build from whoever they OEM the unit from, and horribly break it. My brother, who I bought this for, has 25 years of professional software engineering experience. After wasting over four hours trying to install the maps, with the installer crashing over and over, he contacted Garmin support via email.Garmin support told him to WAIT FOR THE CD TO STOP SPINNING BEFORE INSERTING THE NEXT ONE. GIVE ME A BREAK! There's no way the lousy software they ship with the iQue works for ANY of their customers.I am so angry at, and dissapointed with, Garmin. Thanks for ruining my brother's Christmas. Beyond a doubt this is the last product from Garmin that he or I will ever consider purchasing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Product - Ignore Most Negative Reviews","review":"I did a lot of research before buying this unit and I was still a little nervous, given some negative reviews here and elsewhere. I believe the negative reviews were almost all created BEFORE the second release of the software, as this is really a great unit.It was very difficult to get the unit to synch to Outlook and also continue using my Treo for everyday (non-travel) PDA functionality. The tech help was great at Garmin, though, and I should have called them much sooner...you should too if you run into a problem of any kind. Definitely buy Chapura's Pocket Mirror if you are planning on synching with Outlook and using the Garmin plus another device.This thing is BETTER than NeverLost and will cost you way less if you need it more than a few days a year (there are much higher value car rental companies than Hertz, who often doesn't have the NeverLost you were hoping to get anyway).I highly recommend this great product."},{"rating":"1","title":"IQue Palm Series Garmin PDA/GPS won't run on Vista","review":"WARNUNG! The IQue Palm Series Garmin PDA/GPS handheld systems will no longer be able to run through Microsoft PC based platforms.

Garnmin has no plans to port their Palm Desktop drivers, and sync software to Vista."},{"rating":"2","title":"Garmin iQue 3600 PDA","review":"The Garmin iQue 3600 PDA is an excellent product. It takes a little time to learn the function of the device. Once you learn it, then its a cake walk.Pro: 1. Expandable slot for additional memory. I recommend the 1 GB. It can load 3/4 of the U.S. on it.2. The device is compact and easy to travel with it. Make sure you take the car travel kit w/u.3. It have all the function of a PDA and more.Con: 1. Battery life is too short when using the GPS. The battery cannot be change or purchase additional battery, because the battery is build in. You have to mail the device back to Garmin for replacement.2. When the GPS is turn on in a new location. It take a couple of minutes to locate satalite.3. It does not always give the shortest route. But it give the most common route.It is worth the $$$$. Happy Travel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Tempermental, But When It Works, 5 Stars","review":"iQue = PDA + GPS, which is a versatile, capable tool... when it is working. I have found the PDA/GPS combination to be fantastic. Garmin's approach to the iQue 3600's extreme sensitivity to static electricity, however, has been very poor. I have gone through 4 units since receiving this device as a gift. Exchanges with Garmin have been no-questions-asked, but it is a hassle, and I end up paying shipping one way each time, plus there is the hassle of re-installing via Garmin's draconian serial number system.Overall, I like this product, but if there is any chance that your unit may face one elctron of static electricity, consider carefully before buying this item."},{"rating":"2","title":"AWSOME","review":"This thing is awsome.

I tried to unlock the MapSource CD and each time the program crashed. I tried to install at a different computer and the problem was the same. I emailed Garmin and they sent me an auto reply with useless advice and wasted 4 hours of my time to uninstall and reinstall their product. I inquired again but they didn't respond. I guess they don??t have a solution to the problem either. They even sent me a dead link to their own web site, so much about knowledge staff. I am sending this product back. Minus 5 stars.I am a senior software engineer and I couldn't get the Garmin map software to work! I hope other people have better luck.Update: Don't bother to email Garmin.

I only use this in my car and in the office so it's always connected. At least twice a week the unit has to be reset while I'm out of the office. It loses all of the info on the unit - especially irritating is the info I've entered since the last hot-sync. Several times in the middle of navigating to a destination it has gone kablooey.I've already sent the original back. The next one I received was refurbished; another persons voice was on the unit!! This is the third one and it stinks. Wonderful idea, but absolutely unreliable. Don't waste your money.

Finally a device that integrated both GPS and Palm applications. Right out of the box I encountered several problems with the unit. It would continuously hard reset itself. I sent an email to Garmin and never received a response. After doing a little research on the web I discovered this is a common problem with this device. I uploaded the new software as recommended and now the unit can not acquire a satellite signal.

Even with the updated OS, it crashes unpredictably. Took it on a trip from SF to Oregon (multiple destinations), and it worked very well. Tried to route to Tucson, AZ for my next trip, and nothing but calculation errors.On a short hop inside CA, it got me to the destination just fine. Coming back, it crashed, loosing all data.The documentation is one of the big weak spots. Looks like they wrote the documentation for a similar design, but not the same product. Makes a lot of assumptions and sometimes takes you through a process that does not describe the options the same way they appear on the system. Support also sucks. I was having problems with the IR port, and the docs say to read a separate document on the CD. The document isn't there. I contacted Technical Support, and they said to read the Help. The Help says read the document. When I told TS about this, I was told to post a message on the newsgroup. Ugly!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Outstanding","review":"Ignore the reviews that talk about hard resets and poor reliability. Garmin released Version 2 of the firmware and all that has been fixed. This is an awesome product that I would recommend to anybody. The screen is gorgeous, the integration between PDA and GPS is first rate and the map detail is extensive.

Maybe they will correct the initial flaws."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice Idea, When it Works","review":"When it actually picks up a satelite or two or three, it works like a charm. The problem is finding the satelites. I can understand problems downtown, but not on the open highway.

When it doesn't connect, which is often, it does survive being thrown around the car."},{"rating":"1","title":"*** STOP, DON\\"T BUY***","review":"I have owned the Garmin Ique 3600 for over 4 years. I love it. As stated in one of the other reviews of this product it was the first Palm/GPS unit. Since then many other units have come out that are cheaper better. It is a great unit however it will not work with windows vista and even though you may not have vista now you will most likely end up using it in the future. This unit is discontinued because the newer products are just better. You are much better off just buying a regular palm and the garmin mobile 10. The price of the two of them combined are still cheaper then the 3600. Buy the way garmin's customer service is one of the best I have ever seen. In the 4 years I have owned this unit I sent it in about 8 times for repair (mostly all my fault washing machine exc.) and they replaced the unit all 8 times free of charge.

As with all great Jazz players Redman's live performance was better than the studio bound performance on this CD.Here he plays a mixture of acknowledged Jazz standards like 'Summertime' and some contemporary 'pop' standards such as Lennon & McCartneys 'Eleanor Rigby' and Stevie Wonder's 'Visions'. Listening to these tracks you can hear clear influences. On 'Summertime' at times you could swear you were listening to Coltrane!The band are very very good.

I also had two Isobar units plugged in to this line and they are fine, registering no issue. Seems that the HT800 is no better than the HT700 was, which is to say the units are garbage.

Fill out 3 pages, draw out a diagram, send all your equipment to certified manufacturer repair shop, wait for all the quotes, send them to monster, and then wait 4 weeks for a response.

I think it's clean power worked... the other one(I bought two) is installed, but tv works as good as before....It was a great product and price... would recommend it to put all your high tech products in a safe powerstrip... small investment vs a destroyed home theatre equipment.... (explain why you did not do it to your wife after it is destroyed??? - get this now.. you will not be sorry!)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Decent product","review":"I've purchased a couple of these for a couple of home theaters and haven't had a problem yet. I'm not sure about the claim process noted by the other reviewer, but so far they seem to work fine. (Probably because my house hasn't experienced a major power surge yet) Do not buy this at Best Buy as they charge retail prices. It is much cheaper on Amazon.The systems I have purchased these for have not been high end setups. If you ARE considering this for a multi-thousand dollar home theatre/audio setup, I would HIGHLY suggest that you buy something nicer. Why not spend the 200-300 dollars (if you insist on Monster... http://www.amazon.com/Monster-Reference-MKII-PowerCenter-Circuitry/dp/B000AYDQB6/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&s;=electronics&qid;=1222280005&sr;=1-1 ) that will protect the thousands you spent on your HT?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic Item for the price","review":"My son paid much more for this elsewhere and I found this identical one for our use and am very pleased with the overall Power Center. The number of outlets are more than adequate and would recommend this to anyone who needs this protection."},{"rating":"1","title":"Won't turn off, switch broke","review":"Have had this power strip for 22 months. We were going on an extended vacation so I went to turn the rocker switch off and it would not move. By turning the switch off it kills the power to all connected devices. I pushed very hard on the switch and now it moves but doesn't do anything, power on all the time. I can not recommend this as the parts used must be very cheap. A simple seldom used rocker switch should last more than 22 months."},{"rating":"2","title":"Decent Surge Protector","review":"I have no horror stories about lightning strikes or major power surges to tell. This does the job that I need, but do not think it has been truly tested. I have 3 of these for various setups. There was a TV that would occasionaly just have sound no picture. Replacing the surge protector with the monster model seems to have elimated the problem. When they are reasonably priced (as opposed to most Monster pricing) I believe they are a good deal. I hope I never have to find out how good they really are or take advantage of the Monster protection plan."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Surge Protector","review":"Room for large (charging type) plugs also. Company guarantees all of your plugged in equipment for full replacement should it fail."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works great, but expensive","review":"Haven't really noticed a big difference in picture or sound quality since I started to us this surge protector. Might have cleared the signal coming from the cable box a little. Mostly bought in fear of a power spike killing my home theater equipment."},{"rating":"2","title":"Have more than 1","review":"Monster is a dependable product. I have 1 at home already and needed another one. All our electronics are on Monster Surge Protectors. Wouldnt have it any other way."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good product","review":"So far so good. Have not had any lightning strikes to prove the quality or protection. But it seems like a quality product, especially at the price it was purchased here on Amazon (1/4 the price it is sold at my local Best Buy). Recommend the seller for quick shipping."},{"rating":"2","title":"good price, good product","review":"I did my research, and this model power surge protector had exactly the features I wanted, and none of the extras I would never use.Do your research, figure out what you are plugging into a surge protector, and then buy the one that suits your needs.I saved about $40 buying this item online here at amazon. The surge protector was brand new in the packaging and has worked great ! no problems."},{"rating":"2","title":"great science book","review":"This book is all about endangered and extinct animals. We learn what the difference between them are. We also learn a lot about extinct animal species of the world. The author explains that there are many species that are in danger of becoming extinct today. She tell us things that we can do to make the earth a better place for both people and animals.The book had colorful double-page spreads with neat photos. Also it included informative captions and fact panels.The illustrated glossary and index were helpful when looking for certain facts and animals.I would recommend this book to kids who are interested in animal facts. Especially kids who want to learn more about animals that are no longer on the earth."},{"rating":"1","title":"annapolis goes crazy over this insane story","review":"Dateline Annapolis 2005:City dock is abuzz over this tale by David Mercy. The worlds' capitol for sailing has had several bookstores feature this book in storefront displays. It is a simple tale and the narrator moves seemlessly from a simple folksy style a la Hemingway to breathless descriptives evoking Wilbur Smith comparisons. It seems like a tall tale yet if you can find the documentary from Norway TV One you understand the book is understated. It is highly recommended and is a fast read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poorly writen - don't waste your time","review":"I own all of both SG1 and Atlantis novels and am an avid Sci Fi reader. I have found that anything with Sonny Whitelaw will be tons of extranious description and very poor character and plot development. If you want to read some great Stargate books try the ones by James Swallow or Salley Malcom."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing character development","review":"Still an enjoyable read for Stargate Atlantis diehards but characterizations didn't ring true, especially Dr McKay's portrayal. In the tv series, he is eccentric and sometimes clueless, but not repeatedly stupid as was portrayed. The personalities seemed to be contrived so that the plot would work, rather than to be true to their development on the tv series and made the characters seem lacking in depth and intelligence.Interesting plot and plot development; just would be nice to have more accurate character portrayal."},{"rating":"1","title":"2 Thumbs Down!!","review":"This book is a bit too dark for any Stargate story. I love Stargate Atlantis, but some of this story is more like a horror movie. Not only that, but it makes Rodney look stupid and ridiculously short with everyone. In the series, Rodney has an attitude that is right at the boarder of being too annoying (which I think gives him a great charisma), but in this story the author makes it look like he's on the boarder of exploding in literally every conversation."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent read","review":"I thought this book was great. I didn't want to put it down. Who ever said they lost interest while reading this book must get bored easily."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very difficult to learn from","review":"This book was extremely difficult to follow. It fails to teach you the material necessary to solve the problems. The problems fail to develop at a reasonable pace and become fair too difficult much too quickly. The examples don't show enough variety to be of use in solving problems"},{"rating":"1","title":"Fair/Poor","review":"As many other reviewers have noted, this book often trouble for the ME undergrad. Unfortunately, myself and my classmates are trying to teach ourselves the material due to the lack of a decent professor. This book alone will probably be more of a frustration than a source of understanding. With over 800 pages, its way too much to cover in one semester of an undergrad thermo course. Our entire class is floundering, and our professor has had to curve grades heavily to keep the majority of us from failing. So, this might not be the best book for undergraduate students who are trying to actually learn the material. You will spend most of your time guessing what to do, unless you have a good professor."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor","review":"This could be one of the worst text books I've ever had to spend an entire semester with. The chapter reading had little bearing on the problems and the formulas presented were often not enough information to solve them. I don't like complaining about books, but, I spent the vast majority of my time unsuccesfully attempting to solve problems that were not at all like the examples. It is important to learn by doing problems on your own, not copying examples, but this is ridiculous."},{"rating":"2","title":"college level text","review":"This is actually a pretty good book for thermo. While using the book for my undergrad, I'd have to say I did find the course challenging, but I don't think this was the book's fault. (Understanding physically what some terms are, such as entropy, can be difficult in any text.) During my graduate degree, I've found it to be a pretty good reference. I can easily find what I need in it, energy equations, cycles, etc. There is also a lot of examples in this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"help!!!","review":"This book is terrible. I was almost ready to throw it out of my dorm window on several occasions. First off, if you are new to thermodynamics, you will learn practically nothing. Concepts are sort of sprinkled all over the pages, with no coherent development and explanations. The problems are even worse. Most of them have no analogous example, some involve concepts not even presented in the book...assuming they are common knowledge, when in fact that could be the crucial step in solving a problem. In short, you will be lead through a maze and given false directions at every point. As if the authors present student with a challenge and see how well he/she can navigate this mess. Avoid this book at any cost. I haven't seen other ones on the subject, but I know this one is terrible. I'd give it -5 stars if I could."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good plot doesn't always make a good movie","review":"I remember when I was little I saw this flick real late at night and absolutely loved it (although I saw it under the title, \\"Killing Box\\"). Not too long ago I found Grey Knight at the ol' Blockbuster and was sooo excited I rented it (good thing I talked myself out of buying it). While ripe with cameos, (i.e. Billy Bob Thorton, David Arquette, Martin Sheen, etc) this movie was just plain bad. I must have been really easy to please in my youth. Grey Knight, I do have to say, has a great idea for a film but the directors handled it very poorly. With a touch more of plot development, budget, effects, as well as a change of director this could have been an excellent movie. I'd love to see someone remake it because it does really have an interesting story. Overall, I'd watch it again if it was on TV but I wouldn't recommend spending money to rent it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Miserable Movie","review":"If you are looking for something exciting that mixes the Civil War and Zombies then look elsewhere. Horribly filmed. Horribly acted. Just horrible. This movie will leave you feeling like you want ninety minutes of your life back. BE WARNED: STAY AWAY!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"OK item - terrible shipping","review":"I ordered this item as a gift. I very disappointed to find when it arrived that the pieces of the stand had not been wrapped at all for shipping. The long pole pieces were in plastic bags, but all the smaller pieces were unwrapped and rattling around in the box. As a result, a chip was knocked off the pole, and there were gouges from screws elsewhere. The wood & general construction of the stand seems good quality, but as you can imagine, I couldn't give this as a gift to anyone. Very upsetting!"},{"rating":"1","title":"2 Broken Racks in 3 Months","review":"I don't write a lot of reviews but this product deserves one. I bought 2 in June and by September both of them had broken legs. One rack broke when it fell over. There wasn't much pressure on the foot to make it snap. The other rack broke when a heavy leather coat on the peg. Once again, not much pressure needed for the leg to snap off. I've very disappointed in myself for purchasing this product because I read the negative reviews before buying it. This may be the first Amazon purchase that I did not listen to negative reviewers. I'm going to use these broken racks as fire wood this winger. I just ordered 2 new coat racks that are made of a much harder wood (with much better reviews)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cracked","review":"It seemed nice; however there was a crack in the stand so I had to return it. I emailed the company to see if they could just send a replacement since it was annoying to have to disassemble the whole thing and put it back in the box, but they never wrote back. I just returned the whole thing and found a comparable one at Christmas Tree Shop for half the price!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Great until it falls over","review":"Worked great while it lasted.

Broke the first day.","review":"I thought I was going to write a rave review of this item. It was amazingly easy to assemble without any tools needed. Unfortunately, less than a day after I assembled it, and before I hung any coats, the wood in the base cracked and the coat rack was unusable. Amazon is good with returns, but it is still a hassle to take the coat rack apart, pack it up and take it to a UPS Store. I think a metal coat rack would be a better idea."},{"rating":"2","title":"Super easy, piece a cake","review":"This is super easy to set up, no need of instruction, even grandma and a 6 yrs old can do.

I was looking for a simplistic, sturdy item,as well, within my budget piece of furniture that accented the other wood pieces.

All the stuff hooked up to it suddenly cut out, but the light was still on when I looked at the surge protector. I pressed the reset button a couple times to no avail and then just threw it in the garbage. You get what you pay for. If you're looking for something cheap to add a few outlets to a pre-existing wall outlet, this should do it. If you've got sensitive/expensive/anything you care about - spend a little more and get something that's not a cheap POS such as this.It should be noted that this product has NOTHING to do with the more well known \\"Monster Cable\\" company.So.

They both sold for about the same price. The Monster is vastly inferior. The Belkin has three times the Joules rating. The Belkin is much more attractive and well designed. The Monster is just a squarish standard strip that felt very cheap compared to the Belkin and worst of all the Monster had a bad rubber stink and the cord felt gritty. The Belkin had a smooth white power cord. My other mistake was to get the Belkin with the 6 foot cord , I realized a 12 foot cord was available after ordering. You will be MUCH happier with the Belkin. I will post this exact review with the Belkin as well. Last time I gave something 1 star Amazon did not display it.

Their stereo/home theater cables are the best you can buy. So buying a Monster Cable surge protector is a smart choice. It's also reasonably priced (unlike most Monster Cable products) and comes with a great warranty, as described in the product description.

The story takes you though the ups and downs of the day-to-day situation between the men. There is always something going on in each man's life, and life seems to throw many challenges at him. Some of the issues include interracial marriage, unfaithfulness, betrayal of trust, and a wife who is a blabbermouth and a wife who is a murderess.

As the reviewer below said, I do wonder at the inclusion of a few (well one, really) who seem to hold odd agendas concerning the Magdalene, but this is far outweighed by those whose thoughts and opinions are well worth reading.

The characters are annoying and whiny self-absorbed creatures. I could not muster any sympathy for even a single one of them.

But Elizabeth Brundage would do well to work for a basal reader outfit: Annie had a desire for grapes. She put one in her mouth. She thought about her new lover. Annie knew he must be thinking about her. No, that isn't from the novel, but that is the degree to which the author has writing skills. The syntax, on the whole, is very synethic.Then there are the absolutely ridiculous characters who seem straight out of a telenovela. Every character in this novel is one-dimensional.

(It never did.) What did emerge is a sordid, distasteful portrait of what a set of lives may become without a sense of decency. However, that was obviously not the point; rather, the opposite of the author's intention. Attempts to scintilate with the glamorization of bohemian lifestyles, wild adulterous sex, and utter selfishness bombard the reader without mercy. Worst of all, no one in the book learned anything from their awful behavior! The fact that many people who are not crazed religous fanatics sincerely believe that there is a better way to handled unwanted pregnancy than abortion is not even given a sentence of consideration.

It's an editorial!","review":"Okay, this book screams \\"psychological thriller\\" on the OUTSIDE, but once into the chapters, what came screaming loud and clear are Brundage's politics in the form of preposterous caricatures. Just when you think the story might rise above it, her dastardly villains and shining heroes become unintentionally hilarious. I found myself predicting for fun what \\"dark\\" qualities would appear next in her characters of faith, and what shining characteristics she'd bestow on dubious icons. Surprise, our hero is your caring part time abortionist at a women's health clinic. The icing on the cake is she's no stranger to cliched romance and the drug-filled existence of artists. Oh, it's tough to be a doctor's wife."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Book Sure Has A Lot of Words.","review":"At first the book was interesting. Then I found my mind wandering, so I tried again later. I read till the last half, and got so bogged down I decided to speed read the rest. I read the last few pages to see how it ended, and that was that. I didn't like much about this book-- the characters, the way anti-abortionists are portrayed (of course, they are all bad), and I thought the conversation with the 6 year old girl about abortion was totally unnecessary. What 6 year old girl can understand a subject that serious? I just didn't give a flip about any of the characters.

Hmm what's wrong with that picture? He's \\"noble\\" and the whole Catholic hospital community is wrong....so the author would make it seem. Maybe if a doctor feels OK about doing abortions he shouldn't work at a Catholic hospital, but then Brundage would have no book to write.As usual in recent chick lit, ALL the pro-life characters are amoral, psychotics and because of that all the pro-choice characters need not believe God exists. What tripe.The characterizations of \\"the perfect preppy life\\" are sweeter than syrup.Brundage's similies/metaphors are senseless and sometimes even comical.The whole plot is too contrived to be remotely plausible.It oozes the author's unearned satisfacton with her own inadequate work.In short, this is trashy plane trip reading if you absolutely can't sleep and have a free, used copy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Glad I didn't buy it!","review":"A friend gave me this book to read.

None of the characters were likeable, but the thing that made the book the most disjointed for me was reading things like, \\"He turned out of South Pearl Street, onto Delaware Avenue heading toward the expressway\\" or something like that. South Pearl is nowhere near Delaware Avenue. Anyone heard of Googlemap? There were quite a few scenes like that, that brought me up short and took me out of the rhythm of the writing. Something as simple as a map of Albany might have helped."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Worth It","review":"I am glad that I only borrowed this book. Like many readers, I could not sympathize with any of the characters. By the end of the book, the character I hated the least, Simon, was the character that I think the author intended for the reader to despise the most. Annie, the doctor's wife was selfish, the doctor was a dunce, and Lydia was just plain crazy. To be honest, I was hoping that all of the main characters would die at the end of the book, that is how obnoxious I found them. Plus, the author was too strong with her pro-abortion agenda."},{"rating":"1","title":"Semi boring book with political agenda","review":"I, unfortunately, put this book down after the first half. As a policy, I always continue a book to the middle, regardless of whether I am enjoying it or not. I did not enjoy this book. I found it rather boring.

The doctor of the title is an obstetrician in a religiously affiliated hospital who begins preforming abortions at a recently opened neighborhood clinic. The doctor's wife is a journalist and a stay at home mom, who is trying to get back into her career. This novel can be seen as an interesting commentary about the violent \\"pro-life\\" movement in this country. The novel takes many unbelievable twists and turns, as the couple becomes involved in very intimate yet different ways with another local couple--one an artist and professor at a local university and the other, his wife, a deeply disturbed and beautiful woman.The story line is a little convoluted and hard to buy into.

Brundage poorly develops her characters and you are left not caring what happens to a single one of them. And we have every conceivable attention-grabber thrown into the mix - sex, drugs, abortion, religious cults, adultery, suburban boredom - Brundage must have feared that if she didn't throw in something for every taste some readers wouldn't finish her book. The result is so over-the-top that the \\"cataclysmic intersection of...lives\\" described on the back cover becomes an absolute train wreck for the novel as a whole. And the culminating scene in the farmhouse is so anticlimatic and predictable and poorly written, it was like watching a bad for-TV-movie. I live in the locale that is the setting for the book and can't even take satisfaction in that. Sorry, even cutting the author some slack for it being a debut novel, it is a total waste of time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing original","review":"I found not too much original in this book. While there were several themes with intriguing possiblities, (abortion, mental illness) the author never really fleshes them out, but rather depends on cliches and one dimensional portrayals - all anti-abortionists are religious zealots, all sexually abused children turn out to be murderers, etc. The become simply a backdrop for soap-opera or romance novel theatrics.

We bought one of them several years ago, and like it enough to buy a second. It's ability to capture sound is also superior to any other camera in its class (we film a lot of live theatre, and we have perfect sound even from the last row in a non-mic'd show). The only cons are that we've had to have 2 repairs over the last 5 years, and the bottom-loading is inconvenient when using a tripod."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good deal for the money.","review":"This camera is great for a few reasons. First of all, it can deliver some pretty good images for the casual point-and-shoot consumer who wants to shoot some high-quality home videos.It is also very good for someone who likes to have a little more control over the image. The manual focus ring and manual exposure features allow for a more customized picture. Being able to turn off the automatic white balance is also a huge plus here.The higher-end features are where this camera struts its stuff. For instance, this camera offers true 16:9 widescreen mode. It doesn't merely put black bars on the top and bottom of the image, you actually get more real estate on the sides of the picture without losing resolution (a feature not available on much more expensive cameras such as the Sony VX-2100 and the PD-170).I use this camera for producing short films and other video production. When lit properly, you'll be amazed by the quality of video you can get out of this baby."},{"rating":"2","title":"A video camera ahead of the competition","review":"The video quality is great! Plus the steady shot, night shot and VCR features are cool indeed! Still picture quality (at 1-MEGA pixel) is also acceptable.You need to purchase a higher capacity battery because the supplied one may not be sufficient (depends on how you use this camera). I also recommend to purchase a memory stick of at least 32MB because the supplied one (8MB) may not be enough (again, depends in your application).The main drawbacks are: the tape opening located at the bottom and you need to purchase a separate video light."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice Sub-$1000 camera, but not perfect for perfection....","review":"As a newbie video enthusiast, I'm really pleased with the TRV38. For under $1000, you get a great camera with a bunch of features. I just bought mine, so I'm still playing around with it to see what it can do. From what I can tell, the image quality is pretty good indoors, but when you get into lower light levels (like a dim room) the image seems to turn a little on the gray side. Out of the box, the camera feels good in the hand with most of the essentials at your fingertips. There are two features I'm not too fond of with the TRV38. One is the bottom-loading tape. If you're using a tripod, changing tapes can be annoying. The other item is the touch screen. It seems durable enough right now, but how will it stand up over time? it would be nice if there was a stylist (like a PDA) to help reduce the wear grubby fingers can have on the screen. Other than those two things, I'm really happy with the camera"},{"rating":"1","title":"Stopped Working","review":"The DCRTRV38 is a great Digital Camcorder - as long as it works. Mine is 1.5 years old, has had light use (about 10 hours of video recorded) and has had no abuse. It no longer plays video back on a TV, and after hours with Sony support, it appears the A/V out no longer works.I wouldn't be concerned, but when you start to search on line - you begin to realize that Sony has tons of problems with the entire line of Digital Camcorders. They don't seem to be fixing the problem, and ask for a lot of money to fix the problem - estimated at $269 for this repair (on an $800 unit).I have to say, in dealing with the problem, Sony support is spectacular. The on-line knowlege base took me quickly to a relevant troubleshooting procedure. When it didn't solve the problem, it offered me a choice to do an interactive chat with support. I did that and it worked very well, though it ended with the determination that the unit was malfunctioning. It would be great if everyone emulated Sony support."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unrealistic","review":"I started reading this yesterday, got halfway through, then skipped to the end. I appreciate the author's desire to write from a Christian perspective; however,in my experience Christian novels mostly come across as naive: the characters are uninteresting and predictable; the plots contrived. The Christian message is often thrown in awkwardly, as though the author feels compelled to \\"witness\\" even at the expense of the smooth flow of the story. And that's what happened here."},{"rating":"2","title":"River's Edge","review":"In the third of the series there is the introduction of a few more characters but without losing the main ones we have met consistently in the other books. Each book holds the suspense to the end with clues planted to make many possible murderers. In this one it seemed that the murderer surfaced only at the end. It was logical--not out of left field, but hidden by other seemingly more obvious ones."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved this series!","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed all three in this series. This particular one was especially good because it wraps up the story lines of many of the characters.

I think it is better than part 2. The only problem I have with any of the books in this series is that I feel I was tricked into reading them. Part one and 2 were kindle freebies then you had to buy part 3 and 4. I will be honest I buy very few books for my kindle because of the price hike that occured right after I purchased my kindle. I would say this is a great series of books and mild enough for teh wholel to read them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love this series!!!","review":"I highly recommend this series!

This product worked perfectly. Although you need to work within the time limits before it sets up, that was very easy. As a matter of fact if you are gluing something you need to hold together while it bonds then you need to be a bit patient as it does take two or three minutes before you can release it to let it set.

For one, I want the full seasons rather than a compilation like this, and secondly, the selection of the episodes on this DVD downright sucks (they only have the first two episodes the \\"Her Honor\\" four-parter). Here's what the suits say are the \\"best\\" that Night Court had to offer:1.) \\"All You Need is Love\\" (which we already have UNCUT on the Season 1 DVD)2.) \\"Her Honor, pt 1\\"3.) \\"Her Honor, pt 2\\"4.) \\"Death of a Bailiff\\"5.) \\"Who Was that Mashed Man\\"6.) \\"Fire\\"Also, it must be made known that the episodes on this compilation DVD are the cut-all-to-hell episodes shown in syndication.

To that, I say \\"bullsh*t\\". If Warner was planning on releasing Season 2, they would have done it already instead of putting out this compilation to test the waters. Warner's second-guessing is quite confusing to say the least; the Season 1 DVD sales prove we're rabid for more full Night Court seasons. And as for the content of this DVD, I must say the selection was careless and sloppy to say the least. What's the reason behind including the pilot when we already have it on the Season 1 DVD? Why are parts 3 and 4 of 'Her Honor' omitted? Who the hell was in charge of compiling this DVD?

It is quite difficult to navigate through its 500+ pages to actually find what you are looking for. More than once I did not even find information on basic or essential issues (e.g. proofreading symbols). Instead, it elaborates at length on trivialities or somewhat outdated writing approaches/techniques that in most cases could be summarized on 1/10th of the space. Therefore, it either seems to address a readership that I have not yet met or tries to be an artwork per se. Otherwise, the enthusiastic editorial reviews (has anyone of the reviewers actually tried to make use of the book?) and the 5* ratings throughout this review section stays incomprehensible to me."},{"rating":"1","title":"The title should be \\"The Technology of Scientific Documents\\"","review":"This book is 600 pages long and focuses on the technology of producing documents. For example it has a Chapter entitled \\"Writing Techniques\\" but it is all about the technology of word processors (even a subhead on \\"mouse techniques\\"); within that chapter the section on Text is about fonts, not words. I found it extraordinary that a book entitled \\"The Art of Scientific Writing\\" did not have a single chapter about actual writing--using words and language to communicate ideas. There is certainly useful information here--for example, very few books in the genre discuss how to deal with writing and publishing a book. But if you are looking for help in learning how to write papers and communicate your ideas and your work powerfully, I would not recommend this book.

An honest look at the way Kerouac and his crowd viewed women. Sad that these men caused irreparable harm under the guise of creating a new way to write. They thought too much of themselves and their desires and imploded in the destruction they left for others. Had they not been so self centered they might have done some good for the many who were duped into believing that Jack and his boys were on to something."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beat from the Other Side","review":"A part of this memoir--the first 68 pages--is given over to Joan's male relationships around 1950 before she met and married Jack Kerouac. She and Bill Canasta had a close buddy relationship living together. Bill Canasta-- a sad, brilliant and drinking early beat figure who died when he tried to climb out of a subway window--is depicted lovingly. The attempted rape by a former work colleague is horrifically depicted. Joan describes the pressure at the time for women to marry, to escape the pressure of men hitting on them, and the fear of rape. She accepts much of the gender roles given women during her time, but refuses to sacrifice her independence of mind. She describes honestly the slow awakening of her libido and provides a brutally honest view of her relationship with the king of the Beats. The book is written in a clear, unassuming, and intelligent style."},{"rating":"2","title":"Suspense, in HEAT","review":"This thriller is based on a single lady, Kristen (soon to be bride) who becomes abducted by a crazy psychotic drifter after a visit to her want-to-be husband, Sam, a park ranger in Death Valley.

Perhaps this book is helpful for those who have extremely mainstream, fastfood tastes. no experience with vegetarian food, and no cooking background. For others, however, this book is useless. Much of it involved (1) descriptions of premade vegetarian meat substitutes that can be purchased in supermarkets and (2) elementary cooking ingredients and techniques. The recipes include instructions on how to \\"pizzazz\\" a commercial frozen pizza with Green Giant hamburger crumbles.

This really explains Shannon's feelings, her struggles and personal victories.

I've gone through it many times, playing over all the games. Chernev was not considred one of the strongest masters, but he knew how to make the game of chess come alive for ordinary players. His joy in the game is infectious. I strongly recommend this book for both instruction and enjoyment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beware of ordering the 1992 edition!","review":"I ordered this book based upon the rapturous reviews. No one seemed to notice or care if the book was non-algebraic. Well it is the 1965 book without any updates. Since I saw 1992 in the description of this edition I thought it would be safe to buy and not get the old notation. Sorry Charlie! Dover re-issued the 1965 book AS IS. It has been an interesting excercise, no doubt, trying to follow these games when the notation is, for example, 1. P-Q4 P-Q4 2. P-QB4 P-QB3 3. Kt-QB3 Kt-B3 4. B-Kt5 P-K3....etc....And those are just the easy ones. Caveat Emptor!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Descriptive Notations Need Not be an Obstacle in Chess Learning","review":"Beautiful collection of games and also shows that good chess instruction need not cost a fortune. The ideal rating for the students is from 1200-1500, though anyone who likes reading good chess literature will enjoy it. In descriptive notation which means that you can learn to be \\"bilingual\\" and be able to comfortably read both descriptive and algabraic notations. This gives you the flexibility to buy any chess book out there because not all of them will be written in algebraic notations."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun And Instructive","review":"This is a fun book to play through: Chernev loves chess and it shows.

I must agree with the previous poster on this. The vocals and harmonies are lovely but overshadowed by the choice of music, which is just flat-out boring. There is so much potential here; it would be wonderful to hear an album that showcases their glorious voices. I would advise you to save your money on this one, and hope for something a little better in the future."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice harmonies but weak songs","review":"The Webb sisters once again demonstrate perfect singing capabilities. It is a shame that the material they are working with on this album does not give their talents more challenge. Their singing is beautiful and harmonies perfect, but in the long run a little boring. I prefer them in the more challenging combination with Leonard Cohen and Sharon Robinson.

With Lost Dogs, the fans are given a treat beyond belief; B-sides that are not filler tracks. A great double CD set that covers thier long standing in the grunge music scene. If you like them as much as I do I think you will love Lost Dogs. Many of the songs I noticed are really hard edged and remind me of their earlier releases like Ten and Vs. Other songs on here are also psychadelic and drifting. I think a long time from now people will be talking about this band, and also this very dual CD set. I wasn't a big overall Pearl Jam fan but Lost Dogs has me liking them more than ever. I give it five stars for that reason."},{"rating":"2","title":"pearl jam's best album","review":"This is a great collection of rarities. The exclusion of \\"State of Love and Trust\\" prevents it from being perfect; regardless it is the band's most cohesive and listenable album. There is no artsy, pretentious filler, no half-assed sonic experiments. It's just a great collection of passionate, well-played rock songs. Until the band releases a singles collection or retrospective (if they ever do, the band, I'm sure, has some sort of quasi-political objection to such things) this will stand as the most representative of the band's albums. If you like this band at all, buy this album. If not, why the hell are you reading this?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Present","review":"This cd was purchased by me for my son for my daughter in law.

This is not the case in Pearl Jam's \\"Lost Dogs.\\" Even people not familiar with Pearl Jam can listen to and enjoy this double album. Most of the songs are from the earlier years of Pearl Jam; however, there are a few from the Yield, Binarual, and Riot Act sessions. Songs that make this album memorable include Footsteps, Down, and Fatal. Another gem is a secret song on the 2nd disc entitled \\"4-20-02.\\" This is a song that (vocalist/guitarist) Eddie Vedder wrote about deceased Alice in Chains frontman Layne Staley.Lost Dogs is a great collection of songs, overall. Its hard to believe that some of these are B-Sides; most of them are good enough to go on any of Pearl Jam's albums. Lost Dogs is great for long time Pearl Jam fans, and is even a good intro to music fans just getting into Pearl Jam."},{"rating":"2","title":"BRAVO! BRAVO!","review":"THIS IS A MASTERPIECE!

As others have noted, the first disc is more lively and fast-paced, while the second is full of ballads and slow-paced songs. The first disc naturally captured my ear more quickly than the 2nd due to the stronger beats. While at first I found the 2nd one to be a bit on the dull side, it certainly has grown on me and now I think I enjoy it more than the 1st: it seems to have more \\"soul\\" to it and more skilled.

Well simply put you cant, their music speaks for itself."},{"rating":"2","title":"damn good but could be better","review":"pearl jam, one of the greates rock bands ever. i love this band and i love their music. eddie vedder is the greatest song writer of my life time. lost dogs is a great album. yet i found that 2 of the tracks on this album should have stayed in the closet. these tracks include whale song and sweet lew. i was dissapointed to find that brother was an instrumental but this version helps show how intence the guitar was behind the vocals. i think whale song should have been replaced with stated of love and trust, a incredably rare song near impossable to find the original studio electric version. i found sweet lew to be over worked i like the music liricly it is good but vocally it is terrible. this is because there is so many effects added to the vocals of who ever sings it becomes annoying. there where other songs that i did not like such as hitchhiker and dont give no lip, yet after listening to them more they grew on me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great B-Sides Album!","review":"First of all, listeners have to remember that this is a B-Sides and Rarities album, so don't expect the greatest Pearl Jam song ever to be found here. Having said that, it certainly is a great album, with unusual songs, funny songs and certainly great songs. The tracks Don't Give Me No Lip, Gremmie Out Of Control, Dead Man Walking and Last Kiss are amazing. I gave it four stars because it just isn't perfect, but it's quite good. Give this CD a try, you won't regret it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Pearl Jam from the good days!","review":"Mid 90's Pearl Jam returns with some awesome B-Sides and Unreleased songs. If you miss the old grungy style of PJ from the era of 10 and VS. you will love this CD! I Like the second CD \\"Dogs\\" better because it has some of their slower stuff. Some of the songs on this CD suck, but at least half of them are excellent. I was so happy to see the release of this, I don't like their new stuff so this CD brings back some great memories of PJ that I know and love."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice Collection","review":"Some really bright spots, although you can see why some of the tracks didn't make it on other albums."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great CD!!","review":"Lost Dogs is a tremendous compilation from one of the best bands of the modern era. The great thing about Pearl Jam is that they allow their musical offerings to evolve and change as they mature. Lost Dogs allows us to listen in on ten years of their evolution.And can we stop the Pearl Jam vs. Nirvana battle going on here? I personally respect each band for what they are/were. And I'm sure that if Kurt was alive today, his music would have evolved into something much different than Bleach, Nevermind, and In Utero. Who would want to listen to 8 albums of the same exact sound? Dave Grohl didn't.And to trendhitman, who decided to use his reviews as a forum for Pearl Jam bashing, I'll remind you of what you called Pearl Jam in one of your many otherwise worthless reviews of Ten...\\"One of the most talented and influential bands of the past 10 years.\\" I agree."},{"rating":"2","title":"Surprisingly good collection of previously uncollected....","review":"With few exceptions, this collection of previously uncollected Pearl Jam tracks is remarkably good. My biggest surprise is why some of the better tracks were relegated to b-side status to begin with.If you are a Pearl Jam fan, you owe it to yourself to obtain this album for your library. It is not a bunch of low grade throwaways and the price I paid Amazon was very good for a two disc set.

I'd call it a more artsy release because the songs are mostly very different from what PJ would release on their albums (probably why the songs didn't get put on the albums). But together they compile a wonderful variation of raw, almost punkish, balls-out rock n' roll. If you are a Pearl Jam fan or just a fan of good rock music...

The book is a novel, so the history given may or may not be accurate, but I wasn't reading it for accuracy of history. I was reading it for pleasure. I didn't think highly of the Mormon persuasion given protrayed in the last half of the book.

I read my children's books before they do and I'm thankful that I did in this case. While the book starts off innocent enough, toward the end of the book Mormon propaganda creeps into the story. This new religion sends out missionaries and they heal people in an amazing way. It's so amazing, that everyone converts except the main character's boy friend. If you're a Mormon, this will appeal to you. If you are a Christian, beware of the true intent of the author who is a LDS.

It plays into the stereotype of the 'war mongering Indian' which is a falsehood and I am disappointed to see this type of language used in a book claiming to be an educational source on Native American culture.

I am not sure why, but the drivers in this printer turn out easily legible maps.And the sole point of unhappiness is:* scanner: lots of banding while scanning color photos. The photo scans are unusable, even my kid looks wrinkled. I'll have to keep my old scanner for an occasional photo scan.Overall, happy with the purchase, and am looking forward to not replacing all those ink cartridges."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brother DCP-8065DN Digital Copier","review":"I am using this in a Human Resources office for non-volume copying.

My older Canon dedicated copier made better quality copies, and was faster.

What is of concern is that this Brother began to make mechanical noises from its paper path when copying when it was less than 90 days old. On-site service is not covered under warranty. The local authorized service centers want $80 to $90 for on-site service, so the I had the machine taken to an authorized service center, where it is now waiting for parts. The machine will be out of service for at least one week. I am using a flat-bed scanner to do copying in the interim. I have a Brother fax machine which has been reliable, so the break-down of this machine is disappointing. I wonder if this machine will continue to be unreliable in the future.

He then has to find ways to avoid the farmers and save his family at the same time. The book keeps little children hanging on every word and has an excellent ending that they'll love. The excitement makes it a great book to read to little brothers, sisters, or kids. I read it to my sister and she wouldn't let me stop till I had finished the entire book.Roald Dahl makes some of the greatest children's books that are very imaginative and help develop a child's imagination.

This is the author to move kids on to when they graduate from Dr. Suess.

Since currently Sena is not making a case for this and given the 200 series' large size, there's not much around so I thought I'd try this.The main issue with this product that led me to send it back is the construction of the belt clip. Obviously there's not a locking clip but the clip comes out a bit and then goes straight down. Nothing at all to provide resistance to pushing off. Aside from the design, the clip is pretty weak.

Chapati dough is not supposed to (and will not) rise, as there is no leavening agent.If familiar recipes are not authentic, one cannot trust the unfamiliar ones.

I felt they were going through the motions on the songs. I would compare it to the Fear of the Dark album by Iron Maiden. Bruce Dickinson seemed bored with the album, just like Joacim Cans here. I do not feel a change in singer is needed for the group. Cans has a great and distinctive voice in the hard rock world. The two years off between studio albums should work wonders for the group. I really don't care what this group wears in the pictures. They can dress up like unicorns for all I care. As long as they rock, it is alright with me.

In the same genre as Blind Guardian, but without the over use of chorusing. Great fun."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Masterpiece","review":"RENEGADE rocks. Hammerfall just gets better and better with each album. Jociam Can's vocals are amazing and he really soars on this album.

Living in Victory is a perfect example of this, it is uplifting and glorious with lyrics like \\"Chasing Dragons by the moon, Burning bridges between us. Your deepest fears begin to loom.\\" If you like metal and don't buy this album then their is seriously something wrong with you. Get it now, you will not be dissapointed.

Mr' Hauck has done us all a great service in elucidating the secrets of inner alchemy, breathing new vitality into this ancient discipline.After reading this book, the neophyte will be well-prepared to continue his studies with some of the deeper and more symbolical texts."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good explanation of the stages of alchemy","review":"This book provides a good explanation of the seven stages of alchemy and how they can be applied to a person via psychology. The author does have a tendency to mix in some inaccurate history and also tries to connect alchemy to UFOS, but even with those flaws, this is still a useful book for someone wanting to learn about alchemy and begin applying some of the concepts to his/her life. I recommend it primarily for the explanation of the seven stages of alchemy, which you can apply to your life via your own internal work."},{"rating":"2","title":"Deep and practical for everyday life","review":"I found The Emerald Tablet by Dennis William Hauck, a deep, mystical, transformative and practical book, with enough historical information about its origins, great and simple description of the 7 steps with beautiful examples to help us get a clearer idea to what this steps would look in our life, powerful and practical meditations to help the reader get the most out of this experience. As I am reading this book, it's teachings have come alive in my own life, transforming to the core and from the core of my being!!!! A life changing book!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A comprehensive intro to alchemical processes","review":"This book would appear tobe another book that is so full of blind that it is more suitable as a replacement for nyquil, however this just isn't the case. To cut it short, this book provides new information in a easy to understand and enjoyable to read fashion. References are made to several occult authors of note, as well as the golden dawn. The book has several plates, goes into depth on the plates, provides exercises and takes little more then some good solid schooling to understand."},{"rating":"1","title":"This Book Sucks","review":"The fact that Mr Stavish, who knows a thing or two about the subject, lauds this book is incomprehensible to me. The book is re-hashed and dumbed down Jung, with a sprinkling of New Age twaddle of the worst sort. Indeed, the thing is so bad I wouldn't want to waste another sentence on it, were it not so pernicious. Beginners should steer well clear, although experienced practitioners and scholars might get a good laugh from the almost complete lack of historical context or understanding displayed by this charlatan. There should be a minus rating system for books like this one, which merits minus-5 stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wrong Bulb","review":"Unlike the person who did the review in August, when I look at this product, I see the bulb with 4 tubes, which is what I need for my light. So I ordered it, and I got the long thin one with 2 tubes that the August reviewer had wanted. Annoying to say the least. To be fair, the item # on the box is the same one listed as the bulb for my light. It looks like they are both CFML36VLX. But, that's why I ordered the one with the picture of the bulb I needed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not same bulb as pictured.","review":"The bulb I received was not the long, 2-cylinder bulb in the picture.

Otherwise everything went well and the customer service department dealt with the problem immediately and was prompt in getting back to me. They emailed a prepaid return label so that I could exchange the battery and then followed up to make sure everything was taken care of satisfactorily. I would order from them again knowing that if any problems arose, they would take care of things in a timely and professional manner."},{"rating":"2","title":"Forget Spielberg","review":"Gillo Pontecorvo, who also made \\"The Battle of Algiers,\\" gives us the only kind of movie that treats the Holocaust respectfully and responsibly: in order to survive, a Jewish girl (almost?) sells her soul by assuming another person's identity and becoming a concentration camp guard. Excellent cinematography and authentic moral complexity."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not For The Light-Hearted Viewer","review":"This is a serious movie. It is often depressing, but that's when you have to deal with your own preconceived values and judgments. Simply, this is a story of survival in a Nazi concentration camp and the choices one makes to survive. No grand saviors here, just down-to-earth people making everyday life-or-death decisions. Well-acted, realistic settings and characters. Important pre-Battle of Algiers movie for Pontecorvo buffs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Product appears to be correct, if only the shipping delivered it in one piece","review":"Purchased this item in conjunction with the wiring harness and antenna adapter kits (sold separately). At first glance it appears to be correct and should work effectively but as my piece came in a few extra pieces I'm not sure yet.In general, the idea is that this slides into the dash opening and then you slide your stereo into the opening. Maybe the seller should put this in a box rather than an envelope because it has thin separation stems from the bottom to top of the unit that on mine were broken in transit (basic shipping was USPS).Complete installation of a new stereo requires these additional items:Stereo Wire Harness Ford Focus 00 01 02 03 04 (car radio wiring installation parts)Stereo ANTENNA Harness Ford Focus 00 01 02 03 04 (car radio wiring installation parts)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent","review":"Like Windows 2000, Exchange 2000 is a whole new ball game.

The book offers nothing technical for the reader at all. It is more like a commercial for Exchange 2000. I was able to get the same thing out of the documentation shipping on the Exchange 2000 RC2 CD. The book is only good if you are trying to decide whether to roll out Exchange 2000 or not. However, it offers ZERO assistance in installing, configuring, or maintaining Exchange 2000 at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not very useful...","review":"This book attempts to describes Exchange 2000 features at a high level but doesn't really succeed. What it really describes is the technology that makes up Exchange 2000 but not in a way that would satisfy a technical audience. In the end the reader is left with jumbled descriptions of Active Directory, the Web Store, and various Internet protocols without a clear vision of what Exchange 2000 is all about. What's really missing here are discussions and examples of how all of this technology can actually benifit organizations and the users that they employ. Otherwise, this book only helps the reader become a little more 'buzzword' compliant."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works just like a gasket should","review":"keeps the exhaust gas inside the pipe & doesn't leak.

If they earned this record based on students in the area and NOT the recruitment efforts, or, if they played other schools that recruited players, THAT would be worth writing a book about. It's always rubbed me the wrong way that a high school team does this. Does De La Salle turn out amazing players? Definitely. The funny thing is though, most of them were already highly talented before they got there, which is WHY they got there."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sports Book","review":"Great story and super details of the strike before and after. It had all I expected including many human details that some authors might have chosen not to include. This book was great."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just Disappointing","review":"There is far too little new content in this book that will find use. There are some nice new powers, and the Lurk and Ardent are interesting. However, the feat section is simply pathetic compared to what you find in other books in the series. The included \\"errata\\" is unwelcome, not only because it is taking up page count, but because the major clarifications themselves (mindblades and astral constructs) both nerf existing classes and seem like the less likely reading from the original book. Implementing this book wholesale will probably have a net negative effect on your game. I do not recommend this book even to a completist. If you run a psionic campaign, this book might be useful for a handful of new ideas, but I would not pay even half the cover price for that content."},{"rating":"1","title":"No reason for this book to exist...","review":"D&D/WOTC/Hasbro keep releasing 1 useless book after another.

It's Neo-Classical with a Goth edge to it; if you like Dead Can Dance, Qntal, Delerium, or other similar bands, you will love this CD. It stands on its own though and is completely unique. The Bulgarian roots of the band give it a uniquely Eurasian feel; definitely Southeastern European, but also Southwestern Asian. You can practically feel the history of centuries of Byzantine and Ottoman influence throughout the whole CD.

I was very happy when I first got them since they were super-comfy and didn't get in the way while excercising. The sound was pretty decent for the price-range, and overall, they seemed pretty sturdy. Unfortunately, yesterday the right ear conked out and no longer outputs sound. I went to Sony's website to diagnose the problem and their solution was to replace the headphones. Naturally, I'm just outside of the warranty period. I would almost buy a new pair if I thought they would last longer than a few months. I really didn'[t do anything wierd with them, so I'm not sure what went wrong. Maybe it's an isolated incident, but still worth considering before buying these headphones."},{"rating":"1","title":"Portable Headphones??","review":"Not much to say except their already not working correctly.

Not only do they hurt your ears after wearing them for about 30minutes but sound like they should be $10 headphones.I feel like I paid for the Sony name and a flashy design.Some things I did buy them for, but I figured they'd have at least as much bass as my freebie sonys that came with my walkman years ago. Otherwise the sound is OK, too much high and decent midrange. Nothing spectacular here.I will say that this style of headphone is about the best thing out there for any excercise routine.I'm usually a Sony fan too, everything I own is sony.But unfortunately I shouldve gone with Koss in this department, they make behind the neck headphones also, and will in the future."},{"rating":"1","title":"One of worst purchases of my life","review":"This review isn't about headphones, it's about it's quality since I bought it in \\"almost new\\" condition.

After tons of use and many miles of running, I felt that those were a great value, plus they sounded decent.When I went to purchase the same model, I found that they had changed slightly to this newer version. The design was identical so I went bought them. Sadly, Sony's build quality which I thought was wonderful, is not up to par on these headphones. Yesterday after 8 months of ownership, these headphone stopped working. The right side speaker no longer functioned and slightly twisting the speaker brought the sound back momentarily. By the end of my run, the right side speaker was completely dead.Now I see that Sony no longer sells this style of headphone. I guess it's time to move on to a different brand."},{"rating":"2","title":"most comfortable headphones I've owned","review":"I rarely provide reviews, but this is one of those rare products for which I can't help but sing praises. I've own three or four sets. Unfortunately, they haven't been made for a while, and I'm having difficulty finding headphones which can compare. Please comment if you have found anything similar!They are comfortable. I wore one pair all day long at work. I wore another pair at them gym. There were perhaps one or two occasions when they become uncomfortable, but they were otherwise perfect.They sound great. The bass was solid, and the full spectrum sounded great (I'm a musician, so my ear ought to count for something!). They let in enough sound for me to hear traffic, etc., while running, but they sufficiently block annoying office noises/coworkers.Someone suggested that you buy an extra set of ear pads. Well, all of mine came with an extra set, and I even had enough spares left over to use on other headphones which came with cheaper ear pads."},{"rating":"1","title":"Right earphone died in a year","review":"I purchased this item 3 years ago and the right earphone died in a year.

The sound quality on these headphones is still good so I didn't want to get rid of them. I looked online for replacement headphones and found they charge $15.95 a piece or as little as $2.95, plus shipping. I suggest you check your local dollar store for cheapy knock off headphones that look like the style of the Sony Headphones and take the foam pads off of them. Worked for me.Pro's: I like the bass of these headphones, but they're not as loud as my Sony earbuds even with the volume turned up all the way. Gold plated connector.Con's: I would have said the foam pads, but since I resolved that issue, my only complaint would be they get uncomfortable to wear if you're wearing eye glasses."},{"rating":"1","title":"Comfortless headphones","review":"I don't consider myself to have a extra big neck or head, in fact I'm just an adult male of normal neck & head size. I can barely get these on my ears. If I tilt my head up, it feels as if they are going to pull off. I'm going to cut the neck band in the middle & tape it back together, adding about an inch to the lenght. That should give enough room to move my head while using them. The sound is good, but not great. I can only use them with my portable cd player. The cord won't reach the computer unless I sit the tower in my lap. A very unsatisfactory purchase. I'm stretching it with 2 stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Junk - lasted 6 months","review":"Don't purchase these headphones. I have purchased Sony headphones several times and all have failed. This model was purchased 6 months ago and the right side just stopped working. In fact, I just looked at the Best Buy site and their reviews said the same thing that we experienced. I saved the Sony packaging and the Amazon receipt almost expecting these headphones to fail and they did. I just got off the phone with Sony and they offered to \\"exchange\\" the headphones for $19.20 - I paid $19.99 for them and this was no bargain so I passed. The warranty was for only 90 days and we had them 6 months - I think that expecting them to last a little longer is not unrealistic. Take my advice, don't invest in Sony headphones - look for a longer warranty and something that is made a little better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fragile and uncomfortable.","review":"I am really not too impressed.

Unlike the Philips Rich Bass Neckband Headphone, these do not have an extra protective string to absorb the weight of the cord when you run so it pulls on where the cord connects to the headphones directly which is probably why they broke down so quickly. I use Philips Rich Bass Neckband Headphone now but if they came out with a version of these that had the protective string I'd probably go back to these instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"Decent headphones for running, working out","review":"These headphones are good enough for working out.

I came across the Sony MDR-G57G S2 and decided to give them a whirl. Now I wish I didn't. While the sound quality wasn't bad (I've heard better from other Sony ear/headphones that I have owned in the past), the comfort was a huge epic fail on Sony's part. I know the design was to make the headphones was to be more snug for active users with the extra ear pieces but apparently the people who designed that feature never had to wear them for more than five minutes. I have gone back to Phillips earphones that slides over my ears which I find a lot more freedom and comfort than this rancid headset from Sony. The sound quality is better to in my personal opinion."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Basic Headphones","review":"I use these for regularly running 3-8 miles and they work very well. Note: I am not an audiophile but I certainly appreciate good sounding speakers while spending considerable time on the roads.My only small complaint is that the fit isn't quite as good as the previous generation. They seem to be sized for a head just slightly larger than mine and as a result, the pads apply a little more pressure in the front. It's not a major problem by any means, but it prevents me from giving them 5-stars.Highly recommended for anyone looking for reasonably comfortable, good sounding, reliable headphones for working out."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Fit, Poor Performance","review":"I used to buy these headphones exclusively because they fit so well and stay snug to your head during your workout whether it was running, lifting, etc. I'm no audiophile but I felt the sound was completely acceptable and they were comfortable around my ears. Unfortunately, one of the speakers would always die within a short peroid of time(6 months to a year)and you were left listening to music in only one ear. After the this happened on the third pair, I have switched to Phillips headphones(model SHS5200). These fit a bit more loosely but sound good and have lasted two years. I am back today to purchase another pair after one speaker died on the Phillips brand. Perhaps this is inevitable with this type of headphone but I will take two years of wear time with Phillips over 6 mo. to a year on the Sony brand!"},{"rating":"2","title":"great for working out","review":"I like these headphones for working out.

I have one relatively small complaint: first, they pinch the top of my ears a bit, and I get tired of wearing them after an hour or two. Sound quality is decent, though not spectacular. There isn't a whole lot of sound leakage, but enough that somebody might notice.I used these for quite a while and even bought a replacement pair of the same ones when I broke the first pair.

They are especially nice when working out, as they do not slip at all.Bass - Weak. Very, very weak.Trebel - Too strong actually, and not very good to boot. The trebel lines in music drown out all the other sounds. On songs that have particularly high or loud trebel sounds, it is almost painful to listen to.Vocals - Not anything special.For the price, they are horrible. You do not get your money's worth. The sound is iffy, and the design is good. The koss KSC-50 sport ear-clip headphones (or the KSC-55, wrap-around) have twice the sound quality of these, and are much more bang for your buck.Overall, these headphones aren't worth your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Short out","review":"After 4 months of use, less than 1 hour per day, the cord developed a short.

One reviewer suggested removing the removable plastic clips to make them more comfortable. I tried this and found them far less comfortable so I put the clips back. The clips seem to take some of the pressure off the back of the ears. I also found that when the headphones started to hurt, I could simply lift the phones upward and they wouldn't hurt for a while.Another reviewer suggested there are 2 different models: The MDR-G572 and the MDR-G572 S2. I believe they are one and the same.I use them for jogging and for listening to TV on the treadmill. The sound is great for sport type headphones and I have been very happy with them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor quality","review":"This hose is poorly made and won't last long.

The DVD that came with it was extremely helpful and the kit is very complete. My only addition to the video is that when you're doing an area where the concrete is contained by walls, you cannot go off the surface to start/stop spraying as the video instructs. It worked for me by having someone follow me with a bucket that I could start spraying into to avoid having the sprayer drip onto my surface.Also, instead of always going in circles, I'd be sure to go in straight lines along the outside walls as the circle pattern won't adequately coat the outside areas. The circle spray pattern works very well for the main area of the room.The only item that wasn't included in the kit was a brush/mop with stiff bristles to scrub the concrete and citrus etch into the surface."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not buy this \\"stain\\" it is a waste of money.","review":"Don't waste your money on this \\"stain\\". This stuff is closer to paint than stain. I spent a week prepping the floors in my house (I am a disabled vet and it's very difficult for me to do this type of work) and when I pulled off the painters tape some of it touched the floor and it peeled the stain off the floor like it was latex paint. I know the floor was prepped right and I know I applied it correctly. This stuff is straight up garbage. After spending a few hundred dollars on this stuff I am pretty upset.My floor is actually now worse off than if I had never used it.

It's a pretty rough, porous concrete. Easy to apply and the color looks great. As others have noted, this is more of a paint, not a stain. It has been on for roughly 8 months and still looks good. We had a couple of spots where the stain came up, but we quickly discovered that it was due to a chair with soft rubber feet. In the heat of the summer, the rubber \\"melted\\" and adhered to the top coat of the stain, ultimately lifting it. We have had no problems since, even with harder chairs \\"scraping\\" across it frequently."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth it","review":"The stain was very thin and didn't adhere to the garage floor. I spent several hours preparing the surface according to the directions, but it still didn't work well. The sprayer would frequently clog and drip, creating blotches of stain. Instead of a nice even coverage, it looks like someone threw up stain all of over the floor. I'll likely redo the floor with another product in the spring, when the weather gets better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Know What You're Getting","review":"I purchased the kit to stain my concrete basement floor. It is essentially a thin paint that was not absorbed by the concrete. An entire section peeled up 24 hours after I finished the floor. In other places, chipping has already begun. This project is less than 1 month old. I would not recomemend this product for any concrete project that is not highly porous. I say this because there are places where the stain went on the unfinished cinder block wall when I was spraying, and the stain looks like it adhere & absorbed well.

It's almost unbearable at certain parts. Of course all the musicians involved are very skillfull, but that did not save the album. THe term \\"metal opera\\" is wasted here.

It's curious because by the times of 1955 is remarkable how both doctors, patients and everybody smokes a lot everywhere, something today would be politically incorrect. Furthermore, these physicians are good for all: they operate an open heart and in the following minute they attend to a labor and give a baby to light, vaccinate the people, etc. I think there are some excess in that sense, and perhaps a film in color would be more appropriate for these theme, for the blood, etc. The little village Greenville when Mitchum works is also a little blurred, but the whole is a non fully perfect but very good film."},{"rating":"2","title":"Shaman's Healingh","review":"I am an avid fan of Shastro.

You will get hooked on this show once you start!"},{"rating":"1","title":"An utter disappointment","review":"The tragedy of this series can be laid at the feet of the writers.While the acting efforts of the cast are commendable, the true essence of Terry Goodkind's book series were totally left out of the show; namely the love story of Kahlan and Richard and how their characters affected those around them. What the fan is left with, is a mangled fantasy universe sparsely populated with original story elements that make you go \\"oh right there it is\\".The only good thing I have to say about the series? Thank goodness it was cancelled. Don't waste your money buying this and if you are gifting it to someone who is a fan of the books, be prepared to have something better to salvage your friendship after."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bewitching and beautiful","review":"From the opening shots of this first episode of Series 1 I was bewitched. If you like fantasy and magic and adventure, then you will love this show, but that's not all it offers. Wonderful characters like Zedd (he is hilarious, watch out for when Kahlan meets him for the first time!), amazing costumes, the incredible scenery of New Zealand where the series was filmed, a love story, and of course the battle between good and evil, Legend of the Seeker has it all. The opening shots are haunting: two girls on horseback, one blonde and the other dark, riding for their lives, closely pursued by soldiers, they are trying to protect something, but time is running out......... This double episode will set you up for many hours of bewitching entertainment as you make your way through Season 1, and then Season 2."},{"rating":"1","title":"Something with the potential to be good went wrong!","review":"I had never heard of this program or the book on which it is supposedly based. I came across it while wandering through the TV programs section. While I did not read the reviews, I did read the background to the story and told myself, why not? I watched the extended first episode of the first series and I was rather impressed. It had all the makings of leading in to a good series. Unfortunately, I then watched episode 2 and any thought of this becoming a good series went out the window. However, not being one to give up easily, I also watched episode 3 and by the end of that, I had seen enough. The dialogue was childish, the actors \\"over acted\\" frequently and not even the poorly executed \\"slo mo\\" fight scenes were going to save this program. Like I said, \\"in the beginning\\" it had the potential of making a good series. Perhaps the makers of this program should have just left the first extended episode as a TV mini-movie and left it at that."},{"rating":"1","title":"no thank you again","review":"I thought if they followed the books the tv series would have lasted much longer than two seasons, the 12 books are amazing and not you avarage fairytale."},{"rating":"1","title":"Incredibly disappointed","review":"I have no idea what possessed Terry Goodkind to allow someone to completely warp and destroy one of the greatest book series I have ever read. I can't tell you how many times I yelled BS at the TV screen while I watched this show, or how many times I couldn't stand watching it anymore and just shut it off. For the people who have never read the books and enjoyed the show, I feel very sorry for you. Because if this show had been done properly and in tune with the books it would have been a masterpiece to dwarf even the lord of the rings trilogy.

More commendable is that they even got the second season to come out. This however, is were they praise sadly ends. A comparison that a wise old man once told me pretty much sums this up - The reason you wear brown pants to battle is to hide the crap that is taken when faced with overwelming fear of the coming situation - ... This tv series though trying to show why the books were so good, actually tears the books apart and makes a gross characture of the beauty found in the pages. Now dont get me wrong as stated above there is some praise but, this is just too painful to watch.I would highly suggest skipping this. If the title does catch your interest though, pick up the book or kindle version of \\" Wizard's First Rule\\" by terry goodkind as this is the first book for which this series is based."},{"rating":"1","title":"Read the books","review":"I thought I would try to watch this first episode, since I loved the books, (at least as far as book #6 or so), but it was very disappointing. Obviously, they have to condense the story to fit in the episode timeline, but it all happened a little too quickly to be believable. There was a lot of running back and forth between people's houses and the barrier, and running about in the woods. The dramatic music and awed expressions from all the characters, every time Richard did anything of significance, such as picking up the sword, was a bit overdone. And how many times did they say \\"You really are the Seeker!\\", or \\"Spoken like a true Seeker!\\"??"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Show, to bad I discovered it to late","review":"Really love the show, I discovered it on Netflix and decided to watch a few episodes and ended up watching the whole first season and half of season 2.

Everyone who was involved in this travesty should not be allowed into the entertainment industry ever again. The show branches so far away from the first book to make it unidentifiable by any of the fans of the series. If I'm getting this correct Darken Rahl doesn't die, Richard never ascends to take over Dahara as the next of the Rahl bloodline, completely negating anything past the first two books, where it became necessary for Richard to lead.I would be surprised if Goodkind let this go on any longer than two seasons.Don't buy this and support this travesty, buy the books instead they are much better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy unless you have a PC!!!","review":"I am a Mac-user and I bought the Legend of the Seeker so I could watch it on my computers and / or the tv/ ps3.

Ok. It hardly follows the Story Line. I have only seen the first episode, but it decimated the storyline. Think \\"The Count of Montecristo\\" the Movie vs. \\"The Count of Montecristo\\" the Series. The Count of Montecristo Series was so much better than the movie that it was a disappointment to watch the Movie. That's how I feel with watching the Legend of the Seeker Series after having read the books. The Count of Montecristo Series did a fairly good job at following the book's storyline. The Legend of the Seeker does a very poor job at creating a Series that follows the books. Definitely not a \\"Lord of the Rings\\" or \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" (The good one with Collin Firth.)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hercules or Xena, with a \\"Sword of Truth\\" world slapped on.","review":"Firstly, I loved Sam Raimi when he made Hercules and Xena. They were campy, and so fun to watch. The problem was, you never took them seriously. Now, imagine one of the best fantasy series every written, and then make it Hercules. It is painfully obvious that Sam Raimi never read more than perhaps the back cover of the book. It seems that they took his name from Spider-Man, and used that prestige and high budget to make the show.The cast (aside from Zed) seems like they were picked from the phone book. Richard, rather than a tall, built D'Haran man, he is a small, skinny guy. Ever woman in the midlands has hair just as long as Kahlan's, and Darken Rahl isn't even blonde! While i'm positive that those who loved Hercules or Xena will enjoy this show, anyone who has ever read any of the books will want to sandpaper their eyes.

Nevertheless, it is very entertaining and achieves the purpose of showing the more less mundane world in which a spy moves, rather that the high trills and intense adventure in which these characters are portrayed by Hollywood. On the other hand, he clearly acknowledges that his services to Rommel were basically useless, so the title is really a merchandising tool, since if it have read \\"My Life as a Spy\\" by John W.

Somewhat awkward to get to the button you have to press to change drill bits.Yes, it's not a professional grade drill press, but for the price it's very useful and does a good job. Thank God someone posted a YouTube video on how to put the thing together, though. I'd have never figured it out from their crappy directions! Even the video could have benefited from slowing down and showing some close ups. But once up and running, it's a peach of a hobby tool.

Make sure the locking nuts and levers are secured and there won't be any issues with light pressure and patience. I was able to drill through aluminum, plastic, and steel (steel took a while) with no problems at all. Yeah it took a little longer than a regular drill press, but I don't have the space OR the money for one.The instruction manual was worthless, but luckily assembling the press was intuitive. However, the manual would be good for ordering replacement parts if needed. There is a nice break down of the parts that are included in the kit.

I guess it's cool to be able to rotate the tool, but the problem is that it completely refuses to line up parallel with the stand (pointing straight down) so you end up with your dremel at a slight angle when you are trying to drill straight up and down. The plastic that forms the body of the mount seems to have deformed when it came out of the mold so that there is a bunch of slop in the action, and when you tighten down the locking mechanism it pulls the whole thing out of alignment. You'd be better off getting a stand that doesn't rotate--unless you plan on drilling a bunch of holes at 87 degrees. I've tweaked all the adjustments, and even toolk the whole thing apart and added a bushing to the axle to tighten up the mechanism, but to no avail.

I have now purchased the Dremel tool also and it is a nice functional system."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great, but not a replacement for a drill press.","review":"Decent quality construction. Mounting the rotary tool is easy, as is changing. It's not perfectly stable however, so you may wind up drilling a larger hole than you would have intended, or having it start slightly off center.

Blackthorne clearly .. I received my unit last week and was definitely perplexed about the fact that my 395 (apparently supported by the unit) was way too small. There were no real mounting brackets to hold the unit firmly in place other than the coupling nut at the bottom. There has to be an adapter .. otherwise this is either bad engineering or bad marketing.I am not really going to use it for anything high-precision but I do need tight enough tolerance for drilling holes close to each other. I cannot use the 220-01 station reliably .. intend to modify it to hold my dremel tool. And if I can't .. I'm returning it."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Dremel Work Station is a disappointing product!","review":"For my hobby, working with stone for lapidary and jewelery, this product is a disappointment. There is a lack of precision in the slide mechanism. This results in a lateral (side to side) movement of about 2mm at the cutting tool when modest pressure is applied. This means that it is impossible to drill a precisely positioned small hole as for a jump ring or pendant chain.I spoke with Dremel's customer support by phone. At first the support person didn't understand the problem. When I explained that I needed to adjust the slide mechanism to make it tighter and reduce the side to side play, she seemed flummuxed and could offer no help. She suggested I contact a retail dealer. I don't expect Amazon, my dealer, is prepared to provide the kind of product help I need.Before buying the product I would like to have seen the specification of precision in relevant documentation in print or on-line.Victor Wyman"},{"rating":"2","title":"An excellent accessory","review":"This is an excellent accessory for the already-versatile rotary tool. The trick to its use is to recognize the inherent limitation of all rotary tools.They are high-speed, low-torque tools. The work is done in the same way that a dentist's drill works: Very light pressure lets the bit in effect shave away the material. As the manual says, you need to adjust the tool so the bit is very close to the workpiece, then slowly lower the bit into it.This means you can't use the Dremel drill press the same way you would use a full-size drill press, where you can bear down on the lever and force the bit to dig into the work. If you try to use it that way, you'll get the \\"slop\\" that some other reviewers mention.When it's used correctly-- and the manual makes it very clear how to do so-- this is a very good accessory to have."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sloppy","review":"Lots of play.

Up and down and other functions are very good."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good Luck Drilling Straight Holes","review":"Or more accurately, good luck drilling holes perpendicular to the workpiece. The tool is held way off plumb from the base plate, a few degrees front to back and almost as much side to side. There is no adjustment for front to back. It's a shame, the actual construction and operation of the tool is pretty good but if it can't drill straight it does not meet the primary purpose. Maybe Dremel will correct these issues one day and make this worth buying."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dremel work station","review":"Very flexable item.

It's obviously not going to replace you standard drill press but it will work great for small jobs or if you have very little room. I purchased it mainly to drill out holes in printed circuit boards, which so far it does the trick. The only problem I had was the telescoping tube got jammed somehow while I was putting it together, but I don't really need it to telescope so not a big deal. 4 stars because of the jamming issue, which was probably my fault.

My unit would NOT adjust to a true vertical. The plastic cowling was distorted. And the 2mm horizontal play noted by some was clearly present, making the stand useless for drilling--unless you are aiming for the side of a barn.

I am using it for constructing radio control airplanes, and the type of sanding I sometimes do could not be done without it! I am very pleased with it. As far as the deisgn, there was some confusion as to the installtion of the bolt that holds the main shaft in place. There was no hole or indentation in the shaft that made it obvious how the bolt goes in. It appears the bolt just tightens against any spot on the shaft, which then seems like it would loosen over time. But, overall it it is great product and just what I was looking for.

My problem is that the Dremel I am in possession of is a model 395 circa 1984. The Dremel I have has a different body style than the current 395's and will not fit the drill press. I can understand this mistake but it would have saved me time and money spent to know this detail. As for the press itself it is definitely of budget construction. The assembly is pretty simple but that is after you interpret the poorly written and skimpy instructions. All-in-all you get something that should be priced around $40.00 and in today's world that is not saying much. The old Dremel in my possession is still going strong after 26 years; I don't think this drill press will have much worth after the same amount of time except as scrap metal and plastic."},{"rating":"2","title":"great product","review":"This really makes the dremel a more versatile tool.

Tightening screws helps a bit, at a cost of higher resistance. I ended up using a cheap chinese stand.After I discovered Proxxon, Dremel tools ended up collecting dust on a shelf.

From \`City of New Orleans' to \`Amazing Grace' to \`Country Roads' to \`Rhinestone Cowboy', Hasselhoff pays homage to these legendary artists.And he does it very well. Instead of trying to directly emulate the style in which the original artist performed the song, Hasselhoff adds his own personality to each cut, making them familiar yet original. Being an avid Elvis Presley fan, I was interested to see how David was going to cover \`Love Me Tender'. In my opinion, it takes real courage to record a song that the King has made famous but Mr. Hasselhoff did a beautiful job. I am impressed.David Hasselhoff Sings America is a CD worth adding to any music lover's collection. It is a pleasure to hear the old favorites redone with a new twist."},{"rating":"2","title":"Don't take this too seriously.","review":"I like this CD. You have to NOT take it seriously, though.

I happen to believe that there's a place for really bad music. I'm a Gunther fan, and this ranks right up there with him on my top five favorite bad CD's of all time.If you don't take this CD seriously, appreciate the obsurd, or are a Hasselhoff fan, then it's really worth buying.

What's next, Hof- GNR's \\"Welcome to the Jungle\\" with a Barry Manilow/Vegas Lounge singer beat??Perhaps the Germans like the Hof because he's comic relief after pounding one too many Hefeweizens at a Beer Tent.

I have been out with the set 3 times and the inside of the bag has completely frayed and started to come apart. Every time you pull a club out you get lots of purple strands of thread around each club and I would imagine within a few more uses the entire inside dividers would be gone. While the set is pretty cheap it really should be better quality that this - its not like pulling a club out of the bag is an unusual move for the golf bag! Perhaps mine was flawed but I have gone ahead and returned this one for a refund. As others also noted it is not the color pictured either (although the inside lining does match) but rather the outside of the bag is the palest lavender and not very attractive. I had read other reviews and so was not surprised by this, but falling apart so quickly is something I was not willing to put up with. Hopefully the refund will go smoothly and quickly."},{"rating":"2","title":"Confidence Golf Lady bag and clubs","review":"The clubs have nice grips and oversize heads.

And, it is good read in its own right. However, the series arguably stands better in publication order (2,3,4,5,6,1) than in narrative order (1,2,3,4,5,6), because this book lets the cat out of the bag.

Additionally, there is a static popping sound that comes occasionally from the back of the TV and it will turn itself off.

Problems with it started after about 8 months of use, when the sound would shut off altogether or emit an ear-piercing noise. Shutting it off and turning it back on would solve the problem at the beginning, but it has increasingly become worse to the point where the sound is lost after a few minutes no matter how many times the TV is shut down and turned back on again, or how long it has been allowed to warm up. Another problem is that it recycles when first turned on, shutting itself off and then restarting repeatedly.Attempts to contact Philips have gone unanswered. I sincerely regret having purchased this TV and highly recommend that others steer clear of it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor contrast ratio.","review":"A friend bought this for his bedroom. Although they don't list the contrast ratio here, it's for good reason. The contrast ratio is very poor. My guess would be about 600:1, like the first LCDs to hit the market years ago. This is an old technology LCD of years ago. The blacks are only light grey/purple at best, never even close to black. It's like turning the contrast down on your current set, & then turning up the brightness. Everything looks washed out, especially during dark scenes.

The combo would randomly turn itself on and off and would open and close the DVD holder multiple times before playing. These are terrible products! When I called Philips regarding the issue, the company would not fix it because the one-year warranty had passed. We are now responsible for paying out of pocket for repairs. Given the same consistent issue reported by other users, it is more than likely that there is a defect with these devices."},{"rating":"1","title":"PIECE OF JUNK","review":"Worked fine for about 18 months and then began having the same problem as so many others have experienced with this model. Upon turning on the set, it began emitting an ear-splitting screeching noise and shutting itself off and on again, over and over, all the while making the nearly unbearable noise.

I bought it online and had to return the first set because it was defective and wouldn't work at all.I received another set. It worked okay but certain colors were overly saturated; mostly reds and greens. And yes, I tried to adjust it numerous times: always with no luck.About 14 months later I started having a problem. When first turning on the set, the picture would distort, make a shrill noise and the screen would go black. The picture would come back shortly after. This would occur 3 to 8 times before stopping. The problem was even worse with HD channels.I wisely had purchased an extended warranty. The service department said there was a problem with the display and decided it would cheaper to replace the set than to repair it. To my delight, Circuit City is replacing with it a Toshiba model. Hopefully my luck will be better. I will never purchase a Philips LCD TV again."},{"rating":"1","title":"WHAT!","review":"Wow this TV is a piece of junk! of so i buy a PS3 and i get a Xbox 360 and then guess what happends! the sounds cuts out and then next thing you know the picture cant even stay on!

They look like little black & gold beer cans, and you'll see how the top is domed, and/or the bottom is blown out. Any that look like this need to be replaced.I needed three 1000uf 10V, and one 470uf 16V. Got them from STSI.com for $8 shipped, and three days later with 15 minutes work with a soldering iron and it was fixed. Make sure you don't put them in backwards!!

I can zoom along on the Microsoft 1000 without having to look at the keyboard. I also enjoy the mechanical feel and response of the keys. All in a all a very nice keyboard. Only 4 stars because this is my third one of these. They don't last as long as I would like and I am fairly lead-fingered. Keys started popping off of my last one, prompting this purchase."},{"rating":"1","title":"No go","review":"Keyboard is nice and easy to type with. But for some reason the mouse always jumps on the screen and I tried to fix it but it's still not working. So right now I'm just using the keyboard with my old mouse"},{"rating":"1","title":"OK Wireless Keyboard & Mouse Set \\"Buyer Beware\\"","review":"I purchased this wireless keyboard set as I am already using another one of these on another PC and it performs well. I like it better than the newer Microsoft model. Unfortunately I received a defective unit (mouse) from this third party seller and they expected me to jump through hoops to get it replaced, what a hassle! I contacted Microsoft directly and they took care of the problem immediately sending me a replacement. The only problem was that the replacement was the cheaper newer model. Still better that a defective unit. This third party seller has something to learn about customer service as I would Not Recommend them or any third party seller!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good wireless keyboard/mouse option","review":"This is a great product for the price. All of your most-used functions (calculator, My Documents, browser, volume control, etc.) at the push of a button. The only problem I've had is when playing music through iTunes, the mute button doesn't work. Strange conflict between software and hardware. This is the only thing keeping it from getting 5 stars from me (and that sounds like more of a problem with iTunes, since that's the only app that has the issue)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"The item is not what I waited. I disappointed because I use this keyboard close from my laptop and sometimes the signal is lost, I don't know why the signal is fall. The keyboard is big and it can't use it from afar to your computer. I'm very disappointed"},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible","review":"I bought this because a guy at radio shack reccomended that I buy a wireless keyboard/mouse for my mac. I use both Windows XP and Mac OS 10.4.7. This thing was great for the first week. After that it seemed like the batteries for the mouse lasted three days. Then after a month the keyboard started messing up but only when in Windows XP. I would push one button and it would type another. So after this frustration when I changed the batteries it was fine, however now it seemes like the batteries only last 3 days like the mouse. The mouse is more comfortable than a mighty mouse and the keyboard has some nice shortcuts but that simply doesn't save this terrible set. I guess you get what you pay for. My advice, buy a more expensive model."},{"rating":"1","title":"Product would not function","review":"This Microsoft Wireless 1000 keyboard and mouse system would not function even though I installed the software as described. I then followed the \\"read me\\" instructions and uninstalled it several times trying to find circumstances that would work. Then I went to Microsoft's web site and downloaded current software and nothing, nothing, nothing worked at all after several hours of checking battery installation, uninstalls, downloads, etc. Gave up. I went back to my former wireless mouse (without keyboard, reinstalled it,. and it works fine so I know the wireless interface does work, just not with the 1000 system."},{"rating":"1","title":"Absolutely Horrible!","review":"This set is good...if you plan to stay within 2 feet of the receiver, which most people don't. If you want a wireless keyboard and mouse that will work a farther distance, choose a better model. We were attracted to this one because it wasn't as expensive, but hell, I'd rather buy a wireless keyboard and mouse separate, pay $10 more, and get better quality that will work a farther distance. Not worth buying and is a waste of money."},{"rating":"1","title":"I hate them","review":"As has already been stated, the range is Crap and RSI is inevitable from the constant smashing of the mouse into the side of your head with frustration.Shouting directions for the pointer on the screen has proven more effective than this odious little device.Keyboard works ok for me... Perhaps I'll try hammering the mouse with it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good enough set. Great value","review":"Pros:+ Easy to use+ Compatible with both PC and Mac+ Battery life. I went on for 2 months before I had to replace and I'm a heavy computer user+ Great range. About 3 1/2 feet max works for me+ Unbeatable price. With Amazon's great pricing and free shipping on this set, it surely offers great value for moneyCons:- I do find it a bit bulky compared it's newer, more expensive counterpartsOverall a great product with great value. Recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for couch surfing","review":"I bought this because it was cheap. I wanted to sit on my couch 8 ft away and surf the internet on my TV. I know it states 6ft, but I was being an optimistic cheapskate. The mouse handles the distance well, but the keyboard has to be practically \\"jam up against\\" the receiver to work (within a foot or so, and on the same level). So I guess that is \\"almost\\" wireless. I have to get my lazy self off the couch, and kneel on the floor to use the keyboard. Going to get a 2.4 gHz set up now (a cheaper one of course) http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002RV01LI/ref=oss_product. We'll see."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Connectivity","review":"Pros:~>If you are on a budget and just looking for something quick and simple, then this is for you.Cons:~>If you are using for gaming purpose or large coorporate conference room purpose, find something else.Software Installation:1) For Keyboard and Mouse driver installation, it is very slow. (No its not my computer)2) For software setup, the selection of driver wording is poor and can be confusing for beginnersHardware1) The USB Wireless Hub is not like a USB stick driver. Its a hub with a very long USB extention2) Poor Mouse connectivity, It will skip unless mouse is close to USB Wireless Hub.3) Typing very fast causes missing letters.*I have found out that placing the USB Wireless Hub close to the keyboard and mouse reduces these problems, but whats the point having a wireless when the hub is closer to the keyboard and mouse.... sigh...."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Seller!
