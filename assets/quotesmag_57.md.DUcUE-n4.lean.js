The game is usually determined by the arrangements of hunters that are scored only at the end of a game.There seems to be more opportunities for coming up with interesting house rules in this version of Carcassonne. For example, a hunter with access to three deers may have each deer count one extra point. A mammoth could be worth 3 points instead of 2 points.

The original game uses medieval tiles (castles, roads, monasteries, etc.), whereas this one takes place in prehistoric times (forests, lakes, meadows).

Also, if you complete a forest with a gold nugget, you get a bonus tile - basically an extra turn, but the bonus tiles sometimes have a huge bonus.The original is fun, but if you're just getting into the game you definitely want to try this first.

Pretty fine. \\"Sweet Jane\\" does indeed deserve its place as the Lou Reed's signature tune. \\"Head Held High\\" is absolutely top-notch. And \\"Train Round the Bend\\" is possibly my favorite song by any band.

When he set the board out I was a little worried it would be like Risk. However it is much simpler (and shorter) than that strategy game. The board features a map of the US with prominent cities marked on it, as well as rivers and mountains. Each player is dealt a set of cards, each with a different US city on it. The players then take turns laying down two pieces of track trying to connect their cities, and you can also follow the track that the other players lay down.

I though that maybe playing with more people will be better but after two more tries with 4 and 5 players the outcoming was the same, it's a boring and nonsense game, at least compared with games as Puerto Rico, Settlers, Bohnanza, etc.So if you're looking for a good and challenging game, look elsewhere. And if you're looking to learn USA state names, search for an Atlas.This is not a fun, neither interesting game. And for the same price you can purchase excellent board games.

The character you start out with is Sonic. Eventually, you get Tales, Knuckles, Amy, Big, and E102 (the robot guy). My favorite level is with E102 where you have to beat Superbeta. Destroying Superbeta is hard because he has a superblaster and direct missiles. The only way to hit him is when he's doing the orange shield attack- then you shoot him from behind.

This is a great game, but the reason i give it 4 stars is because the mac port of this game has a glitch. When you get to the level Dawnville (the 2nd or third i think) It comes up with a error message. Well I did some research and i found out that it's a bug in the mac port.

My daughter loves using it (even if half the time its a game to her), she likes being a big girl and having her own flusher. Far better than the first years elmo potty. The opening on this potty is wider but not so big they'll fall in. The 1st years potty opening is so small that unless i repositioned her on the potty she'd pee on the floor. She's not a big girl either, so if you've got a bigger kid stay away from the other potty. I love the storage in the tank for wipes and extra pull-ups.

At any rate, I contacted Totco and within days I had a new one at no charge. (5 stars for their customer service!!!)Lo and behold though, it will not stay on the potty and hasn't done any good.

We called the manufacturer only to find out the 800 # on their isntruction sheet is wrong, we then called the number from their website (long distance) & left a message, this was followed up by an e-mail, well here we are 4 days later & no returned call nor reply to the e-mail! I find this ridiculous. To make a long story short I debated about returning the whole unit but still like the concept so I took it apon myself to diagnose & repair the \\"flusher unit\\" - it turned out the switch had a bad solder joint that caused a short.

This potty has really done nothing spectacular to justify the forty dollar price tag. The little flushing mechanism broke on ours almost right away.

The one feature that I really loved however, was the wipe/toilet paper holder. That being said, my daughter actually prefers the little seat thing that goes on the actual toilet and a step stool.

We were so disappointed because we could tell he was excited about his very own potty, but we are going to have to return it and get something else."},{"rating":"2","title":"2-year-old loves it","review":"I bought this potty seat for my 26-month-old girl. Just before she turned two, people were wondering why I still carried an overloaded diaper bag around everywhere I went with her, and she wasn't allowed to go swimming until she was trained, so we bought her this. She loves it because it makes her look like a big girl. Whenever she used her potty, she'd say \\"Mommy, look I'm a big girl.\\" Most of my relatives were impressed. They thought most children weren't usually potty-trained until they were closer to three. She was the only one in her preschool class who used the potty."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT FOR BOYS!","review":"Our son's pertinent part points about two inches above the pee guard! He is tall/big for his two years, bit I don't see how the pee guard would be effective for any sized boy. Also, the guard detaches too easily from the potty which futher comprimises its effectiveness. The potty is really cute, easy to put together, and easy to clean, but I would only recommend it for girls."},{"rating":"2","title":"PERFECT POTTY CHAIR!!!","review":"I bought this potty chair early for my son just so he'd get used to it being around before we started training and he didn't know what it was. I bought this model because it looks (and sounds) like a real toilet instead of a colorful bowl which can give them the wrong message. My son took right to it and is now 17 months old and uses the potty like a champ!!! I thank heavens I bought this one and highly recommend it for anyone!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful book!","review":"This is one of the most beautiful cookbooks i've read due to the amazing illustrations by David Lance Goines. I enjoy the historical information about Chez Panisse restaurants and the tips on how to select the ingredients. A lot of the recipes are quite simple which means that in order for the dish to turn out good the best and freshest ingredients must be obtained. This book also makes me want to dine more at Chez Panisse, cafe or restaurant, knowing that i will be served the best of what is available in season."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another excellent book from Alice","review":"Just bought the book and it's wonderful.

My diet is healthful vegetarian, and this book contains a lot of meat and ingredients I can not find in my area. If anyone wants an unused copy, let me know!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Suckered twice","review":"Previously bought the Chez Panisse Cookbook, was disappointed and then bought this one thinking it might be an improvement. Something about the recipes in these books leaves me cold. Either the recipes are unappealing, or they require exotic ingredients that are difficult to find in this part of the country. Also, not a lot of content for the price. I would not buy this until I had browsed it in a regular bookstore. Two mistakes are enough."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oil Pressure Drop - Caution","review":"This oil filter uses extra pleats to achieve the extra filtration. Problem is there is a fine line between filtering the oil and restricting oil to the pump.

Having recently toured Fairlane Estate in Dearborn, I was interested in learning more about the woman who was instrumental in designing and building such an interesting house and gardens. I learned NOTHING from \\"Ford Bryan's\\" (if that's his real name) book. Mr. \\"Bryan\\" took incredible pains to record the details of every sales receipt and house purchase made by the Ford Family but there was literally nothing substantial about the people he was supposed to be writing about. If it wasn't for the pictures, we would have no idea what Henry or Clara even looked like! As for their personalities? A neighbor or two was quoted from probably some old letters or interviews but the book presents a huge family of one-dimensional, cardboard characters from the past. I suspect that Clara Bryant Ford was a woman worthy of an incredible biography.

I don't think the Inns or Cathedrals add much to the game. I mean the add an element of risk for big gain, but they could have been including with the main game, they don't add a new dynamic to the game like my favorite expansion, Builders and Traders.

The 6th color, grey is a bonus.B. The big meaple (The Bully) for each color is really fun. Do you lay him down and try to claim the middle farm, or do you save him and try to steal a key city? Great addition.C. The Inns take the formerly useless roads and make them relevant.D. The Cathedrals present you with a very interesting choice. Try for extra points or try and hose someone else.E. Extra tiles - Including one cool one with 4 end-caps.F. And last, the scoring tiles, which is a nice thought but not really needed.Overall, I Never play now without I&C;."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Must Buy to get 6 Players instead of only 5 and extras!","review":"Inns and Cathedrals is the best expansion to the main Carcasonne Game. It gives you the ability to play with 6 players instead of only 5, gives some cool new tiles, and adds a \\"large\\" follower for each player (played as a regular follower, but worth 2).In my opinion, this should have been included with the main Carcassonne Game.The tiles in MY pack had the EXACT same backing as the main game's tiles, with a tiny follower shaped mark on the front side to tell the tiles apart.So you can't tell which pack they are from when the tiles are face down."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Competitive Carcassonne Expansion","review":"This expansion Contains 18 new tiles, a new larger follower for each player (who counts as 2 followers), and a whole new set of gray pieces allowing for 6 players. This expansion is simple to learn, if you know how to play Carcassonne already it only takes a couple minutes to grasp the added elements.This expansion adds a new competitiveness to the game. The Larger piece allows for more stealing of farms cities and roads. The inns and Cathedrals allow you to double road points or triple city points, but also make incomplete roads and cities worthless. Early in the game the Inns and Cathedrals can greatly increase the value of your road or city, late in the game they can wipe out all the points you've been building up in that large city or long road you've been working on all game long. However if you merely interested in a \\"friendly\\" game this may not be the best expansion for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Inns and Cathedrals adds to Carcassonne fun","review":"Our family likes the Inns and Cathedrals addition to Carcassonne. It adds a little to the complexity, but it's still easy for a new player to learn the game. The cathedral tiles add suspense to the game. Even when a cathedral tile is drawn early, it can be a real challenge to finish a city with a cathedral. When drawn late in the game, the tile was sometimes used as a weapon to ruin another player's city."},{"rating":"2","title":"Yummy, Spicy, Puree First","review":"See title.

The book's infinite charts, tables, and figures are enough to drive you nuts. There are very few good photos. Our nursing teachers were regularly having to use other books to show us photographs of whatever we were studying. Also, after reading the material, I always felt like I didn't really know the material. If I really wanted to know the material well, I had to go study it in an Anatomy & Physiology book.I have looked at other Med/Surg books and prefer them, any of them, to this one.This book is more suited for the experienced nurse rather than the nursing student."},{"rating":"2","title":"My favorite bookin nursing school","review":"I love this book. While in nursing school, this was the most informative and easy to understand. After graduation, I allowed someone to borrow my book and they never returned it, so I checked with Amazon and they had it. I was so lucky to get it and will never lend it out again.

The speakers on the CD are NOT native speakers and their English accent is cringe worthy.

Brownlow is a great film historian and no mean director himself, having made the gorgeous Silent Era documentary \\"Hollywood\\" (is that ever coming out on DVD?!). His knowlege of real-world production lets him know just what questions to ask. The tone is very chatty, with so much quotage from Lean that it's half an autobiography. It reminded me of \\"Hitchcock/Truffaut\\", another filmmaker-to-filmmaker conversation. Mind you Truffaut didn't bother quite so much with Hitchcock's love affairs, but one can always skim. It looks intimidatingly massive but this is more because of the lavish illustrations than excessive wordiness.

None of the other surge protectors or breakers went off in the house. No damage to the wall or any equipment, but this surge protector was in an outlet with a metal cover plate - which is what I think saved the house from a fire. There were a few things plugged into it, but none of them were on besides two alarm clocks as we were out of the house.

Impossible to fix and by the time you get the darn thing out the box is completely destroyed and not a good candidate for return. These people are apparently selling a toy that has consistent defect in the rear left tail, making it unusable. It comes with a backup main wing but not tail.

I recently started substitute teaching (I do not have an education degree) and hoped that this book would provide insight into how to work with the kids, activities to use, discipline procedures, etc. Unfortunately this book only provides a very bare bones approach to subbing. Yes, it tells you what to expect, but all of the information included in the book is what you learn in a substitute orientation or even on your first day in the classroom. I found nothing useful. I was looking for a book with answers and suggestions, something that I could use to become a more succesful teacher, and all this book had was everything that anyone who has ever attended school or used to be a child should already know.

There are better books on the subject and there are better webpages on the subject. A note to people reading this review: When reading reviews, one should check the other reviews written by each reviewer.

It's hard not to like this CD. You'll be addicted to it, because you never get bored of it. The best way to listen to it: Random. That way, you don't have to listen to all the teen pop songs in a row (why do they do that?) or all the rock songs in a row (at the END of the album :( Everyone likes this album, so if you don't know what to get for a pre-teen, kid, teen or even an adult who listens to Top 40, this CD is the ultimate pick."},{"rating":"2","title":"AWESOME","review":"This is the perfect CD... almost. ... are the only bad applesof this CD.

And how many times do you buy a whole CD just for one song and then think, \\"Wow, I wish I could've just had this one song without the rest..\\" This is a great value and even though some tracks are not super popular, it's worth the money just to have a handful of your favorite hits all on one convenient place.

The only bands I'd even consider listening to from the ones assembled on Now! 5 are Nine Days, Everclear and 3 Doors Down... and the songs by these bands on this CD aren't even close to being their best ones. If you like the song \\"Wonderful\\" by Everclear, go and buy yourself the CD single... and pick up a copy of one of their earlier releases called \\"So Much For The Afterglow\\". 3 Doors Down and Nine Days fans will also do good to pick up the two bands' debut CD's rather than this horrible collection of teen pop."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awsome CD... one worth getting","review":"I own 4 out of the 5 Now CDs and so far this is the best one!

The songs are boring and painful to listen to, and there's nothing new- everything on it has been played to death on the radio so that they can package it up in some nice little plastic case and sell it.Anyway, I'm sick of hearing people say this is music. It's not- it's the most lame, terrible stuff that pop brings us these days.I'm not wasting my money on this. Are you?"},{"rating":"2","title":"NOW go buy it!","review":"NOW 3 had a bunch of songs and bands that I never heard of, and NOW 4 was heavily on the pop side with very little rock (thanks for at least putting \\"All the small things\\" in there). NOW 2 was a little too much on rock in my opinion. That being said, NOW 5 has a great balance of pop (N'sync, 98 degrees, ect.)and rock (three doors down, nine days). The only thing I would do to this CD was give it a couple of rap songs (incomplete instead of thong song?????). But, since i know that the CD is aimed toward kids as well as adults, I can live with what they give us. I woudl also like to say that if I could, I would rate this CD a 4.5, not just a 4.OVERALL: NOW 5 is a good CD with a nice balance of pop and rock and is worth your money.

However, this CD faces the same problem as many of the other NOW collections. By the time the CD is available in the stores, many of the \\"hip\\" songs are extremely overplayed. Either I own them on their original CD's, or I am so sick of them I can't handle hearing them one more time! This may not apply to everyone, but I've had this problem every time I've bought a NOW CD, even when I've done it right when they come out. This isn't a problem that can easily be solved, because obviously it takes a while to put a CD like this together, but before you buy this CD because it has has popular music, I would recommend looking at the list of songs and asking yourself how many you already have on other CD's and how many of the other ones you still WANT on CD!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best","review":"I am not a big fan of pop, R&B, and rock music, however... I do like a few songs. I bought this CD and I love it so much! I don't like Shake It Fast, Incomplete, or Aaron's Party. If I were to change it, I would remove those songs and replace them with a Christina Aguliera song, a Blink 182 song and Sisqo's Thong Song... Then it would be perfect!

It's a perfect blend of pop and rock."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Degeneration Of Society...","review":"When the first NOW came out, so long ago, it really was a good disc of catchy, diverse music.

Disposable music for a disposable society I suppose. None of these artists are going to be seen again within ten years except for on VH1's \\"Where Are They Now?.

What a waste of money for the consumer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just looking at the song list makes me queasy","review":"Sure, we've all heard these songs on the radio about 1 zillion times. But now -- a compilation of all of those overplayed songs together on one disk? Ugh. The problem with these \\"Now\\" cd's is that they come out too late - all the songs have already reached that \\"overplayed\\" state where when you hear them you want to lunge toward the radio and throw it at the wall. I mean I guess if you are TEN then maybe you can hear those songs over and over and not begin to HATE them. However, I myself do not have that ability. Therefore, I must say that if I ever receive this CD as a gift, it will be used as a coaster."},{"rating":"2","title":"A power packed set of hits","review":"I have Now volumes 2,3,4, and 5 in my collection.

I too would have liked to have Nelly's Country Grammer and the Baha Men's who let the dogs out. They would make this complete but this album is still great. It has N'sync, Backstreet Boys, 98 Degrees, Jessica Simpson, Mandy Moore and Aaron Carter for you who have pop tastes; Destiny's Child, Mya, Sisqo and Mistikal for R&B/Rap tastes; 9 Days, 3 Doors Down, Bon Jovi, and BBMack for your alternative tastes.There are some songs that I don't really care for, like Faded, or Don't Think I'm Not.

I will not take the time to thoroughly explain what is wrong with this CD, but there were some reviews, one in particular, that said that if you love music you will love this disc. I actually think that it is quite the opposite; in fact, if you love music, you will probably think that this disc if one of the most atrocious things ever impressed upon the public. But anyway, I'm sorry for taking up the time of people who truly love pop, people who are likely cursing the ground I walk on.

It is clearly and thoroughly illustrated, covers the theory of yoga in depth, and gives detailed explanations of how to apply yoga poses to different conditions. I would have liked a better index, but that is a minor quibble.

Yes the movie scenes were drawn out and the seldom placed saves spheres were annoying, but over all I loved the game. A very good plot.I was so excited to get X-2, as I started to play it, I became very disappointed. The game is more like playing a Britney Spears or the like genre game. I miss the other characters there was a balance of seriousness and goofy nonsense with a satisying plot. Here in X2 you use dress spheres?!? This is a game my daughter will play and I may have to bribe her on that since she wants to see Tidus again.FFX2 is a big let down. Only thing I can say is that the graphics are great and I can now skip the movie scenes if I wanted to.

They've turned Yuna into a pop-star, the characters get new abilities by changing dresses, and the battle system is \\"real-time\\" -- which I might have given more of a chance if it wasn't for the very disturbing dress-changing sequences and annoying character commentary.The game is 'girly' -- in the absolute worst, stereotypical, pink frilly dress kind of way. I'm disgusted to think that this is what is being marketed to young girls and that Square felt the need to replace Yuna's sweet serenity and maturity with this half-dressed pop-tart image.In my opinion, this game should not be considered a sequel to FFX.

I mean, what did they do to her character?! What happened to the serious, devoted Summoner in Final Fantasy X? Now we just have a girl who's a singing pop star! Okay, I like how she's looking for Tidus and all, but not her new wardrobe and personality. And what's the deal with the short shorts? It's like she threw away her staff and purple dress. I also did not like her appearance, she looked so much better in FFX. Her face was like, much more... pure?She's just so... open and direct.

After the first fifteen minutes of playing I thought it was like a charlie's angels video game (not praise) And Yuna, the polite, kind, Priestess that we knew from X has turned into a trigger-happy singer/hunter(?). Even the graphics seem to be worse compared to the last game.There is soo many plot holes in this game as well. I thought at the end of ten it was said that all the aeons were destroyed? And why is brother so obsessed with Yuna(a relative of his?) Why when you recieve an item does it say \\"Scored the key Item ...!\\" I'm gonna go to a used game store right now and sell this... I'm sticking with six and seven."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's really good!","review":"I love FFX, and I needed more closure than the ending it provided. FFX-2 was cute, but it's kind of shallow. The depth and maturity of FFX was gone, however it still was a blast to play.The best parts of the game are the musical performances, the fast-paced battles, and the \\"good\\" ending, which gives tons of closure to both FFX and FFX-2. The worst part is the irritating leveling up and learning abilities, which takes forever, but the New Game Plus feature is a nice bonus to help with that.Play it, it's short, it's fun. you really can't go wrong."},{"rating":"2","title":"If you're a FF Fan","review":"If you played FF X and liked it, you have to play FF X-2. The story continues with everyone from FF X. And not to spoil things, but you do get a chance to have a reunion with someone we thought was lost forever.I always play FF games, but I thought I wouldn't like the game because I heard Yuna was packin heat and runnin around like Laura Croft. That's so not FF material. But I soon fell in love with the game. However, I missed the aeons and having the ability to call upon any kind of powerful beings to come to my aid (Ifrit, Shiva, etc.). I think the dress sphere changing, that is supposed to replace calling upon aeons, can be annoying at times. And I think there weren't enough extra adventures (something that I do enjoy in a FF game).The story was great! I'm a sucker for a good plot and FF X-2 met my expectations. The positives outweigh the negatives in this game. If you respect FF games, you have to get this one. Is it worth it...YES!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Not Bad for The 1st Final Fantasy Sequel!","review":"I never imagined what would happen to everyone in FFX after the Eternal Calm. I assumed that, like in all the other FF games, they lived happily ever after. This game seems a little strange and young at first but keep playing. It will soon evolve into a more in-depth story. I know you may think that the new \\"dressphere\\" jobs are a little strange but it actully is a great way to play (although it can only work with female-leads). I give the graphics another 4 and 1/2 stars, like the first, and the storyline the same."},{"rating":"1","title":"Algo decepcionado...","review":"estoy algo decepcionado del juego, cambia \\"todo\\" o casi todo las reglas del FFX, nisiquiera sale un instante el novio de Yuna, las chika comienzan con un nivel tan bajo, y yuna sin usar sus Summon, bueno en mi perpectiva perdio muchas caracteristicas buenas del FFX."},{"rating":"1","title":"FF X-2, game sucks","review":"I read a lot of reviews on FF X-2, and though I love FF games, well lets say X-2 sucked and bad, and I am a female, and I though this game is not interesting. I gave the game back to game stop. FF X is a great game, but I don't know what happened in FF X-2.There are a lot of stupid side quest, which I could not stand. It drove me nuts.The game characters looked really weird in my opinion.I didn't think the graphics were all the great, ok I guess, and the story line sucked. I did not enjoy the battle system.I would highly recommend renting FF X-2, before you buy this game."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too much girl power, sexism, and gloating from the girls.","review":"This game a was a let-down. Final Fantasy X; it's prequel, was a lot better than this game full of sexism and girl power.The male characters in No. 10 were awesome! Tidus, Wakka, Auron, now there you have power and ability to kiss ass!! But this, you have 3 girls who are the ONLY characters you control in the game. With all the buitt-kicking like the way 3 girlsw did in Charlie's Angels, it turns me off. I'm a guy so I find it very insulting for these small-waisted, love to dress up, over-bearing pride acting, and physically not that big and should'nt be able to beat guys up that are twice their size EXTRMEELY insulting!!The only reason I keep playing this game is because Tidus will eventually show up and he's one of the cool guys from No. 10.This is a game to make girls feel good and to make guys like me feel like sayin \\"What about me?\\". Final Fantasy X-2 is way to 'in your face'."},{"rating":"1","title":"Holy Crap.","review":"I loved FFX, so much so that I squealed in delight to hear that there was a second game, just waiting for me to happily give my money to see what had befallen Tidus.I restate my title- Holy Crap.There is nothing about this game that I enjoyed. The story line is weak, the characters fail to live up to their personalities that were originally portreyed in FFX, and the music makes me feel like I need to strangle someone.While I was happy that the characters were finally allowed to climb/jump, and while some of the cut scenes in the game were breathtaking, this is overall a very dissapointing game."},{"rating":"1","title":"A disappointment from Square","review":"I love all of the previous Final Fantasy games. They all have a good storyline along with excellent gameplay. Final Fantasy X-2 ends that streak though. The idea of continuing with a story from an earlier game is good, but they definitely picked the wrong one to go with. Wouldn't it have been much cooler to see Cloud and the aftermath of FF VII? The story is just terribly uninteresting in this game. What I absolutely hated was the amount of \\"humor\\" that they tried to put in. I felt like this game was geared more toward 14-year-old girls than to the gamers who have been playing FF all along. Rikku and Brother are the two most annoying characters ever to be in a game. I couldn't stand listening or seeing either one of them. This was the first FF game that I didn't play through a second time. I didn't get the good ending where Tidus comes back, but then again, I didn't care. I hate to say it, but I just wanted it to get over with. Please, do not buy this game."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's not a video game, but a movie.","review":"The Final Fantasy series is the best roleplaying game series there is. If you like roleplaying video games, you'll love this game. However, this is an indictment of roleplaying games, because this game, well, stinks.In essence, here's how the game works. First, you watch a little CGI sci-fi movie. Then, you scroll through some menus and hit some buttons. If you didn't pick the right buttons on time, you die, and have to start over. If you pick the right buttons, you get to watch another little CGI sci-fi movie. This process is repeated for about 40 hours until you win. (I guess it takes 40 hours. I didn't stick around to find out.)What you purchase when you purchase this game is not really a video game, but a mediocre sci-fi movie, a movie which takes a lot of effort to get to see the ending of. If you want to watch a sci-fi movie, go rent on. If you want to play a video game, play something else."},{"rating":"2","title":"final fantasy","review":"Okay, first off, FFX was NOT the first game to star a female character as the hero, Look at FF6 (ff3 in japan), Terra was the lead character throughout the entire game. 2nd, If you think the \\"Job system\\" is not final fantasy, you're wrong, because it is, and always has been. MANY of the early FF's used it, FF11 uses it and FFTactics did also.Now that that's out of the way, I think the game is going to be great, one of the VERY best, never to be forgotten for years to come. I mean, after all it's the first sequal ever for a FF game and FFX was the first FF for the PS2, it just makes perfect sense! :) As for Tidus not being a main character in the game, who knows... there may be another coming as well. *cheers* to FFx-3! (Maybe ;))"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disgusting","review":"I am very disapointed with this game. FFX was pretty good though some of the scenes were cheesy...With FFX-2 all you get is ditzy chicks with stupid oneliner. No joke...Paine says \\"Ice, Ice, baby\\" when she casts Blizzard... This game was supposed to be geared toward women, but instead its just insulting. The three main characters act like bratty 12 year olds. They are supposed to be 19 and 20! Rikku is the most annoying of them all...all she does is whine in a high pitched voice. The dress sphere idea is completely idiotic. They can change dress spheres in the middle of a battle! Overall its a waste of money. If you can borrow it, maybe give it a try...but dont buy it...."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rpg fans beware. This game will disgust you.","review":"I was skeptical of this game from the start, but I bought it anyway because games with female lead character's amuse me. Let's see what was good about this game.........................................................................................................................................NOTHING!!!! A game where all you do is run around and play dress up. WOW!!! That will appeal to masses ( If your a 12 year old girl ). Any rpg fanatic like me has nothing but respect for Squaresoft and the Final Fantasy series, but my respect level has gone down a few points. I'm sure Squaresoft will be more careful in the future after the horrible reviews this game has received ( I was surprised to see there were actually some high reviews on this game here at amazon ). But no one who knows what good rpg's are all about will give this game a good review. Talking about this game makes me lose my temper so I'm going to quit now."},{"rating":"2","title":"A True Review","review":"This game was beauiful. Unlike the other FFs this game only had three playable characters but with the DRESS SPHERE changes it seemed like their were more than enough characters. I did finsh this game with only 64% of it completed. The last boss was my only disapointment not to ruin the story we will just say \\"it\\" was very easy. \\"It\\" didn't even knock out one of my character during battle. However I did rate this game a 4 out of 5 best game out this season!"},{"rating":"2","title":"can't wait 4 the most expected sequal","review":"I have played most of the games in the FF serise, excluding, FF1, FF2, and FF7. To me FFX had the most replay value and originality. The closters of trials were a very unique was of putting puzzles in the game. I am very pleased that Yuna is now a main character and that she isnt a weakling.I'm thrilled that the job system is back. the games with the job system were and will always be my favorite."},{"rating":"2","title":"READ PLEASE!","review":"I LOVE this game and Final Fantasy x!

All that I know about now is that Yuna and Rikku (and later in the game, Paine) set out through Spira in the exact same places in FFX to find Tidus, who has been held captive since he disapeared in FFX, by some rival company. Of course, they all look different, and I think that Yuna will be a surprize to people who haven't seen her yet............"},{"rating":"1","title":"This sucks toe corn","review":"This is the most ridiculously stupid game er RPG I have ever played. I would say everything about it sucks but the battle system is kinda cool accept it kinda kills it with the irritating class changing thing. To sum it all up the characters are crap and they remind me of Charlies Angels on stereroids. There voice acting is also pretty pitiful. The story sux because you have to go through half the game until you actually know what your trying to do, and the music is pretty crappy because it sounds like a friggin jazz/wannabe Meriachi band. O and whats up with the 3 main and ONLY characers bein female. They should have atleast brought Auron back or something. In fact this game sux so much I went out of my way to right a review on it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Super!","review":"Wow! I love this game. I'm sure it isn't as good as the last one, but this sequel will make your head spin because of it's realistic graphics!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a Final Fantasy","review":"While the graphics are pretty and the premise somewhat fun this game is more like dress-up. Contantly changing dressspheres and utterly chaotic battles take away from the technical gamer. Those looking for a story will be dissapointed as there isn't much of one . Much is left unanswered and there are many inconsistencies between this game and its' supposed prequel. The music is simply painful. This isn't a game for gamers or for people who like Final Fantasy. It's more like a game for a 13yr old girl (most of whom aren't gamers). I would avoid like the plague."},{"rating":"1","title":"Strike for Square","review":"This game is just, well, cheesy. It captures none of the grandiose nature of the Final Fantasy series. There is no breathtaking world to explore, no sense of danger or need to succeed. It really has a half-baked plot you only discover toward the end of the game. This game is aimed much more at the Spice girls/Charlies angels fanclubs than fans of the FF series. I'm just not impressed. I'm still not sure if the $15 I spent on the game was worth it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Different From FFX","review":"Let me begin by saying that this game is very different from FFX. Do not expect an epic story here. And the battle system is drastically different. All three of the main characters are females. The story takes place in Spira. Yuna, Rikky, and a new character, Paine are Sphere Hunters. They travel all over the continenct searching for these artifacts. The story is very lightweight and definitely not engaging. However, the game is not a bad RPG. If you simply just want to pass the time and play an RPG, then this game will do. Just do not expect it to be anywhere near as good as FFX. In my view, there are many other superior RPGs out there that should be first on your list."},{"rating":"1","title":"It hurt to play this.","review":"Wow. What to say. When I heard FFX was going to have a sequel I was excited... till it came out. FFX-2 consists of the player (who plays as Yuna) running around Spira with Riku and Paine 2 years after the events of FFX. The new costumes of the trio are skimpy (Yuna with her hot pants and Riku managing to fit into an even smaller outfit than what she had in FFX). The music is a weird 70's-marching band-techno which gets very annoying, and I don't even remember the plot because it lacked in having one. They managed to sneek in some scary pop-princess moments, with Yuna singing two pop-tacular songs in the game, and a lot of annoying \\"Alright!\\" \\"We did it!\\" *jump and high-five* kind of dialouge. The characters where plain and none really stood out like in past FF games.If you have any respect for FFX, don't play this game. Yet if you want to play it, rent it before wasting more money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ultimate","review":"Passing this game up should be a...Sin. ;) honestly, great game and it concludes the final fantasy X story. The story line is great, the dresspheres are rather different than the typical \\"job\\" category, and the overall fun that comes with the game is hard to beat. Definitely one of my all time favorite games."},{"rating":"2","title":"Final Fantasy X-2","review":"It has a cool story-line, but I don't really like that there are only 3 characters in the whole game. I also think the sphere system is awesome. The new battle system is pretty good too, but on wait and active battle style it acts the same."},{"rating":"1","title":"I really -wanted- to like this.","review":"This isn't the game they said it would be. Despite preview's promise of this being a non-liner mission-based FF (which is partially true). The percentage completion system is set up in such a linear way, it is nearly impsossible to even get 99% in your first playthrough, and impossible to get 100% w/o some sort of strategy guide due to the arbirartry nature of the linear story.The female characters are occasionally nice to look at, but that's not a reason to play a game. (real women are better) Levelling up is dull, and there's not enough reason to switch out of different dress spheres once you've mastered the abilities.In short, this game doesn't have the 'fun' 'story' or sense of \\"I must collect every item\\" that previous Final Fantasies brought to me. It's a struggle to make myself even finish this game, and for me that's a lot."},{"rating":"1","title":"Squaresoft has lost its mind","review":"10-2 was the worst final fantasy in the whole series i mean changing clothes..... its just outta da question if your looking for a real RPG try 7,9 or 10-1 nice graphs though"},{"rating":"2","title":"Is Square's FFX-2 a giant leap ahead? Or a stumble back?","review":"To start out, I am a big fan of Square and have unwavering loyalty to them, seeing as I sat through through the ill-fated FFIX. This is everything X was, and more. One of my favorite things about FFX was the costume changing. At first, it seemed to me to be just a last-minute feature thrown in for good measure. Over time though, I saw the need for this. I'm glad to see that Square brought this back. I must say though, what in the name of all that is good and true do high caliber, automatic side arms have to do with alchemy?? Also, I'll never be able to get my head around the fact that Yuna's gunner costume makes here look like a bad Lara Croft wannabe.All this aside, FFX-2 is a quality RPG, exactly what I, and many other Final Fantasy fans, have come to expect from Square. Good job, and I eagerly await the release of Kingdom Hearts 2, due out in the next year or so."},{"rating":"1","title":"You're not Yuna, what happend to Yuna?","review":"What happened to the calm, collective, selfless, and lovable girl that made Final Fantasy X so enjoyable? Instead I'm confronted with an over abundance of sexual imagery, a homo-erotic airship driver, and some goth with no backstory.Truth is, I played this game nearly half way through waiting and dreaming of the moment in which Yuna's old personality would emerge. Over 20 hours of playtime, I only noticed it twice. The only thing left of Yuna is the voice.I consider myself a closet diehard FFX fan. I know FFX front to back, piece by piece, philosophy to Yevon doctrine. Call it a guilty pleasure, but where is my dream girl? She died along with Tidus."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the Final Fantasy I love","review":"I found this game used at a local store and was pretty excited to play it. Since I'm getting back into gaming and loved Final Fantasy I gave it a try. Wish I hadn't. I'm glad I only paid $10 for this game. Firstly I think the designers were obsessed with hot almost naked girls. It starts off with a concert, what's that about, and then goes into obnoxious interactions between the girls. And all the while I'm not really listening just trying to figure out why do these girls have to be so stupid sounding and so unclothed. It was a bit much. I played for a few hours and still just really couldn't get into. I wouldn't recommend this game to anyone unless you are wanting to look at hot imaginary game girls."},{"rating":"1","title":"BRATZ version of Final Fantasy X","review":"I am not a follower of the FF game line, however I do enjoy linear game play (ie LOTR: The Third Age). I picked up FFX on lark, and fell in love with it! Getting closer to the end of the game, and hearing there was a sequel, I had to try it!I finished FF X, and excitedly put in FF X-2. Then my jaw dropped to the floor and I almost wept.If you enjoyed FF X, this is NOTHING like it! The battle mode is confusing and messy, the sphere grid is gone and replaced with some type of \\"barbie dress-up\\" spheregrid. The music is beyond annoying and so are the childish antics and attitudes of the characters.I played about 35 minutes and couldn't stomach it anymore....my best advice would be to rent this first to see if it is a style you would enjoy."},{"rating":"2","title":"AMAZING!","review":"Great.Great.Great.Great.Great.Great.Great.Great.Great.Great and once again Great.

Are you just going to trust their words, I mean you haven't even triend the thing so you cannot judge it by other people's ratings. I love the game, and the FMV's(Full Motion Video) are just GREAT! The intro is awsome where Yuna, the main character starts singing on stage(Real Emotion and 1000 words are sang by Jade from SweetBox.) singing Real Emotion, but too bad it was- ergh. I don't want to spoil it for you! But my favorite character is Rikku, and also if you buy the stragety guide, you can master the game, well in a few trys at least! At least rent the game and try it, if you like it buy it!

I am far into it, and it seems like it's getting worse. I think SquareSoft(Enix) has gone to crap. They keep making games worse. In ten 2, they change the characters personalities way too much. Yuna drops her spiritual beliefs and becomes a singer. How dumb is that! There also aren't too many new enemies, they look kinda the same. You also can only use three characters, and they all are chicks. No offense, chicks can fight, but you always need a badass guy (like Auron) to be there. To Square Enix, change your name back because it was sweet. Also stop making dumb sequels that don't make sense with the original. Stop making FF XI, cause I'm pretty sure that it will suck. Leave the online adventures to Everquest (which I don't like anyways). The best idea I can suggest is to remake FF VII for the PS2 with advanced graphics and gameplay, but keeping everything else the same. That game was the best."},{"rating":"1","title":"bad","review":"From what I have heard it sounds really bad. I mean heck why would they even want to make a sequal for a good game. And its stupid you can't have most of the characters from the other game but there are only a few new characters and Yuna can't even summon anymore. And some new girl character which her name is pronounced as like some food but i forget. I would say that this will be a very bad game, Final Fantasy X was very good but when Auron and Tidus died it kinda makes it so a sequal would be stupid to have. Bad bad game do not get it but this game will either be very bad or very good so I might be wrong."},{"rating":"1","title":"This game sucks","review":"I thought the first ffx sucked but now I have seen the worst. If a game has a crappy story then it is no good. You only play as three characters. Yuna is no where near as good as she was in the first game. All this is about is Yuna looking for her boyfriend.

I bought version X-2 and could barely make it through the 5 minute introdution, which was some Japanese girl in skimpy clothes singing. The beginning of the real game wasn't much better. I'm sure the game has all sorts of things that make you guys love it, and that's great, but for folks who like D&D, Tolkien, and that sort of game, being thrown into a world where the main character is a teenage Japenese girl wearing short shorts, a halter top, and cleavage - oh yeah, and who giggles - was just too much for me. Even my nephews who LOVED the earlier Final Fantasies were laughing at how bizarre this one was.

For shame squaresoft for shame.i suggest anyone who wants a good FF game go out and pick up a used ff vii cause thats squaresoft at its best,this is trash"},{"rating":"1","title":"This game needs work.","review":"THe battle is awesome and everything. Takes time to get use to. But overall. Its crap. I love final fantasy but this one is one they should have just not sold. Not worth the cash. Stick with FF 11"},{"rating":"1","title":"Good, though highly flawed.","review":"As I see it, the charm of the Final Fantasy series lies in it's labyrinthine plots, and in the almost unique ability of the games to develop their main caracters' personalities.However, I found the main caracters in FFX-2 totally unlikeable, since the dialogue made me cringe every second scene (It's hard to like people when they use expressions like \\"heave-ho\\" and \\"disasteriffic\\").The all-female cast came across as juvenile, and square-enix replaced the ambient, atomspheric music of FFX-2's predecessors with bubble-gum pop. Over all, the game has a light-hearted, almost camp feel to it.Having said all that, the FFX-2 can top all the rest in other areas. Fights are faster and have a more fluid feel to them, and the game comes with the usual incredible visuals associated with the final fantasy name.I would recommend this game, but with the warning that it lacks the subtlety and darkness of previous final fantasy games. Buy it, but keep the receipt."},{"rating":"2","title":"If its as Good as Final Fantasy X then go for it","review":"i played final fantasy X a year ago and i beat it to the full and i must say that final fantasy x is one of the better games of the year now that they are making a sequel the true pop question is will it be great or will it suck well my opinion is this game took 2 years to be realeased that must and only mean it will be great this will be a must buy for all rpg gamers"},{"rating":"2","title":"a sequel is born.","review":"A year ago,when i found out square enix was going to make a sequel about final fantasy X,i was shocked!I mean this is going to be the best final fantasy game I ever played.There are a few new surprises in the game,such as the Active Time Battle,the new jumping abiltiy,and the new Job Wheel,which dresses can be changed from in battle and out.This is going to be the best.Not only me,but all the final fantasy fans out there."},{"rating":"1","title":"boring,corny, and plain stupid","review":"what complete waste of money, its 10x worse than the first ffxits boring, reading a book is funner than this game"},{"rating":"1","title":"Almost dissapointing.","review":"I just have to say that I played Final Fantasy 10 twice and I loved every minute of it and cried both times. So naturally I was excited to see if Tidus returns in 10-2. The game goofy at best. There is a respectable storyline if you can ignore all the almost pointless (yet required) sidequests like making monkeys fall in love to get tourists out of Zanarkand. I would recommend to anyone willing to play this game (and trust me it will test your love of the game) to look up at least how to see the \\"Good\\" Ending when reaching the end. The \\"Common\\" ending is just terribly dissapointing. I'd love to say I loved this game as much as the first, but I spent waaay too much time solving crime for the Al Bhed and digging in the desert to really say it was good."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Game","review":"I recently recieved my new Playstation magizine and contained a demo of Final Fantasy X-2. Although a good game it seemed a little flawed from the demo disk. For one thing the battles were extremly easy. There was no difficulty at all. Even the battle with Bahument. I mean come on. Also the missions provided on the demo disk seemed slighty easy. Maybe the real game will be more difficult but im only reviewing the demo here. So although this game as its apparent weaknesses like i stated i will still be one of the people waiting to buy this game the day it comes out."},{"rating":"2","title":"Evidence","review":"Hmmm, let's see. To me, and I think most people would agree, what made ffx great was three things: unique characters, the grid sphere leveling system, and the aeon combat. What about the plot? Kill a giant monster to save the world? yea, it wasnt that great. Sure the graphics help, but in this sequel all three things named above are being radically changed. A new line up of characters is being put together, the grid sphere's being trashed, and any word on yuna still summoning aeons(seeing as they're dead). I'm not saying it's not gonna be great but all these kids shooting their mouths off about how great it'll be without any frame of reference. Just thought i lay out the evidence without bias."},{"rating":"1","title":"This game is crap. Period.","review":"I waited 2 months for this game to come out.

I played the 1st FFX, which wasn't to bad, but neede some improvments. This game however, really disappointed me. This is like a fantasy version of charlie's angels. I knew it was going to be girly from the start, but I thought they would actually DO SOMETHING, not sit around and giggle all the time. This is just blah, so don't get it if you like good characters and story lines. Rikku and Yuna are like bounty hunters and I really can't say I like the new character, Pain, because her name stands for what she is, a pain. So, my advice to you is, rent this game if you really want to play it, but don't waist 40 bucks."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dissapointing....","review":"Ok i may not be the one to talk because i had never played a ff game before but this game really blew it. It seemed more like a little girls doll game.

Square, WHY DID YOU MAKE THIS PATHETIC EXCUSE FOR A GAME!!! the one thing that pisses me off about this is that there are SO MANY DARN SIDEQUESTS! It took me about an hour after completing a sidequest to get back to the main story, wich isn't much of a story at all. Also, in FFX, Yuna was quiet and somewhat mysterious, and now she's a friggin pop singer! WHAT THE HECK IS UP WITH THAT? The battle system with the dresspheres is, to my taste, CRAP. the only good thing is the awesome cinematics. And where's Tidus? And Lulu? Sure, keep the hyperactive girl with a single-digit IQ and the weird summoner and leave out that ball-chucking guy from FFX (forgot his name) All in all, this game sucks."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great game hidden by a bad presentation","review":"Final Fantasy X-2 is a direct sequel to Final Fantasy X.

Final Fantasy is known for story and there simply isnt one here. Second, the game feels more like a episode of a modern charlies angels than final fantasy game.

Yes, I am a man, I like looking at good looking women when I'm playing games. But this is just foolish. The main characters act as if they are 12. The game is marketed towards 14-17yr old horny boys. I loved FF5-9, but this is just sick. Why can't Square make a good oldschool FF. Heck, if they took FF6 and redid it with the new graphics, maybe tweak the plot a little bit to give it a little new jazz for old school FF people. The job system is nice, (FFX had the worst leveling system ever...), but they couldn't just call it \\"Jobs\\" no, they had to call it \\"Dress Spheres\\"...More crap thrown in.

I beat the game with 56% of the game completed and was surprised to how easy it was to beat the final boss. The game itself was had great graphics. I enjoyed it but it left me wondering if its time to hang up the there shoes at 12. Final Fantasy 8 was there best work."},{"rating":"2","title":"great game","review":"this game is much different from FFX. actually, this game doesn't look like RPG. the storyline isn't straight coz there are so many missions to be completed besides its storyline. There are 3 different endings, so u can play it more than once if u wanna get all those endings. this game has more fun than previous FFs coz there're so many mini games and sidequests to play. however, this game is more difficult since the enemies can attack your characters while u're choosing the command. so, u have to choose the command as fast as u can. This game is also confusing because i dunno how to manage the dressspheres. there are so many dressspheres and garment grids, and each dressshpere and each garment grid have specific ability.WARNING: If u like men to be the main characters DON'T BUY THIS GAME!!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Big Let Down","review":"This game is by far the worst Final Fantasy game. I liked every other one. I am open minded with RPGs and applaud people for doing new things, but this game falls way short. If you like the minigames in FF games, this is your game. If you like to go to the same places over and over and over again, this is your game. If you like to play dressup and you like to play games with little story, this is your game. If you like pop music videos in the middle of the game or like minigames where you practice dancing or give someone a massage, this is your game.

Final Fantasy X-2 just has missions where they go around the world and find spheres...It's just not a great story that I could get wrapped up in. =(Don't get me wrong! I'm a HUGE final fantasy fan...I just couldn't get caught up in this story. I know I'm not too helpful. O_o It's kind of difficult to explain.

What sequel?","review":"This game was ridiculous and I was EXTREMELY disappointed with it. Being a huge fan of FFX, I was stoked for part two. Then, just with the intro of the game, I was pissed. This game blows. It's like Britney Spears designed a game and then threw up bubble gum on it while girls threw glitter in the air. This game is so girly and so overwhelmingly in direct contrast to the characters we used to know that I kept asking \\"What the hell is going on?\\" Since when have popstars been in the history of Spira?

This game is a watered down, half baked wet dream of someone's. It's obviouse that no real thought went into the plot. And no real work went into the making.Send a message to Square. If you're going to make a sequal, don't just ride on the first games popularity, put some heart into it!

As an avid final fantasy fan I immediatly jumped on this game as soon as it came out, but was grossly dissapointed. The characters they reused from the first game were perverted in the sense that they were grossly changed (ex. costumes were made emensly slutty) and the story plot was WEAK. In addition to this, I was able to beat the game in less than a month! And by only holding down the x button during all battles none the lesss!

Yuna is looking for Tidus after the events of Final fantasy 12 and finally recieves a lead in the form of a video sphere. Sounds like a good setup but its not. From there things just go downhill. A friend of mine once had trouble beating a boss so i told him \\"just hold down the x button and they will manually attack\\" and this actually worked for the entire game. X-2 is a standard turn based rpg except the characters all move and attack alot faster than usual. There is a job class system that also changes the characters's clothes. The dressup/job system is actually fairly entertaining as you can switch classes during battle and gain new jobs. That said the gameplay isn't very original, the voiceacting is just as bad as before(rikku is still annoying), and Yuna became a ho. This game is the actual reason why square doesn't repeat a story in the final fantasy series; sequels always suck"},{"rating":"1","title":"this game blows","review":"this game is horrible. it has horrible controls horrible gameplay and horrible voiceacting. all this game is a game where you get annoyed every five seconds by another misreable characther. great elements of play hmm i cant name any. dont get this game instead try jak 2. it looks as good as final fantasy x-2 but plays and sounds wayyyyyyyyyyy better. oh and by the way any boys here should be ashamed they even want the game. yo this is definitely a girls game."},{"rating":"2","title":"its ok","review":"hello im here to tell you about this game. This game is ok nad not that great. the only reason i got it is because i like final fantasy and im trying to get the whole collections. the graphics good, the story ok, the characters suck. the characters are so annoying, but the battle system kept me playing.Also this game doesn't have the famous theme song after you win a battle(if your a real final fantasy person you know what i'm talking about). if your a noob at the ff series this is a good game to get, but for all you ff pros dont bother unless you want the whole sereies. the best ff game is ff7"},{"rating":"2","title":"finally!! a sequal to a incomplete game!!","review":"i have played final fantasy X and i thought it was a good game but not a great game. the ending was just way to incomplete and it ended on the tragic side. i'm happy that square or square-enix made a sequal to FFX so that they could further explain what happened to tidus at the very end and yuna's journey after sin. this game i think, is going to be very good and will clear up the doubts that a lot of people had about the ending of FFX. FFX-2 is sorta going to have the final fantasy tactics job system + the crono cross style game endings (meaning you will have to play the game more than once to achieve the ultimate ending). the battles will again be using the active time instead of the count-time system. i am extremely excited for this game and hope that it'll clear up all of my questions about yuna and tidus."},{"rating":"1","title":"Final Fantasy X is far superior...","review":"Simply put, this game is no comparison to Final Fantasy X. Final Fantasy X-2 is a disgrace to the entire series. first of all, there are only three playable characters, Yuna, Rikku, and Paine compared to the several characters on the other Final Fantasy games. Compared to FFX, X-2 has no aeons, overdrives, overkills, and no sphere grid. There is only a grid for clothing to change the characters' clothes and types. The storyline to X-2 is also pathetic, the girls are just trying to find spheres in hopes of finding Tidus from FFX. All in all, this game is a HUGE disappointment and I recommend renting this game before buying it."},{"rating":"1","title":"square cant make rpgs any more","review":"ok square really has done it this time ffx [was really bad]if i wanted ta watch a movie ill go rent one thats all the last few have ben. big cgi movies and no game play at all the last good one they made that was balanced was 7 . face it square isnt trying any more soon itll be just hittin a button for hrs jsut ta see a stupied cgi movie. the only 2 good ff that are around are the first and 6 thats it square please stop making movies on video game sysems and make a good game."},{"rating":"1","title":"FFX-2 ruins a classic tragedy!","review":"Imagine if they made Romeo and Juliet 2, and they had Romeo and Juliet come back to life and live happily ever after. Now you know what Final Fantasy X-2 is all about.Now that I know how FFX-2 turns out, I don't have need to keep my original FFX copy that I always thought of as a classic treasure. FFX had a definite ending, and realistically it was about one thing, a tragic romance. When FFX-2 was announced, I think it was obvious how it would turn out, and it does turn out that way. I was a bit surprised that the developers of the game where this predictable. I kept telling myself, something else has to happen, it can't turn out like a Disney fairytale, but deep down inside I think I knew it.Anyway, as far as I'm concerned I just needed confirmation that this was true, so that I wouldn't waste my time playing the game.

Ok the graphics are better so what! In my opinion a good final fantasy game would have a GOOD story line that intrigued you and kept you playing. This game on the other hand takes you on a journey of the sphere hunter yuna(who they degraded from final fantasy X as a high summoner to a shallow teenager) and her cute little friends looking for spheres for her lost boyfriend. Most of the game consists of side quests. You want to know why they are called side quests because they are not the game itself they are things to do on the side! Furthermore you can not even control the camera angle in the game. This games target audience seems to be jr. high teenage girls. I truthfully can not see how any gamer would enjoy this game."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wonderful, if you are an 11 year old girl.","review":"I am female and purchased this game because I liked Final Fantasy X so much.

You run around using difficult controls, bad camera angles and even worse fighting sequences. Come on, if your gonna battle then battle. You have to stand there and get hit (just like all of the other FF's), then when you finally choose the attack you want to do you've already lost alot of life. Next, the voice acting. The worst I've ever seen (well, besides Sonic Adventure 2 Battle that is). And whats with the Charlie's Angel's theme? Three girls battling evil. Uh, Square Enix, thats already taken, but nice try.

It is a game for two players. Recommended for ages 10+. I think younger kids could learn it if they are patient.Players build the playing area with tiles that must match up correctly. You collect pieces as you move that are worth points and some also have special abilities. The winner is the one who has the most points at the end of the game.There is some stragety involved since you get to choose how to place the tiles but there is also some luck with what points you get.The way you play the game doesn't have anything to do with Lord of the Rings, but the characters are from the story."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing really new.","review":"I bought this book in hopes to getting real inside information.

Burped and spit out globs of paint periodically during the first use, especially when paint level got down to about a third of the cup. This is probably due to the filter on the uptake being too tall, so that air is drawn in. That's a serious design flaw.

Not only is the pan so heavy that it's difficult to move around, but the design is completely flawed. On the grill side, the ridges are so deep that any non-stick coating you use (oil, spray, butter) sits down in the troughs and none remains on the top of the ridges to keep your meats from sticking. It literally ravages the meat because it sticks to the pan. On the griddle side, it's the same problem, the butter drains down into the well around the border of the griddle, little to none remains on the flat surface and everything sticks and burns. Ruins pancakes. A truly non-functional piece of kitchen equipment."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointed","review":"I love Emeril and expected this grill to be awesome.

Unfortunately, it is warped and doesn't sit flat on my cook surface. Pressing on one corner and the opposite corner raises about 1/2 to 3/4 of an inch. Lack of quality control. It heats well enough, but may be relegated to a campfire cookware since warping won't really be noticed. I don't care for the 'grill' side since the groves are so deep it makes cleaning and drying (crucial to cast ironware) difficult. The handles are flush with the cook surface making picking up a knuckle burn hazard and dumping grease a mess (grease channels is too small/narrow). Coating is very rough and not suitable for 'fragile' cook items such as fried eggs over easy.Overall not impressed, the design isn't well thought out (handles, grease channel and grill groves). Lodge does a much better job with their cookware, though I don't believe they make a similar shaped item."},{"rating":"1","title":"Quality Concerns - Cracked almost in half before 1st real use...","review":"My gf and I just bought this product tonight from Bed Bath & Beyond, and after cleaning it and placing it on the stovetop to begin to preheat, it made a loud popping noise which ended up being due to it cracking almost in half. We didn't even get the opportunity to try it out to comment on how well and evenly it cooks. We refuse to chance using it at all with a crack in its structure.

We own several pieces of cast iron cookware and I love it. Thank goodness for BB&B's return policy, since this griddle does not heat evenly at all. We tried using it several times and got awful results with half burned/half raw eggs and pancakes. This griddle has a weird finish and I would not personally venture to call it true cast iron. For the same price you can buy something made in the USA versus this one, which is made in China of questionable materials and therefore substandard results.

It cooked very unevenly (the left side of a 4-inch pancake was almost burned, while the right side was practically raw) and the pancakes stuck, even though it is supposed to be preseasoned (it's cast iron) and I heated it first before applying a light coat of vegetable oil. It also did not sit securely on my gas stove, due to the 'grill' ridges on the other side -- it rocks back and forth slightly--even thought the box says it is suitable for all cooking surfaces except glass.Because I use my griddle almost every weekend, I am considering the Broil King Ultra Large electric giddle, which got Cook's Illustrated top recommendation in its 2003 tests."},{"rating":"1","title":"junk","review":"gift for friend and it has a crack in it after only a few uses!do not reccommend emerilware cast iron griddle"},{"rating":"1","title":"Cracked cast iron griddle","review":"I own a small cast iron skillet that I love and keep very well seasoned.

I had it on my electric burner on med-high and heard a pop sound. I couldn't figure out what it was. And then I heard it again and saw that the griddle had a crack in the middle of it.

If you like this song and you haven't seen \\"Pretty In Pink\\" yet, you need to. There is a great scene where Jon Cryer is lip synching and dancing to this song. It's too bad he's not still around. His music will always be remembered."},{"rating":"2","title":"Otis Redding lives forever!","review":"Ah, Otis Redding. The man is incredible! Whenever I hear \\"Try a Little Tenderness\\" it makes get up and dance! It's a very rousing soulful song, as all of the other songs on this cd album. Otis has the kind of voice that no one possesses at all. He usually starts singing tenderly on most of his songs, then he goes into a soulful frenzy like he's in a Baptist church. If you get this cd, you must get his \\"live\\" album \\"Live In Europe\\". It's one of the best live albums ever produced."},{"rating":"2","title":"Klein Tool 650 Cushion-Grip Scratch awl with 3-1/2 inch shank","review":"I received item in excellent condition and in a timely manner.

A lot of the commentary has nothing to do with Near East customs, but is based on the teachings of the Unity Church.

I grew up on Monopoly and Sorry (they pale in comparison). I then purchased Ticket to Ride and now Puerto Rico. They are amazing games. Two of my sons play these games with me and they can't get enough. We have hooked our extended family as well.Puerto Rico cannot be won the same way every time. Each decision you make has an effect on the next. As well, the timing of your opponents decisions force you to react and adjust your game plan. Do I purchase a building or bring in more workers? Should I trade or ship my goods?"},{"rating":"2","title":"it's all about strategy","review":"Great game, once you and your closest 3-4 friends learn how to play. I have found only two down sides to this game 1. It literary takes a little over two hours just to get through the rules, but only 45min. to play the actual game. 2. Lots of little pieces to the game to keep track of, which makes for a long set up time. However, having said all that, it is a blast to play. Some luck, but lots of strategy involved."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not balanced enough","review":"After playing this game many times, I now realize that some buildings in this game are not balanced. The Hacienda is an example of a building that is too strong, and the observatory (I believe) as a building that is too weak for how expensive it is. The expansion is a good way to introduce some other pieces, and you can use them to balance out the strong pieces. They are available at the manufacturer's website.I also have to say that the learning curve for this game is gargantuan, so don't bother trying to teach other people how to play unless they are very invested and would not mind losing the first time.Apart from that, it is a relatively good game. Lots of pieces, lots of different strategies available to choose among. Enjoy."},{"rating":"2","title":"We love this game!","review":"I bought this game for my husband for his birthday and it has been in perpetual play since.

Lots of fun for a family that likes thinking/startegy games."},{"rating":"1","title":"Quality game, just a bit boring","review":"First, I will preface by saying the game is extremely complicated to get started with, you really need some outside help to figure it out. The instructions are good, but there are about 12 pages of rules, so a quick play the game is not.That said, once you figure it out, it is not difficult to play, but it is not particularly fun, either. There only a few options on what you can do each turn without basically giving massive points away to the person next to you. For example, pretty much no one wants to pick up the card to ship goods, because you give the person to your right first dibs on everything, so you give them a truckload of points. This results in people sitting around and picking the same cards over and over to avoid losing the game.All in all, a well made, quality game, but just a bit on the boring side."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too complex to figure out","review":"We purchased this game because we love Settlers of Catan and Carcassonne, thinking this will be another great board game to enjoy. Unfortunately, we were unable to understand the instructions enough to ever play it, even though we are intelligent, well educated people. We have never had a problem learning a game before this. I ended up selling it on ebay at a loss. It would have helped us if we had a friend who has played it before, and who could explain it to us. I am sure it is a great game once you know how to play, but that is where the problem lies."},{"rating":"1","title":"This game is shameful","review":"Your role in this game is to make money as a slaveowner. You purchase plantations and buildings, and then distribute your \\"colonists\\"-- small dark brown tokens-- to work on the fields or in the buildings. Each turn they arrive by the boatload. It costs you nothing to hire or employ these \\"colonists.\\"I felt extremely uncomfortable playing this game. I would encourage any potential buyer to choose something that doesn't make a game out of slavery."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best entry level strategic group game ever","review":"While the rule book is a little long, once you have one person who understands everything, the game goes relatively quickly and is by far my favorite of the shorter strategy board games (1 hour vs 5 of monopoly or 10 of axis and allies). Unlike Settlers of Catan (especially with the Knights expansion pack), you will not have a run away leader and every player has a chance to win up to the very last turn (though you may want to replace the Fortress with something in ). Also, since your farms cannot be destroyed and you can't be bankrupt, there is less animosity and no one is left out.But perhaps best of all, there is NO DICE ROLLING. The only chance in the game is crop selection, so you will never sit idle such as in Trouble, Sorry, or Settlers of Catan while your opponents win the game with a string of luck.Don't pass this one up!"},{"rating":"2","title":"not hard to learn but...","review":"...there are many details and small pieces to read.I've only played this game once and at first I was a bit intimidated by the set up. Once we start playing, though, it became more clear to me. Although it's not one of those games I could learn how to win the first time around. I can see how the game can become quite complicated (not the game play, but more the strategy) with a table of good players."},{"rating":"2","title":"What an awesome game!","review":"It's a complicated game to explain until you start to play it.

The plot is well-known by now: Jack Liffey, existentialist gumshoe, sets out to find two missing college students against a backdrop of heightening racial tension.

They enable you to analyse what you want and where you are going as you enter your 30s - but would be equally applicable to moments of transition at other ages.The authors manage to make the subject matter meaningful and entertaining - adding humourous elements that make the book easy to read and follow.

Buy the DVD set, anyhow, you must, but go to the Cassavetes pages, find Carney's links, and read his account of the troubles he's had, trying to preserve and expose people to rare cuts of FACES and SHADOWS he himself tracked down... Sorry to take sides -- Gena Rowlands probably has her own justifications for feeling as she does -- but I greatly admire Carney's contributions to keeping Cassavetes' memory alive and exposing people to his films; he put an amazing amount of work into CASSAVETES ON CASSAVETES, too.

By the end of Lady Knight you are as in love with these characters and you were with Alanna and Daine.

Filled with battle, magic, romance, and fatalic events, Lady Knight is a superb read for all!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Lady Knight","review":"I thought this book was good,but not as good as Pierce's previous books. In Lady Knight, it seemed that Kel's attitude changed,and she seemed less human. The book did not play as heavily on her faults as the others did. There was no mention of her fear of heights. While it was a wonderful tribute to those who died in 9-11, the book itself was sadly lacking. The climax was built up remarkably well, but the book just. . . ended. In this book, Kel seems more superhuman, and less kind towards people. Her treatment of Tobe and several of the others in the camp reflects this. I didn't like that part. The book also doesn't mention some of the things that were very important to Kel in Squire, Page, and First Test. It was like Kel was truly a noble, and not someone who was kind and fair to people.

She seems to have lost touch with that writing style somewhere along the way. This final book is pretty boring. It is difficult to empathize with any of the characters because they all seem to lack any genuine emotions. Everything seems fake and forced. A good rule for writers is 'show, don't tell;' a rule which seems to have been utterly abandoned by Pierce. She over-describes everything, spending far too much of her time and the reader's on unnecessary details that only hurt the story.

Every year, twice a year I getexcited waiting for one of her books (that I'd pre-ordered) to come out. They've always been excellent before. This one was the last in a series, and quite possibly the last tortall series. I was jumping up and down in excitement when i got it. Then, I read it. I didn't get too far before my excitment ebbed. Kel seemed a less likeable person than before, and the entire book dragged, while being totally predictable. Considering how good Pierce's books have been in the past, I was disapointed and upset, and wish that such a good series had come to a better end."},{"rating":"2","title":"Can't live without it!","review":"I must admit, until I read Lady Knight, I thought that Squire was undoubtedly the best of the Protector of the Small quartet.

Watever Kel lacks he makes up 4, and visa-versa. He is like Neal, but there are some differences in them that makes me able 2 c Dom and Kel together but not Kel and Neal, hes perfect as her frend. Another book should b written bout kel and dom. it wood b bad 2 hear about them in the back round because i want 2 c how they act alone 2getha and stuff.

So I was quite disapointed with Squire. But Neal is back in this book with great lines such as \\"You do realize we should all be put in a nice, cozy room somewhere with muscular people to keep us from harming ourselves?\\" Part of me was disapointed with the lack of romance in this book, but the thing is that it is good to have a strong female character who doesn't need a man. Also at 18 I know quite a few people who want to take it easy on romance (it is less novel and they want to become their own person) so it is also realistic. So I think that I am happy that there is basically no romance in this installment. It makes it different from the other Tortall books. One thing though, at the end I think she set up what might be the next quartet alittle too nicely. I think it is a very good book though, and a nice final installment."},{"rating":"2","title":"Arrival","review":"Lady Knight is the conclusion in the Protector of the Small series by Tamora Pierce.Kelandry of Mindelan, the main character, has struggled through probation, page training, squire training, The Chamber of Ordeal, endless bullies, a griffin and more to become the first recognized female knight.In this final installment, Kelandry is set her first assignment as a knight. War is raging with Scanra and new terrifying machines are tipping the scales in their favor.With fun new characters and old friends, this book is a brilliant end to the series."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pierce Comes Back Strong","review":"After a shaky \\"Squire\\" with exaggerated romance and several poor dialogues, Lady Knight is a refreshingly good book. The plot begins as war with the Sancrans is finally heating up, and Kel is sent to the border. However, her dreams of fighting gloriously are dashed when she is put in command of an enormous refugee and convict camp. Things are complicated by an indentured servant Kel purchases, as well as all of her friends from this series and several from others. The realistic challenges that Kel faces offer us all a lesson in command and tolerance.Although this book is very long, it will not deter most fans of Kel and of other Pierce books. Overall, it is engrossing, and reads very quickly. This book is recomended to all Pierce fans or those looking for good books for young girls."},{"rating":"2","title":"alanna dragondancer's opinion","review":"i really enjoyed this book but i felt that this series (protector of the small) wasn't finished.i would really like another novel about Kel. another problem was the complete lack of romance! in all her other tortall series the last book was the one with all the romance and this one had nothing.i was really surprised and quite disapointed but the book was still great and very moving.i'd give it 4 and a half if i could"},{"rating":"1","title":"O.k. would not recomend","review":"This was a rather dissapointing book and I'm not likely to read the other's in the series.

On the surface, there was no romance or intrigue, but also Kel's story started off with a bang and ended with a puff.

First of all I thought Tamora pierce thought towards the end oh no this isn't going any where I need kel to do something the readers will love: I'll have her try to save all the \\"small/poor\\" people in a dangerous land, but I'll just have them all hanged, and when kel fights the bad guy, who I forgot to develop, her friends will be there for her.

It turned out to be very useful, and I agree with the comments of the other reviewer. I particularly appreciated the instructions on how to differentiate similar species. My one complaint is that many of the photos, while lovely, do not show leaves, let alone the entire plant. And the plant descriptions are sparse. This book is geared to flower, as opposed to plant, identification. To use it you usually need the full flower in front of you. Along with this book, we ended up carrying Newcomb's Wildflower Guide, and Core's Flora of West Virginia. Those books have drawings, now perhaps considered old fashioned, and certainly not as flashy as photos, but which provide SO much more information than photos."},{"rating":"2","title":"great field guide","review":"I purchased this book to augment my other wildflower field guides.

Case in point--the plastic clamps that keep the sliding head from slipping off the bar are flimsy plastic, and mine already are breaking. Jorgensen, on the other hand, is more intelligently designed, using a cotter pin to hold the plastic stop in place. Jorgensen also has wider and longer clamping surfaces.If you must have designer names, no one will talk you out of buying Bessey.

Soon after the speed control went bad and the motor would only run at the middle speeds. This thing really did not get much use and then the coupler from the motor to the output shaft broke so it didn't even spin anymore. I took it apart and thought maybe I'd order a bunch of new parts and rebuild it, but I see that some parts are already no longer available. Forget that idea.

The illustrations are inviting and lead your mind to wonder about other fabrics and textures that could be incorporated into each project. I would reccomend this book both for its instructional value and its ability to stir up creativity."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful Book","review":"Excellent excellent book!

In fact, we tried 3x to install and while initializing it would crash. We downloaded a fresh copy from the originator's site and it also crashed. Ended up downloading a free 30-day trial piece of software from somewhere else which worked fine with our new drive.Do not recommend SuperDuper."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Home Printer + Entry Level Photo Printer","review":"Print quality is very good even at draft quality settings. At high quality, the print is perfect for resumes. Print speed is execellent for a home printer. Photo quality is also good. Resolution is clear and colors are pretty accurate. I do not plan on using this much as a photo printer given the high cost of consummables and the abundance of inexpensive online photo printshops.The negatives are as mentioned before, the consummables are expensive: the color inkwell is a single tri-color instead of individual ink wells. Also, the inkwells do not last long and there is not much of a market for cheap suppliers. The printer is rather large and flimsy. There is no USB cable included which is a really poor marketing decision on Canon's part. There's no output tray. I have a narrow leadge for my printer on my computer hutch so I must stand there and catch my printouts."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheap printer, expensive ink","review":"The printer produces decent quality pictures, although far from being the advertised \\"lab quality.\\" It also makes a nice document printer with good speed for this price range. The problem with this and many inkjet printers is that it uses ink very fast and a set of cartridges are as expensive as the printer itself. I was only able to print about 10 4x6 pictures set to \\"high\\" quality plus 120 pages of color documents set to \\"fast\\" quality before the printer started running low on ink. That results in the worst cost per page I have experienced yet. Inkjet printer manufacturers really have quite a racket going on - they price printers super low to sucker customers into their brand - then rip those same customers off with their short-lived, high-priced ink cartridges."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't bother","review":"Canon calls this a photo printer? Prints are faded, blurred, and distorted. Compare this printer to an HP Deskjet 3940 and decide for yourself. Do not invest in this printer. However, if you are stuck with this printer because you bought it as a package deal, either sell it on eBay or give it to your kids. I REPEAT, do not buy this printer, you will be sorry. Every Canon printer I have ever purchased has not met my expectations."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why No USB Cable","review":"I am really not able to understand what is this cheap kind of strategy not to provide USB cable with this product, especially when thats the only interface available technically? Can someone make me understand the logic (business sense) behind this, especially for a Canon like brand!!??? Definitely, consumers expect much better from Canon.\\"Canon\\", please bring better business sense to market that would help end users/consumers. Thanks."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fast but a hassle","review":"I got this printer for free; I wouldn't recommend buying it. It uses up ink like crazy, and the cartridges are more expensive than other canon ink cartridges. While the printer quality is fine, it's a hassle to use. It took me a long time to get the hang of loading the paper (it can't hold much at a time, or the paper jams). Worse, there's no place for the paper to go after it leaves the printer. This means you're stuck catching the paper yourself after it comes out if you don't want your paper scattering all over the place. It's small, which is good for small spaces, but you have to sacrifice perks that better printers have like different settings.Try a different small printer if you want real quality."},{"rating":"1","title":"Canon PIXMA IP 1700 printer bought from Amazon.com","review":"The quality of the printer (CANON PIXMA iP 1700) bought Amazon is horrible. On the website the condition of the printer was mentioned as \\"Good\\", but is really worst and has hardly worked. I feel cheated and frustrated. I even bought new cartridge considering that the issue might be due to the cartridge, but the printer is not at all working."},{"rating":"1","title":"problems with cannon 3000 printer","review":"I cannot print only in black when I am printing text.

I really have never heard such a unique blend of styles the way this band does it. It's obvious that these guys are great musicians and their original tunes prove it. Their sounds grow on you after a while and you will find yourself thinking about a part of a song and wondering where you heard it. I'm looking forward to hearing what they will do next."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can't support this product","review":"Or vice versa. This is a fine bra for wearing around the house, but not for anything else. It offers little support for me (34C) and flattens the breasts rather than flattering them. It is comfortable, but not exceptionally so. You can do better.Spanx Bra-llelujah!Spanx Bra-llelujah! Soft Cup BraSpanx Bra-llelujah!"},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"Back to the Drawing Board\\" Please!","review":"I like lots of Spanx products, so it was with great anticipation that I ordered this bra. I am very disappointed with it, unfortunately. I gave it two stars because it does eliminate bra lines. Other than that, it gives very little support (I am a C cup) and does nothing to make your chest look shapely. Maybe if you are younger and have never had kids, it would be okay. Of course, with implants it might be good too. I found it to ride up. I had to pull it down countless number of times. It is like wearing a sleep bra or a loose sports bra. Definitely not worth the price."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cups roll and straps are NOT adjustable. Skip it!","review":"For what you pay for this bra, you'd think the straps would be adjustable or the size would at least run true. Or maybe, just maybe, the cups wouldn't roll outwards, making it impossible to wear this item even under a sweater without your cup outlines showing.Sadly, none of these are true. I ordered my same bra size. Not only is the chest too big, the cups are very thick and, as noted, tend to roll outwards--which means less coverage and support.Even the shoulder straps are NONadjustable, and they are HUGE. See the photo? They're easily pulled up that high. A stretchy bra is an ineffective bra. You will be nouncing all over the place in this doozy of an item as you move, ever closer, towards having what Sharon Osbourne calls \\"National Geographic boobs.\\" All this, just to make slightly less apparent the back of your bra showing through your shirt? No way."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hate everything about it - what a disappointment!","review":"This bra sounded like the answer to all my prayers where bras are concerned. As it turns out, it answered none of them. First of all I had a heck of a time getting it on. I was exhausted by the effort. I am neither very large, nor very small, so it didn't have to do anything special, but I found it to be an ill-fitting, uncomfortable pain in the butt piece of garbage. If I could give this zero stars I would, because I cannot honestly think of one thing I like about this bra. This is the first negative review I have ever left for any article of clothing, so please don't think I am a crack pot. I don't know how something could sound so good, and be so bad."},{"rating":"1","title":"rides up - impossible to wear!","review":"I had to return this bra after trying to wear it for one day. It kept riding up so badly that I was afraid I was going to fall out of it every time I moved my arms. I don't know who thought up this product, but they obviously did not test it on real women in everyday activities."},{"rating":"1","title":"Negative","review":"The bra itself feel good when you first put it on, but after a while it starts to roll up from the bottome. It also does not do a thing for one's figure as there is a band right through the middle that flattens the breast. If I had been on the ball, I would have returned it right away.

(that is from a confirmed bra-hater)I bought it to wear after surgery, however, it was not conducive to wearing just after surgery, as you step into the bra and pull it up to put it on..... No, really!

I am a 36 C and bought several styles. Do not be fooled by the comfort of it when you try it on in a store. It does feel great at first! However, once it starts to ride up and your breasts fall out at the front, you'll regret this purchase. These bras are worthless. I am shocked at the celebrity endorsements. Shame on them for being dihonest with us! I wish someone would invent a comfortable bra that shows no buldges in the back, AND offers support to women who have C cups or larger."},{"rating":"1","title":"UGLY!","review":"I could have done better with duct tape. Not only does this look unfinished, it takes a double jointed person to attempt to put it in place. Even then it rides up turning it into a tourniquet around your bust. EXTREMELY unflattering in appearance. I certainly don't want anyone to see me wearing this. I can't return this fast enough.Size runs small and is not meant for cup size over a B.It is constricting,flattens your bust line,hot and generally uncomfortable to wear."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed.","review":"I bought this in the correct size, and the label stated that size, but when I put it on it was small and just crept right up. It wouldn't stay in place and felt awful! This thing may work for people with very small breasts, but if you're larger than an A cup, I'd look for something else. I returned mine."},{"rating":"1","title":"SPANX Bra-llelujah will not last long","review":"When I first purchased two of these bras for $60+ each I thought they were the greatest as far a comfort goes. Also they did not show through any of my clothes. However, after wearing each bra approx. 10 - 15 times each (with hand washing in cold water with Forever New fabric care wash and laying flat to dry) these bras became all stretched out and unwearable. Like a fool I purchased a third one and after 10 wearings / washing the exact same happened. When I wrote to SPANX they basically blew me off. So between the poor quality and the way they treat their customers I would never purchase another SPANX product again. There are too many good companies that would stand behind their product - and I'll go with them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Spank Spanx","review":"This bra looked and promised to be comfortable. It sort of is until it rides up until your breasts fall out of the bottom band. Sadly,it also flattens, not flatters. Don't buy this bra if you are physically active in any way."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth it","review":"I just got one of these in. I put it on, as instructed (step into it and pull it up over the hips). It is very comfortable, and that is the only good thing I can say about it. It barely covers part of my breasts. There is no hint of support. It will ride up in the back if I try to adjust it. I would expect to pay about 3 dollars for a bra that supports the way this one does. I can't even use it for a sleep bra because I would fall right out of it. I will not be buying anything else from this company. For reference, I wear a DD cup, which this bra is supposed to be able to fit. A woman with small breasts that don't need much support might love this. For the less perky individuals, we need to keep looking."},{"rating":"1","title":"I wouldn't wish this bra on anyone!","review":"Wow, I read the reviews and bought the bra anyway -- I really wish I'd listened to what other people who bought it had to say about it! It IS comfortable, the all hosiery thing is a great idea, but it doesn't work!! The bra rides up constantly.

I wouldn't wish this bra on anyone!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"one wear and it stretched to much for comfort","review":"I love the idea of this product but after one wear it was uncomfortable and not staying in place.

This bra is not flattering, and flattens very uncomfortably. I could hardly breathe in it. It also rides up. The straps are too short. Stay well away from this product. Duct tape would work better and be more comfortable."},{"rating":"1","title":"BOO-llelujah for BAH-llelujah!","review":"Bah-llelujah to this bra! It tends to run on the small side and it does not do jack for support.

Really unappealing.2) Doesn't provide enough nipple coverage. Do not wear in cold climates because I swear your nipple will show through.3) Bunches up occassionally during wear.4) The seams and sewing lines show thru t-shirts. :(Overall, this product works very well as a soft bra to sleep or lounge at home in. I would definitely wear this when I get pregnant again. It does provide considerable support (I'm a 38C) but it is a bit too pricey for a soft bra that looks \\"unfinished\\". Please do not wear this if you are trying to seduce your partner. My husband was APPALLED by how \\"raw\\" it looks."},{"rating":"1","title":"WASTE OF MONEY","review":"I am extremely disappointed with this product. I expected it to be soft, but I did not expect it to be ill-fitting, non-covering and essentially the biggest waste of money I've spent to date. Don't be fooled, ladies. Just because they offer larger cup sizes doesn't mean they are built for them. I wasn't looking for full-support, but there isn't enough material to hold the twins in at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"useless for bigger sized women!","review":"I bought this bra and I am a 42DD and it did not fit!

Kim's spurious claim that the Cambridge University Law faculty is run by a fascist dictatorship is a complete joke. Kim is a renown 'sex-pest', who prays on first year female law students. Kim's recent behaviour towards students (particularly girls) at Cambridge has landed him in hot water such that he has come close to being 'sent down'. Kim was correctly ejected from the law school library because of his inappropriate behaviour i.e. he was considered a threat to the security of females in the department. Kim is a racist himself so he should be the last person to complain of racism.Kim is a loser, who needs to get out more and learn about social norms, when it comes to relationships with women.This book is a waste of money and consists of lies based upon supposition and distorted logic."},{"rating":"1","title":"A lot of old rot!","review":"The suggestions made by Kim in this book are ludicrous. Kim tries to portray a forward thinking Law Faculty as racist and claims that it is run an oppressive regime. This idea is ridiculous and shows the current mental instability of Kim, who is clearly aggrieved at being thwarted by the Law School's security guards in his attempt at harassing the female students. Female law students have had enough of Kim continually pestering them to go out with him or marry him. The fact of the matter is that Kim is twice their age and they are simply not interested. Its not as if Kim is particularly attractive for his age (40 years).Kim should stop spreading lies and get on with his life and try to complete his Ph. D. within 20 years. I feel that this is a long shot at present considering his mental instability and his inability to perceive his own faults and rectify them.This book is not worth buying."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disgusting","review":"As a Korean, I find the book quite distasteful. Kim has not served the Korean cause well with this ridiculous book. Cambridge University has many Korean's studying there, some of which are doing law. I am fearful that if I were to suffer racism as a result of an anti-Korean backlash arising from the publication of this book, my complaint would be taken less seriously. I find it hard to believe that one of my fellow Koreans could sink so low as to pretend to be suffering from racism just to discredit a law faculty for revenge. I can only assume that Kim picked this habit up in America because we Koreans are a proud people, who were brought up to be truthful, loyal and honourable to the Korean cause.Shame on Kim and his repugnant book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Atrocious!","review":"This book is absolute dross; it presents a distorted account of life in the Law school at Cambridge University. The content is highly controversial and defamatory. The idea that you can compare minor incidents and disputes with major acts of repression and persecution is absolutely preposterous and rather offensive to those who suffered under such conditions. I have spoken to many people, who form the opinion that Kim was justifiably barred from the Law school because of his inappropriate behaviour towards female law undergraduates. I hold the view that Kim pursued and harassed these females and they decided they've had enough and made a complaint, which was considered and upheld by the Law school. The Law school then took appropriate action to rectify the situation i.e. bar Kim from the library."},{"rating":"1","title":"dross","review":"This book is very poorly written and consists of fabrications and distortions of the truth.

The idea that a reputatable Law School at one of the world's leading universities is racist is stupid. The Law School at Cambridge is ethnically diverse with many ethnic minority students.

I was an undergrad at King's College Cambridge, and he sent me one such poem. It included a line along the lines of \\"I know she doesn't like me doing it, but I push on anyway\\". Not only was the poem devoid of literary merit, but it was very offensive and rather scary. I am shy and find it difficult to deal with pushy people like Kim. In spite of my not returning his messages, not turning up to occasions to which he had invited me, and running in the opposite direction whenever I saw him, Christian Kim could not take the hint, and refused to leave me alone. He has also made unwanted advances towards several of my friends at King's. I have no difficulty in believing that he harrassed female students in the Law library. I hope the law faculty takes legal action against him for his libellous book.

I am a black law student at Cambridge and I have never been discriminated - ever. In fact, if anything, the school actively encourages applications from ethnic students. I think that this story is defamatory nonsense. I am sure that the student will be asked to retract these allegations or prove them. The truth is that this man was asked to leave the law school because he repeatedly asked young girls to marry him. Girls that he had not even been on a date with. He is fixated with young women - and I note that he is a middle aged man. He should try to date some people his own age. He is also fixated with law students, because he always dreamed about being a lawyer, but could not get into any law school, due to his poor grades."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disgraceful","review":"This book is by far one of the worst I've ever read. The content is totally inane. The suggestion that the Law School at Cambridge University is racist and oppressive is absolute absurd. The Law School is one of the most ethnically diverse departments in the university. Many students from Asia, Africa and other areas study there and none have complained about or published any material condeming the department as racist.Kim seems to be a very bitter and twisted person who will stop at nothing to strike out the Law School. I think he probably had an application to the Law School rejected, therefore he wrote this drivel to exact some kind of revenge.This book should be left on the shelf where it belongs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hypocritical","review":"This book is total and utter rubbish.

I happen to study Law at Cambridge and none of my friends from ethnic minority backgrounds have ever complained of any racism in the Law School.The facts are simple, Kim was ejected from the Law library because he harasses women, I should know as I was one of his victims.

The account of the events that supposedly took place at the Law School is completely flawed. There has never been any reported incidences of racism at the Cambridge University Law School. Most students at the Law School give a very different account of the events that took place. The most reliable account of events is that Kim repeatedly harassed and stalked 1st/2nd year undergraduate female Law students and was warned as to his conduct. Kim failed to act on the Law Schools advice and persisted in his attempts to pursue female students, leaving the Law School with no choice but to ask him to leave. Kim refused to leave and the security guards were asked to escort him off the premises as he presented a threat to the female law students.I would certainly avoid this book as it gives a distorted account of the incident from an unreliable source (an author with anti-Semitic views)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not good to say the least","review":"I was disappointed at this book by Kim. Kim bases his allegations of racism against the Law School on dubious and circumstancial evidence, which is open to interpretation. Kim distorts the incident that occurred in the Law School to fit his story. Kim has a reputation for pursuing and praying upon female undergraduates, who are half his age. This book should be avoided since it gives a distorted account of what took place."},{"rating":"1","title":"Totally inane","review":"This book consists of the rantings of a bitter old man, Kim, who has nothing better to do with his life. Kim lives in a fantasy world, where he is allowed to preach anti-Semitism and yet claim to be the saviour of Jews. I think most readers will agree that this is farcical. The book is equally farcical in that it portrays a world class law school with a ethnically diverse student body as racist. It is disgraceful that an author with racist views such as Kim plays the 'race card' to his advantage. Kim was in the wrong, he sexually harassed several female students in the law school. The law school at Cambridge took the appropriate course of action in ejecting him as he posed a serious threat to female students. This book is based on a series of lies, therefore it is best avoided."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor","review":"This book is unutterably poor! It is full of fabrications and distortions of the truth. Kim, a known racist and anti-Semite, has falsely accused the Cambridge University Law School of racism. I concur with the majority of readers when they say that Kim was ejected from the library because of his sexual harassment of female students. I think its disgraceful that Kim plays the 'race card' with the aim of exaggerating a trivial incident. Kim is playing into the hands of extremists such as the national front, who will see this book as evidence for their theory that immigrants are coming into Britain with the aim of taking over. Kim is also a hypocrite because he complains of racism whilst holding racist views himself.Avoid this one! It stinks of lies!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Libelous rubbish","review":"The content of this book is totally nonsensical and is based upon the fabrications of a man who has been thwarted in his attempt to harass female students. The author claims that the Law School at Cambridge is racist, this is a total lie. The Law School has actively encouraged applications from ethnic minorities and many have successfully applied and gone on to do well without any experience of racism. In my opinion, Kim is using the race card as a means of exacting his revenge after he was quite rightly ejected from the Squire Law library.This scandalous book is absolute rubbish. Do not give it any credit by buying it, as this will simply improve sales/ratings thus sending out the message that it is alright to play the 'race card' for revenge and financial gain."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very poor indeed","review":"I must say that I find this book somewhat distasteful in that it portrays a forward thinking ethnically diverse faculty in a world-class institution as racist and oppressive. It seems to me that the author holds some sort of grudge against the Law school at Cambridge University and is seeking to redress the balance by writing this ridiculous novel (with a view to discrediting the institution). It would not surprise me if I were to find out that Kim had made an application to the Law school, which was subsequently rejected. This book is best avoided as it puerile, repetitive and inaccurate."},{"rating":"1","title":"Inaccurate account of events","review":"Having read this book and spoken to many LL. B. students at my college (Magdalene, Cambridge), I came to the conclusion that Kim's account of events is a gross misrepresentation.I feel that it needs emphasising that Kim is delusional and suffers from a phantasmagorical myopia when it comes to assessing his attractiveness to women. Kim's inability to deal with his complex about girls has led to a lot of complaints of harassment being made such that the Law School had to take action. There was no racism involved, the Law School was simply carrying out its duty to provide an environment conducive to study i.e. one where students can work without being pestered, distracted or sexually harassed.A friend of mine at Jesus College, where Kim studies, told me that he has been kicked out of his accommodation and is likely to be sent down in the not too distant future."},{"rating":"1","title":"Completely inept","review":"I found the content of this book totally ridiculous. It consisted of the inane ramblings of an old man, who bore a grudge against a highly reputable law school. The suggestions made e.g. \\"the Law School at Cambridge University is racist\\" are totally absurd. The author, Kim, appears to be suffering from delusions. It is a well established theory in many Cambridge colleges that Kim is a 'sex pest', who prays upon 1st and 2nd year female LLB students. I am delighted that the Law School had the guts to stand up for the rights of these female students against Kim. The Law School quite rightly barred Kim from its library as he posed a constant threat to these female students. It would not surprise me if the tripos exam results of female LL. B. students had suffered in years prior to Kim's ban as a result of his continual sexual harassment. I would advise readers not to buy this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Absolute drivel","review":"This is possibly the worst book I have ever read. I am a student at Cambridge university and it is common knowledge that Kim made unreasonable advances to several female students and was justifiably ejected from the library. To dress this up as racially motivated exclusion is an absolute joke. I have reason to believe that Charles Ingram is an alias of Kim."},{"rating":"1","title":"Incomprehensible rubbish","review":"I was very disappointed by the lack of coherent reasoning shown in this book by Kim. The content is dubious and the interpretations made are based on false logic. It seems to me that this book was written with the explicit aim of inciting racial hatred between Asians and Caucasians. Kim takes a petty incident that occurred in the Law School at Cambridge University and blows it out of all proportion. Kim distorts the facts to make them support his claim of racial abuse.I find it quite amusing that Kim has to sign on as different people in a desperate attempt to boost the ratings of this poor quality book.(...)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Lies, Lies and more lies!","review":"Kim really has excelled himself with this book! The levels of hypocracy have reached a new high. I find it quite ridiculous that Kim complains of racism whilst writing anti-Semitic and racist literature. This book really is a joke, the account of events given by kim is full of inconsistencies and simply fails to add up when all the evidence is considered. My advise is for readers to avoid this book at all costs."},{"rating":"1","title":"A complete fabrication!","review":"This account of the alleged incident that took place in the Cambridge University Law School is a complete fallacy. Kim distorts and fabricates events so as to make the Law School appear racist and colonialist.The lack of concrete evidence provided by Kim weakens his case considerably. The comments made by the vast majority of reviewers suggest that Kim harassed young females and was ejected after they made a complaint. This interpretation sounds more realistic.Kim's attempt to compare and contrast the regime at the Law School with that in South Africa during apartheid is ridiculous. It is clear that Kim never visited South Africa during this era; otherwise he wouldn't be drawing the aforementioned comparisons.I hear from one of the reviewers that Kim is going to write a sequel to this book. If the first book is anything to go by, one shouldn't expect much from the second."},{"rating":"1","title":"Kim gives fiction a new definition","review":"As a male undergraduate at Jesus College, Cambridge (where Mr Kim studies), who has on many occasion had to stop him from molesting female members of the College, I feel it is my duty to inform anyone thinking of wasting their money on this book as to how Mr Kim operates. Mr Kim's 'ordeal' with the Law Faculty has as much to do with 'Color, Justice and Due process' as pickled cucumbers have to do with a fruit salad. This book's gross misrepresentation of the situation, where Mr Kim has continually made a nuisance of himself in respect to the female members not only of Jesus College, but also of any female student of Cambridge University he comes into contact with, is to be wholly ignored, and I hope that he gets 'sent down' as soon as possible."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor quality and poor value for money!","review":"This book was a waste of money! It contained nothing but lies and distortions of the truth. The author has written racist material in other novels and has the cheek to accuse others of racism - hypocritical or what?The Law School booted Kim out of the library because he was a pest, constantly harassing the girls and playing with their hair etc. Kim should grow up and get a life!This book is a pile of pants."},{"rating":"1","title":"Predictable and boring","review":"I was very disappointed with this book; it consisted of an inane commentary about a supposed incident that took place in the Law library at Cambridge University. The author tries to exaggerate the event by claiming that it was racially motivated. I find that rather surprising when the Law School at Cambridge has world-class reputation with an ethnically diverse student body. Kim's use of the 'race card' is potentially damaging to race relations as many complaints of racial abuse could be taken less seriously as a result.I have had the misfortune of reading some of Kim's other books, which contain racist material as well as that promoting religious bigotry. This book belongs on the scrap heap."},{"rating":"1","title":"Absurd!","review":"Kim's book is one of the worst I've read. I concur with the other reviewers, who state that it contains many distortions and fabrications of the truth. Many students at the Law faculty at Cambridge know that Kim repeatedly harasses the female students. The security guards are well within their rights to escort him off the premises, afterall their job is to maintain a secure environment in which to work. Kim clearly poses a threat to this environment, especially in the case of female students.Kim should grow up and accept that his analysis of the situation is fallacious. Koreans living and studying in England will not thank Kim if their legitimate complaints of racism in other situations are not taken seriously as a result of this book.I urge Koreans and other nationals alike to vote with their feet and give this book thumbs down by refusing to buy it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rather petty","review":"Kim's book is rather petty because it tries to sensationalise a trivial incident. The content is pithy and rambles on without providing any concrete evidence to support the allegation made.I find it rather sad that Kim feels the need to sign in as many different aliases to review his own book, in order to boost its ratings. Given the poor standard of this book, I have to say that writing is not a viable career option for Kim. Kim should seek a new career path, perhaps working as a brothel manager."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dreadful","review":"This book is a total disgrace, it is full of falsehoods, exaggerations and misinterpretations. Kim made out that the Law School at Cambridge University is inherently racist. As an LLB student at Cambridge I find this assertion patently absurd, especially when you consider how many ethnic minority students are studying law here. I know for a fact that Kim has approached many of my friends whilst they were queuing to buy a sandwich from the snack counter in the lower level of the Squire Law library. Kim harassed one of my friends for weeks with emails saying how he loved her and wanted to marry her etc. Many of us decided enough was enough and that we had to make a complaint to the librarian about Kim's actions. This is the real reason why Kim was ejected from the library. My friends and I are pleased that he has been banned since we can study in peace without looking over our shoulder for fear of Kim.Please don't buy this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pathetic","review":"This book appears to be the work of a deranged man with a bitter hatred of the Law School at Cambridge University. Kim claims that he was racially abuse and yet there is no concrete evidence for this. Kim is quite hypocritical in that he dishes out racial abuse in his novels and is the first to play the 'race card' when he feels aggrieved. I would recommend against purchasing this book as it contains nothing constructive and is full of misrepresentations and fabrications."},{"rating":"1","title":"Interesting story ruined by inappropriate comparisons","review":"Whilst I found this book interesting, I felt that Kim could have provided more examples where the Cambridge Law School has been acting in a racist manner to back up his story. Kim ruined what would have been an intriguing account of the alleged incident by drawing ridiculous comparisons with apartheid and Nazism. There may be racism in the Law School at Cambridge, but I doubt it is anything like that experienced by blacks in South Africa during apartheid. Kim claims that there is a Jewish conspiracy, if this is true, shouldn't he try to do something about it instead of crying all the time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"When I bought this book, I was hoping for an exciting and controversial interpretation of an incident that apparently took place in the Law School at Cambridge. I started reading and found after about 10 pages, I could read no further. It was so boring! Kim just ranted on about a minor incident and tried to put different spins on it so as to exaggerate it. Kim claimed that he was ejected from the law library on the grounds of his race. Kim then goes on to compare this trivial incident with major acts of racial oppression such as that experienced by coloured people in South Africa during apartheid.This sounds like a lot of all nonsense to me. I would avoid this one as most readers will get bored after 10 pages."},{"rating":"2","title":"Relevant for Taiwanese Americans","review":"Yesterday, a Taiwanese business man was arrested for spying for China. It seems like the latest \\"Chinese\\" spies arrested in the USA for spying for China are Taiwanese. This may show our community a lot of important things that we are only beginning to realize. One thing that this trend is encouraging me to think about is the concept of official coercion. What happened to Christian Kim is an act of official coercion. It was immoral official coercion which violated due process. What Taiwanese Americans should be concerned about is precisely this. How do institutions use official coercion and not respect due process. Critical thinking on this issue can save the Taiwanese American community. This book by Christian Kim is great in helping us and our community started on thinking about this important issue."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rosa Parks of England!","review":"Mr. Kim is Rosa Parks of England.

For a few dollars more than the Incra 1000 you get positive stops every one (1) degree, rather than every 5 degrees as on the 1000. Additionally there is another indexed stop which then makes all the positive stops on the 1/2 degree. Marvelous instrument, especially when compared to the miter gauge that came with my Sears table saw 22 years ago.Update 31 Mar 05: Now that I've been using the Incra 2000 for a few months, I find zero defects, zero detractors for this miter gauge. In fact, I finally can make 45 deg angles that are more accurate than the wood movement that occurs in any project. You cannot get any better than that!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Incra 2000/27 Miter Gauge","review":"Recently purchased the Incar 2000 Miter Gauge. I have tried for years to accurately cut mitered angles with mediocre success.I spent a very careful hour setting up the Miter Gauge. When set up was complete (followed directions explictly) I tested the product. I took 8 pieces of stock 3/4\\" x 1 1/2\\" x 12\\" and proceeded to cut 22 1/2 degree angles on both ends. Laid all eight pieces on the work bench and dry fitted a perfect hexagon. You can't get a human hair in the joints. This is an expensive tool but for the first time ever I can cut extremely accurate angles. This tool should dramatically enhance my abilities.I am not thrilled about the \\"stock stop\\" feature but that is a secondary need for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"There are better miter gauges","review":"The INCRA 2000 has two faults.1) The Angle bracket that holds the fence is just a bent piece of steel.

Tired of the recommended shimming to correct, I made my own from angled stock.2) The handle easily comes loose in use, allowing the fence to move on the base plate during a cut."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Value","review":"I was a little leary about buying this, because the pictures make it look a little flimsy, but I was very pleased to find that it is quite heavy and rugged. Took me less then 10 minutes to have it set up and cutting perfect miters on my xacta saw. Since it comes with the bar and stop it is a great value.

I cannot begin to estimate the amount of time I have spent trying to set it to get a consistent 90 deg cross cut. I finally gave up and got a similar product from a different company for less, and although it is not dead accurate - its closer than I ever got with the Incra. Many claim success - but I have to wonder how long it took them to get it that way - and does it keep its setting, mine does not. Good Luck."},{"rating":"2","title":"Flawed, but was showing promise.","review":"This movie was made up of the first three episodes of the \\"Mighty Ducks\\" TV show, when it was probably at its best. The basic premise of this show tended to be weak, but their were moments when it showed a spark of inspiration, such as the Duck's initial distaste for humans and the conflict at first when Dragonas threatened Earth. Why should we help this alien civilization? Once they became standard-issue superheroes, the show lost much of its interesting parts. It became just another Saturday-morning cookie-cutter action cartoon. The only interesting part was the subplot of trying to get back to Puckworld, and with the cancellation of show, that was left unresolved. This show only needed a little tweaking to put near \\"Gargoyles\\" in strength of narrative."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enjoyable series","review":"This isn't an actual movie by itself, it's actually the first few episodes of this series, but I remember watching this on Saturday mornings and really enjoying this. It was a pretty fun and somewhat far-out idea, somewhat cheesy at times but overall enjoyable.This show had the potential to become great like Gargoyles, but didn't quite get there.

He has a band (calling themselves The Resurrectionists)that keeps right up there with him, and it certainly sounds like a perfect match: Jimmy Jones on guitar, Brian Curley from The Delinquents on bass, Carl Giesecke on drums keep on pushing Roky's vocals right to the edge. \\"Don't Shake Me Lucifer,\\" \\"You're Gonna Miss Me,\\" \\"I Walked With a Zombie\\" are full of spite and menace.

I was able to restore 40 or so dull bits collected over the years (personal problem throwing junk away)! The 250 gave the bits balanced, sharp cutting flukes that hold up well. The new cutting edges have extended life to my cordless drills batteries and reduced project times due to greater efficiency in drilling operations. The video and operation materials are real straight forward and easy to understand.I've used several power tool bit sharpeners, including the old B & D industrial units. They all worked well but at 3 to 4 times the price. Darex has produced a quality product at a real value price for the consumer."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best drill sharpeners on the market","review":"Went out and purchased this unit after smoking 1/2 drill bits left and right drilling 1/2\\" steel plate.Initially I bought another brand of drill sharpener..sucked, brought it back and grapped the drill doctor.Works excellent,fast, very (repeat very) easy to use, great customer service (just bought it but, was interested in replacement grinding wheels down the road..they actually called back the same day!!)Also even though it does not say so, you can replace the grinding wheel on the 250 model (along w/ the 500 & 750).In a few months plan on buying the 750 to sharpen larger bits.Highly recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"drill doctor 250sp","review":"I bought this item based on favorable reviews and it is as easy to use and as efficient as all have said it was.

I usually hate sad dramas but this one just left me kind of speechless at the end. It's everything that everyone else has mentioned - beautiful, gut-wrenching, sad and if you also think about it happy and bittersweet. I hated the ending and it did get emotionally draining to watch all the crying in some scenes but it just makes you want to watch it over and over again in the end. Rain totally does an excellent performance. I loved Full House but here he truly shows that he can act in any scenerio."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun and enjoyable drama series","review":"As a Korean drama series this was very interesting and fun to watch.

He truely is a lawyer."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Inspiration to the Comming of Age","review":"I have recently gone through a rough time trying to find myself. I am a high school senior and for the first time in my life I am needing to make some decision that I know will decide my future. I wish this could be a required text in school. I needed this book to guide me to self-realization. Through reading this book I was able to learn about myself as well as those around me I had never noticed before. Thankfully I was able to find and thank the Graceful Giants in my life. Sometimes people get to caught up to take a second and realize the Graceful Giants in life and are therefore much to often over looked. In addition, Mr. Litchfield personalized the book very well. It was almost like I had acquired a new best friend."},{"rating":"2","title":"Grace: The most important lesson","review":"What does it mean to live with the Grace of God? Why is living by the Grace of God so important? The answers to these questions are found in this inspirational book by Robert L. Litchfield, Jr. This book will provoke serious thought in readers on how they are currently living their lives, what it means to live with Grace, and how (step-by-step methods) they can achieve greater joy by living with Grace. Five famous faces appear on the cover because they each lived their lives with Grace and serve as good examples on how important being a \\"Graceful Giant\\" can be. I highly recommend this book to any reader interested in learning why having Grace is one of the most important things in life and the steps that he or she can take to live with it."},{"rating":"2","title":"It Is Very Thin!","review":"I purchased this filter for a medium telephoto in a 58mm size,because it was on sale.

There is already a considerable literature on fallacies and several thoroughly researched works in print.

Don't waste your money, get The Dictionary of Misinformation series."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ok","review":"This series is pretty bad, the way the lessons are set up won't help you learn anything. Hearing conversations over and over with nothing to go off of doesn't work."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what it is supposed to be","review":"This book is fundamentally the same as the previous edition and has inherited its problems and idiosyncracies. Very annoying is its method (or lack of it). It flits from one thing to another. When you think you are going to get some information on a language point, you get a sentence (or short paragraph) and then the book jumps to something quite different. It doesn't get to grips with anything. You can't learn much. Another annoying feature, more so in this new edition, is the big gap between what you read on the cover and what you find in the book. You spend your money in the belief that you are buying a course that will help you progress quickly beyond the basics (that's what it says on the cover). Then you find out that the course barely covers the basics. I teach the language and have a copy of the book but this is a course I would not recommend."},{"rating":"1","title":"It defies the basic rules of teaching","review":"Normally material is presented; then it is explained; finally the learner is tested. It is different in this course. In the dialogues of unit 1 and 2 you come across vai,vamos,vao plus infinitive. This verb construction is not explained in the grammar sections. But you are tested on it at the end of unit 2. You are expected to produce the answer 'Vou te dizer...' This defies the basic rules of teaching. This is not the only way this course defies normal teaching practice. Material is not graded. A new dialogue may introduce a number of new grammatical features at the same time, not step by step, and only some of these features will receive a (brief) explanation anyway. I would not call this a course. I would call it a random selection of dialogues and grammar notes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the best option","review":"This course in not one of the best. It is very disorganised and the language is not quite right. It does not appear to like the brasilians either. Starting in the first lesson, it says that the portuguese language has an old fashioned way of saying thank you and that you have to watch the brasilian police. If you want a good course you have a choice in this collection. For just a taste of portuguese there is Elizabeth Smith's Instant Portuguese course. For more than a taste, you have Manuela Cook's course. The Instant Portuguese course is more for Europe, but Manuela Cook's is OK for Brasil too. It is very good and has a beginners section, like a preliminary section, a 'survival kit'.I am brasilian and have been asked my opinion by some friends from the States. When you are trying to learn a language often you don't really know what is the best course for you. It helps to have the opinion of a native speaker. Here it is my opinion, I hope it will help someone."},{"rating":"1","title":"It takes you nowhere","review":"This course is too disorganized. It throws the language at you, jumps from one thing to another, you get nowhere. Nothing is properly coordinated. I much prefer The Living Language Portuguese, because it is more organized. You know where you are going, you feel you are getting somewhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book is okay if you already speak some portuguese","review":"This book is Okay if you already know the basic words and phrases, It helped me to learn some of the different tenses, and SOME gramatical rules; but it is not put together in a logical way, where you can just turn to a certain chapter to refresh your memory on how to say a particular phrase. I would not reccomend it to people who have never studied portuguese or spanish before, becuase it will not give you the tools to form sentances properly. It seems to be more for a traveler who is planning to go to Brasil for a couple of weeks and only needs to know certain phrases. It also bothered me that it is written in British english, not North American. If you are trying to speak fluently, I would definitly not waste your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poorly Organized","review":"I did not have time to look through the small selection of Brazilian Portuguese grammar texts at the bookstore I bought this at, so I thought, usually the Teach Yourself books are pretty good (Italian and old French ones are great). I was thoroughly disappointed by this one however. The organization is terrible, grammar points are not thoroughly covered. It seems that only enough is explained to help you understand the specific conversation pieces throughout the text. This also was a pain, because over half the book is dedicated to conversations/dialogues that are helpful, yes, but very specific and the audio cassettes/cd's are basically essential here.Overall a poor investment. I'm looking for another grammar book and I just bought this a week ago."},{"rating":"1","title":"Brazilian Portuguese but British English!","review":"This course is supposed to be for the Portuguese of Brazil as opposed to that of Portugal but the book is written in British English. This does not make much sense to me. It is for the Portuguese spoken in the American Continent but is written in the English used in Europe, why not in American English?Another problem I have with this course is its lack of logical organization. It jumps from one thing to another. As you go through the units you build up confusion instead of building up competence in the language. I gave up half way through!Not a favourite with me, you can tell. Sorry, but this is my experience of this course."},{"rating":"1","title":"I want my money back...","review":"The audio CD doesn't gives only one or two exercises where you can repond and focuses almost exclusively on listening. In addition, the written exercises do not follow what is on the CD so often you don't know if you have completed the exercises correctly or not. My husband is Brazilian and I speak fluent Spanish so I understand spoken Portuguese. I wanted something to help me with my pronunciation and grammer, but this wasn't it!Annoying waste of money!"},{"rating":"2","title":"An Excellent Bible Study","review":"This is an excellent Bible Study. I liked the layout of having the Scripture readings and the Commentaries in one book. It made iteasier to read the Scripture passages and then read the Commentary. This Bible Study also comes with a booklet of 17 - 18 questions for each lesson. However, if your Bible Study group discusses just the questions and answers, they will miss discussing many sections of Acts that are not covered by the questions. This is why I rated it 4 stars. You can also purchase the answers to the questions which I recommend to the facilitator of any Bible Study group."},{"rating":"1","title":"Some good info, but scattered with medical babble","review":"I sold this one...

This entire section sounds like a 'rush job'.Each song in the Red Garter section sounds the same due to Jack's very weak right-hand technique and the absence of emotion and dynamics coming from Jack's banjo.Also, what adds to the downside of The Red Garter section on this CD was the \\"we're going to do this entire session in only one take on each song\\" attitude of K.C., the producer of this project."},{"rating":"2","title":"Serious Stoner Rock","review":"An all-around great album.

The customizability is nice (MP3 soundtrack, custom artwork, etc) but the gameplay is choppy and the controls, even with a dual strike, are not as fluid as the console. I don't think resources are a problem - I am running on an Athlon 64 with 1 GB of RAM and a Radeon x1600 card.Also with this game (like with everything now) you get this digital cockroach EALink app that wants to talk to the internet 24x7. You can turn it off, but outside of renaming the binary and then changing it back when you want to play online you can't get it to turn off and stay off.Anyway, stick with the console unless you and your friends like playing in a LAN league and you're really into customizing your team."},{"rating":"1","title":"awesome at begining but gets boring","review":"THis is a good game with the franchise and superstar hall of fame.But it sucks because nothing new happens its the same stuff game after game with the exceptional invisible gatorade being poured over the coaches head at the end of the superbowl.If YOUR WANTING TO BUY A GAME THAT WILL NOT GET OLD AFTER A FEW WEEKS OF PLAYING DO NOT BUY THIS GAME."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than work","review":"This game is the reason for not doing chores around home.

But like other reviewers, I was very disappointed. Just out of warranty, it died, even though it had not had many hours of use. I paid $80 at Lowe's a couple of years ago and spent a good deal more on accessories and the expensive proprietary sand paper it requires. So now I have a lot of money sitting in a little black bag. It might last for some simple, occasional hobby activities, but it is quite expensive for that. It won't hold up for more serious projects. In the end, the lesson was the same as for many gadgets: the old fashioned way still works the best. Good quality sandpaper and a little creativity in shaping it make more sense for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not very satisfied","review":"This product is ackward to use in tight areas. I do like the different attachment you can use. I found using them by hand was easier, because the disign of the tool positions the sanding attachment in a way of uncomfortable hand position on the tool.

This product gets a D+."},{"rating":"1","title":"It died after minor use!","review":"After sanding details over a period of two years for about a total of only 12 hours, it up and died yesterday when I used it. out of warranty now for sure, it only got used a little. how much use did it get?

However I classify this sander as a purchasing mistake. Here is why; 1) I get a lot of scratching on the items I sand. 2) It does not remove much material and takes a long time to do the job. 3) The sanding pads tend to fall off. 4) It died on me after about 5 hours of use. I wouldn't pay to fix it. I will try my next detail sander before I buy."},{"rating":"1","title":"less than impressive...","review":"I got this sander to get into tiny places that my orbital sander couldn't touch or was too powerful for, as well as contoured pieces, particularly rounded edges. For me, it's weak, even for a detail sander. Takes a long time and doesn't really smooth pieces to my liking, so I end up touching it up by hand. I've found that it's just as fast to do those small areas completely with hand sanding if you have a good, flexible sanding pad. It's very weak on cleaning up glue lines and spots as well--just lacks the power. The concept is good, but the performance is weak. If you want to invest in a detail sander, I would suggest that you go for one with considerably more power."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worked excellent for two days","review":"I got this tool to sand kitchen cabinet doors. It worked execellent for 2 days. The sanding contours worked great to sand curves and grooves. But by the third day the tool would no longer hold the sanding contours.

Changing the magic format to the \\"New style\\" makes this way too easy. Why did they change the names of the weapons and bosses like Kary? And WHY those stupid shrines!? And this is what REALLY gets me. NO WARMECH! The BEST character EVER (!!!) and they change his name! WHY!?If this game was exactly like on NES (Like Zelda and Metroid and Link), then this would DEFINATELY get a 5 star rating but because it isn't, it's LUCKY it gets this rating..The second game isn't much better.Nintendo just needs to release \\"The ORIGINAL\\" (no remade graphics or anything!) and then I'll be happy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not What I Thought It Was Going To Be...","review":"This game is made out to be a masterpiece but in my opinion the game lacks a good storyline, and REALLY lacks good graphics.

Moments later he says if I really want a good read to pick up \\"Low Level Hell\\" by Hugh Mills. For the remainder of the flight he kept talking about this book. So on his advice I picked it up. He was right on...what a read. Mills writing really puts you into the thick of it....to the point where I had to put the book down about a half-hour before turning the lanterns off for the night...to let the adrenalin subside. The book is well written, humorous at times, terribly sad at others, and a real page turner. Even if this is not your typical read, pick it up. The book leaves a lasting impression."},{"rating":"2","title":"Man, Machine, Compassion, & Balls","review":"This is one of the most interesting books I've read. It has the makings of an classic. It is an epic tale of a OH-6 Scout pilots exploits in Vietnam. Hugh Mills, the author and subject of the story brings to life his experiences as a young man during the Vietnam conflict. A true tale of guts, glory, and compassion. A must read!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Low Level Hell","review":"Low Level Hell: A Scout Pilot in the Big Red One. I bought it for my son. He said he loved the book and I have not read it. He loves any and all books on the Miltary and I try and buy those for him whenever I can. Thanks Amazon!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Very little content.","review":"The book is action packed but it ends there. You can literally go to any spot in the book and read 5 pages and the content would be nearly the same as any other 5 pages. The action is very well described but becomes very repetitous and therefore, \\"Boring\\". after reading 75% I found myself speeding through the remainder just to get it over with.Needs more character build-up and a lot more intimate details."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful relaxing, moving music","review":"The songs on this CD range from wonderful memories of long ago with Nights In White Satin, to the contemporary theme from Rent.

It has a nice variety of songs which are presented beautifully. I never get tired of Lorie Line's piano solos. A real stress buster!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Spiritual book","review":"I think this novel is better described as a spiritual novel rather than a \\"Christian\\" or \\"Catholic\\" novel. The story follows the life of Anne Delaney and her family and their struggles with religion, society, culture and the government. There is a clear underlying message of the need to turn to Christ in his Church (the Catholic Church), but it is never clearly stated. In terms of the spiritual struggle, S&S is a very realisitic story of all of our lives."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I thought","review":"I found this book to be disappointing. There are part of it that are insightful and make you think, but overall the story seems rather disjointed. I am not sure what the theme is supposed to be - if it's the family, the book doesn't give a complete picture of all the family and what happens to them. If it's the spiritual development, it is lacking because you never know exactly what the husband Stephen's faith consists of and the wife Anne's faith is nonexistent until at the end of her life she finds something but what it is seems vague. I really didn't much like this book - at the end I got the feeling that life is awful and then you die. It is not uplifting or inspirational in the least."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too slow for me","review":"I read and loved Father Elijah, Plague Journal and Eclipse of the Sun. They were wonderful, faith-filled, and action-packed Catholic novels. Then I bought Strangers and Sojourners, hoping to continue the action. It started out with a bang, at a satanic ceremony in the main character's childhood. I thought that it would continue from there with more God versus Satan action. No such luck. The story is very slow and just didn't hold my interest. Twice I took breaks to read more interesting novels before continuing with Strangers and Sojourners, then I finally just gave up. I was over 200 pages into the book and still there was very little happening in the woman;s faith and not much action to speak of. It was just too boring for me. I was disappointed with this novel."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Saw","review":"My wife actually purchased this saw as a Christmas present(with a little prodding). This saw took 5 minutes to setup, and I was mitering wood just like that. This saw cuts through wood like butter, I have cut wood as large as 2x4's, and as hard as oak and maple. It always delivers a smooth cut, and the 60 degree cut on right has already come in handy on numerous occasions. The handle/safety button angle/placement is a little uncomfortable until you get used to it. A great value for the dollar."},{"rating":"2","title":"First Time Miter Saw Owner","review":"I have a friend who is a carpenter by trade. He took me through a tool store pointing out all the tools I should get for the shop I was setting up now that I have my first house. He suggested that I get a sliding miter saw but the price was a little steep. I decided to get a standard compound and since he spoke highly of Hitachi I was drawn to this saw due to it's relatively low price and quality build. Set up was minimal and I did a few practice cuts at different angles and then started working on the molding in my infant son's room. It's not easy to get a good joint but I can't blame the saw since our walls wave all over. My only real complaint is that when you tilt the blade off of vertical the motor cover interferes with the hold down clamp if you have it on the left side. I plan to get the optional wings since cutting the end of a 2x4 is a pain unless someone is holding the other end."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good","review":"It was sent quickly with a little information on how to grow the herb.

The pads aren't soft, they aren't fluffy, and they don't fold. They are stiff, they continuously shed huge strands of polyester fluff, and make such a loud crinkling sound that my dog won't even lay on them in his dog house. I might carry these in the back of my SUV to protect my carpet from draining pots when I bring home plants from the nursery, but I would never put a baby on them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible","review":"These changing pads are TERRIBLE. I washed them before my baby came home and not only did they ball up and end up looking like they were 10 years old (they were brand new), their fuzz balls stuck on everything else I washed them with. So there I sat, with a lint brush, trying to salvage the laundry. They are 100% not worth the annoyance. Buy another brand and save yourself the hassle. I would give this product zero stars, but apparently you are forced to assign at least one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I was hoping for","review":"I was hoping that they were more absorbent. They repel more than anything else, allowing baby, baby's clothes, etc to get wet/soiled. I would not recommend purchasing unless you are using them as a waterproof mattress protector only. They do not hold up well in the wash either. Even when washed on gentle cycle."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good function but, lots of pills","review":"These pads are great for protecting surfaces but, pill so badly (even when air-dried only) that they become very unattractive after one washing.

A worthy addition to protect your lens...don't skimp, get a premium coated filter."},{"rating":"2","title":"Go buy It","review":"The 4 star rating is given based on the price of a Hoya Filter. Hopefully it lives to the rating when comes to durability and protecting lens from any accident."},{"rating":"2","title":"worth the bucks","review":"This is a fantastic filter at a great price. Normally, I'd expect to spend over $30 for every filter I buy, so this was a bargain. Hoya means quality. If you have a $1000 lens and protect it with a $50 filter, that gives you lot of insurance for the life of that lens."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good one .","review":"I can not find any difference in an image taken with and other taken without the filter. So, I guess that is good, because I buy it to protect the lens from scratches and dirt, but I was afraid of the halos and gost images, and all the extrenge creatures that I have seen with the \\"Polarized\\" Zeikos U.V filters.The filter fit almost nice in the canon EF-S 18- 55 IS lens But I think this is due to the plastic lens thread.The HMC do a great work keeping the reflection out of the image but, sincerely, it is a pain to clean this filter."},{"rating":"2","title":"Superb Filter","review":"Bought 2 of these to fit to my Sigma 70-300mm dg apo and 18-55mm canon lenses. They fit perfect. Had to go with multi coated glass, so I chose to give this Hoya product a try. Wow was I impressed. Packaging was nice, opened it up to inspect the glass and it was just crystal clear. No scratches at all after shipping. I was pleased with the feel of the metal ring as well, as it felt quite sturdy. I don't necessarily plan on testing out the durability intentionally, but I feel the filter could take a good whack on the outer ring and still be good to go. Pictures were all amazingly clear, and the filter did it's job well. Great job Hoya!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Better than Tiffen but still gives flare","review":"Shoot professionally, frequently in low light conditions or darn close to dark. At a recent company Christmas Party this filter gave me lots of shots with some flare. Looking to get Pro1 version to hopefully solve this issue. The HMC 67mm on a Tamron 17-50 DI lens did Not give flare under identical circumstances. Will try to upload picture(s) of flare."},{"rating":"1","title":"HOYA 58mm UV(C) not UV-0","review":"This item is not labeled correctly. I ordered this item hoping it would be a UV-0, which I know is in part my fault. However, it would have saved me money and time if it were labeled correctly. It is actually Hoya HMC UV(C). This piece of glass has way worse flaring that another filter I purchased for a few bucks more. Check images for my comparison.The worst part of this filter is it got stuck on my 300+ dollar lens and I freaked out because it wasn't budging. I was finally able to get it off without breaking my lens.The other bad thing about it is the lens cover cap doesn't clip in all the way, like a previous review mentioned. I didn't think it was a big deal until I saw what it was like in person. See images to see what I mean.All in all I would rather just fork out the extra money and get the same filter I already have or try and find a UV-0 like I was hoping this was."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beware of Glare and Flare","review":"I trust Hoya brand, but even though this filter says it is multi-coated, one of those coats is not anti-glare. Make sure you have a circular polarizer handy. Otherwise, you may run into glare and flare spots with your photos.I live in Seattle, so it is difficult to tell when cloudy days receive the gift of sunlight here and there. After a strenuous uphill hike to the top of a spectacular view, being without a polarizer, several amazing pictures had glare and flare spots due to the sun peaking out. Total bummer.In summary, I don't have much experience with filters (yet), so maybe this is commonly known with UV filters that are not labeled as pro, or it is a known fact in general. I gave this product 4 stars due to the ambiguity of the multi-coated claim; it is definitely not anti-glare. Take it for literal value (UV coated only).On the bright side (no pun intended), the lens cap for my Canon EOS 500D (Rebel T1i) fits nicely."},{"rating":"2","title":"Serves its purpose","review":"Used it on my hike through the Enchantments to protect my lens from the elements. Pictures came out great (except for a bit of flare on one or two), but rain spots were a little too obvious on some (more so than a regular lens). Construction seems good and durable, but not amazing - but that's about what you expect for the price of this item. Overall, I'm happy with it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great lens protector, not much difference in pictures","review":"Easily screwed onto the ef 18-55 IS lens, and is a great lens protector. I haven't noticed much of a difference in my pictures, however, unless you are shooting 70% of your shots outside in the sun, this will be more of a hindrance than a quality booster."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect","review":"This is exactly what I was looking for.

I have not been disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"The last HOYA filter I purchased","review":"I have been using HOYA filters for years, but no more. I purchased this filter in May 2012 to protect Canon kit lens on a Canon DSLR. In July the filter cracked, while in protective camera bag with lens cap on. This is the second HOYA filter that died on me like this within a year. Yes, camera bag must have been bumped into something, but the impact has been nothing out of ordinary--nobody dropped the bag. I blame my last HOYA filter's early demise on the design flaw common to all HOYA filters I have purchased. Unlike the B&W filter I purchased as replacement (ASIN: B0000BZL67), the metal frame of the HOYA has no inner metal ring for the lens cap to stand on, so that any impact on the lens cap, however mild, impacts the glass directly. The reportedly better optical characteristics of the B&W are a welcome bonus."},{"rating":"1","title":"Multicoated but the glass had rough defects...","review":"Cleaned lens filters for installation and found each had a hard grain of glass or sand or something embedded in the p,ane of the filter glass....

I opened the case and found one of the four motor/fan housing mounting bolts was completely out of its fixture and one of the remaining three was loose. The one totally out was of course the least accessible so I had to take the whole case apart, put the bolt back in place and reassemble the unit making sure all the other fasteners were tight along the way. (It took about 25 minutes start to finish). I then mounted the unit on the ceiling of my workshop and began using it. It cleans the air like a champ. I don't know what noise scale the other reviewers are using, but my unit makes less noise than I expected.Oh by the way, I called JDS and complained about the loose bolt problem; they apologized and promptly sent me a free charcoal filter as compensation for my troubles. I will have no problems dealing with JDS in the future."},{"rating":"2","title":"Top notch Filtration","review":"I bought this filter after some careful review of what's available out there for the modest price range.

This filter exceeds my expectations for keeping harmful airborne particulates out of my lungs. I work in a two car garage as most of us woodworkers do and I can say I notice a big difference.

The unit is designed and constructed reasonable well, quality seems good so far. It makes a little more noise than I expected, based on the other review, but it isn't unreasonably loud. The remote and timer are great.Cons... The unit sports an \\"electrostatic air filter\\" Now, when I hear that, I expect to find a high voltage power supply with an ion charged attraction surface (like my whole house filter installed in my central forced hot air heating system). However, what is in this unit is a plastic 1\\" thick filter that can be washed and reused. That washable filter is a good feature, but I think that it is misleading to label it as electrostatic. I'm sure that technically it has electrostatic feature, but certainly not what I expected.I'm going to keep the unit as I believe it will meet my needs and like I said the design is well thought out and the fabrication quality is good."},{"rating":"1","title":"Expect damage in shipping.","review":"The case is too weak for shipping.

A word of caution...if you sample the first couple songs -- you will want/ need to purchase this."},{"rating":"2","title":"It was AWESOME!","review":"Regardless whether it was a low-budget film, the screen writer did a real nice job! I enjoyed all of the good points they brought up about family, expectations, Asian-American heritage, etc. This would be a good film to show in an Asain American studies course or just for anyone who wants to find humor within a stereotypical situation. Can't wait until a sequel comes out!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money","review":"I did not notice any significant desensitizing from this product.

Amazon had the lowest price, the book was in stock, and it shipped quickly. And it was exactly the right book - the info on the web site provided all the details I needed to make sure I was ordering the right edition (as these things change quite frequently in law books). Everyone should seriously consider getting all their textbooks here."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful book","review":"This book, in a nutshell, is amazing. Atlas doesn't shy away from using sometimes-familiar language, empathizing with the reader and clearly explaining all major topics. It is very detailed but well-organized, and the musical examples are beautifully chosen. Additionally, the book is aesthetically pleasure -- it has lots of nice illustrations.The anthology, which is sold as a separate book, is almost a must-have, since Atlas discusses most if not all works contained with it. (Also, it's a well-chosen anthology, and worth adding to your library.)Therefore, if you like Renaissance music and want to learn more, or if you know a little about it and enjoy reading academic textbooks, this is the book for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Indispensable","review":"This book is indispensable for every one, student or amateur, interested in Renaissance music. Clear and understable, with many examples (in this book and in the anthology companion), Pr. Allan W. Atlas book presents music in the historical, geographical, political and artistic context which produced it. In addition to excellent presentation of composers, musical forms (mass, motet, chanson, instrumental music) and many works, pedagogical exercices are real introductions to research : how to edit a Busnoys chanson, how to understand payrolls. Moreover, Pr Atlas asks readers about the opportunity of adding a sharp, understanding contemporary earwitness texts. The epilogue is about what is generally the introduction : is there any unity in what musicologists call Renaissance music (1400-1600)?"},{"rating":"1","title":"content = excellent; quality of construction = the worst book ever!","review":"This is an excellent introduction to Renaissance music; however, the construction of the newer paperback is horrific. One hopes this is the kind of book that one has for many, many years. However after less than a month, the spine cracked and pages, nay chapters began to fall out. It is as if they didn't use enough glue to hold the thing together. I am very disappointed. Advice, by a used hardcover edition. The score anthology has the same problem."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good but dated","review":"Everything is fantastic, except the De Prez info is outdated because the book was published in 1998-much has been discovered."},{"rating":"1","title":"Joe Louis : American Hero Betrayed","review":"Joe Louis was before my time but always been a big fan of his ..Was disappointed in this DVD ..Didn't tellme anything I didn't already know.HBO, producer didn't do their homework..Left out how the war started betweenbetween Joe and IRS - USO benefit fight..The original film clips were entertaining but that was about it..HBO should get another producer and do a remake ..HBO missed the boat on this one..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Interesting but not orthodox","review":"Dr. Errico's comments are interesting and could be enlightening but the reader should know his interpretation of the meaning of Scripture is not orthodox but more closely related to Gnosticism. He explains away all miracles and is interested in that doctrinal view. There are some insights here but those who adhere to mainstream Christianity will not find much inspiring here."},{"rating":"2","title":"I can't believe it's over","review":"I would say that this was an overall great book, I agree with others that it seemed rush but it did give me closure with the end of a series that I have been reading for a decade. I'm really going to miss this and I have to say one part in the book has haunted me in my sleep. Let's just say the little big space maneuver and the short quote that came with it had a major effect."},{"rating":"2","title":"Overall good book","review":"I'm sorry to see this series end. I know they are going to advance the timeline when the new game appears, but it won't be the same. And he left such nice openings for further plot development too. I agree with another reviewer. Where was the first thorin? Plus it moved too fast. Should have been two books."},{"rating":"2","title":"Are there loose ends?","review":"To me, Endgame seemed unbelievably short for the final showdown of the FedCom Civil War. However, Coleman continues to surprise me, with his clear and concise editing. My only gripe is a certain flaw in the storyline: What happened to Colonel Christifori and the First Thorin? Throughout the Civil War, Christifori's character was built upon, until the final snapping point where he wanted to be there when \\"the axe fell\\".The axe has fallen all right. So where did Archer go? He was my personal favorite of the new characters introduced in the civil war. To see him disappear without a trace saddened me. Still, my compliments to each of the authors for a brilliant saga."},{"rating":"1","title":"'ello","review":"An ok book, but I only really read it to see where all the storylines end up.I'm a huge fan of Battletech books, but this was pretty feeble.Victor Davion started off as a ruthless, tough, capable leader, and ends up a total wimp who looses every war, every battle he's in. Even in this book, where he eventually 'wins', it's only because everyone else carries him.Most of the caracters have changed so much, they are nothing like when they first started out, and don't even seem to progess as they should, suddenly changing whole opinions and outlooks chapter to chapter.I read it once, 'cos it's Battletech. Won't be reading it again unless I'm very bored.P.S. Mechwarrior Darkage is complete crap."},{"rating":"1","title":"Goes out with a wimper","review":"I have collected the entire Battletech series of paperbacks and the only good thing I can say about how this \\"end of this generation\\" finale opus is that it completes my set.I've read that the authors who picked up the task of finishing the series worked off Michael Stackpole's original outline but that outline apparently did not allow for the build up over the last 20 books to fizzle out in a couple of hundred pages. Weak at best and with a cliff hanger ending that has no where to go with this generational ending. Very, very, disappointing. If you're a Battletech fan and want to know how the FedCom civil war ends and what happens to Katherine/Katrina pass on this book and just imagine an ending of your own choice."},{"rating":"1","title":"Piece of garbage!","review":"Don't waste your money.....I ordered 2 of these and the same parts were missing from both packages.

I'll have to stick with cotton."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT AS DESCRIBED!!","review":"You will NOT get the underwear described in this description. The company who sends the product claims they have NO control over the description and only fill the orders. POOR Customer Service, trying to cover their own behinds. They have my money, they're happy!I ordered panties that were 82% Nylon and another pair that was 90% Nylon. The two pair I received were 100% Nylon. When I received my items, there was a note saying that the two had been merged into one item.The descriptions of the two items were different and I paid different prices. Paying two different prices, I expected to receive two items. You should change the description of both of these items to reflect the merger and charge the same price!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Panty, But...","review":"Great panty, but the waistband tends to roll due to its high cut.

These looked like them, the material said the same as my old ones, and so I ordered 7. Even though the size said the same as my old ones, these new ones were uncomfortably too small. And it was like an oven, it held in sweat, and actually made me perspire all the more. So, within 1 hour, I removed them and put another pair on, same thing. Then I put on one of the old pants and I was comfortable..no perspiration, especially under the pants. I cannot figure that out, as both pants say 100% nylon. It must be in the weave.

The wheels are just the right size to overcome the pitfalls in most... lawns without being too large and cumbersome. The only drawback is its weight.

The reflector itself works fine; this could be a decent product if the zipper wasn't such a cheap piece of junk."},{"rating":"1","title":"Zipper gets stuck.","review":"This product has a reversible liner that acts as a slipcover that slides over a diffuser panel. If you aren't really, really careful when changing the cover (turning it inside out and re-covering the diffuser), the zipper gets stuck. While still functional, it looks sloppy and unprofessional. My solution is to have the color reflector I need already on there BEFORE you arrive at the photo shoot. #1 to avoid an unprofessional appearance and #2 to save time - if the zipper gets stuck it takes some time to guide the zipper back and forth properly to fix the problem."},{"rating":"2","title":"great!","review":"Great product!!! i took my girl for outdoor shooting!

It is a reflector, read on. I did not realize how big this reflector was until I got it. It popped open into this massive disk. My first thought is it's huge. Since that first opening I've used it to bounce light into speckled shade around sunset from 50 feet on to 3 people. It covered them all. I've used it to fill shadows in tight spots from other distances that may not be possible with smaller reflectors. Because of it's size it does make a great diffuser, again, able to cover multiple people.Because of it's size it does not pack up small. Yes, it does reduce in size to about 18 inches. Still it does require some shimming of gear in my on-location-bag to carry it. Since it does require an assistant to bounce light to the scene you may as well have your assistant carry it for you.The quality is good. It's a Wesctott. I've seen this brand in my local photo stores selling for much higher prices."},{"rating":"2","title":"A workhorse! Great, but some flaws.","review":"I bought this with the light stand and reflector arm, so I will review all of them.Reflector:Good-Great and very usefull. I have put it to work in every single of my photo shoots.Bad-The zipper. Worked great at first then after some use it would get caught on the lining almost tore it. Before I figures out a trick (I'll tell you in the following section) I could only zip it up part of the way.Work-Around-If the zipper is giving you problems when you put the main piece into the reflector sleeve start pushing the main piece (diffuser) until it loses it's round shape. It makes it easier for the zipper to zip up.Light Stand and Arm:Good- They work well.Bad- Plastic holders and segment screws are easy to break. YOU NEED A SAND BAG!!!!!

There really isn't anything wrong with the zipper, you just have to compress the disc a bit by pushing it into the ground or you wont be able to zip it up.

It's got five styles of reflector. The silver, white, and gold all work wonderfully, I haven't used the black or shoot through yet. Make sure you realize how big 40 inchs is before you buy this-- it's most of your arm span. You might not need something this big, in which case you might want something smaller than this. If you don't want something this big it's a great value. My only quibbles are that it doesn't fold up that well and just because of it's side and zipper I wouldn't want to quickly switch back and forth between the black/silver side and the white/gold side if I were shooting a model.

The levels have fighting and puzzles like all Zelda games. The bosses are easy, which is disappointing because they are really easy, no challenge at all. Finally, the story is excellent. A new bad guy comes looking for power, turns Zelda to stone, you have to gather 4 elements and reforge a sword. A basic Zelda game. I give this game 4 stars because it's to short.

But there was one trend that nintendo kept going with in the Game Boy games They had the same formula when it came to the plot, story, and weapons/tools. I lost the feeling of excitement I used to feel when I got something new in the games, and I got bored with getting the same stuff in most of the games, so I almost didn't buy this one.I almost made a huge mistake, I finally got it and it was like the first day I got the original. I was shocked by how much they changed the formula they always seemed to stick to. I haven't had this much fun playing a Zelda game since OoT.This is a must buy, It renewed my faith in the GBA Zeldas. I enjoyed the wind waker, and the older console Zeldas, but most of the GB games haven't changed a lot, they left me bored.

If you are able to play this game non-stop you may be able to see the end, but I wouldn't count on being able to pull that off without missing some major sleep. I tried to leave it on pause and/or sleep mode overnight, but the game would just freeze and have to be reset.

It is a sophistcated book showcasing Phillips' deft skills as an author. He expertly handles different times and points of view. The novel works as a literary achievement as well as a top-notch crime tale.There's a lot of [stuff] to wade through out there in the book stores -- same-old-same-old cops-n-robbers plodding through the usual formulas.

I had no trouble whatsoever following these stories, and the subtle emotional payoff that was delivered as they all tied together was an original, unexpected delight. Phillips doesn't write for dummies. He's hunting big game on the literary frontier. And with this book he has bagged a winner. He manages to combine deadpan humor, stark reality and deep, resonant emotions in a way unique to the current spate of by-the-numbers best sellers clogging the bookstores.

I fall into the latter category. Reading a book should be a pleasure, not a task. The story jumps from 1952 to 1979 and 1989, without any logic. Worse, the characters are rather boring compared to other Phillips novels. Even more confusing, most of the book is told in third person, but sometimes changes to a character in first person.

Borrowing extensively from previous books - especially Sutcliffe and Fielder's \\"L'Historia Bandido\\" - and press cuttings the book is littered throughout with careless errors, and dwells, tabloid fashion, on the more sensationalist and 'media friendly' issues such as drugs, his sex life, and his involvement in the rainforest. In an 'exclusive' interview he gave to the Daily Express newspaper at the time of the book's release, Sting said - \\"I have led a pretty wild life, but none of it's in the book\\". He gave a more succinct review on Virgin radio when he said that the book was \\"crap\\". We don't disagree - it was fun to read at the time because it is about Sting, but it left you feeling a guilty and a little queasy afterwards."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your time or money","review":"This is by far the worst book ever written about Sting.

It reads like a cheap tabloid story, quoting anonymous sources for wild accusations, being downright mean to its subject (and also Sting's former bandmates in The Police, Stewart Copeland and Andy Summers). While Sting may have his share of skeletons in his closet and has no doubt lived a wild life, there is little in this book to lead you to actually believe the stories Clarkson tells.

The music and gameplay are fabulous, and even playing it just recently, after so many years, I was still impressed. The music, the characters... Everything joins together to make an incredible game.

Points and 12 coins here' s a tip you know that guy that stands by that stump? That's gong don't talk to him he'll join the shining force but he has no weapons he just uses a spell called heal also in battle when you attack there's no turn based battle your guy just attacks and the enemy doesn't attack same with enemies if an enemy say a Rune knight it just attacks and your guy doesn't do any thing You'll love this game as much as I do.

Even using a different stamp pad that we had for arts & crafts projects, the results were only marginally better and required multiple applications of ink before getting sufficient coverage (so maybe the problem is the stamps themselves; they are a very hard foam and would require a very wet stamp pad).

'Borrrrn in the USA!!!'\\"?The author is remarkably uninteresting, and his subjects not much better. Even the cop, commenting on \\"41 Shots,\\" could have been engrossing had they picked a more interesting cop. This one was just like, \\"How?

There is very little insight here, and the result is very disappointing. As someone who has been affected greatly and thought deeply about Bruce's music, I couldn't even finish reading it.Here are the criticisms of what I did read:* Superficial commentary on songs worthy of great comment* Very poor editing: I think Coles just transcribed his interviewees stories directly from tape without editing. It's like one big run-on sentence. It is choppy and totally unlyrical. Frankly, it hurts my eyes!* Some of the people aren't even Bruce fans. They are acquainted with Bruce fans or have observed the impact of Bruce on America without participating in it and experiencing it.

Also like any traditional martial arts book though, those who practice a traditional martial art probably knows most (not all) of this stuff.Overall I like the book and recommend it to anyone who wants to supplement their training, anyone who wants to know more about Mas Oyama, and anyone who wants to follow along as they formally learn Kyukushin Karate.

Yes, they are cute stories and just the right length for young readers. However, they rely too heavily on sight words, including many sight words that aren't particularly useful for beginning readers. I tried these with my 4 and 1/2 year old at his teacher's urging. While entertaining, they seem pointless at this stage as a learning tool. They provide little opportunity to practice phonics. Further, they introduce some very random sight words and ignore frequently occuring sight words that he needs to learn for fluency. I do think that these will be good after he's mastered phonics and basic sight words, but they are not geared to \\"brand new readers.\\" My daughter's kindergarten teacher introduced me to many books that were better suited to a brand new reader.

Wonderfully written and with an edgy tone that says history isn't black and white and has incidents that we'll never know about, it explores a time period you don't find in novels. This isn't the Roman Empire at its height conquering Britian and kicking butt. It's the slow slide of the end. I always liked De Hartog's character of Martinus Harinxma because he examins himself and his life without pity. This book links him to a centurion in the most original way I've ever seen in a story. I will never forget the hilarious and sad scene where the German tribes send an old dog in a Roman helmet as an insult to the Romans and how the Centurion, taking pity on the dog and his men, saves all of them-much to the incomprehension of the tribesmen. Even in his serious stories, De Hartog injects humor and surprise that are always believable since life is full of such things.

When she checked it in a short time, the water was boiling rapidly and could not be reduced to a simmer. No matter what setting, it just plain got scortching hot.There is supposed to be a one year warranty, but Amazon only takes returns in the first 30 days and in original packing.

I give it high marks on design, function and quality of materials, but it is much larger than I anticipated, so it may not do much traveling. It's big enough to fry a whole chicken with room to spare, so it's more appropriate for a large family than for empty-nesters on the move. The surface heats up quickly and evenly, is truly nonstick and washes up nicely. The low sides and oval shape make it a nice keep-warm server for foods like meatballs. I found the same \\"cons\\" as many of the other reviewers: the legs get loose with normal use and it would be nice to have a steam vent in the lid. Overall, it's a very nice skillet."},{"rating":"1","title":"handle comes loose","review":"I am pleased with the cooking part of the skilletBUT the screw holding the handles keep coming loose.and the handles are LOOSE.I even purchased some kind of glue to hold the screws and that did not helpI will contact customer serviceDart"},{"rating":"2","title":"Steam grill and cook book ordered seperately","review":"I fried chicken in it, I was really impressed with the ease of use.

As other reviewers have pointed out, you have to constantly screw the legs back in. Amazing: you'd think the knuckleheads at Presto would have corrected that problem before making any more. In two months, I've had to do this three times - the screws keep coming loose. Don't think you can just over-tighten them - in time, that would break the plastic legs."},{"rating":"2","title":"Even heat on a slick surface","review":"PRESTO's description of this electric skillet as \\"professional\\" is a little overstated perhaps but this is a good skillet for the price. The weakneeses involve keeping the legs and lid handle screws tight without stripping the aluminum threads but this is a problem with all the electric skillets I have had. The stregths are the long oval shape so that bacon gets little chance to curl, the non stick surface which, so far, is one of the best we have ever had, the glass lid is thick and unlikely to break and it is attractive enough to sit on the table when the food is cooked. I had purchased another, less expensive, model shortly prior to purchasing this one and I had to take it back because one side of the cooking surface was much cooler than the other."},{"rating":"2","title":"Presto Professional Electric skillet and server","review":"We thoroughly enjoy our new Presto electric cooker.

I haven't used an electric skillet for years, mainly because they weren't durable. This one is attractive, heats quickly, and is easy to clean.

Though it does have some techniques that can be helpful and some good warmups, I thought the majority of it was very common sense and would be covered in most teacher prep programs. Good teaching techniques can be good reminders for even the most experienced of teachers, but I can't imagine that too many people forget how to give constructive criticism to students or how to sing \\"Bingo\\" with students' names. Also, there's no mention of technology (besides CD players), which can and should play a large part in the modern day classroom."},{"rating":"2","title":"worth the money","review":"Was a good book overall, but i would have liked to see more on subframing in early 50s chevies.

The band sounds tired and listless for the most part. For you fans of Derek Trucks(which I am not)he hasn't yet inserted himself into the ABB sound at the time of these Beacon shows. Dickey is hardly present and a shell of the player he was around the late 90's. Despite what some other reviewers have mentioned, Gregg's singing on this set is not near his best. His range is limited and he's struggling to stay on key. Granted, he's not able to reach the high notes of his younger days but, I've seen him in the past few years and singing way better than here. This record is for completest fans only. With all the great live Brothers discs out there, look elsewhere........"},{"rating":"1","title":"A word to the wise....","review":"As a huge Allmans fan, I was anxious to hear the newest entry in the string of live discs they've done. What a disappointment! The sound quality is horrible. I really can't believe that a major label released it. It's truly an embarrasment quality-wise. You know what it reminded me of? When I sat second row at the Beacon last year, off to the side, right in front of the speakers. I literally had to wear ear plugs.....and that's exactly what this disc sounds like. Like listening through ear plugs. The song selection is pretty good, especially if you like the early bluesy Allmans. But it's really hard to get past the crappy sound. If you own (and enjoy)either of the last 2 live Allmans discs, you'll be mighty disappointed with this baby."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buyer Beware...","review":"Anyone expecting \\"Peakin'\\" to join the ranks of \\"Live At Fillmore East\\", the live portions of \\"Eat A Peach\\", or even the often very solid two sets of \\"An Evening With The Allman Brothers\\" released in the mid-90s will have to look elsewhere. \\"Peakin'\\" is poorly mixed, the song selection is rather dull, and the lead work by Dickey Betts is very often shockingly bad. I'm talking out of tune, incorrect key, meandering to the point of incoherence bad. This set appears to be a contract filler, and though I would hope that the organization would not resort to a tactic that rips off their fans, proof that Mr. Betts was indeed forced out of the band for legitimate musical reasons."},{"rating":"1","title":"Confirmed","review":"Members of the band have confirmed that this is just a contractobligation filler.

Whoever claims that Derek Trucks isn't ready to play with the ABB is out of their mind, or just hasn't seen him at his best.

As far as the songset goes, it's darn near perfect, with some of the old classics revisited(this should have been the case with the 1st and lousy 2nd set cd's but wasn't)but 'High Falls' just drags on way longer than it should have, 'Whipping Post' would have been a better choice. The band sounds tired and unrehearsed and Gregg's vocal are bit raw, maybe the end of the tour? Clearly Betts and Trucks are not a good match: sour notes, sloppy playing, etc. Basically a nice try but no cigar, maybe next time it will be better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money!!","review":"I'm a big brothers' fan but this is simply a disc thrown together to fulfill a contract obligation. \\"Evening.. 1&2\\" pretty much show the band in it's great mid-90s form.

To my ears, it is not one of the best in sound quality; but it is far from terrible as some would have it.From the word I had heard was the reason why Dicky Betts was kicked out of the band was because his addictions had made him difficult to deal with and his playing had become very uneven gig to gig.

Without grossly offending innocent readers of this review, i will say only that Klein includes a mind-bogglingly detailed description of the disinterment of the bodies of Jackie's two stillborn children. Yes, you read that right. I never thought I'd feel sorry for jackie Kennedy, who always seemed strong enough to deal with her life. But I am now desperately sorry for her, and for her two surviving children. This is outrageous, and Klein and his publishers should be ashamed of themselves. (Too bad there is no provision for \\"no stars.\\")"},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh, how low can Ed Klein descend?","review":"If you're interested in reading about Mrs. Onassis' menstrual cycle, which parts of President Kennedy's body she massaged after his death, the disinterrment of her dead children's bodies, well...get your kicks from reading the Starr report instead...This book is based on gossip, attributing stories and quotes to people who are dead and can neither refute nor verify them and is an insidious attempt to cash in on Mrs. Onassis' life.Shame on you Ed Klein."},{"rating":"1","title":"How do you spell \\"trash\\"","review":"Never have I read a biography of anyone who was trashed so much as Jackie was in this book. I've only read 6 chapters, and I doubt I'll pick it up to attempt the 7th, but what I read was hearsay, quotes from people who probably weren't her friends (wannabees, maybe from years ago) and I'll bet a lot of speculation. Sure some of what he wrote may be true, but does it have to be detailed to titilate us just enough to let our imaginations go down the wrong road?About the only positive thing I got out of this book was the way he was able to get me to really feel Jackie's pain -- from her husband's death, her fear of the future and shabby treatment from \\"friends\\" and peers. I hurt for her 36 years later for this pain and for continued shabby treatment by this author."},{"rating":"1","title":"A complete waste","review":"This book is a complete waste of paper and of time to read. I only got through the first 50 pages and i could already see the horirble writing on the wall. THe book is like two books shoved into one everyother sentences conflics with the previoius and most of it is heresay and taken out of context at that. Edward Klein should be ashamed of himself as anyone who allowed such a book to be published, i am glad i didn't read further on because it would have probably jsut made my stomach turn. IF you want to read pure trash, out of text qoutes, false allegations, etc. then this is the book for you but if you want accurate, in text quotes/conversations,real accounts then there are those books out there are worth your time and day and i would happily recommend them to you but this not one of them. This book should only be used to start a fire or to sit on and nothing more. Refuse to recommend this book to any living soul"},{"rating":"1","title":"Yuk! What an Awful Excuse for a Book!","review":"I HATE this book. I have been a reader of books on the Kennedy's for almost 20 years. I've waded through a lot of smut. This book ranks right up there with the major, unreliable smut. Klein may have met Jackie, but much like Ted Bundy, Klein manipulates that encounter to rape her in this book, disclosing information no one would ever want published.There are glaring factual errors. Jackie was not at Patrick's funeral. Caroline was not married at age 25. Klein neither knew nor understood anything about Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just Jackie","review":"Edward Klein is the author of another Kennedy book titled Jack and Jackie: A Love Story. I found his first book too focused on scandals....many of which were not well documented. When I received this book and immediately realized that is was by the same author I was very disappointed. If you are looking for an interesting read on Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis' later years I would suggest Reading Jackie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Is that all there is?","review":"Nothing new here. Klein repeats all the same stories, tales, and fables we have read elsewhere before, throws in a few new ones based on unnamed sources in a workaday prose that does little to illuminate the former first lady. Kitty Kelly and C. David Heymann topped the field in their marvelous tomes on Jackie. Klein and Chris Anderson are wannabees. The photographs, however, are good but only because Jackie is still one of the world's most beautiful women."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible","review":"I don't mind it when people shatter a facade. Only as long as it's true. This book holds no credibility. When Klein claims he was an acquaintence with Jackie, I think that means he picked up something she dropped once. Another thing that seems suspicious is that Klein keeps writing books about the Kennedys. How many times can you write about the same subject? Get a life, Klein."},{"rating":"1","title":"bad recording","review":"Officer Eddie Morales gives you a exellent overview of the basic of an police officer procedures on self defense,arrest etc.Unfortunately the way the dvd was recorded is the worst it cuts off momentarily,somentimes the sound goes out."},{"rating":"2","title":"What a great guide!","review":"For those who like to discover the city at low cost.

I used to use Carmex lip balm and if you like that tingle from Carmex you will like the tingle from this lip balm. I also love the color. I am African American with brown eyes and hair and wear warm colors, and earth tones. This is nice on my complexion and isn't over powering with color and shimmer. I am a busy mom with young children so makeup is not quite in the regimen (due to time). It does come off somewhat easily but it feels wonderful while on. It kind of gives you the feeling of a pick me up. I also love the fact that I can find it in drugstores and grocery stores (no special trips) not to mention that there are natural ingredients. I highly recommend. I could also see a teenager or young girl using this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Happy to find this again.","review":"Burt's Bees Lip Shimmer makes my lips feel great and Nutmeg is the perfect color for me.

I was delighted to find this product and color on Amazon.com."},{"rating":"2","title":"there's a buzzzzz with Burt's Bees!","review":"I gave this product 5 stars because it's that good.

Burt's bees is such a wonderful Company!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Burts misses on this one","review":"I really like BB products, but this one falls flat. the rounded shape of the balm makes it awkward to stay within the 'lines' of my lips. I twisted out a bit too much, and then couldn't twist it back in and ended up pretty much wasting the whole tube. It certainly feels nice, but I think you should stick with the lip glosses. Those are better."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best title in my collection of Sega Genesis cartridges.","review":"Words alone cannot express how awesome Lightening Force is, but I can, however, say that this game is the best game I've purchased thus far.

I chose it because I thought Berlitz was supposed to have an established reputation. When I got to Korea, the first day in my apartment I tried to decipher the buttons on my washing machine. I spent an hour looking through this dictionary and NOT ONE word that appeared on my washing machine was in the dictionary. So the Korean-English half wasn't much good to me.Next I tried the English-Korean part, looking up the word for \\"bag\\" so I could ask for one at the grocery store. The Korean word listed under \\"bag (paper, plastic)\\" was \\"kabang\\", which is actually the Korean word for \\"purse\\".

I could read the scriptures from the opposite side of the page, it was so dark and distracting and the paper was terribly thin. The Genuine Leather bonding felt like imitation leather. Stiff and grainy and paper like.I was thoroughly disappointed after waiting 8 days for this shipment to arrive. I finally went to a local bible store and picked up a decent bible for 8 more bucks.

The maps are better quality, but I didn't buy it for the maps. If I cannot read the text easily, it completely defeats the purpose of a Giant Print bible. I would normally be forgiving and offered at least 2 or 3 stars, but the fundamental purpose of the book is compromised with this thin paper, so I cannot give it any more than 1 star. Given that many people gave it very good reviews, I believe the paper theirs was printed on is thicker, because it is not something that one would not notice.I'm returning mine."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent value","review":"This giant print bible is a great value for the price! And the print is truly giant, not like what others call giant. It is easy to read. It seems to be a sturdy bible, and the concordance and suggested readings pages in the back are very helpful. The leather binding had a strong leather odor at first, but seems to be fading a little now with use. The bible comes packed in a very strong box, that I will use for other purposes in my craft room.

The Dead Dog arc was brilliant, but they say it won't be in this collection, presumably because they would have to pay Debbie Harry for the rights to use her song.

Was enjoying the show, it is as good as it always was, and then reached the season 2 surprise, when it skips over the entire dead dog records arc. Complete crap. It should be advertised that it is missing episodes, and not called a collector's edition. I gladly would have paid more money for the set to have the story arc in it and the music from the original airing. Reminiscent of the Tour of Duty releases. The scumbags releasing these things are taking advantage of the fact that these were some of the best shows on television, and that fans of them would love to be able to see them again, so they figure we will gladly just the shortchanges up the rear and just be happy that we get to see some of the show.

It's a shame because Wiseguy is a perfect example of how great TV used to be, but you wouldn't know that from watching these DVDs.

Then we get the mother of all problems the end of the Sonny Steelgrave arc. To not include the Nights In White Satin theme, just shows truly that these companies care about NOTHING but their bottom line. Fans be damned. Well I say I paid 60 dollars for the complete series with all music intact and every episode included (with the 2 hr post series tv movie) and I am HAPPY.

In a time where extended multi-story episodic shows are the norm, Wiseguy was one of the first to use this format in a prime time drama. The first season is a classic starting with the Sonny Steelgrave arc, and Ray Sharkey as Sonny is the perfect foil to Ken Wahl's Vinnie Terranova. Every episode has something worth watching, with appearences by Ray Sharkey, Annette Benning, Kevin Spacey and many others you'll probably reconize.

Not enough to do my 3 dogs on the same day. Also, I took the battery off of the charger and was unable to do nails at that time. I went to do them the next day and the battery was dead.

Then the battery charge that was giving you 15-20 minutes is giving you 5-10. I have three dogs now and it's a big hassle to have to divide up the nail grinding event over several days when it can be done all at one time. I'm on my third Dremel Minimite now!!! I could have purchased a very substantial handheld tool with the money I've invested in Dremel... I can't even figure out where to find replacement batteries to purchase.So, it's a good tool for a while, but be prepared to purchase it again and again, especially if you have multiple mutts :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for dog toenails","review":"This is my third mini Dremel.

This particular model fits nicely into the hand and one charge does the nails of three dogs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't work","review":"I was waiting in eager anticipation for this product to arrive...boy was I disappointed when it did. First of all, it feels and looks cheap. I immediately charge the battery since by dogs are in dire need of a nail trimming and this is basically why I bought this tool. After inserting the battery, I turn the setting to \\"lO\\" and realized this was way too slow so I switched over to the \\"HI\\" setting and nothing...it would not even rotate. I thought perhaps I did not move the cheap feeling switch over far enough but I could not move it over any farther. I than took out the battery and reinserted it into the body and it turned on for a brief second. I realized that it would not turn on unless I had my hand pressing the bottom of the battery to make good contact! I'm in the process of returning it and will now order a Proxxon which I stumbled upon researching for another dremel. Do yourself a favor and spend the extra bucks on something else.Extremely disappointed,TKM"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for Dog Toenails","review":"I bought this after my old Dremel Multi-Pro Cordless started turning itself off as I was using it. I like the Mini-Mite better for dog toenails - it has less vibration so it doesn't make my hand go numb. It also is much quieter, I can Dremel while watching TV even on the high setting - before I had to wait for a commercial. The low setting was good for starting puppies with the Dremel, and the high setting is fine for my adults. I have corgis and a BC. For really big dogs with big tough toenails, it might not have enough rpm to get the job done fast, but it's great for my dogs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stops working over time","review":"This tool was great at first. Unfortunately, the battery gradually stops holding a charge, and becomes too weak to be used for even a few minutes. The battery on my unit also began leaking and it corroded the connections in the motor section just after the warranty expired. I would recommend buying a more powerful and better made dremel, even if you intend to use it for dog nail trimming, with the hope that it will last longer.While it still worked, I found it very useful, and my dog liked it better than the nail clippers.

The battery pack finally gave up the ghost, and I decided to get myself a new dremel. Looking around I found this one, I amm usually skeptical unless I can hold it. Well I had some plastic models that were crying for attention, so I bought this model.I was pleased with the new grip, and had no issues with the control like some others. It ran a bit faster than the old model, but that could be because I was used to the dying battery pack. Be careful if you are using this on plastics that could burn under high speed grinding.The tool did what it was supposed to do, and it does it well.

This from two dogs who were terrified of a nail clipper.The Minimite is the perfect size to fit in my hand, allowing for various angles of use. The medium drums are great for a large dog's nails.

I heard of using this product and was afraid, but I tried it on myself first to see what he would be feeling and it was fine.

I've since used it on our dog several times and it is quite effective. Having the ability to switch speeds when I am concerned that the nail is getting \\"hot\\" is excellent.I don't know how someone could say the battery life is short - I've left mine out for a couple of weeks only to pick it up and have it be just as effective.

This Dremel has some new features that I really like. The battery goes into the charger and the drill only one way, so you don't get confused on which way to put it in. I really like that. It goes at the slower pace versus a power drill, and that is great for hand crafted items. Easy to hold and do any task needed.

As if I were an idiot and had never had any relationships before. I think that this would be a useful book for people to use as a study guide, as if you are in a book club, rather than just reading straight through.

Jeremy's frustrating pent up sexuality is an instrumental part of the narrative and at times it just was too constrained to be believable. Max the streetwise 14 yo Manhattan boy's vulnerability was excessively cast as every imagineable catastrophe for a young boy to have to endure was incorporated into his character. It seemed like looking at a portrait painted only in primary colours. I have not read the other two reviews on here but I am not totally surprised that one has given 5 stars and the other 2. The storyline held alot of promise but it just was not delivered in a convincing manner yet notwithstanding I enjoyed most of the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Void of Morals","review":"Make no mistake about it: this is a story about child abuse. Physical and mental. However beautifully written (and it is), it is about child abuse. Three major characters engage in it and one even manages to get away with it. (Jeremy has never before acted on his impulses but what about Ruff and Charlie? One has spent decades and the other years in a summer camp for boys. It seems highly unlikely that they only did this once.)Layered over the shenanigans at Camp Ironwood is a second storyline about Jeremy's thesis on the Amish. While I get the author's parallels, I found the whole Amish angle somewhat extraneous. So that leaves Max, the 14-year-old who has led a really hard life, but who becomes the star of this story. He is precocious and adorable. Overall, this is an engrossing read, but it treats adults who diddle with young teens a little too easily."},{"rating":"1","title":"dissapointment","review":"this story is quite disturbing because the protagonist does not really come to understanding of his feelings to the 14 yo.

The whole Amish story was poorly incorporated into main story line. The writing is nothing exceptional.Sadly I spent 2 days reading this story trying to find something more meaningful.

And you might have nothing to wear because you have 50 tops and no bottoms that flatter you.

Definitely an evolution of the Haujobb sound and formula. The programing, sequencing and all the sound enginering is all simply mind blowing. A few of the songs that I really liked had some great uses of samples from movies very smoothly mixed into the sequences. While there is still a chorus here or there that isn't perfect, overall the songs really pound hard with an incredible intensity. You must listen to this album on a great car stereo or insanely loud in a club to fully appreciate the full depth of the compositions.

Now, don't get me wrong, it's still a great album,but now I can recognize its flaws. A good portion of the tracks seem to blend together into a single kind of sound that's not bad, but not exceptional.

If you are not interested in those things then I say to each his own.Tom Brown is a wonderful writer and I am glad I bought this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"This was a very powerful book for me.","review":"A friend loaned me the Tracker and The Search a few months ago and I was impressed with the straight forward truths in the writing and the experiences that the author shared. I next chose Grandfather and was not disappointed. Each chapter struck me deeply and contained powerful \\"connection with earth and all things\\" truths that will be with me for a long time. I highly recommend each of these three books and I look forward to reading more from this author."},{"rating":"2","title":"Should be required reading for every human being","review":"This book should be required reading for every human being on this earth. I could only read one chapter at a time because each chapter is so profound, I needed time to decompress and absorb each one. Amazing. Profound. More than thought provoking. Life changing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lies!!","review":"This book should be listed under fiction along with the rest of Mr. Brown's false accounts. One can only feel sorry for those who have fallen prey to the Tracker Cult that this man has carefully devised over the course of his career. Almost all of his former instructors have renounced their belief in his legitimacy. Don't waste your money on anything he has attached his name to."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Glossy Work","review":"Tom Brown has written some excellent works--most notably \\"The Tracker\\". Unfortunately, this book indulges in sentimental descriptions of a powerful philosophy. He does little in the way of delving into the main character's real personae. We are provided a schemata at best in which \\"Grandfather\\" seems to operate from; the same set of emotions as that of Mythological gods. He is triumphant, angry, elated, and sad and these are the types of general words that Tom Brown uses to portray the experiences of life worthy of better reflection. We never get to really know who the real \\"Grandfather\\" is. This book, somewhat egotistical on Tom Brown's part, seems like a poor attempt at fiction. It is interesting to be sure, but not moving or realisitic."},{"rating":"2","title":"Insightful","review":"Thank you for giving us a deeper understanding of Grandfather. What a privilege to share his life in words."},{"rating":"2","title":"Product just as stated","review":"The book arrived in a timely manner in perfect new condition.

I don't get the appeal of this man. At least with a Gordon Ramsay book you get something interesting."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book","review":"I received this as a gift from my brother. Amazon's editorial review is spot on - there's nothing innovative in this book, but Bourdain's commentary adds a perspective and clarity that's straight out of a working kitchen. I've made several of these dishes already for many impressed guests (including my brother) and look forward to making every recipe in the book. Definitely a great addition to any kitchen library."},{"rating":"2","title":"The \\"Whole Bistro Book\\"","review":"Excellent Foodie book, particularly if you like bistro type of food. Bourdain covers the character and operation of the bistro and the classic menu it generates. He details the restaurant prep of these dishes and provides a parallel procedure for prep in the home. He wraps these around the operation of his own hugely successful bistro and its interesting clientele.Very entertaining food book, with some interesting recipes thrown in. A great read if you like food but aren't interested in cooking it. Even better read if you do like to cook."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fantastic prose, not-so-great recipes.","review":"I was quite pleased to receive this cookbook as a gift, but disappointed once I started cooking the recipes. Mr. Bourdain's talents as a writer are not to be denied, but it must be said that these recipes are a bit anemic and wanting. While I definitely appreciate his passion for good food, that passion doesn't seem to extend into making the actual food himself. Which is totally fine -- Bourdain's advocacy for top-quality cuisine is definitely appreciated -- but it means I'll look elsewhere for the nuts and bolts of good recipes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Recipes..... easy to make....

But given the fact that these are mostly humble and slow-cooked dishes from a French brasserie (equivalent to a moderate restaurant with a large menu), the dishes come out delicious and are just plain honest.I've made the coq au vin, beouf bourgignon, and porc roti au lait with little more than a large pot, a stove top and some time (and some thyme...it's a pun).It's a great book with some great inserts of snarky wit from Tony Bourdain."},{"rating":"2","title":"Anthony Bourdain's Les Halles Cookbook","review":"Great cookbook.

The recipes are clear and precise: fun to read, fun to cook and the results taste superb. Many will recognize Bourdain's style from Kitchen Confidential\\": this is a cookbook with attitude (the introduction to Poulet Roti\\" is itself a miniature sarcastic masterpiece). On top of this, the book itself is beautifully made, with wonderful photographs. An unabashed hedonistic hit!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Meez. 'nuff said","review":"My husband and I went out for dinner with friends and we ended up in a bookstore. Because we were all a little toasted, we wound up with books we already owned. My non-cooking husband went back to exchange them with the instructions \\"just buy a cookbook.\\" He came back with Les Halles, and we spent a great evening cooking together. Bourdain just makes it all make sense. I'm a decent cook, but getting everything together at once is always challenging, and his emphasis on thinking out your recipes and having your \\"meez\\" en place before starting is just what I needed to tackle the dual projects of getting a great meal on the table and introducing the spouse to basic cooking skills."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome","review":"Great recipes and fun and entertaining read? Recommend for any chef pro or beginner. Great yet simple recipes. Trust me you'll love it."},{"rating":"2","title":"hysterical cook book!","review":"I have a decent sized collection of cookbooks, many of which I've read as if they were novels. This cookbook makes me laugh out loud! I have not prepared any recipes yet. I purchased the book to widen my collection (didn't have French - too intimidating and Julia Child's didn't appeal to me as a home cook). Anthony's irreverent sense of humor makes me want to keep turning the pages to see what outrageous comment he'll make next. If you like his show and enjoy cooking - you'll love this book. I plan to purchase more of the writings of this talented bad boy."},{"rating":"2","title":"the glossary is worth the price of the book","review":"... it is absolutely hysterical. I am in awe of this man -- such a breath of fresh air in a smoggy-FoodTV-celebrity-infused industry."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bistro style how-to for pirates","review":"Bourdain has got his particular niche dialed in and locked down. If you like or want to learn to cook some elementary homestyle French dishes, this is a great starter kit, and one that will take you a long long way toward getting the French palate clocked. I'd especially recommend this to culinary school kids and new kitchen recruits, as it is stuffed with very practical, totally demystified procedures. Some absolute classic and fundamental preparations, solid recipes, all well described, and with an emphasis on the home cook - lists of necessary tools, how to set a proper meez for a given dish - the guy is thorough. I loved it - great addition for either the novice or the veteran."},{"rating":"2","title":"Christmas Gift to Keep","review":"I recieved Tony Bourdain's Les Halles Cookbook for Christmas from my husband. We're both fans of his previous books and Food Network Show. I have made Boeuf Bourguignon, Beef Stock(from the Veal Stock recipe, sorry, Tony) and tonight, Onion Soup Les Halles. C'est magnifique! The soup was marvelous, sweet, (credit the onions, of course, and the tomato paste used for the beef stock, and intensely flavorful. The cookbook is a hilarious read even if you don't cook. He writes like I talk, so I've enjoyed reading about recipes I have no intention of trying to make. He's right, though. You CAN make these French culinary treasures. Just follow his advice. I couldn't find the ugly brown crocks, so I got some from Le Gourmet Chef Store. They worked beautifully! Thanks for a great cookbook. Mussels are next!"},{"rating":"2","title":"It'll Make You A Better Cook Even If You Never Make Any Of It","review":"Many of the recipes in here are of the type that one makes not just because one wants to eat, but because one wants to cook. Anthony Bourdain's Les Halles Cookbook is overflowing with the kind of straight talk we've come to expect from the salty-tongued kitchen rogue. It is also chock full of inspiration. If you're looking for another collection of half-hour recipes to cherry pick through for a few new bits to add to your repertoire, keep surfing for something from Jamie or Nigella. But if you want a book that's a fun read, delves a little deeper into what makes truly great food and which will make you want to put more care and passion into elevating the food you do make, this is it. That being said, there are also many practical, delicious classic dishes in here which are also extremely easy."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Direct Marketing Bible","review":"So many marketers today have 'forgotten' the fundamental testing techniques which build the Mail-Order industry.

It is not too thick and not too watery and the product seems odorless.I really love this line of cosmetics and have begun to explore more of their product line.

Even if she was unable to obtain the exact recipes for the peach pie and the white bean pie she describes, I felt that she should have put some effort towards obtaining good ones. Also, at one point, someone mentioned where she could get the \\"best\\" kind of a certain pie, but she refused to go out of her way to drive there (I believe this was an apple pie in Texas)!

I had never owned a scroll saw before, so was unaware of how it should sound, or work. Noisy, vibration, and plain end blades are impossible to keep tight. Will not cut square, despite squaring the table and blade. Warranty is expired, so I will replace it, hopefully, soon.My next saw will definitely not be a Dremel, and from what I read, the DeWalt may not be such a good deal either, being built in the Orient.Word to the wise.

Lowes was great - they replaced it right away. However, about a year and a half after that, the saw simply quit working. Everything looked ok - nothing jammed, bearings ok, power ok, it didn't overheat and reset, etc. It looked like, in a bone dry Arizona shop, that static was the culprit the second time as well. I concluded that Dremel didn't add adequate protection against electrostatic discharge (ESD), and that ESD fried the electronic motor control. This makes Dremel far too high a risk for me to ever buy another one - even if I lived elsewhere, as winters can still be very dry. Too bad, because the tool is otherwise great."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Average","review":"For the hobbiest who has a lot of time on his/her hands,this machine is probably ok. As a professional woodworker, I found the blade changing to be excessively difficult, hit and miss with the top rear tensioner. Also, it's foot doesn't fit right to the wood surface; causing strain when moving the piece around for precise cuts. Mine developed a loud clanking sound after only a few hours of use, and eventually blew fuses, and finally shut down completely. It has some nice features, like the controls up front, large base, and variable speed control; but, unfortunately, not very reliable for the serious scroll saw enthusiast."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good Saw - Bad Motor","review":"Bought this tool over a year ago but only used it for a total of about 30 hours before the motor \\"burned out\\". The tool is solidly built, blade changes are easy, and overall I was quite happy with all aspects of the tool until, of course the motor went. Called the Dremel people, it's out of warranty and to get it fixed is cost prohibitive so I'll have to buy a new saw. If I had confidence that this event was a fluke I would buy another Dremel 1680, but another reviewer had a burned out motor with very little time on the saw. It's a shame because other than the motor this 4 star tool, alas a great saw with no motor is a $149.00 paper weight.

Then a section with the sequences listed out. As the book is presently presented, if you are following a sequence for a stress release class and the pose was presented earlier in the book, it refers you back for each of the details on setting up, in the pose, and releasing.

The battery pack is designed such that it pops out of the tool with the least bit of pressure. The battery pack is actually part of the handle, so you can't avoid touching it when working w/ the tool. I found it very difficult to work with the tool for more than a few seconds before it shut down because the battery popped loose. I resorted to duct taping the battery in place. Eventually I got tired of this & I heated up the case with a butane lighter and bent the sidewalls inward to more firmly grip the battery. With this modification, (or with duct tape) the tool works fine. But you shouldn't have to resort to this sort of jury rigging.

Are people not aware of it? Whatever, maybe the fact that it is a \\"Montgomery Brothers\\" session and not a \\"Wes\\" session has thrown it off the radar. For me, this is a topshelf \\"Wes\\" album. There always seemed to be something special about the albums he did with his brothers. It's said that Wes never felt comfortable in the studio, and perhaps having his brothers on the session loosened him up a bit. I like all the cuts, but standouts, for me, are \\"Doujie\\", which may have the greatest Wes octave solo, ever, \\"Delirium\\", \\"Bock To Bock\\" and \\"Grooveyard\\".

I found it difficult to deal with how spineless Rachel is throughout the entire book. She doesn't evolve at all as a character and puts up with just about anything from her cheating spouse, Daniel.Frankly, I wanted to see her have the guts to take her children and leave her husband. What kind of hubby doesn't tell others he's married and keeps his wife and family secret? A bad one.Sure, the book has a sweet ending when a huge revelation is bestowed on the reader, but after 95% of the book having me hate Daniel, it just left me wondering why I wasted time with the entire story. He could've told her the truth about the other woman a whole lot sooner.Sorry, but I hate really weak female characters. I can't believe she continued to sleep with her hubby after he admitted to cheating.

Rachel wanted so much to save her marriage - but was it too late? Could she ever forgive Daniel, if he had committed the ultimate betrayal?This was definitely a great, heart-wrenching work by Michelle Reid. I gave it only 4 stars, though, because it really was a bit too sad a look at marriage for me. In other Reid novels, there is a big passionate separation, followed by a big passionate reunion. In this novel, there is a slow, depressing separation followed by a slow, painful reunion.

After about 5 minutes of use, the set screw that holds the carbide tip in the unit came out. I went to replace the screw and found that what threads were available to grab and hold the screw in place had stripped. It appears that there are not enough threads to hold the tip in place and/or the metal the base is composed of is just not hard enough to hold the screw. It doesn't make sense that a device designed to vibrate at 7,200 strokes per minute (120 per second) would have a hardened carbide tip but the base that holds it wouldn't be designed to withstand the force (the base looks like to be POT metal)"},{"rating":"1","title":"How the heck are you supposed to tighten the screw?!","review":"My girlfriend purchased this engraver for me right before we moved 2 months ago.

One of my opponents was the football coach that the author talks about in his book.This book covers the passing, power running game, and the misdirection of the Double Wing Offense.This book is easy to read and full of information that can be used from youth to high school level. It is a five star book.However, I can not recommend this book until the price comes down under $20.00. Until then it gets one star."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"The Toss\\" is a winner!","review":"I recently finished reading Coach Vallotton's book, \\"The Toss\\". I have been researching the Double Wing offense for some time now and this is truly one of the best sources of this offense on the market! Coach V's writing style is clear, concise and easy for even the novice coach to understand. However, the experienced coach will probably benefit the most. Coach V explains the basic concepts behind the Double Wing strategy that starts with \\"The Toss\\" play. He refines the offense with his sweeps, counters and traps. Then he provides the detailed information to implement a passing attack. The section that I felt was one of the most useful was the \\"drills\\" section where he provides guidance on running unique drills in your practice that compliment \\"The Toss\\". Overall a great book that is a must for all coaches who are running the Double Wing or are thinking of changing their offense. This book will sell you on its effectiveness!"},{"rating":"2","title":"THE BOOK HELPED CHANGE OUR COMPLETE FOOTBALL PROGRAM AROUND","review":"this book is very easy to understand and to follow. with this book we were able to be up a running the offense in about 2 weeks.

The one fault I see with the design is with regard to the stability of the tool mounting method. It could use lateral rigidity improvement to keep the tool perpendicular to the router table. If material is fed into the cutting/sanding tool too aggressively the axis of the tool shifts and can cause a bind or extra load on the tool. This will cause a router bit to bind on the material being fed and could ruin a smooth finish. My fix was to attach a small angel bracket to the right side of the tool mount and fix it to the underside of the table with counter-sunk screws and nuts. I use a bolt, washers and a wing nut at the tool adjustment point so the hight of the tool can still be adjusted. Now the tool is much more rigid and positive and has less tendency to bind or shift axis."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dangerous and inefficient","review":"becareful when using unstable and needs to make a jig for. dremel may fallout of holder and at high speeds it wobbles and make cut incorrectly.

The results of too much flex are uneven cuts when trying to use the fence.I think the flex would be less of an issue when doing work without the fence."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as Shown on the Box","review":"I got this and am really not too thrilled. Let's look at my list of gripes:1. What you actually GET is NOT what is shown in this illustration or even on the box. This tool does NOT come with the pictured tool holder that provides additional stabilization and support. Even though the holder is CLEARLY shown and there is an insert about it in the box, it ain't there.Without the holder, your Dremel is ponly attached to the \\"table\\" with a a collar at the top of the tool that is secured with e hex nut. This leaves the body of the tool unsupported and that much linear mass makes for easy deflection when working harder woods.2. Once you have mounted the \\"table\\" to a support surface correctly mounting the tool into the holder is a real challenge (I guess I have big fingers)3. The precision of the fence and depth adjustments is really hit or miss as most of the assenbly is plastic.Overall I give it a 2 -- mostly for false inducement."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy this. It is not up to the usual Dremel tool quality","review":"It's good for edging and such. But it is no good for cutting groves or if you want to square up a piece to trim an edge.

I've seen better tools from Playschool."},{"rating":"2","title":"good for small tasks (obviously)","review":"product is a good addition to my dremel collection.

I have been making a lot of grooves and notches in wood, and the table keeps the cuts consistent. There is an adjustable fence for precise wood placement as it passes through the bit, as well as an up-and-down adjuster for cut depth in the wood. I have a very specific application for this table, and I've been able to get my grooves and edgings precise every time, which is essential for my project. This router table is a must-have for anyone who uses their MultiPro for routing applications."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poorly-made Chinese plastic garbage.","review":"I wish I didn't have to make such a vicious statement, but this thing really is poorly-constructed junk. The tool mount flexes too much to guarantee any accuracy in your work. What's worse, on the one I had the tool didn't even mount centered in the hole - preventing me from ever using any wide router or sanding bits without damaging the plastic of the table itself.If there were an adjustment - a pair of slots of some sort - to which I could center the tool properly, I would have kept the table and given two or three stars. At least it would have been somewhat useful to me. I just don't see how a plastic molded part can get this wrong, and for that I returned it.I don't expect too much from a rotary tool system like this, the quality is cheap and you get what you pay for - but this is ridiculous."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent product.","review":"I love this product, It is wonderful. This product has met all my expectations, I recommend it those who want to buy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for miniatures","review":"I have a full size router table, but it is too large for the miniature work that I do in making doll house furniture. The Dremel router table is just the answer to a point. It is compact, the Dremel motor mounts securely and adjustments are relatively easy. Mounted on a 2 x 4 that clamps to my work bench makes it easy to work with and then put away. The only problem that I have and it is not with the router table, rather the limited number of bits that are available for the motor. A ten bit set contains all that are available, at least that I have found. Do not buy this as a \\"do all\\" router. Know its limitations and get a full size router table for anything other than very small work."},{"rating":"2","title":"Too good to be true","review":"Like many of the other reviews to this book, I believe this book was amusing! It was very provocative to get me to think about changing from my Beloved English to the Queen's Pawn Opening. However, like many other people, I cringe when he claims to have worked out a forced win for White. Yes, his little records are exciting, and perhaps he is on to something, but I doubt that chess will be solved to a level where humans can know how to do it, ever.Still, there is much to be said for his interesting first two chapters, where he lets you in on some good information, much of which was review (in the first chapter), but still informative. I did enjoy this book, but for someone really looking to improve their chess, I can not recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"An Absurd Book","review":"For those of you tempted to buy a book whose author claims to have worked out a forced win for White against the Grunfeld and several other defenses, I strongly recommend that you read the independent reviews by John Watson and Jeremy Silman at chesscafe.com, where the specifics of much of Berliner's bad analysis and megalomaniacal pontificating are spelled out in detail. In my case, I found the book to be a slightly amusing exercise in debunking crackpot science (which is why I gave it two stars). I'm sure that there will be several others who will agree with me that this may just be the most preposterous chess book ever written. If, however, you're the sort of person who watches PLAN 9 FROM OUTER SPACE every time it's on TV, calls the Psychic Friends Network regularly and thinks professional wrestling is for real, this book is right up your alley."},{"rating":"1","title":"Some good opening tips buried in dogmatic, pointless theory","review":"Some very good ideas and tips on openings can be found in an otherwise dogmatic and desperate attempt to turn the rich and dynamic game of chess into an equation.

Too much talk of powerful lobbies and mass cover-ups.The author seems to combine many smaller, poorly verified pieces of evidence to combat larger, well accepted blocks of evidence found in western archives. Also, he seems to skip a few of the more prominent pieces of evidence used by historians when defining the event as genocide.Ultimately, the book closely paralleled an article I once read written by a Palestinian man claiming less than 2 million Jews died in the Holocaust and that Zyklon B was never used to kill them.While it was written intelligently, it hardly seemed unbiased."},{"rating":"1","title":"DEFINITION OF GENOCIDE","review":"In 1943 and at the UN, Raphael Lempkin, a holocaust survivor who lost 48 family members, coined the term genocide.

A must read!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Gritty language does not equal gritty reporting.","review":"Mr. Dicker seems to believe that peppering his text with foul language gives his work an edge. I can't decide if he is just trying to be hip, urbane or if his vocabulary is so limited he has no other option.If Mr. Dicker considers himself a serious writer, and apparently he does, he should concentrate on holding the readers' attention through solid writing and give up the crass language.I would not recommend this book for anyone expecting a thoughtful, carefully crafted critique of Wal-mart."},{"rating":"1","title":"Activists Stay Away","review":"John Dicker's book is largely a rehash of materials patched together elsewhere, and even the title is taken from a far more compelling book, Al Norman's \\"The Case Against Wal-Mart.\\" This book will disappoint activists who want information about how to deal with the social and cultural destruction created by big box retailers. Dicker seems to be disengaged behind his computer, unruffled by the turmoil going on in small town America, and clueless about what to do about it. For a better read on what Wal-Mart means, and how citizens can confront them at the local level, get a copy of \\"Slam Dunking Wal-Mart\\" or \\"The Case Against Wal-Mart.\\" If you just want some history about the giant retailer, get Bob Ortega's book about Wal-Mart. It seems to be getting trendy to write armchair critiques about Wal-Mart, with several academics holding forth on the wrack and ruin of Wal-Mart. But this book seems to be an idle romp by an author who brings no real political vision to what he is writing."},{"rating":"2","title":"refreshing and challenging","review":"Dicker brings something that is too often lacking to discussions of Wal-Mart and its effect on American labor and American communities: nuance. Don't be fooled by his occasionally too-jokey tone; he knows his material and recognizes that there are no easy solutions in a country that puts a bargain ahead of all other social goods. A thoughtful and intriguing short read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ugh...you get what you pay for.","review":"These pads do not stay in place and can only be positioned in one place because of the short length of the velcro strips.

The platform is just about the right size, and I added a couple of velcro strips to keep the AD-5 in place. The AD-5 doesn't weigh a whole lot, but the tilting mechanism is really flimsey and doesn't lock in place very well. The clamp that holds the device to the microphone stand is a terrible design as it is a \\"V\\" shape and the set screw doesn't meet the tube at the proper angle to keep it from falling off. That being said, it would be ok for some sheet music, but the platform is way too small for anything except maybe a couple \\"post it notes\\". Way over priced and not even good for scrap metal.

I highly recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"I Wish Every Teacher Would Read This Book!","review":"Barry Lane has written such an incredible book that I can't praise it highly enough.

This is what writing instruction is all about!"},{"rating":"2","title":"ESSENTIAL READING FOR ALL TEACHERS OF WRIITNG","review":"Mr. Lane's book should be required reading for anyone who teaches writing. Before I read this book, I found teaching students to revise their work an insurmountable challenge. I found that using the ideas in the book empowered the students, and they began taking charge with their writing. Mr. Lane shares his ideas with an infectious and enthusaistic vigor that motivated me to take more chances in my classroom. This resulted in students taking more creative chances in their writing.Thank you, Mr. Lane. I'm glad you wrote this fantabulous book."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Excellent Resource","review":"I have found it difficult to find resources about Welsh, let alone resources that are decent. Most books about the Welsh language are disorganised. Welsh is a complex language that has an extensive use of auxiliary verbs, a complex system for the verb 'to be', a well-developed system of mutations, etc. Most books handle all this poorly. This book is focused more on conversational Welsh than literary Welsh (which is much more complicated). This book, however, does deal with aspects of the language that are not in the realm of conversation. It offers many examples and much practise on the CDs. It also has a good dictionary in the back, as well as citing other resources for further study. This is one of the best books I have seen for learning Welsh."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent, not perfect","review":"Simple to use, audio quality is excellent. It is not easy, but then Welsh is not easy to learn. Could use a more extensive Welsh to English dictionary."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great tool","review":"Welsh is not the easiest language to learn, but it is hepful to be able to sound out place names and converse with people in their own language while on holiday. Within a few days of working with the CDs, I was able to read a little Welsh, and then actually carry on a few simple conversations. The book and the CDs work very well together. I highly recommend them!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect for Independent Studying","review":"The Teach Yourself Welsh course is fantastic! I was in doubt a while back when I tried to find a good Welsh program (that wasn't as expensive as Rosetta Stone) and Teach Yourself stands out!

I would highly recommend this to any aspiring Welsh student!Cymru am Byth!"},{"rating":"1","title":"How not to teach a Language","review":"This book is an example of how NOT to teach language. It purports to have small snippets of conversation but they are contrived events with sound effects that annoy rather than enhance. Concepts are not very clearly presented and you will spend more time figuring out what they are trying to tell you than learning anything.You are far better off going to one of several UK sites (like BBC) where they appear to know how to teach languages."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cardboard feel","review":"This supposed luxury leather case feels more like cardboard.

They love the wiggles, they do point to the characters and say their names - but to PLAY on it. Not possible. The songs mumble jumble all over each other as the kids move on the matt. Its a very loud speaker and even I cannot take it (Im very liberal w/ loud toys and banging, etc) There is not an ounce of fun in this toy, im very disappointed as most of the other wiggles toys have been great.Dont spend your money on this one. OR keep your receipt handy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Frustrating For A Little One","review":"My 16 month old daughter received this mat as a gift. I have to agree with several of the previous reviewers about this toy. She can't dance ON the mat, she has to be taken OFF of the mat because as she moves about, a new song starts. It is very frustrating for her, and for us to watch her trying so hard to play with the mat. It should have been made differently. I too had to put clear tape over the speaker....MUCH too loud for a little ones ears. Not to mention annoying for parents as the same song starts over, and over, and over.....My advice is buy another Wiggles themed toy for your Wiggles fan!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Wiggles Dance Mat","review":"I bought this for my 2-1/2-year-old daughter and she likes it, but I wasn't impressed at all. I thought that when you stepped on the mat it played music for you to follow along with kind of like you see in the arcades, or like what Ronald McDonald is doing on his commercial. Well, I was wrong; the mat has 4 circles that play 4 songs each and that's it. You don't actually dance on the mat because if you do, the songs keep starting over. I was very dissapointed; however, the kids liked the idea of dancing. I could have saved my money and just turned on the radio."},{"rating":"1","title":"Think before you buy this toy","review":"We got this toy as a gift for my son and daughter for Christmas. We were so excited because they LOVE the Wiggles. The truth of it is that the toy is boring and you can't dance on the mat because everytime a child steps on a character's picture on the mat, a new song will begin before the previous one is finished. This can become very annoying, very fast for both parent and child. Overall, my son and daughter played with this for about 5 mins. Then decided to move on. It really didn't keep their interest at all. Two thumbs down! You are much better off buying a Wiggles video and having the kids dance to the video....you'll at least get your money's worth that way!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Just because it has the Wiggles name...","review":"...doesn't make it a great toy. A lesson learned the hard way. This toy is unbelievably loud. So loud, my husband and I can't stand to be in the same room with our son when he's dancing (stomping) on it. So ridiculously loud, my son can't play with this toy inside at all anymore. Every time he moves, the songs start over. Grates on your nerves after the 5th or 6th stomp. What a disappointing toy. We've had it out of the box three or four times to play with. It is now hidden in the deepest darkest part of the hall closet until we make our next round of donations to Good Will. Save your money for one of the other good dance mat toys on the market. This one's a stinker."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lots of basics, plenty of extras","review":"I had been looking for a good savate book or video for ages and this is good. It shows the basic strikes (and by basics I mean the accepted sport techniques as well as old fashion street methods). It also shows blocks, parries, some takedowns, sparring types, etc... The moves are shown fairly briefly- which means they can fit more on the dvd. The extra bonus is the clips from other savate dvds which you may never find but are pretty cool to see (one of an older guy who moves very well, another has a teacher who moves very fast and with precision, both in the street- no padded gyms and special uniforms for these guys)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great lens protection","review":"I've used OpTech Hood Hats for several years now and consider them a required part of my equipment.

Eager to retrieve his son, Heddon tries every diplomatic way possible to get his son back, but this is 1970s China and the Communists aren't interested in the yack of imperialist dogs.

I have cut up over 50 chordsWith the chain and it is still like new. I take this sharpener and mycordless Dermal with me and when needed would take 5 minutes to sharpen my chainsaws.If you have ever cut wood with a dull chain you know how slow and difficult the job is.I am by no means a professional but this little tool is a must have if you want the choreOf cutting wood to be a breeze.I followed the instructions and it only took me 5 minutes to set it up on my Dermal.

Back to the old hand files for me!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Much easier than a file","review":"This works much better than I thought it would. Accuracy is equivalent to a handheld file but it's a lot quicker and easier. I don't believe this fits the battery operated Dremel so you have to use it near a power source. Installation on the Dremel tool is vary easy. It takes maybe 15 seconds longer than changing a regular bit. If you have more than one size chainsaw, consider getting two.

I kept thinking that I was not getting the edge sharp enough, when in fact I was going way too far and needless shortened the life of my chain. Feeling the edge with my finger was not effective. Looking at the edge with a jeweler's lupe was the best determiner for me to decide that I had it in the right position and that it only needed a couple of passes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dodgy Directions, Read How to Sharpen with this tool elsewhere!!","review":"I should have read Peters review. He is completely right. Using this tool as described in the instructions gives you a chain sharpened well only in one direction.

Fortunately my father, who has far better mechanical reasoning than I, re-discovered \\"the fix\\" Peter describes in his review and it works fine now.Very surprised at Dremel for not catching the huge error on this one.

My faves are \\"No More\\", \\"Not this Time\\", and \\"More Than Friends\\" (which was produced by FULL FORCE, producers of Samantha Fox & Lisa Lisa). Most of the songs are like a musical slap on the face to their boyfriends, but some are ballads, and they are wonderful.

Adrienne plays the role of Chilli, with the more elegant look and best voice, while Naturi, of course, is to Left Eye, the less-noticeable rapper of the group, whose sections are edited out on radio. A witty attempt at duplicating TLC's success. Though they fail miserably in accomplishing that, \\"No More\\" is a very hooky, well-produced song. To this day, the best track this group has ever done. But they're one-hit wonders-in harsher words, don't expect anything better than \\"No More (Baby I'ma Do Right)\\" from these girls."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great debut Cd","review":"This is a great cd.

Why this single didn't go farther is beyond my comprehension.The vocals are fantastic, the harmony first rate, production top notch, etc.This album is thorough through & through. With \\"No More\\", their next single \\"Playas Gon' Play\\" which is now struggling up the Billboard Hot 100, \\"Curious\\" and the list of songs go on.This album is consistently selling from week to week, though not a smash among the young crowd, it finally went platinum a few weeks ago selling a million copies.I hope these ladies have a future in the new millenium.

The debut single No more (baby I'm a do right) peaked at #23 on the billboard Hot 100 and got plenty of radio play the next single Plays gonna play did not do as well. While Destiny's Child and TLC sold millions of records around the world and charted many #1 singles, the girls of 3LW were unable duplicate the success of their debut Album and finally split in 2007. Bailon and Kiely Williams moved on to other projects including starring in Disney's The Cheetah Girls and later forming the all girl quartet of the same with Sabrina Bryan. Today 3LW is no more and Bailon's solo debut album has been in making for several years. Nobody knows when it will finally be ready. Anyway the 3LW debut album is a good pop album with fun songs for young girls but the older guy's might take a pass on this."},{"rating":"2","title":"3LW step into the spotlight then step out","review":"They did an awesome job on this Cd and many others but now that Kiely and Adrienne have gone with The Cheetah Girls (which are good two) they have sort of ditched 3LW.

I did my research and discovered that this Flex Shaft was a critical part of the equation because it allows for easier handling of the bit while doing detailed work.Since this was our first Dremel, reading the instructions and knowing what some of the terminology meant was difficult, but with the aid of some pictures in the instruction manual and a bit of trial and error, we were able to put it together and get it working.So far, my wife is really happy with the way that it allows her to move around more freely while doing her work. It also gives her a little extra length to her advantage since we are hanging the Dremel from a vertical surface. A great purchase for a great price when doing this kind of engraving."},{"rating":"2","title":"Happier Husband","review":"My husband had a Dremel years ago but never this specific tool.

Excellent tool for detail work with the Dremel. Be advised that the Dremel should be hung above where you are working and not just sat on its side next to you. It will perform much better this way.Oh and don't lose the driver bit (little screw in bit) or the tool is useless.

With a smaller object to grip, I have more ways to hold it, and get better leverage by having my fingers closer to the tip so my wrist doesn't have to work as hard. The cable can get hot if run at high speed at too high of an angle, but so far no problems have arisen from the friction. Great tool for detailed work.EDIT: 5 months later, the whole thing came apart in my hands. I picked it up to try to find out what went wrong and how to fix it, and it burned my fingers badly. Turns out high speed will cause it to overheat and destroy itself. I'm pretty ticked, but maybe that's just the way these things work.

It's great for those remote, hard-to-reach areas of my work pieces where the width of the tool itself would hinder my efforts, ot it just can't reach. It took a while for me to get the hang of using it, since it required a bit more hand control than I originally anticipated. Just make sure to keep it as straight as possible, and don't bend it too much- it heats up pretty quickly, especially at the bends. And heat's the big killer of this accessory. Also, be sure to have a bit of the flex-shaft grease handy for occasional lubrication.The only thing that annoys me about the flex-shaft is that it won't accept a chuck to secure the bits, just collets. This can be a major frustration when I'm doing work that requires constant bit changes, with different bit diameters. Just when I thought I was rid of those pesky collets forever...\`Late"},{"rating":"2","title":"A must have accessory.","review":"This flex shaft speaks for itself once you have used it.

I also wish the end of the tool were flexible allowing adjustment to 90 degrees. Seems like Dremel has the market cornered for having to buy special attachments when they could design one that would do the majority without having to constantly change pieces. I'm sure in their mind it's a good thing because we keep buying attachments to do the projects we need to do and it means big $$$$'s for them.

So you had to be smart with your money or else you'd end up with a lot of wasted dough.

(I devoted my whole day to it, I watched my Fellowship and Two Towers DVDs before seeing it.) I loved it like I wouldnt have thought. When I got home, I was shaking. It is so amazing. Hands down, best movie of 2003. And in my oppinion, Lord of the Rings was the best movie I have ever seen. Even if you did not like the first two, go. It will get you loving the other two, and if you already did(like me) you will love them all even more. There is no way to describe how great it was. (I cant wait to see it again tomorrow) I won't reveal anything, but, I'l just say that the battles were breathtaking, and I loved how the relationships evolved.(Eowyn and Merry)Of course, if you plan to go to any other movies, and want to enjoy them, they will seem like nothing compared to Return of the King."},{"rating":"2","title":"Return of the King-the best movie","review":"Return of the King is so thrilling. It is the perfect present for anyone and I think everyone should own it. It is the best movie ever, and I would know because I have read the Lord of the Rings books over and over again! I have also seen the movies over and over again! I have seen many movies like Van Helsing, Spiderman, Harry potter, Monty Python, and Star Wars and nothing can beat Return of the King. It keeps you on the edge of your seat and you never get bored while watching it. The Lord of the Rings, the Return of the King is the best movie of the year!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The return of the freaks","review":"It astounds me that there are now all of the these fanatical LOTR fans that know the characters and all the little nuances of the story but have never actually read the books. The third movie was an absolute let down. Why go to the effort of making this amazing book into an amazing movie only to re-write it and edit out parts that are essential to the core chemistry of the books. We live in a world of avant-twits. Peter Jackson should be ashamed to take something this great and re-constitute so he could sell it to all the freaks to lazy to read the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"hard-to-part","review":"As with 1 and 2, the actor commentary is a big plus. Billy and Dom-what a pair! Good for at least a chuckle throughout. Overall, best new/extended scenes are those that add (so much) more to Faramir's character-from \\"flat\\" to \\"round\\". Biggest disappointment--Theoden left on the battle field..The \\"good-bye\\" scenes on the appendices...pretty well mirrored the film's ending (i.e. and then, and then) but they know we wanted more, more, more so there you go."},{"rating":"1","title":"2 stars only for the CG and action sequences....","review":"Peter Jackson should be strung up in everyone's eyes for this. It is absolutely amazing to me that he can completely cut the last 50 pages out of the book for this movie, and put \\"The Lord of the Rings\\" label on it. Don't get me wrong, it is a well-made movie, but all of the cutting out of parts of the book ruined it for me.For example, where did Saruman go? He was in the tower, and then he just disappeared, never to be seen again? The book doesn't tell it that way. If I had never read the books I would probably like this movie, but having read them, I stomped out of the theater in disbelief and anger after it was over. If you are expecting a movie true to the books, and haven't seen the movie, save yourself the time and frustration."},{"rating":"2","title":"excellent","review":"majestic, awe-inspiring cinema of the highest caliber, making those of us who used to make fun of D & D fanatics cringe with envy.This film captures the human imagination at its best, inviting us to gently escape from so-called \\"normal\\" reality and indulge for a few hours in the power of amazing visions, ideas and possibilities.Bravo."},{"rating":"1","title":"lord of Booooaring!","review":"I smuggled a bottle of champagne into the cinema when I went to see this...even that couldn't liven it up...I fell asleep for 1/2 an hour...asked what happened; \\"the orcs blah dwarfs blaah gandol\\" zzzz I was asleep again.Tedious.

She didn't say much.However, there was more good than bad.- Skydiving in fire was cool- balls of fire - very original- eye of sauron spotlight - cool stuff.- wringwraiths were really good this time.Not bad , not bad stuff.."},{"rating":"2","title":"Too Long - But Well Done","review":"The third installment is about 3 hours and 20 minutes. That is about an hour longer than it needs to be. The action parts are amazing, yet you know most of it is digitalized, the non-action parts are too drawn out and the ending is a guaranteed tear jerker. As my wife said while watching it - \\"not a dry eye in the house.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"The worst of the series","review":"This movie was badly paced, poorly directed, overlong and had at least three schmaltzy endings one after the other. (Being true to the book's numerous endings does not give one leave to be cloying and saccharine in their execution.) Now you want to sell a version of this bloated whale of a film with an additional 50 minutes? No way. The first two installments of this series were great. By all means watch them, buy the extended versions (I did) and enjoy them over and over. But read Tolkien's Return of the King. The book is far superior to anything Peter Jackson's virtually unwatchable finale has to offer."},{"rating":"1","title":"NO hope","review":"They cant revive it there is no hope. They strayed so far from the path that Tolkien intended that they would need at least 2 hours with a lot of cuts and adds so I don't look forward to this at all. I love the Lord Of The Rings and bought the books on CD and listen to the trilogy probably once a month for the pass 2 years. So it is evident to me that Mr. Jackson or \\"The Book Butcher\\" could not understand that evil, money, lust, and other desires of the flesh did not drive Tolkien's creations. But if you don't care about the books then the movie will be great.A 13-year-old purist (who cant spell)Oh yeah, Elijah Wood could not portray a character with depth if his life depended on it"},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible, absolutely horrible.","review":"Would one care to explain to me the exact purpose of this terrible film? I found myself overcome with nausea upon viewing this film. I must say, the performances of each and every one of the actors and actresses were woeful, and truly disturbing, in the least. How this truly awful film came to win so many Academy Awards (TM) remains but a cryptic occurence in a world copious with hate. The excessive length induced a severe bowel movement, which eventually forced me to miss the last hour and tweleve minutes in the cinema loo. I must say, though, that I was somewhat glad to have missed so much of this terrible film."},{"rating":"1","title":"ONLY 3 out of 12 disc will play","review":"The Lord of the Rings: The Motion Picture Trilogy (Special Extended Edition) Elijah Wood, et al Sold by: VE N: B000654ZK0,Walls Video 4 Less (seller profile)ONLY 3 out of 12 disc will play!!!.

Boy,did I make a mistake. Clocking in about 3 1/2 hours The Return of the King bored the crap out of me.It's one of those movies that may have been ok if it was about 80 minutes long. The only good part was when Elijah Wood's character gets his finger bitten off by that creature.At the end it looked like some gay love story, when Sean Astin and Elijah Wood got together at the end, it looked like they were gonna kiss each other or something. Come on, why does everybody think this garbage is so good. Overrated!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"OVERHYPED P.O.S.","review":"BORING, all hype, terrible movie that never ends.

I may have liked it better if the movie was 2 to 2 1/2 hours I think I would like it better. But WHO WANTS TO WATCH A 3 AND A HALF HOUR MOVIE!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"It deserves no stars","review":"Tolkien was not keen on seeing his works on film. Indeed most of his friends were vehemently against it, especially C.S. Lewis. Out of respect for the author, any true admirer of Tolkien should not support any movie made from any of his works.Tolkien himself said:\\"In human art Fantasy is a thing best left to words, to true literature...visible presentation...silliness or morbidity are frequent results\\" (\\"Essays\\" 68)In this case silliness is definitely the result. This film has terrible special effects that look as fake as they are, the acting leaves a great deal to be desired and the characters are miscast and cartoonized.In the extended edition many hoped it would be 'fixed' but even duct tape couldn't fix this disaster, if you buy this it would be a better investment to flush your money down the nearest drain. Go buy the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"15 Stars for The Trilogy","review":"In order to give credit to this movie, I honestly believe the trilogy has to be reviewed as a whole. This is not and Indiana Jones type trilogy with three individual stories. Without one, the other two fail. Together, these movies make up the most outstanding, monumental and brilliant bit of moviemaking that we are ever likely to see in our lifetimes. The fact that Tolkien's works are shear genius only makes it more difficult to translate them onto film. And although it would be impossible for anyone to make the \\"perfect movie\\" from these books, Peter Jackson came as close as any human possibly could. I'm definately looking forward to the Extended Edition DVD.p.s. If you haven't done so already, please read the books...including the Simarillion."},{"rating":"2","title":"coleccion completa!","review":"4 estrellas porque es la version extendida que menos le aporta a la historia, LAS DOS TORRES, fue un ejemplo de lo que una version extendida podia aportar a los fans de los libros que quedaron esperando por mas en las versiones cinematograficas, en este capitulo, abundan las escenas cortas que no aportan mas que \\"duracion\\" al filme. Sin embargo... puedo citar que al igual que las anteriores, esta muy bien hecha y posee ciertas reminicencias de la obra de nuestro querido profesor Tolkien."},{"rating":"2","title":"Extras hit and miss this time","review":"The extra scenes this time around do not always add to the movie. While as a LOTR's fan I would still recommend getting this set, just don't count on liking it better. I won't pick out specifics, everyone is going to have their favorite grips and cudos here. I would add that it is amazing what got chopped in terms of special effects.

And the hidden \\"easter eggs\\" (for the adults) on each extended version are extremely funny.Want to find the hidden treat? On each ext. edition, the hidden ring is on disc one. First you click on Select Scene. You want to then get to the very final scenes of the movie. Example: if say scenes 27-30 are the final scenes, click on it.Once on that page, scroll down with your down arrow until the Ring pops up at the bottom. Then just click on that, and laugh away! (if any of that isnt clear, just search on yahoo or google for more info!) Great fun, great movies, from a great director and cast!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Two Words: Overkill & Excessive","review":"First of all, let me just say how impressed I was with the first two movies in this trilogy. They were outstanding films and deserving of all the awards they received. Perhaps that is one reason I was so disappointed in this movie; it wasn't nearly as interesting as the first two. The main reason can be summed up in my headline here.Director Peter Jackson made the same mistake he made in the film he did right after this one: \\"King Kong,\\" where the action was way too much, too the point of ludicrousness and an insult to viewers' intelligence. So was this film, the third in the LOTR series.It was too much action, so much that after halfway through this 3 hour, 20-minute movie I was numb and could care less what happened from that point. I stuck with it, but, overall, it committed the worst sin of them all for fantasy-adventure movie - it got boring. Too much violence translates into \\"boring.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Lord of the Rings - Return of the King -- Terrific","review":"The best way to describe this movie is to say that I went into the theater wondering how I would sit through a 3-1/2 hour movie and before I knew it, it was over. What a wonderful story. I developed a bond with the characters and I had to remind myself that \\"in real life\\" I didn't really know these people. The special effects were just that -- special. So much so, that you couldn't tell they were effects. I have to say I thoroughly enjoyed this movie (as well as the two previous) and as an aside -- I'm over 50 and still loved it."},{"rating":"2","title":"I love it!","review":"Well it's finally happened.You can almost get the whole Lord of the Rings trilogy on DVD!!!!!!

Even though the first two films were amazing, this one is the best. I would rate this higher if I could. This movie has everything: Comedy, action, and romance. The only problem I have with this movie is the drug out ending. The movie could has possibly been 3 hours if they cut some of the hugging and kissing. The battle at Minas Tirith had to be the best battle I have ever seen! Those ghosts looked amazing. This movie is not like the 2nd and 3rd Matrix movies, which only consisted of a lot of special effects. This movie DOES have a lot of special effects, but it has a great story. This is the best movie I've seen for a long time. Go out and watch this movie now, stop reading this review! GO!!! Are you gone? GO!!! You gotta see this movie!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Lord of the Rings: Return of the King","review":"All I can say is that the last part of the triolgy was a major desapointment to me and I would advise others not to waste their time in seeing it and wasting their money on it.

I thought the scene between Arwen and Aragorn slobbering all over each other at his coronation was cringe-worthy (I mean honestly... they did everything but dry hump). the third movie also ignored parts of the book in favor of adding scenes that appeared to be ad hoc with no other purpose than to extend the movie by a good 45 minutes.Now on to the packaging: I've watched the DVD's a few times, and some of the little round tab buttons in the package have snapped off, entombing the DVD in the case. While trying to pry out the DVD for the second half of the movie, it snapped in half!

For example, the scene of the Gondor Regent leaping in flames from the top of Minas Tirith is one I will never forget. The battle scenes are also just as dramatic -- or even more -- than in The Two Towers. There's a tremendous amount to absorb visually -- I do recommend seeing the film at least a second time.This trilogy of movies was a classic for the ages, and I will treasure my collection of the extended versions once this final one comes out on DVD (the 4-CD version) next November. As much as I loved it, though, ROTK is not perfect. The first hour of the movie is very slow moving, and I also thought the early scene where Pippin curiously handles Saruman's dark crystal ball was very clumbsily filmed. Those are minor quibbles, though."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent DVD version with one pain","review":"The only gripe is that the film is on two discs in this extended version.At 4 hours 10 minutes, it works fine as a stamina booster too :-)Anyways, there are restored items that make the movie sense more coherant. The Biggest plus in the restore is the Christopher Lee work that just has tremendous implications for the film story. It is utterly incomprehensible as to why Lee's pivotal performance would be cut, when it is his sequence that provides the drama for next half hour or so.Restoring many lost elements so that the story is coherant is superb.Hopefully the Blue Ray discs will allow the entire film to be put on one DVD.Absolutely love this version."},{"rating":"2","title":"Breathtaking, grand, and imaginative","review":"I must admit I was not a fan of the first installment of \\"The Lord of the Rings\\" trilogy. I thought I was going to lose it if I saw one more orc or any other equally bizarre looking character. However, I was simply bowled over by \\"Lord of the Rings: Return of the King.\\" This film has all the features of an impressive battle-action movie along with all of the heart. It propels right along and has an emotional resonance that I rarely see in so-called \\"action\\" pictures. After following Frodo, Sam, Gandalf, Aragorn, Pippin, and all the others through a three and one fourth hours trek, the ending is at once grand and highly poignant. I admit to tears in my eyes. Highly recommended!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The best Trilogy DVDs","review":"Most DVD extra feature are boring. The LOTR trilogy is a HUGE exception to this. Two entire discs are devoted to special features going into great detail on how the movies were created. Another thing I love about this trilogy that differs from other DVD special features is the fact that the 'deleted scenes' are put into the movie where they should be, not as separate tracks in the special features section. AWESOME!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This movie should have been LONGER!!!","review":"This is for the reviewer that called the movie a \\"smoldering celluloidal wreckage.\\" All I have to say is that if you have never read Professor Tolkien's genius books, which I consider to be the best books EVER because of his flawless writing style, and are complaining about how bad this movie is, you really need to do your homework. First of all, you probably didn't understand many of the names and the whole plot of the movie, which you don't deserve to having never picked up such masterpieces. Read Tolkien's books (which are definitely better than all three movies combined) and you will see why they are so popular."},{"rating":"2","title":"BEST MOVIE EVER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","review":"How could anyone give Return of The King anything other than 5 stars. I can only guess that there is a lot of angry jealous people out there. Peter Jackson is a genius and the cast was outstanding. And obviously the Academy agrees with me, 11 Oscar Wins!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Product misrepresented; not extended version","review":"This is not the extended version as stated in the blurb. It is very disappointing to me, as I have seen the extended version on DVD. Amazon needs to be more careful in matching descriptions to the project. The fact that comments on a product are shared across different version of the same title, makes it very confusing."},{"rating":"1","title":"A travesty which dishonors JRR Tolkien","review":"This movie is a prime example of why not every book should be made into a movie, least of all an amazing classic like The Lord of the Rings. Not only was much of the original material overlooked, but new material was added that did nothing to enhance the story. Did Peter Jackson think that no one would come see the movie if there was no romance? Romance was added and at the most inappropriate moments. Characters died that never did, true heroism was turned into cloying, wistful looks and less than heroic speech. Worst of all was the return of Sam and Frodo to the untouched Shire. Tolkien was making a huge point by having them return to a Shire that was being ravaged and ripped apart. It would seem that no one connected with these movies bothered to read or understand Tolkien's work.Save your money and buy a good copy of these books and read them many times in the years ahead."},{"rating":"2","title":"No Big-Catagory Oscars for LOTR: ROTK... Oh Well!","review":"Didn't you hear? The Academy Awards have just recently cancelled LOTR: ROTK from winning any big-catagory-Oscars. Many fans of LOTR movie-trilogy are probably angered by this act. But I'm not. Who cares about the boring Oscars-ceremony! Its not the Oscars that determine a good movie; its the peoples opinion. LOTR: ROTK is bound to be the best movie is 2003 even if it doesn't win any Oscars. I am waiting to see this epic-fantasy-movie with great anticipation. I can't wait to see how phenomenal ROTK is! Its to prequels, FOTR and TTT, are two brilliant movies to start off the LOTR movie-trilogy. Director Peter Jackson and his great team will have a wonderful surprise for us on December 17!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Big. Very, very big.","review":"You want to read aaaaaaall about the movie and it's long strides and short comings? Read all the other reviews.You want to know if this is a fantastic movie that, regardless of critical comparison to the books, is worth watching? Read below.Yes. Movie good. You watch."},{"rating":"1","title":"Excellent","review":"This DVD must be on every Lord of the Rings' fan collection. The extra features are excellent."},{"rating":"1","title":"hollywoodized","review":"I'm sorry, but all the hype, all the denial won't help in years to come with the third insallment. IT WAS BORING. the EE is better than the theatrical release and that is why I'm giving it two stars. i would like to give it 2 and a half but can't. I LOVE THE FIRST MOVIE. the EE is near flawless film making. So how can you go from that to this silly, overly self-important, deliberately manipulative story telling. WHA' HAPPENED? I'll tell you what. the director got caught up in his own hype. Christopher Lee had every right to be annoyed and at least this version fixes that. the story is more fleshed out, as it is with all three EE's, but it still doesn't fix the fundamental floors of a film with far too many endings, a magic user who does barely anything magical, and characters that have been given the hollywood treatment (the rot started with the 2nd flick). once the new smell wears off this one many will see it for what it really is: overly long and boring."},{"rating":"1","title":"How many of you think that...","review":"Frodo actually is supposed to tackle Gollum into the volcano after his finger's bitten off?I watched the first two films and thought, hmmm, it's not true to the book but it's not TERRIBLE but Peter Jackson completely lost any hope of my being a fan of his work when he butchered the most essential part of the story-line, where the ring itself is destroyed. I'm very afraid of what's gonna happen now that Hollywoods getting their hands on Aslan as well. Yikes!"},{"rating":"1","title":"AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!","review":"This Movie Is horable!!!!!!! The movie itself was OK but when you compare it with the books IT SUCKED!!!!! I hate the movies aparently mr. jakson is as shallow as it gets if he thinks he can re-write tolkien's master peice!a 13 year old veiwer"},{"rating":"1","title":"I WATCH THIS WHEN I CANT FALL ASLEEP","review":"NOPE, I JUST DONT SEE HOW PEOPLE LOVE THIS MOVIE. BUT I TELL YOU THIS THE THE HOLLYWOOD MEDIA FAVORS THIS MOVIE ALOT, AND SO DO THE PEOPLE FOLLOW.WELL PEOPLE ARE DIFFERENT I GUESS.BUT I WALKED OUT OF THE THEATERS ON THIS ONE. WENT TO WATCH A BETTER MOVIE.GOOD SPECIAL EFFECTS THOUGH."},{"rating":"1","title":"One star is too many in my opinion!","review":"A word of advice to those of you who have been waiting for the extended release, hoping it would clear up some of the missing information. Know how sadly dissapointed you may be. I was able to watch a rip of the extended version and I'm glad I did before I ordered it! Unlike the first two where the extended version added some much needed scenes to fill gaps in the story, this version adds things that never even happened. In a degree that was shocking and upsetting to me even thought I would not consider my self a Tolkein Purist. I would have rather not had an extended version and I am sorry but the Scouring of the Shire was a damn important part! I was okay with it not being in there but instead we get some made up crap, that never happened to Sauraman. I will be ordering the theatrical release of this movie, at least it is not as far from the book as this version. If I want the real story I will just pull out my books for a re-read!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best Yet!","review":"This movie is the best movie in the world! It has tons of action and adventure which I love. I cant wait to buy the DVD when it comes out! This is the best movie out yet and is 10 times better than the last two. I rate this movie 5 STARS!!!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"An Epic of Our Time","review":"First off I haven't read the books (besides the Hobbit) so I have no bias in these films. I hear people complaining about how some parts were left out of the book. Well maybe someday somebody will make a 30 hour adaptation of the book and these people will be happy. But if you are anybody else you will be amazed. This trilogy is an epic of our time. This trilogy even surpasses the Star Wars trilogy and the Back to the Future trilogy. Even if you didn't care much for the other two films, Return of the King is solid gold. It has amazing special effects, cinematography, amazing detail, if full of emotion and does a very good job of concluding the trilogy. If J.R.R. Tolkien were here to see the movie, he would crap himself. SEE THIS MOVIE!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"WOW!!","review":"This movie was fantastic. My whole family absolutely loves it, even my mum which is surprising coz she doesn't even like this kind of movie, which really surprised me. Anyway it one of the best movies of the age and really worth getting."},{"rating":"2","title":"AMAZING!","review":"This was a perfect conclusion to the trilogy. Everything from the cinematography to the costumes to the battle sequences are spectacular. The bonfire-signal sequence was beautiful, and one of my favorite movie moments ever."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bueniiisimo..!","review":"Los cd's son buenos y la estatuilla esta increible....!Lo use para regalar y quede de maravilla."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Lord of the Movies","review":"I have to say that \\"The Return of the King\\" is without a doubt the best of the \\"Lord of the Rings\\" trilogy. The visual effects are extraordinary and the direction is flawless. And the drama will keep you on the edge of your seat for the entire 3 hours and 15 minutes of the film. This is cinematic history in the making. An all out roller coaster ride."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beware of the Seller!","review":"I think this edition is a great edition, don't get me wrong. My family has it and I recently moved out and wanted to buy it for myself. The vendor I bought it from had it used and rewrapped with an entire disc missing. Also, the disc that I did receive was a special features disc, not either extended or theatrical editions. I was naive to think that this deal could have been so good! I returned it, of course, and I got my money back, but it's an inconvenience and a waste of time! Beware of ExpressMedia."},{"rating":"1","title":"What's The Big Deal?","review":"I've seen better movies than this. I mean, it's 1) extremely long. I almost fell asleep. 2) Mostly fighting. Come on! It's not all fighting. What a disappointment. It should have won special effects and that's it. This movie sucks. Big time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing if not for the computer generated effects","review":"Today's filmmakers and moviegoers are just phonies, because all they want is tons of computer-generated effects. LOTR has terrible acting and horrible set designs. People just like the eyecandy in terms of CG animation with fake boom-boom sound. This is moviemaking at its worst."},{"rating":"1","title":"You know it's a kids movie when...","review":"You know you're watching a kid's movie when:1) you can get a free doll resembling the characters in a happy meal2) you can walk down the toy aisle of target and buy little figurines and playhouses from the movie3) there is a breakfast cereal made with characters from the movie on the box4) children come to school with folders, pencil boxes, and backpacks with emblems and scenes from the movie5) they sell halloween costumes in children's sizes of characters in the movie.I mean, think about it: ever see a schindler's list happy meal? Is there a cereal called Sophie's Choice Crunchies? Did a trick-or-treater ever come to your door on halloween in a citizen kane costume? Yeah, this is an adult picture, sure. Dealing with adult themes like faries, nyphs, dragons, and pixies. I think I saw tinkerbell and some smurfs in there too."},{"rating":"1","title":"Definitely, one of the WORST films ever!","review":"I sat down in the theater; hopefully awaiting a masterpiece to make up for LOTR 1 and 2. I was wrong, the lord of the rings: return of the king is one of the most boring and dumbest movie i've ever seen. Nearly three hours trying to stay awake in the theater. This is by far one of the biggest dissapointments that have ever come out of hollywood."},{"rating":"1","title":"holy cow... what a dissapointment.","review":"After sitting it out on LOTR 1 & 2, i thought the \\"return of the king\\" was gonna be a notch above. how wrong i was, the lord of the rings: the return of the king is just as boring and dissapointing as it's predecessors. what was going through peter jackson's head while he was filming this i'll never know. i would definitely give this boring piece of film 0 stars if amazon.com would let me. where is hollywood going these days? it's obvious they're running out of good ideas. little statistic here; in 2003 they had come up with 5 remakes, and 14 sequels, embarassing i know. anyhow, i'm gonna give peter jackson one more chance and see his new 'King Kong this year."},{"rating":"2","title":"Way to go Frodo!","review":"This has got to be the most highly anticipated movie of 2003 I saw the trailer on [E] coming attractions and I just have to say,'WOW! I'm looking forward to this film more so then the next Harry Potter movie. Thank you Petter Jackson for your talent and giving the world a chance to see what middle earth might have been, sorry though that it will soon come to an end. This is a must see for Lord of the Rings fans this film does look and probably will be great.My review is what I think by just seeing the coming attraction."},{"rating":"1","title":"Extended please","review":"In short, this should be both extended and theatrical on one blu ray. You have the space, stop milking it."},{"rating":"1","title":"They are really Milking it","review":"They did this with the DVD release with the various versions (theatrical, extended, and the limited edition) now they are starting down the same road with Blu-ray version. This is just not right."},{"rating":"2","title":"Those Problematic Eagles","review":"I haven't read all of the previous reviews, so I don't know if anyone has commented on this. Jackson's error in making it appear as if the eagles could take out the Nazgul raises a critical problem: If I'm not mistaken, in the book's description of the battle before the Black Gates, even though the eagles came to attack the armies of Sauron, they didn't attack the Nazgul's winged \\"steeds.\\" Tolkien was careful to cover all of his bases concerning Sauron's defenses, and with good reason: If it was possible to disable the Nazgul en masse, there would be nothing preventing Frodo from merely riding to Mt. Doom on the back of an eagle, depositing the ring into the Cracks of Doom, and being home by teatime. The whole story would have been over in the space of one chapter, and there'd be nothing particularly dramatic about LOTR."},{"rating":"1","title":"Glad there are only three","review":"First off, to a certain \\"Mr Money-Bags,\\" I hope you were being sarcastic about these stories being a ripoff of Star Wars, because if not...hello? can you say \\"the other way around?\\" Tolkien's books were a major inspiration for Star Wars. Duh.That said, these movies were bad, though skillfully made, I suppose, in their own way, and somehow strangely watchable, for a few minutes a time, at least until the cheesiness factor overwhelms and you're forced to change the channel. Hard to sit down and watch each film in one sitting (especially the super-extended director's editions, which I am proud to say I don't own and will never go out of my way to watch), seeing as how they suck and all."},{"rating":"1","title":"ok, the climax.... more of the same","review":"nothing stood out. whatever.greatest movie of all time it is not."},{"rating":"2","title":"as good as stories get","review":"all i could say upon leaving the theater after seeing this was \\"what a great ending!\\" i thought everything about the movie was perfect! but i'm tired of people saying that it was (...)not exactly like the book. well, if it was exactly like the book, the movie would have been hours longer. i think that everyone who worked on the project, especially the director and cast, captured the spirit of tolkien's books superbly, and i doubt a movie this amazing will ever come out again in my lifetime."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Movie","review":"This is an excellent movie. That is why I bought it. The theatrical version of this movie made you say, \\"Wow, what a great movie.\\" The extended version raised the bar to, \\"Oh WOW!! What a totally awesome, AMAZING movie!\\" That is all."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sweet deal, a true collector's piece","review":"The figure inside the box it's really great, perfectly sculped replica, good detailed and finished. The dvd box container it's a piece of art, looks like and old book to hold your dvds. All perfectly packed. Definitely recomended!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Almost Perfect","review":"The only thing I found especially shortchanged was the House of Healing segment; I was particularly looking forward to the encounter between Aragon and Faramir. There is something biblical about the image of Aragorn the Healer which was not developed in this extended version either. Very much appreciated was the confrontation scene between Faramir and Denethor and the exchange between Pippin and Faramir which established a comradery that better supports the later developments. I noted that the extended edition gave a superficial but poetic gesture towards depicting the relationship between Faramir and Eowyn. I appreciate the challenges of keeping the overall pace of the movie and avoiding losing focus by developing secondary story lines, but fans of Faramir and Eowyn are going to be disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Literary Masterpiece Translates to Screen Well","review":"The Return of the King is the final episode of the trilogy, well done and beautifully filmed. Adventure, loyalty, truth and good vs. evil keep the viewer engaged every minute. Lots of background information included on this extended edition making the story even more engaging. This is a boxed edition, matching the first two boxed editions which came out previously, so it was important to us to find this particular series' product."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Lord of the Rings - The Return of the King (Widescreen E","review":"Cinematography,Acting ,Special effects are why the movie scored over and over in the academy awards. As for the story either you'll love it or hate it haven't met anyone who is in the middle,just like monty python. I'm not a 'collector' of DVD's but this trilogy is unlike other movies in that you really see new things gain a new perspective watching it over and over again.This trilogy will make a great start to a personal DVD collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good, but could have been better","review":"I was disappointed in the final installment of the LOTR trilogy. I guess I expected too much after Fellowship and Two Towers. While the battle scenes were intense, too much was left out in the story and too much was made of the \\"Rocky\\" syndrome. The down and out fighters getting a burst of strength with the last minutes saves by a hero rushing in. Way too campy. Also I disliked the jumping back and forth from scenes just when things start getting interesting. (A good example is when Aragorn faces the ghosts. Things start getting interesting and bang, scene change.) There were parts that kept the movie from getting boring. Gimli and Legolas running counts were humorous and the torches being lit was awesome. Still this movie reminded me why I try not to go to movies with high expectations. Too much disappointments afterwards."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great movie!","review":"We received this order in good time- we love this series and now can enjoy it whenever we want! The movie was in perfect condition!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Beyond Words...","review":"This is truly an epic movie. Beautiful in every aspect of the word. I can't think of enough words to describe it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Return of the King is the finest fantasy film of all time!","review":"Return of the King, where do I begin...there are not enough adjectives to describe what an astounding cinematic achievement this film is. The one-two punch delivered by Return of the King through inspired acting, and the incredible CGI effects, is simply amazing. Tolkien's story and inspiration brought out the best in all the people who contributed to these films, most especially Director Peter Jackson. I don't see how any person who views Return of the King could walk out of the theatre not feeling completely satisfied. Some reviewers, and other viewers of the film have taken issue with the long ending(s), but I believe the manner in which the film comes to it's conclusion is very appropriate and ties up all loose ends. Nothing is left to the imagination for the viewer as to what happens to all the characters. Return of the King, and the entire Lord of the Rings trilogy, are films for the ages."},{"rating":"1","title":"Movie would be great but if it cannot finish playing....","review":"I have this particular movie, yet about midway through, it locks up and will not play the rest of the movie.

The battle scenes are intense and the best I've ever seen in a movie. The Return of the King is packed with sunning special effects along-side great music (score), wonderful acting, and spectacular drama! The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King is the best movie in the trilogy! The ending is quite long, but lives up to the book. See this movie as soon as possible! It is PHENOMENAL!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Latest Blu-ray release is a Theatrical re-release (201 Min) Not Special Extended (Not 250 Min)","review":"The skinny is this should be subtitled as \\"Theatrical Edition\\" (201 Min), but it's not. Since blu-ray tech came well after the release of the DVD special extended edition release (250 Min), one would think Peter Jackson would only re-release the superior special extended version in the stead of the theatrical edition? Bottom line, he didn't. So why would Mr. Jackson make this release of the shorter version instead? Well to fool those consumers who would think that the blu-ray would naturally have the extended version. Thus those foolish costumers (my hand risen, as one of them) will end up buying both versions, Theatrical and the more aparently impending to be later re-released Special Extended, separately on blu-ray... pretty ef'ed up, but true. LOTR Fan consumers beware!"},{"rating":"2","title":"There are no words...","review":"I waited SIX years to get this DVD. Every year for Christmas, starting in 2004, I asked for it.

Love the Hobbit series, in books and film."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best of the trilogy","review":"I finally saw The Return Of The King on the big screen and was quite pleased. I thought it was the best of the trilogy. I was confused at the beginning for a minute when the men in the boat find the ring underwater, because Mister Frodo didn't lose the ring at the end of the Two Towers, but as soon as Schmeegal (if I spelled it right) said \\"Precious\\", I knew what was going on. I usually don't use lots of words, so let me just say that I thought this was a great movie, if you like fantasies. My only dissapointment was that they never showed the evil wizard, Soloman? (I don't remember all the characters' names). What the heck happened to him? One word of advice: don't buy this DVD; wait for the extended edition to come out!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Gone with the Wind of Our Century","review":"I read the Lord of the Ring Trilogy back in high school. It was one of the longest books around. I could not imagine how the books would be like as a film series. This LOTR is beyond imagination. The sets are majestic, and the storytelling is not disappointing at all. While it is difficult to adapt an epic book series into a film, this version is an engrossing eye candy, made by a master filmmaker."},{"rating":"2","title":"Watching the wrong movie.....","review":"I hate to say that, but if you ever watched the original theatrical release a lot of times (like I did), you watched the wrong movie. Pay attention: The Lord of The Rings extended editions ARE THE REAL DEAL. They are simply much better than the \\"normal\\" features. Once you watch the extended editions, you will never want the normal edition again, never. It'simple as that. The RETUNR OF THE KING sustain that tradition."},{"rating":"2","title":"Near great","review":"Pros-Saruman and Gandalf scene at beginning was excellent and worth the price alone.The Mouth of Sauron was interesting and I highly anticipated this scene, but, as said in the extras, it is impossible to duplicate the tension of the book in this scene because in the book you don't know what has happened to Frodo yet.The earthquake of skulls in the Paths of the Dead was stunning (but possibly slightly over the top when they envelope the trio).Surprisingly, no extra endings.Cons -It seems to me that some of the sequences of battle scenes were changed. The battle doesn't flow as well, especially at the end when it is drawn out so that Gothmog is fighting Eowyn and then Aragorn walks by and kills him. Somewhat anticlimactic for Eowyn to fight Gothmog after she killed the Witch King, but I am nitpicking."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Movie in my Lifetime!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","review":"Hello I grew up during the Star Wars generation. For years, the Star Wars trilogy were my favorite movies. I thought nothing could surpass those movies. But, after watching the LOTR trilogy it was awesome. They did it, I dont know how but they did it. They beat the Star Wars trilogy.I enjoyed looking at the awesome scenery as much as the movie.I want to go to New zealand so bad!! The only problem is plane tickets are expensive, around 2000.00 dollars where i live.I am looking forward to the extended edition, especially for the scene when the \\"mouth of Sauron\\" Saurons lieutenant comes out to meet them and throws down frodo's mithrel vest, making the heros think that frodo failed. Can't Wait until December 14, 2004 at appoximately 12 A.M. . I will be standing in line at Wal-mart for my copy."},{"rating":"1","title":"in Wyoming","review":"I got tired of all the battle scenes.

But I've read the books, and it was sweeeet!!!!! They might change it, but who cares?!? It still is about Frodo going to Mt. Doom. And By the looks of the trailer, the graphics are good, and, well, there is no way to express that movie. I wish I could give this movie more than 5 stars, butI can't. You'll be seeing my full review in 32 days! (1 day after Rotk!)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy this for the Minas Tirith sculpture","review":"Go buy the regular extended edition right now. The scultpture of Minas Tirith has two parts, with the top part being a cover for a velvet lined storage compartment in the lower part. Sounds nice? Think again. The base is too big, extending beyond the 'lid' and exposing an unnaturally flat crescent area that can not be overlooked.

( by the way lotr freaks there is no middle earth ) we find frodo the wimp on the way to the volcano with his wimpy friend sam and their psycopathic sidekick gollum. we also find aragorn ( HATE HIM ) and the only ok characters legolas and gimly. we then go into the stupid never ending battles where legolas jumps on a elephant and kills it. these battles seemed all the same: chaos, untrained or prepared soldiers, the fact that the fab three cant be killed after 10 battles where they are outnumbered 1000-1. im running out of time so let me say this: how the hell does a 4 hour movie win best editing?"},{"rating":"2","title":"THE BEST!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","review":"this movie is the best! i highly recommend it for anyone but small children. the battle scences are great. Elijah Wood was once more playing the inoccent hobitt on a journey. Orlando Bloome shined agian in his role of Legolas. Viggo Morteson was just bloody brillant for Aragon. As a fan of the book series, Peter Jackson was able to sew together a series that will last well over a thousend years. The special effects were exellent but in some parts a little over done.

Way too many chaotic battle scenes introduced by \\"inspirational\\" speeches that leave you in diabetic shock. 16 hours of filthy people in variations of the same set. This was a project for a genenarion hungry for a series to call its own. Why not worship the Naked Gun Trilogy instead? Forced themes and pretentious dialogue does nothing to distract me from the fact that Jackson used to make unique and vibrant movies like Heavenly Creatures and Dead Alive. I see the same problems with this \\"epic\\" that all the naysayers are critisizing the Star Wars series for. The difference is Lucas created his universe, his landscapes, his overblown story arcs and failed on his OWN vision.

But Mildly Problematic","review":"There are many reviews about the extraordinary qualities of these three movies, with Return being the climactic high point in both a narrative sense and a cinematic sense as well. I havent felt this attatched to characters in a long time and realize that this trilogy has raised the bar in so many ways. My one fault (who cares if it doesnt follow the book completely-it got a million people reading the books! Actually reading!) is that there are some racial steriotypes hanging around...like the asians in their closely resembling junks and the orc hybrids looking extremely African American...I understand that there needs to be a basis for every character, but making all humans and elfs in the movie aryan was just a tad annoying. Superficial, yes to a degree, but this is a movie that will live on, and I hope that that doesnt date it. In any case a must see film."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Movie","review":"*************Five Stars, Plus!!!!!! A wonderful movie.

All loose ends were tied up, which makes everyone happy. Even though it is about 3 and a half hours long, it is entertaining the whole time. The battle is bigger and more dramatic than in The Two Towers and the special effects are amazing. I can't wait for it to come out on DVD so I can buy it and watch it over and over again! No doubt, 5 stars!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good movie, but weak on the special features","review":"I didn't see this one in the theatre, so I can't compare the transfer quality, but if (like me) you've seen Parts 1 and 2, you have to see Part 3.The second disc begins with two \\"documentaries.\\" The second (longer) one contains almost all of the footage from the first one!

It is powerful with great filming, characterization, and special effects. The acting was great with the friendship between Frodo and Sam being especially powerful, an accurate reflection of the book. It is hard to imagine finer casting possible for the roles. In many cases films are not nearly as good as the book, but this is different. It stays close enough to the original that it complements the book. I hope to watch it with my daughter when she is more mature after we read the series."},{"rating":"2","title":"The most coprehensive ending to a great saga","review":"I've seen the original of this movie and just know that the extended version will be just as good. After all, it's being told and filmed with the technology that George Lucas has given us, and direct by a mastermind, Peter Jackson. I recomend all three film's to anyone that loves epical movies.

But in \\"Return of the King,\\" Gandalf's role because laughable. He is riddled with doubt and insecurity - the director claims this was necessary to bring out the importance of Aragorn's role - but then, Aragorn's role wasn't developed all that well, either.The sappiness of Arwen fading, nearing death, with her survival linked to the defeat of Sauron... It's like they're trying the \\"I do believe in fairies (clap, clap, clap)\\" ploy from Peter Pan to emotionally involve you. It just doesn't belong in the movie.\\"The Lord of the Rings\\" books were a strong enough series, and the characters were so well developed that you feel you know them. The first two movies of the series were very true to the books. They should have kept this same strategy for the final movie, and left the characters as Mr. Tolkien intended them to be."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Forget about the EXTENDED VERSION Coming SOON!","review":"This is the same OLD THEATRICAL EDITION ONLY NONSENSE.

Tolkien's own introduction in which he denounces his work as an allegory. Such nitpicking on a remarkable achievement in film, storytelling, set design and ensemble acting is in my mind unfair and elitist. No film-to-book adapation is ever perfect, and people need to get used to that fact. Peter Jackson accomplished something insurmountable with grace, style, and flair...that achievment should not be ignored or cheapened by pseudo-intellectual hogwash."},{"rating":"2","title":"I have a question?","review":"Why isn't there a version in which you can buy just the 3rd movie and the box from the boxset?

Several people I know who had not read the books could not follow the screenplay at all. Upon further reflection, I realized that although the action scenes were Epic and overwhelming in their intensity, they did nothing to allow you to glimpse into these characters as they were created in Tolkein's books nor did the dialogue allow you to follow the plot as it advanced. There was not a failure in the epic quality -- there was a failure of genuineness -- if it had hit the mark -- even those who had not read the books would have understood and been able to follow the movies."},{"rating":"2","title":"Books to film","review":"Kudos to Peter Jackson for a beautiful job in interpreting the LOR trilogy in film. Casting, scenery, music, special effects, costuming - all were top notch. That being said, however, I found The Return of the King to be my least favorite of the three films.Although a true blue fan of the Tolkein books, I can understand the need to omit parts of the book when making a film. In the first two films Jackson made up for that with wonderful character development. But the heavy reliance on special effects and the awkward tying up of cheesy previously added subplots in ROK was very disappointing to me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Don't be dissin' Frodo...","review":"I can already tell that The Return of the King is gonna ROCK!! The book had me laughing, crying, the whole nine yards, and from seeing FOTR and TTT, any idiot can tell that the third installment is gonna kick some serious butt.Frodo's fate is one full of sacrifice, pain, weariness, and illness, and it'll have any decent soul crying before the end. To see a creature so young, innocent, and beautiful corrupted so horribly is heart-wrenching, even if you're not a dedicated Frodo fan...Anyhow, don't be dissing my boy- Frodo has no hope whatsoever, and only Sam's love for him keeps him going.Again, it's terribly sad, so be prepared next December.~~~Frodo Lives~~~"},{"rating":"2","title":"Never read the books - I'm reviewing the movie","review":"Great movie, but a couple of points. Out of 3 1/2 hours, 2 hours were battles and a 1/2 hour was a BORING goodbye scene at the end of the movie, leaving a bad taste after some pretty good entertainment. Aragorn should have ended up with Eowyn. At least she had some spirit. Wasn't the appearance of the ghost-soldiers a bit convenient? Just when they needed unkillable soldiers that were sworn to the King of Gondor, there they were, just down that road."},{"rating":"1","title":"Style over content","review":"ROTK is a visual masterpiece, technically brilliant, and a very poor telling of Tolkien's masterpiece.Once again Peter Jackson amazes audiences with breathtaking special effects and stunning scenery. He also repeats his formula for the preceding two films, that of including only those parts of the story that he either feels he cannot get away with ditching, or that will provide him with the excuse for his visual triumphs.Jackson's version of Tolkien's story is a wonderful film, but anyone who wanted to know what all the fuss was about would come away from this disappointed. It would be fair to say that LOTR has not been filmed at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"A horrendous end to a cinematic travesty","review":"Peter Jackson knows nothing about J.R.R. Tolkien's masterpiece, and, throughout the series, he has insisted on misrepresenting characters because Tolkien's depiction was too \\"one dimensional.\\" I shudder to think that these movies will be, for many people, \\"The Lord of the Rings,\\" while Tolkien's wonderful books lie forgotten, replaced by celluloid trash.As their own story, Jackson's films are certainly well made, but not one of them is deserving of the title \\"The Lord of the Rings,\\" so unfaithful are they to the trilogy. For the love of all that is holy, read the books and forget about Jackson's terrible retelling."},{"rating":"1","title":"Justice !!","review":"When are the HILDEBRANDT BROTHERS going to get the proper acknowledgement by the makers of this film concerning their influence on the TOTAL look of this and the other films by Peter Jackson ?!!!??"},{"rating":"1","title":"Extend THIS","review":"Editors have their jobs for a reason: Cutting the crap and getting to the point. Extended scenes were cut because they have no effect upon the film and in fact slow the pacing. I do not need to see the film's excess especially when that excess betrays the storyline. I did not need to see Saruman killed by Wormtongue and then fall fifty stories - this did not happen in the book. I did not need to see Sam confront Gollum, because he had done it many times already during the regular film. I did not need to see the Witch King confront Gandalf at Minas Tirith. I did not need to see the bizarre speaker for Sauron at the Black Gate. These added scenes confuse the viewer and soil Tolkien's work. These added scenes add another half hour onto an already long film. Enough is enough. Let's return Jackson's film back to its leaner, meaner, pristine condition."},{"rating":"1","title":"The worst of the series","review":"This film did not deserve the \\"Best Picture\\" oscar and was by far the weakest of the three films. The ending was horrible and all I can say is get a better editor. The ghost scenes from Pirates of the Caribbean were far superior to the ones in this film. By the end of the film you wish Frodo could have fallen to his death along with Gollum. He tried to do too much in this film and the true trophy of this entire series was by far The Two Towers."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King","review":"If I had a chance to pick what movie is the best picture of the year I'd pick director Peter Jackson's \\"Lord of the Rings: Return of the King\\". This movie is just plain stunning! The battle sequences, drama scenes, horror scenes, everything in this movie is incredible! In my opinion \\"The Return of the King\\" is better than its two wonderful preludes, \\"The Fellowship of the Ring\\" and \\"The Two Towers\\". Great special effects, stunning music (score), and superb acting enhance this brilliant fantasy movie!"},{"rating":"2","title":"TO THOSE WHO CRITICIZE JACKSON'S WORK WITH 1 OR 2 STARS","review":"I have this to say... if Tolkein himself had been around to oversee the making of these films, then I would expect a faithful adaptation. But these films (and ROTK in particular, since it omits much more than the others) are Peter Jackson's interpretation of Tolkein's books. If you believe that this film is SO lacking due to the missing storylines/climaxes that are present in the book, don't watch it! I would think that such avid readers (who love and appreciate the BOOKS as Tolkein's masterwork) would be intelligent enough to view the films as totally seperate entities from the books, and appreciate the FILMS as Peter Jackson's masterwork."},{"rating":"2","title":"impressive though imperfect effort","review":"An impressive effort, but could have been twenty minutes shorter. The \\"bowing to the hobbits\\" was the most sincerely moving scene of all three films, and the whole would have been much more strongly and sharply ended there, for an adaptation.Instead, the return to the Shire was twenty more minutes of men getting weepy over each other which was painfully boring after 12 hours of such strained posturing and bluster, and Mr. Jackson's most serious editing error.The emotional content of the entire work ultimately seemed somewhat unconvincing and contrived. In the end, the movie remains only a good-looking substitute for the rich and highly imaginative books, and Gollum emerges as the most sincere and gripping character of all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ring Wraith Gets His Due","review":"I'm tired of hearing these whiny complainers griping about the Witch King breaking poor Gandalf's Staff, \\"Sniff, sniff\\". Maybe Peter Jackson was trying to make up for the weakly portrayed nazgul throughout the previous films. Aragorn, single handed, defeating the Ringwraiths on Weathertop, including the Witch King??? Give me a break. Now that, was a travesty, but I didn't hear any whining then."},{"rating":"1","title":"Without special effects, this is nothing","review":"The acting is simply laughable. The set design is quite amateurish. The computer-generated special effects are simply silly and unconvincing. Plus, this is almost four hours of utter ennui. People seem to enjoy this only because other people seem to enjoy this. To give this an Oscar once again shows that Hollywood is a total self-flattering piece of joke."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful waste of 4 hrs","review":"A complete waste of money, time, and some hours of extremely unpleasant after taste.

It is a cartoon version and is, beyond ANY doubt, the WORST movie I have EVER seen. So please, do not blame poor Peter Jackson for the mess up. Now, if you enjoy listening to terrible ballads about \\"Frodo of the nine fingers, and the ring of doom\\", and the thought of a studdering hideous Sam, who uses his entire hand to cover his nose, is funny, than I highly recommend it. On the other hand, if you want to see a movie that even REMOTELY resembles what Professor Tolkien wrote, than PLEASE FOR YOUR OWN SAKE wait until Peter Jackson's version comes out in December (which will bypass pretty much EVERYONE'S expectations, I'm sure of it)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome and worth the wait! But about Saruman...(for Dan)","review":"I'm not sure who the White Tumor Head Orc was but it wasn't Saruman, at least not in the books. Saruman went on the create trouble in the Shire and eventually got what was due him but that wasn't in the movie.A few other key subplots were missing too, most noticably the after effects of the battle of Pelennor Fields and the positive resolutions that came from the tragic battle. There's only so much that can be crammed into the 3+ hours tho' and they did a magnificent job of everything...it was awesome, beautiful, uplifting and so very worth it!BUT...can't wait for the extended version of the DVD.

I saw it on STARZ! on Saturday night, on Sunday afternoon, and I'll watch it again on Tuesday night. I know that the movie is only BASED on JRR Tolkien's books, but I hope that the extended version shows what happened to Saruman and Wormtongue, since the book talked about their demise on the way to the Shire. The movie never showed them after the flooding of Isengard.I also think that even though Tolkien left Shelob's eventual fate unmentioned, it would have been nice if Peter Jackson actually included a scene where Samwise actually kills her instead of just wounding her.

I enjoyed the first installment as I found it entertaining, well paced and visually stunning. I found this movie to be unbearably boring. I actually had to fast-forward through parts of it, it was so slow. I sometimes wonder if people fall into the trap of thinking this is a brilliant movie because of the PR behind it. Oscar? I must be really missing something here.It was a few big boring fight scenes strung together with slow dialogue, weak plot lines and great visuals.

The first was horrifically boring and I almost avoided any of the others because of it. Thankfully, i tried out two towers and it brought back my faith that these could be good movies. My only knock on this movie was-for the love of God, cut the last 30 minutes. It was like a relative who stays too long at a Christmas party-sure you were happy to see them earlier in the night, but now its late and its time for them to go. The last 30 minutes offered nothing except a complete waste of my time. So by averaging out the 5 stars the movie had in the first 3/4ths of the film with the 1 star for the last 30 minutes, i get a 4 star rating.

Hopefully, the extra 50 minutes helps to provide a more befitting closure than the bloated overdone theatrical cut.If you are looking for the perfect Christmas gift for your \\"Lord of the Rings\\" fanatic loved ones, look no further.

Looks like all those beloved ROTK scenes that didn't make it into the theatrical film are back, and boy, are they BEAUTIFUL!

It combines every aspect of a good film, compasion, love, loyalty, friendship, and of course, hard-core battle sequenses. It cannot be passed by because of its 200 minute running time, which is many people's reason. The story is so fully developed though, I suggest watch \\"Fellowship\\" and \\"Two Towers\\" before the Return of the King.Another great thing about ROTK, is the stirring performances by every actor (or actress) in it. My favorite was Ian McKellen with Gandalf.There are so many other great things about this movie, but if you like any of the aspects of film listed above, I suggest you see Return of the King.(It won 11 Academy Awards too, so there's another reason it is so great.)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Intense and Emotional Movie For LOTR Fans","review":"When The Lord Of The Rings: The Two Towers, was finished, the 12 moths between this and The Return Of The King, were too long. Gollum's history as introduction was exciting and very dramatical. The Figth by Minas Tirith was wonderful (sincerely I was expecting more violence, we'll see it in extended edition?). Only the kiss between Aragorn and Arwen was too poor, like a soap opera, within magical or elf environment.At the end of this movie, I was crying: 1) Because this was the last movie of the trilogy, and 2) Anne Lennox's very emotional interpretation: \\"Into The West\\". I hope Peter Jackson an excelent extended edition and it's new filming in the next years: The Hobbit... we are awaiting!!!."},{"rating":"2","title":"The King Returns!!!","review":"The final installment is absolutley smashing. I am convinced it will win best picture since Hollywood does honor films like this. Remember Titanic? If the King doesnt win ratings will be a bust. Remember Shakespeare in Love?? This cast is perfection. Sean Astin deserves an Oscar nod for best supporting actor. I think you all know the part I am refering to where he seals his devotion to his fellow hobbit. I wont reveal the scene for those who have not seen the film. Peter Jackson also deserves a nod too. I love how he sticks it to George Lucas by telling him hey you can do a big budget movie without a zillion special effects. So kudos to the King! If you havent seen it then crawl out from Mount Doom and go! There wont be another film around like this for a long time!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply Brilliant!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","review":"You should have already seen this motion picture and the last two before it. If you haven't see them all then what are you waiting for? You would have to be locked in a room for a long, long time to not know about it.It is recommended you start with the first picture, \\"Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring\\" and move on to the second picture, \\"Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers\\" then see this one. This can be a stand alone picture but it was not intended to be that. You really must view all 3 pictures; the trilogy is a \\"MUST SEE.\\"It is masterful work and superb acting and action all the way around."},{"rating":"2","title":"My Favorite","review":"Of the three, this is by far my favorite (who does not like happy endings?).I have the same version for the first two, I now have the complete set (yes, took me awhile).I highly recommend this series of movies for anyone who has not seen."},{"rating":"2","title":"Second best","review":"When I saw this at the cinema, I thought it was the greatest film I'd ever seen. I couldn't wait for the extended version to arrive on the 4 disk set. When this was finally released, however, I was disappointed - the ending feels far too long and drawn out now so that the excitement and suspense created by the Gondor battle is totally squandered by the story meandering off, not least to follow Frodo on an extended amble through Mordor. So, only 4 stars.That said, the main battle is absolutely staggering. I could just watch it again and again and again. Well... I have! This is the type of film that upsets you when it ends as you just want more and more. It does bring the entire story to a very satisfying climax, but how I wish there was yet another part to look forward to.An incredible film, but for once, the director's cut takes second best to the cinema release."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great movie","review":"Love this movie! This is actually my second copy because my daughter stepped on my first and broke it. If you have children that don't care for reading, this would be a great series to read together and then watch the movies!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellant","review":"Best of the three films.. The three hours and twenty minutes went by quickly. The cinematography was vibrant, the musical score was beautiful and the direction was a masterpiece. I am looking forward to the DVD so I can watch it without cell phones lighting up, popcorn cartons rattling and the man sitting next to me translating the movie to his wife who did not understand English very well. Next time a new movie comes out I am going to wait until it has been out for a while so the theater is not packed so I can move to another location if I get trapped near inconsiderate people."},{"rating":"2","title":"very comfortable and was easy to put together.","review":"this chair is very comfortable and was easy to put together. It's much less expensive than similar office chairs. Only complaint is the arm rests are a little wider than I'd like.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Iceman Soundtrack","review":"The film was a little corny, but like many movies of its kind, the music was excellent. A good soundtrack will always have a strong musical theme, which is reprised in many different scenes throughout a movie. The Iceman soundtrack is hard to find, which almost makes it a collectable. I recommend the music, and possibly the film over half a dozen imported beers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheesy","review":"WARNING -- this thing is bigger and bulkier than it appears on the website. It does not easily fit in a pocket. I needed a place to keep my business cards to hand out to prospective clients, and this thing looked alright and was the right price (of course the standard shipping cost more than the item itself). When it arrived, I was surprised at how bulky and cheesy looking it was. Not something I would take out in front of a client to impress them! It looks like a freebie you'd get at a job fair. I would recommend spending a little extra money to get a business card case that fits in your pocket and actually looks decent. That's what I ended up doing after purchasing this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great organizational tool!","review":"After seeing this product used by a associate, I decided to try it in our company. We were looking for a more durable option for our employees to carry company cards. The size is perfect for employees to put gas cards, business cards, VISA. We further customized the product with labels and contact numbers. The uses of the Bungee Card Case is limited by your imagination!Personally I load the cards that I will be using that day and slip it into my pocket. If I lose it, I only lost a few cards and not my entire life... You can carry business cards (30+) and hunting licenses and tags! We may even buy more to place in our vehicle glove box to hold license and registration papers making a fast easy find!Of the 20 we recently purchased not one has faulted!"},{"rating":"1","title":"There's better out there","review":"Big and bulky. The bungee lid is awkward.

I use it everyday to hold my ID as well as debit, credit and membership cards. Whenever I pull it out I get compliments. People want to know where I got it from and tell me that it's super cool and unique (even after all of these years). The quality of the workmanship is excellent. If you want a functional, sturdy, unique case... get it. Yes, it is LARGE, but if you have a purse you can stash it there... It's smaller than a wallet. I haven't had a wallet in my purse in years! Dude: It could even go in your inside suit coat pocket... It's no heavier/bulkier than an iPhone!"},{"rating":"2","title":"a must have","review":"This case is a must have for all,especially women that carryeverything in their purse.

The best selection by far is the song from God's own 'Word' and that song is Charity. Sure would like to know who the soloist on this song is becasue she can BLOW'. This song gives you fresh insight into the real meaning of 'Charity' without changing God's Word. Also great songs 'I Am The Holy Spirit', 'Blessed Is The Man', & 'Get Back Satan'. The only reason I didn't give this cd 5 stars was because although I like Creflo as a minister, pastor, & preacher, his solo on \\"the Lord is In This Temple\\" left me thinking that this is an area he needs to leave to those 'called' to minister in song! This is a great buy...Pick It Up!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Its not what I expected..","review":"I understand when I chose the \\"used but like new\\" item it woild not be in the brand new condition.

It lead me to want to know more about this wonderfully eccentric person.The book is beautifully illustrated and contains a wonderful message of tolerance.The children I read it to loved it. The book made for some great discussions afterwards about unique people, neighbors, kindness towards others, love for animals and being different."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Book for all ages","review":"Jane Bregoli captivates audiences with her friendly depiction of goats and neighbors of all ages! Delightful, inspired paintings illustrate her true story. Readers from all over will enjoy this classic story, solid in values, strong in spirit, and a joy to read over again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Generic shooter","review":"In fact, 'generic' is too fancy a word for this game. It tries to attempt the same sort of atmosphere seen in the recent film Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow, with Jules Verne-type technology in a 19th century setting. But it's so dull and uninteresting.You have the choice of playing as biplane or a blimp (hardly the best kind of combat vehicle) as you fly through several slightly atmospheric stages blasting at generic enemies and catching generic power-ups. There's almost no skill involved in it at all. And the music is some of the most boring I've ever encountered in a video-game.I can't think of anything to recommend this game. The Gameboy Advance version features slightly improved graphics and altered cut scenes, but would still never ever consider paying full price for this. If you're desperately keen then pay less than half price for the GBA version if you can and ignore the Sega release.Graphics C+Sound D+Gameplay C-Lasting Appeal D"},{"rating":"1","title":"Information? yes. Professional? no.","review":"Definitely not worth the $30. Shot at her home with counter top appliances and spice containers that jump around from shot to shot. In one spot her words are deleted and replaced with other wording while her lips move. Her choices of scent and color don't compliment. She doesn't mention a lot of things that I already know, being essential oils vs. fragrance oils, etc. If you want some basic information without any of the professionalism, this would work, but not for the $30. And she also shows melt and pour soap which is already soap, so that's not really making soap."},{"rating":"1","title":"One star is actually much too generous.","review":"Don't waste your money. David Allen Grier was so funny when he performed on In Living Color, but I now know it's because he was great at supporting roles. When left alone, this comedian leaves alot to desire. The DVD is not good and his stand up routine is just awful. We saw him last night for New Years Eve in Atlantic City. Hard to believe he is the same guy. He had a \\"warm up\\" comedian come on before him who was hilarious. Don't spend any money on stand up or DVD's for him. You will be dissapointed. No chance here to give no stars. If I could have, I would have."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Word of Advice - Skip this one","review":"I really like David Alan Grier.

I have no desire to view this dvd a second time."},{"rating":"1","title":"So Dissapointed!","review":"Well, I went out and bought this DVD because people said it was funny. When my husband and I were watching it, we looked at each other and said, \\"This is the worse stand up we've ever seen.\\" I felt that all Mr. Grier was doing, was screaming at us. His material was neither fresh or subtle. And he doesn't come accross at all as likeable, (like Chris Rock) something I look for in comics. I do not reccomend bying this DVD."},{"rating":"1","title":"not universal voltage for USA only 110 v","review":"The item does not specify the voltage limitations.

I did find the book well done, nice layout,crisp bright pictures. It also started with history, and progressed thru the current crop of people building and experimenting with the scopes. Ms. Baker does a very good job of covering all the aspects of the ins and outs of the different scopes and mirror set ups. Gives the reader looking for only entertainment. Just enough information on any of the chapter subjects to make it clear and then moves on to the next.The glossary,bibliography and internet sites are a nice touch.Along with the other appendix's artists list,tips for building your own,source list and the copies of the main two patents.In all if you have only a passing interest in the what,where and how of kaleidoscopes then this book is for you.

But as usual, Amazon provides so many selections and after reading other reviews, I decided to try the Antoinette Go2 Bra in both Black and Beige. I'm very pleased with the support provided and the fact that it is also pretty.However, I did not give it 5 stars for one reason. I'm a true 36D, and this bra runs small in the \\"36\\" part. The cup fits perfect, but I have to fasten it on the first set of hooks and it's a little tight. Also, had to wash a couple of times before I could wear them. The mesh tends to be a bit scratchy. As I break them in, everything's working out fine."},{"rating":"1","title":"Somewhat supportive...uncomfortable not worth it","review":"I know my bra size and how different brands vary but this bra seemed to have been made by a \\"man\\" who knows nothing about women's comfort.

The edge guide was of no use in routing a 1/2\\" groove into the narrow (1 \\") side of a 2 X 4. This made the router attachment of no use on my project.Dremel has the \\"Shaper / Router Table\\" attachment and a soon-to-be-available Plunge Router attachment you should consider.

The problem is that the opening at the back of the case is too small to easily fit the camera through. It is a real struggle to put the camera in the case or pull it out, and I sometimes think that in fighting with the case I might accidentally rip the articulated LCD off the back of the camera!I have the rangefinder version of this case, which I use when I have a Panasonic 14mm pancake lens on the camera, and it works well because it's easy to put the camera through the opening in the case with a small lens attached. For some reason the manufacturer didn't make the opening on the M 4/3 version any bigger than on the rangefinder version, even though the case is designed to fit a camera with a larger zoom lens. As a result, it's too difficult to use, and I've gone looking for another, better case."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good for rats with bumblefoot, but it's really messy","review":"My rat has bumblefoot because she's morbidly obese. This stuff has kept it from getting further infected or from bursting. Presumably it also tastes horrible because she doesn't try to chew it either. It's finally starting to scab now. so I guess it's doing it's job.I have to agree with the other review, the dauber cap is awful and messy, but I can't imagine the aerosol or the spray bottle being any better.

Does what you except, can burn, shape, cut all different kinds of materials; plastics, styrofoam, wood.This product heats up really really quick.. So make sure you don't just set it down and go do something in the meantime. It took, 5 minutes maybe for it to get to the point of where I could constantly burn into the wood without issue.Only downfall that I saw is that the packaging of the item and the instructions don't give a clear idea of what each tool tip does. They are in their own little compartments which then has descriptions next to them; however, if you don't keep the product in it's packaging after each use, you will have no idea (unless memorized) as to what each tip does..Overall it's been a good product for what I've used it for so far."},{"rating":"1","title":"Already broken!","review":"I bought this tool for wood burning.

It shows all of this so it can really be time consuming.Also, a good QB can complete at least 65% of their passes. EA dosen't agree with me though 'cause in Madden 2002 even if your guy is open there is still a good chance that the ball will go through their head or their hands.Quick, name a RB who can rush 12 yards a carry.

I go on long walks with it, breastfeed with it, basically live in it. Our daughter is colicky and doesn't like to be still. So we walk all day long.

It stuns fleas which allows you time to place them in a ziplock bag to dispose of later. However, it makes a very high pitched sound similar to having your ears ring unexpectedly and must be cleaned after each flea is stunned. Cleaning the unit requires each flea be brushed into the ziplock bag which makes using the Flea Zapper a two person job. To top it off, the Flea Zapper does not work well on longer fur. It is most assuredly, not the natural flea treatment for which I had hoped. Save your money and use a flea comb with a disposable cup full of soapy water."},{"rating":"2","title":"Corner hole","review":"Great game it takes u way back and now my wife is hooked on it I really didn't think u could buy these old style games thankx a bunch"},{"rating":"1","title":"ESPN NFL PRIME TIME","review":"I BELIEVE GIVING THIS SORRY GAME A 2 STAR RATING IS BEING VERY GENEROUS.

First, in my program you couldn't access the instant replays you saved--the program would shut off...In the create player section, the face cannot be transferred without wasting any of your time. Also, the so called 'Dittie Importer', where you can put your own tunes on the game, is virtually impossible to access.These small nuances can be fixed yes, but I don't want to spend a few hours wasting my time downloading a patch or searching through various help sites.

In fact, it's little more than an expanded glossary with some very unfortunate lacunae (for example, the Hierogrammates are given little more than a mention)! The author seems caught up in the arcana arguing by implication that Wolfe is seeking not much more than the consternation of his readers through twistings and turnings of identities. Perhaps that is one of the tools he uses in his writings (there does seem to be a consensus on that point though I remain unconvinced), but it isn't really all that interesting as an end. Of far greater value -- and as little as I understand him, I know this to be true of Wolfe's intent --is what the author is intending to TEACH.

There are better products out there than this collar which in my opinion, is totally useless. Save your money. (And yes, I did spray for fleas around the house and yard). The collar is more of a flea attractor than a flea de-tractor. :("},{"rating":"1","title":"Not working well","review":"We bought this collar for our dog and the two of the same brand's cat collars and they are not working. We put the collars on after giving each of them flea baths and we are still discovering fleas on them. The collars do not seem to be killing off any new ones that find their way onto our animals.

Last there is a new feature that hasn't been used since NHL 1997, and that is a skills competition just like in the NHL All-Stars game in real life. You can practice shoting, manuevering past defenders, and improving your speed.

If you are a two left foot the concept seems attractive, but in practice you first need to buy the expensive and hard to find dance pad (a floor mat with sensors that connects to your PS and which you hop on), and then the game gets boring and difficult quickly.

Make sure and buy *TWO* dance pads for it. However, make sure it is set up somewhere such that the adults can escape! After you've heard the Mickey Mouse Club extended Techno Rave mix 11 times in a row (because the girls *have* to get a AAA score before moving on) it will get old.

The story is very good and actually in my opinion bares some slight semblance to reality, at least in terms of how the politics work. There are a lot of ways you can go through the game that make give you some leeway.I guess for me though, none of it clicked. I had the story figured out after the beginning of the second mission, and basically you can sneak everywhere or kill everything. In the meantime your skills (swimming, lockpicking, computers) determine the secret stuff you can get. The thing is it's REALLY boring and REALLY time consuming to sneak around so after you get caught twice you're tired of it. And the shooter engine isn't as good as other FPS. So basically, it's a bad FPS with a good story that I already knew. Too bad, it had potential."},{"rating":"2","title":"Deus Ex","review":"This is a very good game if you like to get into the game.

If you have the factory CD changer, you unplug the harness from it, and plug it into this devie and, voila, you now have an AUX input on your stereo. However, if you don't have that factory CD changer, be prepared to pay even much more to make things happen.Considering the light weight of this device, and the fact that it is just about 100% plastic, I'm positive that they could charge much less for it.

The tone of the ringer is annoying. The base unit isn't easy to read as you sit, and when the hand set is in the cradle you can't read it either. It's really not easy to read when you walk by either.

Unfortunately, the most redeeming quality about Pnin is that it is short. After reading the comments by reviewers on the dust jacket (\\"Hilariously funny...\\"; \\"fabulous laughter\\"; \\"laughter that is near to tears\\"), I could only ask \\"What have you been smoking?\\" Ok, I did grin two or three times but laughter? Give me a break. Sure, the character did elicit sympathy and sadness but, otherwise, through most of the book I was thinking what a waste of paper. Read it if you want. Being as short as it is, you won't waste too much time."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Comic Masterpiece","review":"PNIN is a quieter, less startling, perhaps less ambitious book than, say, PALE FIRE or LOLITA. However, it is a touching comic masterpiece in its own right, suffused with Nabokov's priceless prose. Pnin himself is endearing, and the emotional core of PNIN is perhaps more accessible, less disguised by cleverness and artifice than the humane sympathy in PALE FIRE or LOLITA. This is a truly wonderful book, and not without its own (not so subtle) trademark Nabokovian indirections and hints of metafiction."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pnin is Pdull","review":"I loved Lolita, but I found this Nabokov story to be dull and pointless. I was very disappointed despite all the wonderful language he uses."},{"rating":"1","title":"I can't believe these reviews!?","review":"Firstly, I've read virtually the entire works of Nabakov & consider him one of the greatest authors of all time. Secondly, Pnin is a terrible mistake. It is supposed to be comedic but is TOTALLY UNFUNNY, the eponymous character is dull and unbelievable, plotline almost invisible, the book as a whole is slow and awkward. Most of Nabakov's writing is as fresh and inspiring as a summer breeze but Pnin is like a bad case of halitosis. Forgive me, Vlad!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Fiction for people who like crosswords, not stories","review":"As a Nabakov fan, I was appalled by this obscure and diffuse attempt at a \\"novel.\\" The entire story is Pnin, a bumbling Russian professor, giving a series of rambling and often bizarre lectures on everything from the nature of being, love, and death to the finer points of Romanian cuisine. I've been told that these lectures hold the key to the story: copy the first and last words of each sentence and slowly the story within the \\"story\\" of Pnin begins to emerge. Brilliant intellectual fun for some but for those of us who prefer Nabakov's more conventional tales, Pnin is pretentious torture and a thorough bore. Consider yourself warned."},{"rating":"1","title":"A slovenly jamboree","review":"This is a novel about a professor who is slightly cuckoo. This is a story about a man who is filled with opinions that can not only be considered conservative for our time, but did for his time as well. I used this novel to exercise my Nabokov, and is my least favorite novel by the author. I am glad he wrote others, because this alone would have stolen Nabokov's artistic genius.The book is written well, but the plot is immensely boring. I would suggest you NOT bother reading it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cure for Insomnia","review":"Pnin was the 5th Nabokov book I've read.

It is one of the most boring, pointless books I've ever read. I find no more amusement in it than I would following around any elderly nerd, watching him fumble gracelessly through his boring life. And I feel it has absolutely no bearing on life as we know it today, and cannot appreciate or even locate social commentary or satire that other readers have found. In my opinion it should go out of print and stay there."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too expensive","review":"I think Amazon kills its Kindle by so high pricing Kindle books - $12 - is the price of hardcover or at least paperback, not of the electronic version."},{"rating":"2","title":"hidden gem","review":"Nabokov is one of those authors you either connect with or don't, which is perhaps more a matter of taste than we would like to admit. His characters are bizarre, usually neurotic if not truly insane, yet almost always funny.Pnin is one of his finer creations: an inhibited academic, whose past is laced with pain and betrayals, he lives a little life from all appearences. Yet within him is a being of extraordinary sympathy and quirky intelligence, which floursihes under Nabokov's comic and tragic gaze. Only those who come to love him experience the treasure that lies within him, and as he is revealed to the reader, who can fall in love with him or not. Though very little occurs in this book in terms of plot, Pnin's existence takes on a kind of significance. THe reader comes to acccept his limitations while feeling such an acute ache of sympathy for him.Warmly recommended, but it isn't for everybody."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Fine","review":"Nabokov's brilliant and evocative prose style once again comes through in this elegant novel about a bewildered professor of Russian who is not dissimilar from the author. This novel is a fine combination of farcical humor and introspective reflection; it is both cool and finely polished as well as experimental. Although Nabokov occasionally falls into the pitfalls of the academic/farce genre, he is generally able to keep the book alive with curious uses of the narrator as character, as well as various digressions into other ancillary characters. A fine work, though it is not Nabokov at his best."},{"rating":"2","title":"Long lasting battery but only one battery in each unit","review":"Have used for 2 yrs - They do work very well when placed in potted plants - shrubbery container - opened to rotate battery and have noticed that these in comparson to another set they have only place [metal connection] for one battery not two - Not sure if that would enhance the brightness or not.

In contrast, Professor Peter Frost uses everyday language to explore, honestly, the positive and negative emotions that surface in any organization. He is especially eloquent when he describes how pain (associated, for example, with illness, death, career troubles, or family problems) surfaces or is suppressed at work. His vivid, real examples make these problems come alive. Next, he shows how leaders who are unafraid of being honest about emotions, can ease and comfort those who suffer, helping to make work a better place. The stories of these emotional heros and heroines offer leaders a new way of thinking and behaving that could benefit us all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Larry Dossey's precepts a \\"trigger\\" to write this?

I wrote to him years ago with my impressions of his book - he is not to be criticized.And here is Frost's book. The Prologue isn't heavy with Dosseyism, but there was just enough to signal a warning that I should dispense with any serious examination of this book.

Also, the front wheels swivel while the back ones are stationary. This took me some time to get used to, and it doesn't corner overly well, but it makes the wagon much safer to ride in.We love the cup holders and large wheels (we purchased in the winter & it does great through the snow!) and with two active kids it is already a great buy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Justices Florida Wagon","review":"We had already purchased this wagon at walmart in NY and needed one for Florida.

Most other quality wagons are design with the pull arm tied to the front axle which locks the wheels together and makes turns very smooth. If this were not a gift from the grandparents I would sell it immediately and buy a less expensive option."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Big Disappointment","review":"We had great expectations when we bought this wagon. One year later we are extremely disappointed. The ride is very rough and the front wheels wobble terribly whenever we try to move quickly. I called Radio Flyer about this problem and they sent two new front axles as a fix. However, because of the way the wheels are installed, it was not an easy fix and did not solve the problem. The wagon is hard to maneuver and gets 'stuck' going over curbs and cracks in the sidewalk. To add to this, my kids (age 2 & 4) are too big for the wagon! Their legs get all tangled up because the leg wells are too small. Finally, there is no extra storage, so when we go on outings I have nowhere to stow my bag, the lunchbag, etc. I have decided to cut my losses, sell this one to the consignment shop and get a Step 2 wagon with the little trailer attachment."},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT WAGON BUT ITS HUGE","review":"I love this wagon but it wouldn't fit in the trunk of my car.I bought this wagon for my sons first birthday because it has seatbealts and I haven't seen any others with them.I have seen too many kids fall out of wagons and I wasn't going to buy my son one until I saw this one.It is very easy to push with my one year old and even his seven year old brother in it.The kids love it but I know it will only be able to be used in by backyard or for walks around the block because it just won't fit in my car.If you have a van or suv I would highly recomened this wagon if you have a car I wouldnt recomened this unless you just want to use it at home."},{"rating":"1","title":"My Suburban has a tighter turning radius than this wagon.","review":"I've nearly dumped the kids out of this thing no less than 15 times. I've rented the most beat to hell, nasty wagons from Zoos, Amusement parks and ones I've pulled off the curb and they all blow this one out of the water. I have my original Radio Flyer with the wooden removable sides that's over 20 years old - It's rusted, rotted and one wrong look at it from falling apart, but I would use that before I take this thing out.Bottom line is if you want to turn, you need an exit ramp length distance and have to start about 1/4mi from it, otherwise the wheels bind up and you'll dump the kids out. The wheels on this thing sink into everything."},{"rating":"2","title":"Kaitlynn's wagon","review":"Our granddaughter thought this was wonderful.

This wagon went together easily until I got to the last step: attaching the pull handle. It simply doesn't fit and the holes you put the axle into are impossible to get lined up.Part# 2700.0830599 and 2700.0830203.I thought the handle was just defective (came out of the mold too early) and called for a new one.The factory sent one in about a week. It was exactly the same so I returned the whole wagon to Amazon."},{"rating":"1","title":"Connecting handle to wagon is POOR","review":"Trying to feed the bar through the holes in order to connect the handle to the wagon body is difficult.

So, my advice is to shop around!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Poorly designed/Poorly made","review":"We bought this plastic version for our kids with fond memories of the metal Radio Flyer of our own youths and have been sorely disappointed from the beginning. The seat belts didnt last a season as weather made them brittle. My 3 year old girl ripped them off by hand. The wheels cannot handle changes in direction (forward to backward) and the front wheels get stuck in a sideways position. They leave scuff marks on patio tile. All in all, this was a poor product and the last Radio Flyer product we'll ever buy -- they ruined an iconic toy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beware when wheels fall off","review":"There are cheap plastic caps for the bolts attaching the wheels. The wagon is basically useless now because it snapped off. This after a year of only very occasional use."},{"rating":"1","title":"BAD, BAD Front Wheels","review":"The wagon is GREAT! Seats are GREAT! Seat-belts are GREAT! BUT, BUT, BUT THE FRONT WHEELS ARE HORRIBLE!! You can not turn the wagon without the wheels getting stuck. I've tipped the wagon over several times with my kids in it. My four year old daughter tried to pull her baby sister in it and could not because of the front wheels. I had to run and catch the wagon because it would have tipped over. I only use the wagon for short walks and I make sure I do not stop because then I have to deal with the front wheels. It's just too frustrating for me to deal with. I also do not let my four year old daughter pull her baby sister in it ever! It's too dangerous! I'm really bummed too. The wagon would be a great wagon if the front wheels turned with the body of the wagon and with the back wheels. We paid good money for there to be a MAJOR, MAJOR flaw like that."},{"rating":"1","title":"Seat belts come off!","review":"I bought this wagon specifically because it had seatbelts. They come right off if pulled on. I have twin 1.5 year olds and they pulled the seatbelts right out of the screws. Yes, they were put on properly. I called Radioflyer and told them about the problem and they sent me new hardware and belts. The new ones did the same thing! DO NOT BUY IF SEATBELTS ARE A PRIORITY TO YOU!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great wagon for two","review":"I bought this wagon after researching many others. I needed a good wagon that would be able to tote my two children in for years to come. I have a 4 and 18 month old boys, and the Pathfinder was one of the only ones that have more than a 75lb weight limit(so both my children can ride in it together). My boys LOVE it. The high-back seats make it a more comfortable ride, and the seat belts keep my little one inside while it's moving.It was very simple to put together. The handle fold up underneath the wagon for storage, or to put in the car. Some reviews said that their wheels were plastic but ours were just very hard rubber, so it almost feels like plastic. The steering is much better than the wagons I remember as a kid, so I don't have to worry about it tipping over on sharp turns.Great Wagon!"},{"rating":"2","title":"they love their wagon!","review":"Bought this for my son for his 2nd birthday, and he and my 3 year old daughter can't get enough. They love to get it and fasten their seatbelts (by themselves!) and will sit in it without complaining for long walks around our neighborhood. They were getting really sick of the double stroller- this is so much more fun for them. It was really easy to put together, and I have had no problems at all with the wheels (as some reviews mention). I couldn't be happier with this purchase."},{"rating":"2","title":"Entire family enjoys it!","review":"Arrived promptly in good condition. Contained all parts. Assembly instructions easy to follow. Overall product evaluation: sturdy, safe, very easy to maneuver.Handle and front wheels operate independently, not linked with a common axle. This means it's strictly a \\"pulling wagon\\". The kids can't jump in and steer themselves down a hill. On second thought, maybe that's a good thing.My girls are one and four and love it. Can't wait to use it at the beach/boardwalk/park.The only thing that could make this wagon better is real rubber tires. This wagon has a plastic center wheel with a rubberized-plastic tread. It rolls silently and effectively, but skeptical about tire longevity.As an aside, I still have and use my 21 year old son's (that's right) Radio Flyer wagon which I purchased 19 years ago. Never had to replace any parts. Never left outdoors so there is no rust. And yes, my son's stepsisters still play with it.Hope this wagon holds up as well as the old one..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Quality - DO NOT BUY","review":"Our 14-month old has been on two rides in this wagon and the seatbelt strap has already broken.

My wife and I bought the Radio Flyer Pathfinder Wagon as a Christmas persent for him. He loves to pull his baby brother and our Yorkie dog around the house in his wagon. By the time the weather warms up, I'm sure the neighborhood will be explored. The wagon has no sharp or pointy projections that could injure the children. It is put together well and appears that it will last until the baby brother outgrows it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great wagon for pre-schoolers and up","review":"I was very pleased with the durability of this wagon. I bought it for my 4 year old grandson. He loved being pulled all around the neighborhood and seemed pretty comfortable with the high back, cup compartment and seat belt. I thought he might get restless and want out, but he thoroughly enjoyed even long walks in the wagon. I was also concerned it would not be large enough for a tall four year old boy, but there was plenty of room and it definitely was large and durable enough. The wheels maneuvered beautifully, and the tall handle was comfortable for my 6 foot 2 inch son to pull without bending. I like the fact that the handle pulls upward and locks in place for storage. A great buy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Grandkid fun","review":"Grandkids love this...they can be strapped in and enjoy the ride...easy to pull, but can be a little hard to turn when going up an incline...great to use instead of a stroller, especially when you have more than one child :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Buy","review":"I just bought this for my daughter's 2nd birthday. She loves it! It is hard to bring her places in her stroller because she won't sit in it for very long, but she will sit in this wagon for hours. We bring it everwhere, into stores and outside. It is very easy to manuever, and very easy to put together. I have an Explorer, and it fits in the back alongside the big stroller.

I bought this wagon expecting the same great experience and was dissapointed. It seems very durable and I like the seats with the seatbelts (primarially the reason I bought it). My main complaint is with the front wheels. I understand that you cant steer it while sitting in the wagon but the wheels when I am pulling my son dont track straight & they just begin wobbling thus shaking the wagon. This is a major shortcoming in my opinion and is a significant design flaw (which earned this product the low rating).

The first two degrees of lighting are super-dim, on a lamp of 4 25-watt bulbs; the third degree is super-bright.

The reason? That darn phoenix in the back room of one of the shops! I tried and tried and went away, came back, and tried again, and never managed to get the feathers off that bird's butt! Other than that, I remember the PS game as having awesome graphics, an odd spell-learning method (timing is EVERYTHING), and the flying/Quidditch was cool.I later bought the PC version of the game, and much prefer it. The spell-learning is difficult (staying in the lines while tracing a design with your mouse, the time limit decreasing - and accuracy demands increasing - each time), but more \\"realistic\\" in terms of what Harry & Co. must go through while trying to learn the \\"swish-and-flick\\" and other wand techniques.

I have recently been finishing my homework earlier than usual so that I can have a few minutes on the PS2.

I would reccomend it to everyone!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Missing the Magic","review":"This game has good graphics, but lacks sufficient challenges. Furthermore, the game lacked options for exploring the many levels it has to offer.

They are challenging without being so hard that they can't be solved by humans.

I would have appreciated a bit better graphics on some of the people but other than that, this is a very fun and engaging game for all ages."},{"rating":"2","title":"Harry Potter and the Sorcerss Stone","review":"This is the best Harry Potter game so far. The best part of it is playing quidditch. Hint: to open some of the pictures talk to the two boys and they'll tell you give them every flavored beans and they'll tell you the password.

I was a bit nervous when I started to play the game because I was afraid how it would turn out.It was great. I really loved how the developers added stuff there that aren't in the book (e.g. Flipendo).The Good: -You can collect different coloured beans for special prizes (yellow, blue, green and red).-Great hidden challenges to win cards.-Very kid-friendly!The Bad: -Sometimes, it can get a bit repetitive.-If you fail to collect all 17 cards at the end of the game, you can't come back to collect them. (fixed in next Harry Potter)-Lack of save points."},{"rating":"1","title":"Um....","review":"I really hoped that the PlayStation game would be a great one. After I saw the movie, I decided to buy the game, cuz it sounded neat. Well...the game is a bit disappointing. I expected much more than Harry running around, trying not to be late for class, casting spells, etc. But that's practically ALL that he does. The beginning of the game was interesting, but then you start trying to collect beans, run... errands, blah-blah-blah. Even thought I LOVE platform/adventure games, this didn't work out for me. I got to 60 something % and just quit. It was a bit challenging after the beginning, but then it just got WAY to easy and short, so I dropped this game and choose Ape Escape. Now, Ape Escape is a WAY better game than Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone, so if you want a great platform game, choose APE ESCAPE!

And u have to see it EVERYtime u challenge valdamore (i dont read the harry potter books, so i dont know wats his name)Luckily, i only needed 3 chances to beat him. He is VERY hard but not frustrating, just challenging. I heard that Harry potter and the chamber or secrets is coming out, i hope that its the same great graphics and everything, just alittle harder.

I felt like the controlls were backward. But I was determined to beat it.

Well, it's truly only suited for small children, and they should make that clear! Also, it breeds bad habits in future video game players. Let me explain:First of all, the quidditch flying system is terrible. It is horribly unresponsive, and worst of all, the control system is backwards. Pressing foreward on the control pad brings the nose UP, not down. It's extremely hard to adjust to for advanced gamers, and teaches young players to fly that way, so it will be hard for them to adjust to the system used by real planes and 95% of all video games.The game is pathetically easy as well.

Here are some pros and cons:Pros:- uhhhhhh... (i guess the graphics are ok)Cons:- No freedom. There is a track you have to follow, but you have to do missions and kill people along the way. Doesn't really make sense.- No weapons. For a game with no freedom, like this one, you would think they would try to spice it up with some cool weapons or something. Nope. All you have is a machine gun and a regular gun.- I don't get why your car turns into a motorcycle when your life is low.- Controls are too complicated. While you are going really fast and trying to complete missions, you have to add more confusion switching your weapons. You would think only having two weapons, it would be easy to switch, but no.This game really doesn't deserve to be a Playstation Greatest Hit.

You know those two or three driving missions in all the Bond games? The ones where you get to drive something hot like an Aston Martin with rockets and guided missiles? I always enjoy them, but there are so few that I play them to death and quickly tire of them. SpyHunter (now a few years old) is still the epitome of arcade, shoot-em-up racing. Your car, the Interceptor, has all the Bond-esque features you love (like smoke screens and machine guns) with the added bonus of MORE THAN TWO MISSIONS!! Fourteen missions still isn't much, but who's counting if the gameplay is good? (esp. if you add in the unlockable movies, multiplayer games and cheats)...P.S.

In addition, I read her Salon articles. However, I could barely get through this book. I thought it was very self-indulgent, and Rosie is kind of an ordinary little kid but everyone keeps referring to how great she is. She's only 8 years old anyway-- not an appropriate age to hold my interest as a major character. This book made me think the author was basing the child on herself because there was so much emphasis on how wonderful the kid was. The good parts of the book involved Elizabeth and Rae going on a hike--I actually felt drawn into the story at that point. It passed. If you read this book and don't like it, keep trying. I found the author's non-fiction works to be everything her fiction wasn't here."},{"rating":"2","title":"Role reversal","review":"I love Anne Lamott's writing with her gentle humor and quirkiness and her characters' inner struggles. Lamott has a gift for immersing the reader in the tribulations of her character's lives. Rosie is another fine example of Lamott's skill.Rosie is a story about a mother, Elizabeth and her daughter, Rosie who are alone in the world after Rosie's father dies in an accident. Often Rosie seems as if she is more adult than her mother. Rosie, is a free spirit, wise beyond her years and Elizabeth, although beautiful, wealthy and intelligent is deeply troubled, she can't stop drinking, and she dwells on her own mother's psychosis. Elizabeth is still trying to figure what she should do with her life now that she is grown up and unable to face her indecision she drinks and often when she drinks she is unable to fill her obligations to Rosie.While I love Lamotts' writing and enjoyed reading Rosie, I did not find it that compelling."},{"rating":"1","title":"expected more","review":"Cutesy and pedantic, clunky and dull.

While I found the story line to be interesting, the filthy language and drug scenes were very distracting. How disturbing to think that someone would write a seemingly personal account of a mother-daughter relationship and think that her audience would accept this story as typical parenting. Even though many may be able to relate to the destructive affects of alcoholism and drugs in family relationships, I found \\"Rosie\\" to be a sad and disturbing story of covert emotional abuse. I would have accepted the theme if \\"Rosie\\" had been labeled an autobiography (was it?) but I found little value in it as a work of fiction. It should have come with a warning label."},{"rating":"2","title":"Scientific Adventure","review":"The book is one of three written by Nancy Kress in a series about interstellar space travel and alien encounters.The book had a lot of tough scientific terms and facts to try to wrap your head around but the character development and the story line more than made up for struggling through the technical wording. I bought Probability Moon (the first in the series) years ago and loved it. However, when I bought it it was out of print (I love trolling through used book stores). I bought the third book in the series (Probability Space) at another used book store, and then had to wait to find the second book. It was absolutely driving me mad waiting, so I finally bought Probability Sun from Amazon. I enjoyed the series so much that I read through them both in one week.If you love true hard sci-fi and if you love a good alien yarn then this series is for you. Don't miss out on it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"l'Hoyer deserves better","review":"I am not fond of the performances. Aside from an unfocused recorded sound, I found the tempos to be too 'rushy' - technically, the playing is sloppy with very little attention to detail. There is a certain sweep to this kind of diffuse playing and interpretation, but details in the music are, to my mind, lost or not apparent. The Stenstadvold recording is greatly superior; this fine chamber music requires a balance of performance pratice awareness with technical finesse and accuracy."},{"rating":"2","title":"A case where the movie was as good as the book","review":"After watching the rather splendid movie adaptation from this book (renamed hope springs), I decided to purchase this vocal book. The premise for this book is around an English character who, after breaking up with his partner back in England, travels to a small US town where he falls in love, only to have he's ex partner come back into their lives. Although this book can be dialog driven at times it is still an easy fast flowing book that, as long as you are not looking for any great meaning, should enjoy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Absolutely unengaging","review":"To be frank, I am baffled by the praise this book has received. I was \\"forced\\" to read it for a book club and found it to be completely unenagaging. When one runs across a book written in such simple language the reaction is to find within the lines some deeper/hidden meaning. Unfortunately this was not the case with \\"New Cardiff\\". A third grader could comprehend the complexities laid out on the pages. A quick read is one thing that can be memorbale for many reasons (try Joyce Carol Oates \\"Beasts\\"), but Webb's attempts in New Cardiff are simply forgettable.

Scanned photos show up reddish in hue (I even tested a photo with a green rug--it turned out reddish as well) and the colors are a bit washed-out. Printing directly from a digital photo does not solve the problem, as those prints have the same red problem.

For the most part, it has worked out alright in that it offered basic performance. I did not wind up using it to scan pictures on a normal basis, but when I did it worked well for that purpose. On the other hand, it seems like there were always technical issues with this printer. It also uses a ton of ink, which is expensive. I'm looking for a new printer now because the roller feed has stopped working properly and, after contacting Epson for support, I was told that I can either 1) drive 30 minutes across town to their sole certified printer repair specialist for a cost of approximately $80, or 2) take advantage of their replacement discount program and but a new Canon printer at a whopping discount.

With all of the printer options on the market, go and chose something else. Why did I buy it in the first place? Good question. I bought it at an Apple store when I purchased an I-MAC. The price of the printer was $[...], but with a $[...] rebate. So, it theoretically cost zero, right? Wrong.

I'm very happy with it. I use it with my Mac. Oh, and I read a good review on this on Consumer Reports, this is why I purchased it to begin with."},{"rating":"2","title":"Top Notch","review":"I have nothing but praise for the Canon MP460. Set up was quick and easy. From the very start, the print quality has been excellent. I have not experienced any of the problems I read from earlier reviews (heavy red tint, etc.). I use this for normal everyday use -- color graphics, photos, and general text printing. I have used various papers of differing grades and weights. All worked flawlessly. Photograph print quality rivals anything I have seen from more expensive HP and Epson photo printers. The scanning function works wonderfully and the photocopy quality is fine (though a bit faint at times) for a smaller machine. This all-in-one gives great value for the price paid. I have only one complaint -- the replacement ink cartridges have not come down in price compared to others in the market. Though the MP460 is not an ink hog, replacement inks will be pricey for a while."},{"rating":"2","title":"great printer, but not as cheap per page as I hoped","review":"I've had this about a month. It's easy to use, and prints GREAT photos--really impressive to me (though I'm admittedly no pro). Better than the HP I was using before, though that was at least a couple years old. Copies are fine. I haven't tried the scanner yet. Doesn't take up a ton of room on my desk (budget a little less than 2 feet by 2 feet). Not too noisy, reasonably quick. My only complaint is that it doesn't get the low price/page of B/W printing I was hoping for. I read somewhere (CNET I think) that it could get as low as $0.04/page, and that's way off. I'd say it gets about $0.08/page at best, maybe $0.10. So if mass black and white printing is your task, you might want to invest in a laser. But if you're like me and also want colour (including for photos), I think it's a good choice. The price for the printer itself seems pretty good to me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good quality, slow printing","review":"This is the first all-in-one printer I've owned that I've been pleased with. Surprisingly easy to set up, never crashes, wireless capability, etc... The scanner works great, and photo prints turn out nicely. My only complaint would be the rate at which it prints.

I still haven't had an opportunity to try out some of the advanced options (printing direct from media cards and others), but the basic copy, scan, print functions work great and the price was right.

Whatever they are supposed to do to adjust the time, they fail to do it accurately. Worse there is no way to fix it, and then last week they began to be 1 hour behind our official time, actually 1 hour and 8 minutes and 1 hour and 17 minutes behind.

The price is low and the display is nice a big so it could be seen across a room or by someone with poor eyesight when not corrected. The major drawback is that the internal clock is not very accurate. Within a month, the clock is already off by 30 seconds compared to the radio controlled clocks in the house.

It also doesn't have a volume control for the alarm but my Mom says the alarm isn't so loud it'll scare you to death! :-) She loves the feature that allows the clock to set itself when plugged in and set to the proper time zone.

There's little talk about how to use the metronome to build technique (very little). In fact, there are basically no exercises at all. Oh wait, he does include actual exercises with rubber bands! There is also some live footage of Mello performing.Yeah, he can play fast but has nothing new to say on the subject. It's not worth the money. No secrets revealed here.

I don't know if Nas is just so good he outshines them (like on Da Bridge 2001), or if these guys are as weak as i think they are. Not that they lack teqnique, but songs like Our Way, we Live This and Break Bread are just lyricaly boring and have no concept. However Nas does return to old form with the should be classic Find Ya Wealth, and comes with a lyrical intensity not seen in years on evey verse (especially with Prodigy).Honestly, the only non-Nas cut on hear that in legit is the Prodigy Freestyle (track #10, and I'm not even a Mobb Deep fan.

The others made you feel guilty, becuase if you weren't doing one thing as much as another, then you felt guilty. Say you were working hard on your crops in HM64, but were doing a poor job on your social life. That could hurt you, but then if you shifted even a bit, it could hurt your farm. This one spends less time on farming, and more time on saving the homeland! If you like the farming part, then dont worry, because you still farm. The farming is much easier, because every hour is about a minute in our time! Less land to farm on, and the grass is already growing for you, and you never have to replant it!

You can't get married, there are no sheep, you can't have kids, and there is only four crops. Despite all of this alarming information...I LOVE THE GAME! It is really fun and an interesting challange to get your horse and dog to like you. The better friends you become to the characters, the more dramatic the ending will be if it involves that person. Like in one game file I didn't make really good friends with the girl and all she said at the end is she still likes some guy, and in another one where I did the same ending, I became really good friends with her and at the end she kissed me!!

If you are a Harvest Moon fan, take my edvice and get Harvest Moon: A Wonderful Life instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Game, Bad Plot","review":"Harvest Moon Save the Homeland, was in my opinion the worst Harvest Moon game. First off, no family. It'll just be you. You can't get married, and you have no dog! There is a stray dog however, and it takes a while for it to adapt to you and start being your friend. Also a thumbs down is there is no festivals! How can you play a Harvest Moon like that! Festivals in 64, Back to Nature.. they were the best. Save the Homeland just doesn't have the charm the others had. However, the Graphics are the best! It is more a game for people who don't play often or littler kids. The game plot is OK, however years.. and seasons.. are a little messed up. Saving the homeland takes a pretty long time if you dont play every week or so.. and I just don't have the time, so.. if you want to buy this game.. prepare. It could be different than what you think."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst HM!","review":"If you want to get an HM game, get Back to Nature or A Wonderful Life.

Listen to me, if you want a harvest moon game, get A Wonderful Life, and they even have a special edition for PS2. The graphics in that game are a little better.

I can't take the stress of having to kill enemies or battle bosses, so I wanted something simple, fun and interesting. I used to love \\"Myst\\" for PC, so I was looking for something along those lines if not simpler. I have never played any of the other Harvest Moon games, so my opinion is based solely on Save the Homeland for PS2. I absolutely love this game!! I can't stop playing it. If you are older like me and are just looking for something entertaining to get your mind off of everyday life, then you will enjoy this game. The graphics are very simple but the storyline is fun and interesting. It is not too easy and not too hard, and nothing has stressed me out as of yet. I love running my own little imaginary farm and tending to my crops and animals. It really is fun and relaxing.

Better than a lot of the mindless garbage out there, anyway. Unfortunately, it pales in comparison to it's psx format.So if you have PS2 and your interested in Harvest Moon, just get Back to Nature. It's a lot better.I personally keep this version, not because I play it anymore, because I like to still be able to say I have every version.

Your main goals are to bake goods, farm the land, then attempt to earn money that way, so you can buy something to give as a \\"gift\\" to some townsfolk fool. This way the townspeople will give you clues to go on stupid little adventures to get to one of nine stupid little endings to the game. Oh, and if you miss their birthday dont expect any help. Save up enough money and you can buy a kitchen for your crappy little shack, whoopie!Im sure glad I could get $11 for this game when I sold it.

For a system like the PS2, there should be a lot to write about. Sadly this isn't the case with this version of Harvest Moon, so I would advise you to save your money on this one. The graphics aren't even all that great, and the sound is dated. I'm not sure why this game is priced anywhere near 50 dollars, especially with games like Grand Theft 3 and Tony Hawk 3 on the market."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible......","review":"Being a great harvest moon fan with her brand new PS2, I wanted a harvest moon game. I had played Back to Nature, 64, harvest moon 2, and so on. I brought the game for 10 bucks down at the mall. I couldn't wait to try it out! The first few days I played it were fun, don't get me wrong, but I was more looking forward to a game like Harvest moon 64. A free-form game that yes, would have a side-quest or two. I was in for a BIG surprise. The game is mainly character interaction. The only two animals you needed were your dog and horse.Pro's1. Good graphics2.You have multiple choices of horse color.3. Some of the quests are kinda funCon's1.Not really a con...but do you see the way they sit on the horse? talk about uncomfortable o.O2. The only two buyable animals you can get are cows and chickens, no not even sheep.3. You only get 4 game months of time to do stuff."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fairly good game","review":"This game itself is amusing, and can be a bit addictive, but if you are a true Harvest Moon fan, you will get bored of this game fast. Unlike virtually all of the other HM games, you cannot get married, nor do you start out with a dog or horse. The gametime only lasts one year, in which you must pick a track. You can still have crops, and there are cows, no sheep. You must work to get a dog to like you, and become friends with the other farmers so they will give you a horse.This game is a bit harder than the other HM games, and I would reccomend you try Back to Nature in place of this game, which I find is more engrosing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Harvest Moon?","review":"When i recenly bought this game i thought this would be like all the other harvest moons where you can get a wife and there are 3 years and u get a little brown dog with a horse and your own farm. Well i was saddly mistaken for you get 1 year to do 1 of 9 of the events and you get no wife you must work for a horse and you must do more just for a dog this game was a very boring game it got old fast and was barely fun i think that natsume took a wrong turn i could see if there were horse races and diffrent events like the other ones but there isnt also you can only build 2 things a kitchen and a dog house big whoop so if i were you maybe possibly rent it BUT DONT BUY IT you will beat it so fast and get bored as fast ..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ehhh... not what it lived up to be.","review":"This harvest moon game takes away nearly EVERYTHING the older ones gave. In this game you cant do anything except go talk to people.The crops suck because they purposly made it so that you hardly have to water the crops. You cant even get a girlfriend! And as opposed to the previous Harvest moon games... you MUST end your game after a year (and it only takes a month to win it). After that you keep your shack and animals and stuff... but all the people you've worked so hard to gain their respect just forget you. And then you have to go through all of the cienamatics again.I gave it a two because the 64 version of this game is much better. There is a ton more to do and it is better scripted. Natsume just rushed to start this game up, but I do look foward to their next Harvest Moon Game."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't get it!","review":"I own this game, and it doesn't come close to its original (Harvest Moon 64)! In Save the Homeland, you can't get married, there are no sheep, no festivals, no babies, the game ends after 1 year of play, you must work for a horse, and there aren't many fields to grow crops! I must say though, the graphics are the best I have ever seen! But I didn't think the graphics were worth the price for the game. So, my opinion is, Don't get it!

It's a story about a very deep thoughted girl named Anna who is so unbelieveably shy that it causes her to go into a deep exile behind the walls of her own house. This book taught me a lot about life and how you can't always stand on the side lines you have to join in and take a risk. To conclude this was a very heartfilled novel and I really enjoyed my experience reading it."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Woman in the Wall-great!","review":"The Woman in the Wall is a preteen-level read about a young girl named Anna. Anna has always been extremely shy, and claims that 'leaving the house would be like asking me to strip off my skin.' When, at seven years old, her mother conveys that she needs to go to school, Anna takes immediate action. She literally takes apart some of the wall and builds a number of passageways within it. As seven years go by, her family forgets that she is there.When Anna starts to develop physically, she realizes that she is changing. And when a young man calling himself only 'F' unknowingly pushes a note into her hiding place, Anna thinks it's addressed to her, although it is for her older sister, Andrea.At the end, a thrilling climax ends with her being rediscovered by her family at Andrea's Halloween party, and a reunion that was unanticipated by all.This book is excellent, and I highly recommend it for anyone who has ever been shy, and, like Anna, wishes to hide within the wall."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good blades","review":"These are good blades for cutting most anything.

We were excited to play this. After about an hour, it was back in the case. This is NOTHING like the PS1 model, it is a direct rip-off of Mario Brothers in 3-D. But it's not even as good as Mario. It's just a frog running around trying to get as many coins as possible.If you like Mario Brothers, you'll like this. It's a good choice if PS2 is your only system.If you're looking for what frogger is known for, you'll have to wait until the next one."},{"rating":"1","title":"an embarrassment to sony and to playstation 2","review":"i rented this game when my 11 year old (girl) cousin came over. we both agreed, this game is terrible. and this is from my cousin who is a huge frogger fan and owns every PC frogger game. even though this game is only $$, it isn't worth a penny.

You cannot control the character at all! Very jerky. Got it for the kids, they lasted about 5 minutes on it. I was expecting much more. Do not buy!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A RIP OFF !!!!!!!","review":"This is the worst PS2 game I have play. The controls are jerky and you cannot control Frogger's movements when it counts. I guess they did not test this game before they release it to the public. If you don't trust my judgement, please rent first before buying."},{"rating":"1","title":"No Way","review":"I fail to see how Konami could release such a terrible game. Don't even think about renting it because you will want your money back. It's terrible with a capital T. It has the word bad written all over it. Don't even bother to look at the cover, stay far away."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very dissapointed","review":"I wasted 50 bucks on a game my 7 year old finished in one day. The controls are horrible, the camera is very annoying, the plot is predictable, the enemies are stupid (most get trapped almost immeadiatly), the background jitters and flashes. All in all, by far the worst game I've ever bought for my PS2. If you are considering this game, RENT IT FIRST, you will not buy it later."},{"rating":"1","title":"Okay","review":"It was okay. The camera angles are ridiculous. You're walking along and suddenly you can only see behind you. Also, it is frustrating when you can't kill those bugs or something. I'd say that you have to have a lot of patience to really like this game."},{"rating":"1","title":"Frogger gone bad","review":"I was a fan of the original frogger games. It had fun arcade style play that was a good time filler. But then when we got this game I just threw it on a shelf after playing five minutes of it. They killed Frogger. They tried to make a good RPG but failed miserably.First of all, the camera [is bad]. You'll be walking around and the camera will be flipping on you then when you dive in water it goes beserk. And the only attack is to spit a blob of who knows what. It stinks. And ditto on the controls. When you jump it is so hard to direct. It took me ten tries to get this crystal from jumping off a block. It is really bad.The only good part (the one star) was the levels, they looked okay.Don't waste your time or precious cash on this piece of junk, it will only make you regret it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible game!","review":"This PS2 game is pretty bad. The storyline is rather stupid. I found the graphics to be colorful but overall not that great. Also, you spend a lot of time swimming in rivers and waterfalls, but there is NO sound of flowing water! I played this game for about an hour before giving up on it. Maybe little kids will like the colorful, cartoony graphics, but that's about it. Definitely not worth buying to add to your library. Rent it instead if you really want to play it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst...platformer...ever","review":"Sadly there's nothing that can be said of this game in the positive, except for perhaps the colors and the relative size of the environments.Simple doddering enemies, the most wretched controls of all time, pointless collecting (the \\"reward system\\" is laughable and nothing more), poor overall graphics, [poor] framerate and brainless dialogue make for a terrible game through and through. After 1 hour and several levels in, I wound up chucking the game -- not in frustration, but in disgust.The only audience fit for this game is the 4-9 year old crowd, however, they'll probably only wind up crying after trying to get around the horrible controls, which you can't.If you're a big platform fan you may want to check out Sly Cooper instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad Christmas Gift... Not Fun at All...","review":"I am sad to say that this game is VERY BAD. I had such high hopes being a fan of the last two Frogger games. This game is nearly impossible to control, for an adult or my six year old child (who is normally quite good at these games.) Very little action in this game, it doesn't lay out the point of each board very well, leaving the player roaming around searching for boring little coins and gems. This gets old very quickly. Although my game has never froze as other reviewers have reported, I wish it had. At least that would have been more interesting than playing the game. Bottom line is that this game will get old for nearly everyone within about 15-20 minutes. I wouldn't buy this game again..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Glad I rented it first","review":"Disappointing is probably too kind. While I've enjoyed Frogger in the past (PS1), the newest edition to the Frogger brand was clearly an attempt at revenue generation and nothing more. The controls were simply impossible to use in any consistent way, the game frequently froze, and even the valiant attempt at playing the game (at the behest of my 5 year old) lost its luster in less than an hour. In addition, the storyline and context of the game as a whole was vapid at best...I'm certainly glad I rented this game first."},{"rating":"1","title":"The worst game of the year","review":"Easily one of the worst games of the year. The controls are terrible. Euthanasia in mind, I threw Frogger off a cliff into the maws of a giant fish."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not This!","review":"Not this! If you are looking for a game. Do not get this! It has horrible controls and camera, lots frame-rate slowdown, extremely short, and it has a bad plot. So if someone says they want or bought this game your reply should be not this! The one good thing is there are 80+ characters."},{"rating":"1","title":"How is this Frogger??","review":"I will have to agree with all who rated one or two stars. And why would it take on a name of such a classic?Controls are absolutely unmanageable and the angles are dizzying.Definitely NOT worth the investment!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"DUMB GAME/ NOTHING LIKE THE FROGGER WE KNOW AND LOVE","review":"I bought this game for my 8 yr old I played it myself as well we both thought it was dumb.

Save your money, and don't buy this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Broken already","review":"I just received this vacuum today, used it for all of 5 minutes when it suddenly shut off and refused to turn back on. I didn't think it overheated (it certainly didn't feel hot at all), but tried leaving it shut off for the recommended 45 minutes. It still won't turn on. Having read some of the other reviews, I would guess that this is a pretty regular occurence, and that this vacuum has some serious problems. I'm returning mine today and asking for a refund. Too bad, because for the 5 minutes it did work, it certainly seemed to be doing a really good job of vacuuming!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Shark Vac EP724-WORST VACUUM AVAILABLE","review":"We have purchased the EP724 and have had numerous problems...1. The floor attachments stopped working after several months.2. Overheating, so the machine shuts off.3. The tube continually gets clogged.4. The website given to us by Bed, Bath & Beyond (sharkvac.com) is not an actual website to purchase new items.5. Availability of replacement parts is non-existent.6. Service is unavailable, unless you want to pay an arm and a leg (for a $99 vacuum...hmmmm).7. Short cord.8. Small canister...we have a dog and a child...so a small canister that blows the dirt around when you open the machine is not what I would consider a good idea.9. Seemingly we are not the only ones who think the Shark Vac is a waste of $99...as another brilliant reviewer so eloquently wrote...\\"buyer be aware!\\"ONCE AGAIN...BUYER BE AWARE!!!!!!!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing!","review":"This is the best vacuum ever! I don't understand why people always write bad reviews about Euro Pro. I had my doubts before I decided to buy this one, beacause all the reviews about Euro Pro products were terrible! Anyways I decided to buy this vacuum and it's a really good one! I look my carpet now and it seems like a new one. This little and very light machine is amazing! Finally my stairs are clean, the stairs were like my worst nightmare. It was impossible to get rid of the dirt on them but now the problem is gone. You don't need any tools to assemble the brushes or hoses. It's very easy to clean all the pieces. The dust cup is really amazing!The best vacuum ever!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Umm...a vacuum should pick stuff up -- not spit it out!","review":"This vacuum picks up SOME stuff. It also spits back out a great deal. So you never actually get your carpet clean. I have had it less than a year and I hate it. I always hope it will just completely shut down so I can feel better about replacing it so soon. And the hose gets clogged really easily. You spend more time trying to make it work than getting any cleaning done. The worst part is that Shark products are not cheap. They are more expensive than a lot of reliable brands and yet Shark products get terrible reviews."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Worth The Money!!!","review":"I'm so disappointed with this vacuum!! We purchased it about a year and a half ago and I really regret it. It seemed to work fine at first, but it quickly went downhill from there. For the last several months it's hardly picked up anything at all. We have taken good care of it, checked the hose for clogs, etc. It's just a crappy vacuum.Also, the cord that runs from the vacuum head itself up to the arm of the vacuum has become very loose. It falls out all the time.I knew this vacuum was doomed when my super-thrifty inlaws - who had purchased the exact vacuum months AFTER us - replaced theirs....before us!! They had several of the cheap plastic parts break altogether.Don't waste your money!"},{"rating":"1","title":"terrible and impossible","review":"My husband came home with this vacuum very pround of its price and looks... I started using the thing and I really don't recommend it!! It is IMPOSSIBLE to clean the filter or empty it correctly.

A real dragg that ended up promptly in the basement."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't bother","review":"I bought this vacuum cleaner about six months ago and used it only occasionally. Just last week, the machine broke down and would not start again. After surfing the web for warranty information, I realized that I am not the only one stuck with a broken Shark. The quality of the brand is spotty, to say the best. Now I am in the process of getting it repaired and the shipping costs along will cost over $40 (two-way, Yes the manufacturer will have you pay for return shipping as well). What a hassle for a machine that costs $99. Buyer be aware!"},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT VACUUM, BUT WHERE CAN I GET A NEW BELT?","review":"I love this vacuum. I have 3 cats, one dog, and a baby, oh yeah, and the messiest, one husband. This little lean mean sucking machine is great. My only complaint is the short cord. I do have a problem however.

Anyone with info on where to find one, please email me at trickydawn@yahoo.com."},{"rating":"1","title":"Deceived","review":"Wow, I loved this vacuum at first. I have only had it for about two months and it already hardly works. The floor attachment works alright. However, the air driven turbo brush seems to have no turbo to it. I have tried everything cleaning it, checking for clogs. But it just seems to have become useless. The only thing the vacuum is good for with the carpets is making the little lines over the dirtiness so it looks like i vacuumed. And it's great at making my back and head ache. I would not recommend.I am very disappointed and feel deceived by the advertising and first couple uses."},{"rating":"1","title":"I rated it a 1 star only because that is the lowest available","review":"They say there are no absolutes in this world. Well this \\"vacuum\\" refutes that theory. It is an ABSOLUTE waste of time and money.

I wish I had found this sight before I wasted my money on this pile of junk."},{"rating":"1","title":"ZERO STARS for this horrible vacuum","review":"This vacuum works fine on hard floors, which it should. It's a vacuum. They shouldn't have even bothered putting a carpet attachment in the package - false advertising on their part. Cleaning out the bagless container is so DISGUSTING that I never want to vacuum. Poor design, terrible vacuum - don't buy it. If I could have given ZERO stars, I would have. Complete waste of money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy from this company","review":"I own this vacuum, but I haven't been able to use it for 8 months. The hose melted after it was placed next to a steam pipe (never a problem with Eureka Mighty-Mites) and I have been trying to get a replacement hose from Euro-Pro ever since. Their fulfillment company cannot help: they can only ship when the manufacturer provides them with inventory. I have 9 postcards stating that the item will be shipped in 3-4 weeks. This was my first purchase of a Euro-Pro product and I will never buy another."},{"rating":"1","title":"A big disapointment!","review":"Useless machine if you have a carpet or a rug. I have small bold rug and the vacuum did not do the job right because of its revolutionary air brush, which is the most useless feature of this unit. The manual suggests to clean the brush as often as possible to keep the brush spinning that came to me as a surprise 'cause the brush hair bunches are getting pulled very easily and in the first 20 minutes of use and 3 cleanups I lost 3 brushes and there is no way they can be put back. Although the machine is useless, it looks good and easy to move around."},{"rating":"1","title":"Frustrating waste of time","review":"We've spent more money buying replacement hoses and parts for this vacuum than we spent buying it in the first place. The electric connection to the carpet sweeper head is incredibly sensitive. We've had to contort and bend the thing into all sorts of positions, just to get it to run. As others have noted, the suction is terrible. You can be looking at a piece of lint, run the vacuum right over it, and nothing happens. DO NOT BUY THIS VACUUM!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A Piece of junk","review":"This vacuum is terrible. The floor attachments suck. One of them attaches to the hose at the wrong angle for a normal bipedal human so I have to crouch down to use it. Emptying it is a nightmare. I have allergies so I can't even do it, I have to wait for my husband to come home. The filter constantly clogs up and has to be cleaned; a process that even makes my cat sneeze.After a year it has also lost a lot of suction power.Don't buy it. Spend more on a better quality machine then you won't be replacing it a year later."},{"rating":"2","title":"empty it regularly: it won't turn on if it gets too full","review":"Several other reviewers have complained that their machine suddenly stopped working. That happened to me recently and I checked the canister, found it was full (I couldn't believe how quickly it filled up, but I have two cats and this thing picks up a lot of fur) but once I dumped it out it worked again just fine. Perhaps it's a safety feature to not turn on if the canister is full, so before you haul yours to a repair shop or worse, throw it away, try emptying it out. I've had mine for a couple of years and it still works pretty well. I used to have a Dyson when I lived in Japan and loved it, but the motor burned out after I brought it here because it wasn't designed for U.S. power (higher than Japan). I'd buy one again if it weren't for the price. This is a decent substitute. I love not having to change bags."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Shark Stealth","review":"I purchased the Shark Stealth from Canadian Tire and paid $200 Canadian for it. The unit that I have is a little different from the one Amazon is selling in that mine has an electric powerhead which is very powerful. The only flaw with it is that the hose is cheaply built and very short. The vacuum worked fine for 2 months and then the powerhead stopped working. I knew that it was an electrical problem with the hose, since moving the hose would start it up. So using my electrical skills and a car-wash type vacuum hose, I changed the hose on the Shark vacuum and it works amazing. I ran a piece of wire through the hose so the powerhead would get power. It is now a perfect vacuum. I suggest that the manufacturer use a higher quality and longer hose."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the money ...","review":"Light weight, easy to handle, but the major flaw is that it doesn't really pick up anything ... this vacuum is just a very poor performer in what it is supposed to do ..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Infotainment for kids","review":"1.

The caprices by Rode are not just \\"etudes\\" for students in intermediate to advanced levels, but are solid art works that many music lovers who enjoy various solo violin pieces would appreciate, if played beautifully. The Shumsky recording has proved that. The violinist in this recording unfortunately lacks proper basic techniques (in particular, intonation and speed) to sound the music at an artistic level."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'm sorry","review":"I'm really sorry, but as a fiddle player, and also a records collector, I found this recording very amateur, violinists need certainly much better performers for pieces we study, once was available a record of these studies made by Shumsky, IT WAS A GREAT PERFORMANCE, and encouraged us very well, buy it if you just want to get an idea of how it should sound, but just take it as an idea, because also I found many wrong notes in entonation."},{"rating":"1","title":"Is this a joke?","review":"I only listened to the samples online because other people's comments really made me curious.

I saw Lauren Silva and it looked like Kathleen Kirkwood was no longer available, so I tried the Lauren Silva brand. I like to 'see' what I am purchasing, especially a product such as this. I was very disappointed, first of all because the foam flap underneath that holds the pad to the bra strap tears easily. I have barely any shoulders and need pads in all I wear. They didn't slip down the shoulder as easily as some, but the ease of tearing is just too much, as I only got 2 wearings out of them-----and for $9.00 per pair. I ordered 2 pr. When I paid for shipping the 2 pr came delivered for $22.99. This is a very high price to pay for wearing 2 pr of shoulder pads a total of 4 times!!! I would like to find the Kathleen Kirkwood brand again, which has a velcro tab that is underneath the shoulderpad and attaches to the bra strap. I have gotten VERY much use out of them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Worth It","review":"I give this product 2 points because the shape was just right-- added enough shape to make a difference in your clothing, but not so huge that it made you appear to have \\"football\\" shoulders. The problem is-- as I was removing them, one of them tore completely in half. I was not being rough with them or anything, and although I realize it's just foam, the foam material should have been made stronger. They're not exactly cheap for some pads to sit on your shoulders, and they should have been made out of more durable material."},{"rating":"1","title":"Chunky and cheap","review":"I purchased these along with one other pair from Lauren Silva, which I've also reviewed. I found both to be flimsy, cheap, bulky and absolutely not worth the price.

It's a lot easier!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not all that great.","review":"I got the game for Christmas, and it sort of dissapointed me that the game was not very challenging. I know, short review... short game. :) Save some money ans get Tony Hawk on Game Boy Advanced."},{"rating":"1","title":"To Easy","review":"This game is way too easy I got it and 2 days afterward I beat it. The spells are cool. But that isnt everything it wasnt what I had hoped for in a Harry Potter Game."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Frustrating Game","review":"I would not buy this game again. I was exited when I heard that there was a Harry Potter game for GBA. But I am very disapointed with this game. First you have to find your way to Defence Against the Dark Arts class. Then you have to learn Flippendo and collect your 5 golden stars. After that you have to collect 6 glass viles for Potions class. And then you have to find your way to Hagrid's Hut to collect Dittany for Potions. That's where all my friends and I are stuck!!!!!! Don't waste your moolah!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"TO HARD AND FRUSTRATING!","review":"DO NOT BUY THIS GAME!!!!!! It is to hard and makes you want to get a hammer and smash it into a million peices!This game stinks so much that you never want to play it again!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Adults stay away","review":"This is a tedious game for adult gamers. The graphics is cheap, and the challenges -- which are the crust of the game -- are boring. Kids and HP die-hards may enjoy some elements of the game, but I was hoping for something more fun. Very disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"ITS O.K","review":"This game isnt that great even if you like love Harry Potter cause it gets tedious after a while of doing the same thing over and over...Also you have 2do A WHOLE LOT before You can save ur game each time u turn it off. If you have Plastaion get it on that instead cause it will be ALOT better"},{"rating":"1","title":"Where Do They Come Up With It?","review":"Although this game is similar to the movie and book in several aspects, it becomes annoying and frustrating with several challenges and puzzles, one after another. It poorly simulates the book, and is easily beat.Many of the challenges are pointless. In most of the game, you have to explore a garden to find ingredients to a potion. Sounds easy, right? Well, you have to beat trolls, destroy spiky bushes, and find things like flowers, worms, and weeds. Although the plot of the game is to find out the secret of the Stone or whatever, the majority of the game is spent finding parts to this potion. You know what you get after finding the pieces? \\"Good job\\".Too much of the game is spent on the little parts of the game.Would I spend $... to buy this game? Sure, to hit it with a hammer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Harry Potter and the great game","review":"I just bought this game a couple a days ago,and it is soo wicked.It has great graphics,and great animation.But you better watch out,Professor Snape is as mean as in the book.You have to search around,collect clues.You also get to learn and use spells.My favorite one is Wingardrum Leviosa.(the spell to levitate.It is a wonderful game both for children and adults.It is very educational.You also ge to fly on Nimbus 2000.It is a very wicked and wonderful game.Hope you enjoy it,I did!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing","review":"I compare this game to old game boy games and I'm amazed. Game play is fair, but over all the game is good and engrossing. However, I'm a sucker for game boy games.... My wife, who is much more discriminating, loves the game more than I do."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is a game you should keep away from.","review":"This game is the most horrible one I've played which means it pretty much STINKS. The reasons are it is way too overpriced for something you can beat in an hour, the graphics are like Genesis' and last of all the gameplay and sound stunk! Put this game on your keep away from list."},{"rating":"1","title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"This game is frustrating and extremely annoying. My twelve yo did not even want to bother with it after a few tries. Not worth the money or the time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Harry Potter does not amaze me","review":"Hey! This game is not very good whatsoever i'd rather soak my head in a bucket of worms."},{"rating":"1","title":"Skip it!","review":"I bought this for my 9 year old daughter for Christmas. She loves just about anything Harry Potter except for this game. The graphics aren't very good. The game is difficult and boring. She has played the Playstation version in stores and says it is much better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Should be an OK","review":"Im not a huge harry potter fan, but this game should be an interesting one to watch. It should sell out very quickly to kids, so reserve yours today.The game is based on the hit book series by JK rowling. In the GBA game, you must survive the first year at Hogwarts. This game is made Electronic Arts game. You play the Role of Harry potter exploring Hogwarts in his first year as a student wizard. You must enter classes with Neville Longbottom, Hermione Granger, and Ron Weasly and master 29 skills that are used in the book. You must also overcome challenges that come each term, such as looking for Hagrid's lost pets or finding the sorcerers stone itself.It should be a hit among kids and will sell out very quickly. EA sure knows how to make a lot of money. There is also a GBC counterpart to this GBA game, which should also sell well."},{"rating":"1","title":"This game is no fun!!!!!!!!! I must complain!!!!!!!!!!!!","review":"this freaking game is no fun!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Totally Frustrating","review":"I HATED it. It is way too hard for the biginning gamer...one mistake...and start ALL OVER. I hate to say it, but this is the worst game I've ever had"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I expected....","review":"And I don't mean that in a good way. I was looking forward to getting this game for Christmas, but I soon learned it wasn't worth the money. I suppose some of it was slightly enjoyable, for example, I liked to flying thing at the beginnig. But that's about it.Maybe if you are a bit younger like 12 and under, but I'm 14 and just don't find it thrilling (sorry about my attempt at big words).To sum it up, I regret getting this game. But it's your choice."},{"rating":"2","title":"Please get into the game!","review":"You've seen the movie and read the book, now be Harry Potter in this hard to figure-out game. This game will not only let your kid have fun, but also expand your childs learing abillity. I own this game and based on what I know it is so exiting you never know what's comin up next. This game is so good that I can hardly belive that they were able to roll it into that small package. It is hard for me, a 9 year old and I recomend this game to those of about 10 years of age or \\"advacned\\" users."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just Put it This Way, Never Buy Movie-Based Games","review":"First off, this game is extremely tedious because the colors are so friggin dark, you can barely tell the difference between the ground and a hole. Also, When sneaking past prefects, it's so dark that you would run into one thinking it's a wall all the time. Second, in the obsticle courses and trials, if you are very far, but die, you have to start all over again with everything back the way it was, unmoved. Third, there is only one boss, and he is very easy. There are more problems with this game, but I don't want to write them all. Overall, DON'T BUY THIS GAME UNLESS YOU HAVE TONS OF MONEY TO SPARE!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"DON\\"T WASTE YOUR MONEY","review":"I bought this game for my gameboy advance and i regret that i bought it. My friend has the Gameboy color game which is loads better. When ever you go to hit a gnome with a spell, it misses and the gnome attacks you and you die. This game starts out at hogwarts, while the game boy color game you get to buy all you supplies etc. If i were you, I would save my money and buy the Gameboy Color Version (it is better and cheaper!!!)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Couldn't Stop Playing!","review":"This was a very fun game even though I had never read the Harry Potter books (or seen the movie)! I couldn't put this game down until I beat it! The story and graphics were great!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I choose the wrong item","review":"For some reason when I asked DS items to be listed, this game boy advance item was in the list, and I did not realised until too late. Amazon searching system failed me."},{"rating":"1","title":"big fat disappointment","review":"one thing no one's said about the game is how DARK it is. I know the GBA is inherently not very bright, but this game is like impossible to see without really bright light conditions. There is also no plot whatsoever, the point of the game seems to be to find challenge stars and potion ingredients. The 2 stars are for graphics, which are prety smooth, and the spell-learning (although the 1st spell, Flipendo, isn't even in the book or the movie). However, it's HARD. I'm not like a hardcore gamer, and i cannot fathom how people can say the Warioland 4 is easy, or this game. I think this game is really hard, and the dumb thing is, the stupid challenges do not in any way contribute to the already very-wobbly plot. To wrap up, this game is mostly \\"busywork,\\" has no plot, has ok graphix, cool spells, IS REALLY, REALLY HARD TO SEE CUZ ITS SO DARK, and it really bites unless you are a diehard fan of all things HP."},{"rating":"2","title":"This game is exploding with action!","review":"This game is so cool. Learning different spells is fun too. The Quidditch match against Slytherin is one of the coolest parts of the game.I thought the troll was thrilling."},{"rating":"2","title":"one of the best games out there","review":"I was really impressed with how they put the game together because I was expecting it to just catch the important events in the story but they even put in the duel with Malfoy.This game is mostly strategy/action game because mostly all you do is go though mazes defeating gnomes,spiked snail,ect. so you can get further.I especially like your fight with the troll,though it did take me a while to figure out how to defeat him.If you like Harry Potter at all you will love the Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone game for gameboy advance..."},{"rating":"2","title":"THIS GAME IS THE BEST!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","review":"I just rented the game for my Game Boy Advance and it ROCKS. It is the best electronic game I ever played! I love shooting all the characters and seing what they are gonna say even if I lose house points for shooting the teachers, I still love it! But getting to Hagrids hut is pretty tricky so you need patience. This game is SO COOL! I just love being Harry and controlling his life I just can't imagine why someone wouldn't like this game. It RULES! I recommend this game for EVERY age! It ROCKS!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"this is a fairy well game... but ...","review":"ok... i though that this was hard at first but... all of a sudden all you know is that you are at the very end! like it's cool...but the grafics are ok.. and the music is normal...all in all i give this item a 4 star cause it's ends really fast!but i would advise it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"one of da best . 11 year old gamer in da house","review":"this game is one of the best out there. it has fun levels.for everybody, buy this game(thats atleast 7)theres an impossible level. thats the best part. this game is filled with hours of staring at your GBA screen."},{"rating":"2","title":"A day in the life of Harry Potter","review":"This game is lots and lots of fun. But at first it seems far too difficult. It is very easy to fall into holes and get attacked by the flying things that you have to risk getting more hurt to destroy. Flying is hard, until you get the hang of it. On the other hand, on the whole it is too easy. I beat it in under a day. The graphics are awesome, and it is as true as it needs to be to the movie and the book. And, again, it is loads of fun. Recomended to anyone who owns a GBA, Harry Potter Fan or not."}]`),x={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:D},data(){return{visibleCount:6,poemsData:O,isLoading:!1}},computed:{visiblePoems(){return this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(a=>setTimeout(a,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=6,this.isLoading=!1}}},H={class:"card-container"},N=["disabled"],C={key:0},R={key:1};function W(a,e,n,u,r,s){const g=y("PoemCard");return o(),i("section",null,[e[1]||(e[1]=t("div",{class:"top-banner"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🎉 Your SNAP 🥳")])],-1)),t("div",H,[(o(!0),i(w,null,f(s.visiblePoems,(h,c)=>(o(),p(g,{key:c,poem:h},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),s.hasMorePoems?(o(),i("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",disabled:r.isLoading,onClick:e[0]||(e[0]=(...h)=>s.loadMore&&s.loadMore(...h))},[r.isLoading?(o(),i("span",R,"Loading...")):(o(),i("span",C,"See more"))],8,N)):b("",!0)])}const M=d(x,[["render",W],["__scopeId","data-v-cbf9d693"]]),L=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"quotesmag/57.md","filePath":"quotesmag/57.md"}'),B={name:"quotesmag/57.md"},j=Object.assign(B,{setup(a){return(e,n)=>(o(),i("div",null,[v(M)]))}});export{L as __pageData,j as default};
