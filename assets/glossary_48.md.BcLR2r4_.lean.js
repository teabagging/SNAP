Turns out this is not true. I called the company and they said it was compatible but did not work. When you attach the unit to your TV and try to play a show, it says 'please connect cable'. After I did some research I found that Apple wants to sell you their own A/V cable that has some sort of copy protection chip in it. That's fine - but Altec Lansing should change their packaging. If you read the specs on their website, they have conveniently removed all mention of the composite jack - nice going Altec Lansing, very sneaky. BTW I'll be returning this device ASAP."},{"rating":"1","title":"Adequate sound, but not as good as expected","review":"After reading raves reviews on Amazon I bought the iM600. On plugging in my iPod the sound quality was very poor, much worse than the 10 year old portable CD player it was replacing (which wasn't much bigger in dimensions than the iM600.) Even the FM radio sounded awful through it.For this price, I'd expect something with halfway decent sound, but it failed to live up to the lowest of expectations.- UPDATE -I went to the local HiFi store and tried another one of these out, and the sound is heaps better. Looks like I got a dud. It doesn't change my rating though, as quality control in their factory is obviously lacking."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worked great for 5 days!!!","review":"I would have given this product 5 stars if it hadn't stopped working after 5 days of use.

My remote doesnt work to do anything but turn it on and off. I cant forward through songs or anything (could be user error maybe?) Also, even with the adaptor for the nano to fit snugly on the base, every time I turn the ipod on or scroll through for songs, it comes loose a little bit and the sound goes off in one or both of the speakers. Then I have to reposition it.But it looks nice, is portable and has decent battery life.

I have a 3rd generation Ipod Nano, 8GB. It worked for the first few tracks then started skipping. I know it is not my Ipods fault because we have another speaker in the house that doesnt make my ipod skip. Also, the only buttons on the remote that worked were the Power buttons and the volume buttons. It did not work to change the song forward or backwards. However, my boyfriend has a classic 30GB ipod and the remote worked perfectly on his Ipod.I returned this for a new one, thinking it was just that speaker. Same EXACT problems. I even got a new remote from Altec Lansing, who sent me a new remote for free.I really wish this had worked for me, because it looks nice, the sound was fine, but in the end the remote didnt work and above all, it skipped!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Stopped working -- twice.","review":"I love what this unit should do...........but my first one stopped working within the first 30 days and when I tried again with a replacement..........that one did the SAME THING within 3 months. :("},{"rating":"1","title":"Stopped working...twice","review":"I bought this iPod audio system.

But at $300, the Bose unit was too rich for my blood and I've found this Altec Lansing system to be absolutely excellent at one-third the price of the Bose (I saw the iM600 for $99 at Costco recently). The sound on the iM600 is crystal clear and has enough presence to fill smaller rooms, like a kitchen or bedroom. I would say the bass response is a bit less than advertised but still adequate. You can help bass response substantially by placing the unit against a wall, or better yet, in a corner. Even though an ad for a subwoofer is inserted into the packaging, according to Altec Lansing, that unit is no longer available. The controls are straight-forward and the mount for the iPod is well-integrated and protected. Bottom line: At $100, the Altec Lansing iM600 is the best iPod sound system available for the price."},{"rating":"2","title":"Portable with Amazing Sound","review":"I love this speaker set for my Ipod Nano. I'm giving it four stars because the first two I purchased were defective and had to be exchanged. In the first unit, the battery wouldn't charge up. In the second unit, the speakers wouldn't work. But third time's a charm! I've been using this unit for several weeks. The sound is full with rich base tones and clear quality, even at higher volumes. I use this unit to teach indoor and outdoor fitness classes. I also use it at home. It sounds great in all locations! I compared the Altec Lansing to similar products at Circuit City, Target and Best Buy. I found it sounds MUCH better than the others. The Altec Lansing folds up easily, it's light, and can last up to five hours on built-in portable power (no batteries to buy).

I've only had it for a week but it works great so far. The sound is excellent and I love how sleek it looks, its not boxy and doesn't have the giant display like the iHome. It still has the alarm and radio too, which I don't use but they're there if I need them.

CHROMASEX MONKEYDRIVE finds the band pounding the same industrial machine as their previous release RAZING EDEN (Which is without a doubt their best work) but has them venturing out into other territoies that may get them some attention.Much harder and more aggressive than their last effort this should find favor with the crowd who have embraced the \\"new\\" heavy metal scene such as SNAPCASE and SLIPKNOT but this will also find fans who enjoy melodies and challenging lyrics as well. Still machine based music but with a harder more refined edge, the monkeydrive hits the spot.

There was hardly any personal detail about Todd, and he seems like such an interesting person. I was really hoping to hear more about his relationship with Patti Smith, another favourite of mine, but she was only mentioned briefly three times, and none of it was related to anything she and Todd did together! But I know everyone has different expectations of a music biography, and I'm sure there will be plenty of people who don't care about the personal stuff and will certainly find it very informative :)Jo Segarra"},{"rating":"1","title":"Ugh.","review":"I love Rundgren. He's a brilliant innovator; the kind of artist that inspires his listeners to think. His thoughts and his music are truly \\"outside\\" and often esoteric. Unfortunately, Todd has (in the instance of this book) inspired a well-meaning fan to make the mistake of publishing a saccharine biography without a reasonable command of the English language. There are some interesting facts contained in the text, but plan on heavy fatigue mining for these gems. You'll feel you've been bludgeoned by James' constant search for big words and synonyms in an effort to sound educated.Reading this was a truly painful experience."},{"rating":"2","title":"great book but it fell apart only after reading the first 5 pages, the glue must be old.","review":"As i read through the whole pbbok the pages just kept falling out. it's not a book anymore, it's now a stack of papers that I'm try ing to figure out how to reglue it all back together."},{"rating":"1","title":"I usually don't do this","review":"I just wanted to find out more about Todd and his relationship with other musical groups in the 70s. the book is even hard to read with the dot matrix print etc. Terrible."},{"rating":"2","title":"First (or only?) Todd Rundgren biography shows it all","review":"Great, very expanded biography. Written by an author who sometimes seems more a fan ('our musical hero') then a critical writer. The worst ommision is an index of all names at the appendix (forgive me my poor English, I'm from The Netherlands). Nevertheless an 'easy' book to comprehend. Waiting for part 2 !!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fascinating and informative","review":"The people who have dogged this book for editing flaws are, apparently, wanna-be critics. Stick to your day jobs, folks.Does it repeat things at times, it does, but that's mostly due to talking with more than one source which tends to validate the story, if anything.I believe if you are any kind of a Todd Rundgren \\"fan\\", you'll find this book immensly entertaining. I am a fan of 37 years, a \\"sicko, die-hard\\" fan, if you will. I have, just halfway through this book, picked up on all sorts of tidbits that I had no knowledge of. I can't wait to read more and I can't wait to get the Vol. 2 in the Utopia years."},{"rating":"2","title":"PLEASE- get an editor!","review":"\\"A Dream Goes on Forever: The Continuing Story of Todd Rundgren\\" is a dense, informative look at the early career of Todd Rundgren that contains copious amounts of fascinating anecdotes and facts that any Todd fan will find illuminating. The problem with it is that it is disorganized, repetitive and contains more typos and bad sentence constructs than a fith grader's book report. I had read this criticism before I bought it and everything I read is true. If it is ever reprinted, it could use the services of a good editor or at very least a proofreader.From a content perspective, the book contains a lot of interesting facts and interviews and is obviously well-researched with a lot of love. Todd comes off as the Tortured Artist with a bent toward career self-destruction but for long-time fans like myself, that's not news. It is definitely a great buy for TR fans but don't expect a polished piece of work just an enjoyable one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wolfman: The Legacy Collection","review":"First of all, the credit given to Claude Rains is incorrect. Lon Chaney Jr. is the actor to whom the credit is due. Although Henry Hull made the transformation first in \\"Werewolf of London\\" (1935), almost everyone agrees that Chaney's 1941 version \\"The Wolf Man\\" is the true origin of the film iconization of the character. The deep tragedy in Chaney's portrayl is nothing short of brilliant.Frankenstein meets The Wolfman is a moderate film, save Lugosi's performance of the Frankenstein monster, whose facial expressions so closley mimic that of his Dracula (1931), that it seems as though the two characters have merged in a shorter less vivid one.She-of London is probabaly my least favorite of the four, but all-in-all the performances are fairly solid.The DVD collection is a must-have for fans of the period and genre. It is beautifully packaged and has cool and interesting extras."},{"rating":"1","title":"Packaging Issues","review":"I have now received my second (replacement) copy of this DVD set. As with the first, the box is the correct one for the Legacy Collection set which is what I ordered.But twice now the DVDs contained inside have been for the special edition of only the original Wolfman film and it's special features DVD.

The younger Chaney had avoided monster roles for years, but created his most memorable screen persona when he finally donned a snout and yak hair. With makeup genius Jack Pierce and a cast of top-notch talent on hand--including Bela Lugosi, Evelyn Ankers, and Ralph Bellamy--the Universal team created an iconic picture that has inspired countless re-visionings. But avoid the sequels: the original \\"Wolf Man\\" is the only version worth feasting on."},{"rating":"2","title":"WOLF WOLF","review":"The Legacy collection has all the Universal classics,The Wolf Man is Lon Channey Jr. his father is played by Claude Rains and off we go,Lon is bitten by Werewolf Bela Lugosi and as the saying goes becomes a Werewolf himself,Evelyn Ankers plays the girl Lon falls for and in the end,well we don't want to give it away so we move on to the sequel,Frankenstein meets the Wolfman which is a very good sequel Lon Jr. is back and we also get Bela Lugosi as the monster,lots of action and the fight between the two at the end is classic stuff,well Directed by Roy William Neil who directed the Sherlock Holmes series for Universal.Werewolf of London is OK but Henry Hull is no Channey and it creeps along at a slow pace,the first change from man to besst is well done,finally the bottom of the barrel movie,She-Wolf of London has a young June Lockhart and that's about it,of course someone is trying to make her think she is a killer but well don't worry it will work out,ENJOY!"},{"rating":"2","title":"PRESENT","review":"I BOUGHT THIS FOR MY NEFEW AND HE LOVES ITHE WAS SO HAPPY HIS AUNTIE GOT THIS FOR HIM FOR HIS BIRTHDAY AND AMAZON WAS THE ONLY PLACE I FOUND IT AND IT SAVED MY LIFE FOR SURE SINCE HE WANTED THIS SO BAD"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Collection for the Price","review":"If you love the classic Universal Monster movies..then this is a great DVD set to add to your collection.

Odd combination, I know.Hmm...hard book to describe...it's uncomfortable in spots, I can't say I'd want to live in this world, it's depressing...and yet I felt oddly bouyant.

However Pirates of the Universe is a Bisson which you should skip. As a woman, and an avid reader of old and new sci-fi, I have a thick skin when it comes to portrayal of women -- if you tell a fascinating story, if the story can transcend time, then I'll forgive you for not having any real women in it. However \\"Pirates of Universe\\" was published in 1997, not 1947, and there's really no excuse for marginalization of his women characters. Between \\"virtual reality sex fantasy\\", \\"virtual reality psycho listener\\", \\"hometown girl with dreams no higher than suburbia\\", and \\"virtual reality psycho sex provider to inmates\\" you have to really wonder why Bisson populated this novel with a full cast of two-dimensional female shadows.

Whether he was right is the question that every character in this film struggles to answer. The plot revolves around a train wreck, and how the various people related to that wreck and to the newspaper that reported the story (the editor, a reporter, the wife, the train worker), interpret the event. Was it suicide? Negligence? Fate? Murder? The artist Meryl hallucinates about this and many other Freudian fears (cleverly represented by animation). She meets the photo-journalist Nick who has his own existential fears, not the least of which is his cancer diagnosis. In the end their love moves beyond the many limits that life and death impose upon our fragile existence."},{"rating":"2","title":"and I love the music !","review":"I came upon this movie through the music of one of the bands in this production: The Arlenes, singing \\"Lonely Won't Leave Me Alone\\".I love this group, especially that song of theirs, and so it lead me to watch the movie: loved it.I cannot be as eloquent in my analysis as the other reviewers here but I know which movies move me, and this is one of them.Oh, if you want to listen to The Arlenes' song, go to:[...]"},{"rating":"2","title":"my gift for all my close friends this holiday season (2006)","review":"You will miss out if you don't read this aloud.

It is a nice addition to his collection since he loves anything with the Red Ranger. The toy is very durable and good for the younger Power Ranger fan. He loves that it shoots out a projectile from the front of the vehicle to help get the bad guys. It also has a light on the front that is turned on by pushing the ranger down in his seat. The yellow parts on the front wheels come off and can be held by the ranger as a shield. The projectile can also be held by the ranger as a weapon. After having this toy for a week he told Grandma he wanted the green ranger in the Dragon Tracker. They make a great combo and lots of fun! The rangers on these vehicles have different costumes on so it isn't like you are getting an exact duplicate of another action figure. We like that as well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Out dated!!!","review":"I bought this book yesterday, thinking I would be all set in time for sending out my thank you notes for wedding gifts.

The language is severely outdated, and never in my life have I used the word \\"gay\\" to describe anything at all....but the author does....in many many examples in the book.I am horrible at thinking of things to say in thank you notes, but I could do a better job than this. Thank God I kept my receipt."},{"rating":"1","title":"Marilyn Werner: Thanks?","review":"To the obsessive compulsive shopper who dares not to take the time to view a books' contents, this will be an $ 7.95 plus tax lesson in irresponsible publishing. Marilyn Werner has the audacity to think that any of her thank you writing suggestions would be, at best, acceptable to a bride's worst enemy. There is no better way to validate a review than to quote the author herself . This is a thank you suggestion for receiving a desk set. \\"For the past few weeks we have been opening so many gifts of linen, crockery, and \\"frillery\\" that George's interest has started to wander. Then along came your handsome desk set. You've selected a gift that appeals so much to both of us.\\" YOU be the judge."},{"rating":"1","title":"Preposterous","review":"I wish I read the above reviews before buying this book.

It is 2002. My husband wrote all the notes to his relations, and I am doing mine. Then there were the sample notes themselves. I haven't seen such fakeness and lack of sentiment since sorority rush, and the sentiments expressed relied heavily on self-deprecation. She even has the nerve to suggest that they could be copied verbatim. How tacky."},{"rating":"1","title":"Close but not quite","review":"I couldn't finish this book. It suffers from a common device in books these days, having two intertwined stories, and alternating between the plots ever other chapter, creating a false sense of suspense and forcing the reader to read on. The problem is, only one of the plots is interesting. If the author had stuck with the twisted underground world of power, sex and death he created in the one plot (which had some potential), and avoided the other boring (just filler for a short story?) storyline, he might have written a good book. But as it stands now, plodding through the secondary story line to get to the \\"good\\" parts was just too much for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"A bland hot sauce","review":"For well over a year, I have been using different types of hot sauce on different types of food. Before I started doing this, I only ever remember using hot sauce on barbeque sandwiches. Even though I have tried numerous types of hot sauce during this period, Chef Paul Prudhomme's Magic Pepper Sauce has set itself apart from the others as being one that I do not find to be striking. I tried this hot sauce awhile back, and all I remember is that even though it was not terrible, it was not pleasing, either. Recently, I was given another bottle of it and decided to give it another shot--I still think that it is just okay. It is not too mild and not too hot, and it has a sugary flavor that I am not pleased with. Overall, I consider this to be a dull hot sauce. I am still glad that I tried it, though.

There is no undo button! It's annoying and frustrating to keep deleting the errors I make with going back and forth the trash can to delete sections of the coasters. I end up deleting the entire coaster and starting over.On a positive note, the game does have some great graphics and it's really kewl that you can ride the coasters after you create them. I'm not a roller coaster person, or even a ride person persay, but this game is great - it's very addicting. Overall, this game is entertaining and a good buy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Game","review":"I have not been playing this game long. I received it as a gift for my Birthday a few weeks ago and have been playing ever since. This is a great game. The Platinum edition is a great deal. However, I do not think I would have paid the money for all 3 games seperately -- I am disappointed that there is no undo button like in the first Rollercoaster Tycoon game because I ended up using it a lot. The load time is forever and my computer moves slowly sometimes (usually when I am trying to put in a Rollercoaster). I don't understand because my computer meets all the requirements for the game? Oh Well... overall I like this game."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a let down","review":"Having purchased this after playing roller coaster tycoon 2 and being excited for the new mode where you get to ride your own rides, I have to say that I'm very disappointed!The problem with this game is that they tried to make it too realistic. I would have been much happier with a game similiar to the second or first one that allowed you to ride your rides than what came out of this game. The whole scheme is completely different. Instead of having a large space in which to build multiple rides and put in lots of scenery. You are barely able to build rollercoasters to a length that is satisfactory. All the graphics look boxey and pixalated it just isn't the same. If you were a big fan of the second one chances are that you will not be as pleased with this game."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as good as Rollercoaster Tycoon 1","review":"I loved Rollercoaster Tycoon 1. It's one of my favorite games of all time. I thought 3 would be 3 times better! Better graphics, more stuff, you can RIDE the roller coasters, etc. But the game itself isn't as fun. Adding paths and rollercoaster track is a chore that is unpredictable. It never seems to go where you want. Also, the park management adds more things to handle but manages to be less in-depth that previous installments. It adds more things, but at the same time waters everything down.The one feature I did like was the \\"Sandbox\\" mode, sometimes it's fun to just go in with unlimited funds and build a super park without a care in the world.

And it is a shocking story of the corporate greed, racial prejudice, paranoia, and deceit, which are the historical roots of this government stance.Mr. Ford, a retired investigative reporter, offers $50,000 to anyone who can prove that marijuana is not medicine, and after reading this book, one can see why not even the government could stand up to his challenge.

The second set had TWO loose discs (also scratched). I opened the third set in the store and found that it was MISSING one of the discs! I decided to give it one last shot, so customer service allowed me to open a fourth set. You guessed it: two more loose and scratched discs!

The second box I tried didn't make a sound so I figured all of the discs were in their holders and that's the one I bought and so far no problems. But I'm afraid Universal goofed in mastering Dracula. If you watch the movie with the commentary track the person notes that the previously censored groans when Dracula gets a stake through his heart have been restored and you can hear them in the commentary track. However, if you watch the movie without the commentary you have a very noisy soundtrack and the death groans are still absent! I read another review for the previous single Dracula DVD and they said the soundtrack was correct and the image was better too. Bevare! Bevare!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Collection - Cheap Quality Discs","review":"Note to Universal: NO MORE FLIP DVDs! I've gone through four sets and have finally given up. These movies are wonderful, but good luck finding a copy that isn't scratched up. Because of the way this set is packaged, you have a zero percent chance of getting DVDs that aren't \\"floating\\" around in their cases. As a result, the DVDs always arrive damaged. These cheaply produced DVDs are also formatted on both sides (you have to \\"flip\\" them like a record in order to play both sides).

Just this week the remaining handset stopped working in the same way. They just behave as though the battery is dead. (Nothing on the LCD, etc) Even if they are sitting on the charger.Basically, I am forced to buy new phones already. While they were working, I received almost no interference from all the wireless devices in my home/neighborhood. The range was great, and I frequently used the speaker phone and no one could tell I was on speaker.All in all if the lifespan had been longer than 6 months... this would be a much different review."},{"rating":"1","title":"not good for headset use","review":"The problem with this unit is that we wanted to use a headset/earpiece with the phone, using the 2.5 mm jack.

But when it lists street name changes and leaves many out (I'll add the change of Jackson to Maryland to the example cited in an earlier review.), then it is worse than useless. It gives the false impression of being comprehensive, so that the absence of a name change from the list might be taken as evidence that there was no name change, when in fact the list is not at all comprehensive and omits many street name changes.

Sprayers of any type don't work well on decks and fences anyway.I spoke with Jason at the tech support line. For $16 you can order the aluminum replacement flow control knob, and depending if its new stock or old, there is a metal trigger pivot that might also be required to improve the gun.here's the number. 888-900-4857, ext 201.I like this gun a lot, but lot of practice is required to get the job done right. It seems that distance of the gun, speed at which you move the gun, how well your paint is thinned, and how much flow you are spraying all have to be reconciled to get the best results. It takes a bit of practice to zero in on it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A \\"Best Buy\\"","review":"Excellent outfit with a 5 yr warranty at a price you can't beat. Down side a poor manual and some plastic parts on the gun, which is with a few exceptions an Apollo 5000 series. The plastic parts can be replaced with Apollo parts, I ordered an alloy flow adjuster and stainless trigger pin with screws from Advanced Machinery for much less than the plastic parts from CH. They also have a manual to download that is much better than the CH one. I also needed a larger tip/needle and air cap, the best deal I found was at McFeely's, .75mm, 2.0mm and larger air cap in a case.

I thought perhaps it might be a fascinating in-depth study of the Paris subway system, similar to Chrisian Wolmar's excellent \\"The Subterranean Railway\\" (about the London underground). I was wrong. It's a very thin hardback in which the author gives short (usually 1 paragraph) stories of how each Metro station got its name. The book is organized by the numbers of the subway lines, and contains some nice color photos (but there could have been much greater variety). I learned some interesting facts about the people and places who have been immortalized in the Metro, but I expected a lot more. No history of the Metro itself, and many stories that could have been fleshed out in more detail. This could easily have been an extra chapter stuck at the back of a Rick Steves travel guide, rather than a separate book."},{"rating":"2","title":"These are the most comfortable shoes I own","review":"Two words: Nike Air Technology.

It could act as a good heater in the winter, if you don't mind about your drives dying prematurely.I had a defective enclosure on which the enclosure activity light only came on for the USB , but not for the eSata interface. I had to get it replaced.The eSata cables are too short. This may be due to the eSata specification. Too bad, since the eSata runs almost twice as fast as USB 2.0.IMO, it is only acceptable to use this enclosure for limited periods of time for backups. Don't leave this on 24/7."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hot item: Vantec Nexstar3 3.5 Enclosure USB 2.0 blue","review":"I bought this enclosure and had some difficulty folding the parallel cable tight enough to allow the cover to close. Also, the enclosure came with the LED cable detached, so I had to carefully look at the very dark photo to see how it should be attached. After getting it going I noticed that in a horizontal orientation, it ran extremely hot. In a vertical orientation it ran hotter than is good for longevity of the drive and electronics. Within 24 hours, the LED burned out. The case is very slippery on most surfaces, creating the possibility of the device falling off one's desk. Drilling some vent holes in the metal case could help with the overheating problem. Overall, the design and quality control are below acceptable, but the appearance is good.Donald Gudehus"},{"rating":"1","title":"Beauty is Only skin deep","review":"The case is attractive however, the benefits of this case ends there. I expected better from Vantec. I purchased the case to serve as my backup drive to backup my Windows Home Server drive which has reliability issues. The first problem is no fan, second problem is that the eSata functionality doesn't work when used with Sata I controllers. I tried two different machines with Sata I (150 MBs) and the system would not recognize the drive. One (intel controller) saw the drive but the system hung when trying to format the drive so this thing is useless to me. I already had a USB case (with fan) that cost me $13.00. I will be returning this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Serious heat problem and poor quality","review":"I just got mine and was immediately disappointed with the cheap quality. The eSATA connector is mis-aligned and will not work. The power supply is weak and has trouble spinning up a 4 platter 400GB drive consistently. After one hour of use I pulled the drive out to check on the heat and it was way too hot. I work for a drive manufacturer and can guarantee a shortened life for any drive running inside this box. The case is aluminum but there is no conductive path to pull the heat from the drive to the case. It also has a solid metal cover over the circuit board that holds in more heat. Don't even think of wasting your money on this!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent for the price","review":"Prospective buyers will want to take note that the negative reviews are quite old. That said, I combined this enclosure with a WD Caviar Green WD15EARS 1.5TB, 64MB Cache drive. It runs VERY cool and almost completely silent. I have no issues with eSATA, it is fully plug and play the same as USB, at least with Windows 7. No reboot required. I was able to copy 20gb of data in less than 10 minutes over eSATA. The unit's construction is solid, especially given the low price point. And you can't beat that electric blue color! All the cables are included, as is a eSATA slot adapter for a full PC.

Still, I found this novel does justice to the harshness of living on the remote Maine coast, evoking sounds and sights, and even smells to mind that coincide with the mood of the main character - Peter.

You can usually only solo effectively up into the 20s but that also depends on the class you are playing.The reason I only gave it 2 stars though is because I didnt find out many things that were important until after playing for hours and hours."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Waste your money!","review":"I'm thankful I was given this game as a gift, because I would be seriously upset if I had paid money for this. First off, Sony was too cheap to actually give you all the discs you need to install this software and you have to spend hours downloading the rest of the program from their website. Second, you have to pay $12.95 per month to have the honor to play this game, NOT a small fee. And when you finally get to the point when you can play the game, it lacks direction and has akward controls. But don't worry, you'll be disconnected every fifteen minutes so you won't have to waste your time on this game.What I don't understand is how Sony expects people to buy this game when you can purchase many other similar games (Diablo 2, Baldur's Gate) that you can play online for no additional cost (or play wihtout having to log on at all).

They refuse to deal with your complaints in a expidient manner. The system is set up so that all issues are handled in game. There is no contact made outside of the game.. no email help.. no telephone help.. nothing.. you really are in their world now when you play this game and their world is a dictatorship.

It became mind-numbingly dull. I only managed to make it to lvl 5 before I couldn't take anymore.The game has a great concept and the graphics look very nice. I enjoyed playing in a world full of other real people that I could actually interact with. The huge downside is that there is little variety to keep things fresh and interesting. I spent hours upon hours running around killing rats and snakes and whatnot. I would find a rat, hit the \\"attack\\" key and watch the battle unfold.

In order to advance in this cyber-world, you need to be able and willing to devote HUNDREDS or THOUSANDS of hours to play it, far more than a casual player like myself cares to commit.Less than halfway through the game ceases to be much fun and becomes tedious. In my opinion this is because the designers decided to concentrate on making the game difficult instead of fun."},{"rating":"1","title":"For those that have too much time on thier hands.","review":"Everquest provided me with enjoyment throughout the lower levels of my character's life, but as time went on, reality set in. Basically it becomes a quest for money and equipment. You will sit in one spot killing the same monster over and over again for hours in hopes of gaining a bit of experiance points. Should you die, you lose experiance and all those hours of \\"camping\\" were for nothing. At higher levels it is impossible to play the game solo and gain anything from it. You will be required to make friends with people and hope they \\"allow\\" you to join a party in order to gain experiance and loot.

If you have alot of time on your hands, play EverQuest.. otherwise, look to the \\"other\\" online RPG."},{"rating":"1","title":"RavenWarrior From Prexus Server","review":"Like many RPG addicts, I chose to ignore the warnings and go ahead and get EverQuest. After the initial ooo's and aaaah's wore down, I realized one horrible fact. The online gaming community that Verant has going on is horrible. The players treat each other with little or no regard, and Verant staff do nothing about it. And if you want to say the heck with them and solo, FORGET IT. There is such a horrible gap in the creature/zone level that even if you are lucky and can kill a yellow con on your own, a red con comes along, agro's on you, and you are dead. Save your hard earned money and seek elsewhere for an enjoyable experience. Wait for Icewind Dale or Diablo 2."},{"rating":"1","title":"EverLevel would be a more appropriate name...","review":"EverQuest consists of wonderful graphics, an easy to use interface, and an addiction factor somewhat steeper than crack. At first I had a wonderful time playing, but then after time the only true goal of the game seemed to be to move your little \\"Experience Bar\\" up to get to the next Level, then repeat. It's major sufferings as a massively multiplayer online game (no roleplaying to it) are in part how incredibly impersonal it is compared to other online games, and the inability to adventure with friends whom have somewhat more advanced characters. There are just too many other online games out there, similar but superior than EQ. If you pick it up, be sure to watch it... games like these are VERY addictive."},{"rating":"2","title":"Still the most fun game I have ever played.","review":"I admit I am addicted. I always loved MUDs. EverQuest is simply the best MUD ever made. It has some drawbacks, overcrowding, bugs, quests which are simply kill these monsters and bring back these things for a prize, but the number one problem is time commitment.Oh, EQ plays fine on slower hardware (200MHz Pentiums and 28.8 modems), but it needs at least Voodoo 2 level video performance.This game has consumed nearly all of my free time in the past year!

I look forward to the Kunark addition and will buy it ASAP."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great game!","review":"Well, it might not be the best game in the world but EverQuest has a lot of expantions, and a lot of people play it.

I could list the things I hated about this game, but I'm going to save the energy. One thing I must mention is that the gameplay is crap.

The animation is quite good, with nice use of shadows, and some neat 3d effects too. The story is just as outrageous as the one in the movie, but it's tighter, and makes more sense, and fortunatly the surprisingly whiney, and irritating \\"Re-Vamp\\" of Dracula they did in the live action movie is nowhere to be found here - which is good, since he was by far the worst thing about the otherwise fun movie. There is lots of action, much of it violent with a fair amount of blood splattering about. The extras are enjoyable as well, with good making of type stuff. Overall, I enjoyed this show, now if only they'd do another featuring the Wolf Man, who RULED in the Movie!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Uh, not so good","review":"While some of the scenes were breath-taking, the animation beautiful, the action well-done, and the actors from the movie voiced their characters in this short, the plot and story were completely lacking.

Enjoyable.","review":"The Isles is a fascinating look at the history of England, Wales, Scotland, and Ireland. Some may opine that the subject matter is much too vast for one volume, but Norman Davies succeeds in what he sets out to do. While some very historic personages and events receive limited exposure, The Isles, as an overview, is well worth the read. The book hits the doldrums nearly two-thirds through, but this doesn't diminish the value of reading this one from cover to cover."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Pedantic By Miles","review":"Davies starts out the book with a silly discussion of names of palce sin the isles and then goes on to impose a brand new nomeclature because of some academic argument that no reasonable reader will care about. This issue then persists throughout the book. I ordered this from the UK months ago because I was so eager to get it. This issue so bogged me down that I abandoned the book hal;fway through, something I never do. It's a shame because this is a comprehensive and valuable book in many ways."},{"rating":"2","title":"Polemic, yes; History, maybe.","review":"Norman Davies' last book, on the history of Europe, was perhaps the best book of its kind. It is that admiration and enjoyment from reading that last book which led me to pick up this one, on the history associated with the British Isles. However, I would characterize this book as being a much better assertion of a very persuasively argued point of view about history of the British Isles than a telling of history. This was not the flaw of his last opus magnum. There are many typos in the first edition which i picked up and read with great excitement; but viewed in light of how I have characterized the book, even the typos are amusingly ideosyncratic. Ultimately, this is an ideosyncratic book, one that should be read after considerable prior exposure to the history of Britain and the British sensibility.

(and as an aside on the last point, there has been long and agonizing debate in library circles about which term should be used and for what geographic part, not a simple error as Davies would like to prove). Why illustrate historical events with romanticized paintings from later times? Why disect other historians' views of history instead of writing something new? Why stud the text with references to contemporary items such as the movie Braveheart or the Irish singing group incorrectly called The Corries?

'The Isles' is hundreds of pages of arguing whether the Saxons should really be referred to as Saxons, what the pre-Celts might have called their island home (why bother?), and a drudging list of heads-of-state through the centuries.

Tried my lens on a another camera body in the store and it locks up on that body. Nikon does not stand by their warranty. This has dragged out over a period of two months and many phone calls. Nikon told me before sending the camera back for a 3rd time that they would replace the lens. They didn't. NIKON IS NOT THE COMPANY THEY USED TO BE."},{"rating":"1","title":"Focus Issues","review":"I'm using this lens with D90 and noticed that the auto-focus fails more often than not. I was surprised with the low quality construction of this lens. I bought this to replace a VR version. My suggestion would be to spend the extra money and buy the VR version.Edit: After using slightly over a year, auto-focus stopped working completely(It actually locks up, you have to turn forcefully to focus it at this point). I wish I could take away all the stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fine lens","review":"Although this lens does not have Nikon's VR - vibration reduction - it is definitely more than worth the price. It is still a Nikon lens - excellent optics and sturdy construction - and with a maximum tele of 55mm, the VR is really not necessary."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sub-par","review":"I guess the product is ok. The problem I have with this lens is that it was made with good intentions but falls short in every way. It doesn't have VR, so most of your shots will come out soft, fuzzy, or down-right messed up. It doesn't have a wide F stop so you can't even PRETEND to use it in low lighting conditions. AND it only goes out to 55mm which is a joke as far as zooming goes. If you are shooting outside in daylight, and you can afford to move around a lot, then this lens is ok for wide angle shots; the optics in this lens are definitely not as good as a nifty fifty, and not as convenient as an 18-135 (if you choose not to get VR, the price is very comparable) making this lens a bad buy in my book.Do yourself a favor and save a little more for an 18-135 (for convenience), an 18-200 (for MORE convenience) or any of the above (18-55, 18-135, 18-200) **WITH VR***."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Everyday Lens","review":"I have 6 different focal length Nikon AF lens and this works great with my D50 SLR as an all purpose lens.

I have sent it back to Nikon once because the autofocus failed to work. Now less than 1 year later, it is failing again. I suggest that you spend a little more and get a better lens.

I used it regularly almost daily. We live in a dusty desert environment. I captured great swimming pool, splash photos, macro, baseball hits, smoke, weather and numerous other images with it and they all turn out fabulous. It has been a great simple lens with incredible turn out. After around 3 years, the lens did start to lock. It wouldn't focus or move. After messing with it, taking it off etc. it would work again. Now there is a piece of plastic that appears broke off inside. It no longer works at all. I am very careful with the lens and camera. It has never been dropped or banged or \\"abused.\\" It seems it lasted longer than some other reviews on here but I thought I post mine because it does seem inevitable that this problem will occur.I am trying to figure out what lens to buy for my Nikon similar to this. Any suggestions would be great:)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretty Good, While it Lasts","review":"Our family has owned two of these already. They should come with an expiration date. They only seem to last about a year, before the auto-focus mechanism becomes hopelessly frozen. The images are great while the thing works. Nikon used to stand for durability and quality, it seems they've walked away from that.

The text is also filled with grammatical errors--very disappointing considering its theme. I guess I will have to keep on referring to my old black and white photocopied maps and articles from the Brittanica which, though sometimes dated, are the best resource I have out here in rural Korea. I am very disappointed in Mister Comrie who I know is a very reputable scholar of language universals and linguistic typology."},{"rating":"1","title":"Written by linguists who failed semantics","review":"I have often thought that such a language tool should be written; now I think it needs an editor. The book was a fine effort, but, nebulous linguistic boundaries aside, the book presented as fact statements that simply are not true. For example, the Irish \\"O\\", seen on so many surnames, does not mean \\"son of,\\" as the book states, but rather \\"grandson of.\\" Unfortunately, this is only one example of faulty research. The book is well researched in its presentation of grammar forms and linguistic boundaries (making for a good atlas), but the faulty research and questionable timelines ruin the finished product. Caveat: this book should only be used by linguists who will recognize errors when they come across them; a non-linguist might become seriously impaired in further linguistic research by this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Full Of Mistakes","review":"At first sight, The Atlas Of Languages seems like a very interesting and highly educating book.

Save your money and buy some other good W40k books, not this crap, please."},{"rating":"1","title":"Look Elsewhere in the 40k Universe","review":"Goto tries to do too much with this tale and ends up doing too little. The book starts immediately with a furious battle against the Tyranid swarm that goes on and on. I had to skim through it to find a breather where some semblance of an introduction to the characters occurs. Unfortunately, the characters are hollow cliches and the Tyranid swarm uninteresting. Injected into the main story is a space battle that doesn't fit at all. I really like the 40k Universe, but I gave up on this about two-thirds of the way through it.

Goto makes Space Marines into real people with real characters. The Deathwatch is supposed to be made up of the best marines from all the different chapters, and Goto uses this as an opportunity to contrast the characteristics of the chapters and to show how they might complement or clash with each other. The result is an extremely effective novel in which the Deathwatch not only have to contend with the menace of the alien tyranids (with guns suitably blazing), but they also have to contend with each other in much more subtle ways. This is a great book to remind fans of space marines that they may be superhuman warriors, but they are still human underneath all that armour.Nice one Goto.

For a game that seems to be aimed specifically at strategic combat, Braveheart seems to have surprisingly little strategy: everything frequently turns into random skirmishes, and one who has most troops will win. Your troops can barely see past their noses, and this makes ranged weaponry all but useless.For the management part: one phrase - no standing orders. You will have to click, and reclick, and reclick each command each and every turn if you want something done continuously. And almost everything demands attention: your countless armies, towns, villages, settlements, spies, harvests, you have to tell each one of them what to do every turn of the game.Braveheart is a good game turn bad, so bad it hurts to see it."},{"rating":"2","title":"BraveHeart","review":"This game was great.

Couldn't find another Armitron at the time so bought another more expensive watch, but it wasn't as water resistant, the battery went dead fairly soon, and then the stem broke.

And the grammar and typo errors mentioned by others are quite distracting.The audio CD it comes with wasn't that good. I like a good jazz song, but I would call the music on this, \\"Crazy jazz\\". That is, a lot of synthetic instruments played in a fast manner. Which I don't find relaxing or engaging at all.So maybe you'll get something out of it, or like the music.

I didn't realize how thin this book would be from the description. I am a fan of the O'Reilly books, and their reputation led me to believe there would be a little more \\"meat\\" here.At a glance it appears to be well organized and written. This would be a good first half of a book, or the book should be half the price.I don't understand who the audience would be for this book. In my opinion (I might be wrong here) anybody who is even INTERESTED in the OSX terminal already knows about CD, LS, PWD, MKDIR, CHMOD, and MV... and that is half the book!

Effort was put into this game but I guess it was all for nothing, as the game can hardly be played for a longer duration than half an hour. You get sick of the frogs and flies coming at you. You actually have to use an ion gun or whatever that is to kill a darn frog! A baseball bat would have done a better job.

This will probably go down as one of the worst games in history. Why do I say this? The game's graphics look ten years old, there are so many bugs in the game that gameplay is almost impossible, and the game crashes at random times. However, the worst part is the customer service. It looks as though Eidos Interactive has already given up on the game. They keep promising to fix the various problems throughout the game, but it looks like these promises, just like the original release date, will be taken care of in about five years. However, there is an upside for having this game in your home. The box makes a great coaster for your soda."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where did all the money go?","review":"Where to begin?

They should have pulled the plug on Ion Storm a long time ago."},{"rating":"1","title":"We all waited a long time to be killed by frogs! Heck No!","review":"Daikatana is to computer games as Battlefield Earth is to movies. The plot is one-dimensional and does not let you stray, even to the point of letting your supposedly smart teammates (read: more of a hindrance than a help), keep you back. If a man can't figure out how to walk in a straight line across a bridge, why should I trust him in a fight? Additionally, the enemy AI is alternately idiotic or lethal, with little balance between which road is taken. The weapons range from the interesting to the downright Twinkish. The program itself drains a system of precious resources to accomplish what most other games can outdo with less programming, and with better results. This is a game to avoid. For a truly good game experience, stick to something with more plot, better game engine, and more developed player-to-AI interface.P.S. That One star should be 0, thats right zero stars buddy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Garbage, pure garbage","review":"This is what we waited for?

A game that took 4 years to develop, well, you know something's not right. Lets start with the graphics. Really very dated OpenGL graphics. If this game came out 2 years ago, it would've been awesome. Interface: No In-Game save. Only way to say your progress is by picking up Save Gems. No Gems, no save. Control: Ok, so it's like any other first person shooter which is why I gave this game it's one and only star. AI: very very bad. Talk about having your AI teammates to back you up. You'll be saving them most of the time instead of them helping you. Also, there is a tendency that your artifical teammates to hit you by mistake.

The author is one of the sons of the late Dudjom Rinpoche, a massive figure in modern nyingma. Thinley Norbu does much here to break-up some of the notions the reader may have about spirituality, and does it in an almost psychedelic way, what with the plethora of... how to say, -he talks to you directly, from what seems a very spacious and conscious (read: realized?) perspective.

It has the same fast and furious pace, and the gameplay is very good for those seeking mindless mayhem when there isn't time to play an adventure game or RPG.Unlike Reloaded, this game does not allow you to select different characters that are specialized in particular weapons. That would have given the game added replay value, perhaps increasing the fun score to 5 stars.

All you do is walk around killing the same three enemies and finding the key to the next door. Hey! It's Doom in a top down perspective! That's exactly what it is.

All because I heard Patty Loveless sing one of his songs, Halfway Down, and went to the web to find out who'd written it.

The stick is too short and you have to jam it into each angle hard, making you lose a lot of timing, and in fighting games, timing is everything. The stick is angled akwardly and the buttons are terrible. You'd have more fun popping the bubble wrap that came in the packaging. It looks nice, and is priced really cheap. But you get what you pay for. I thought It'd be nice to have 2 matching arcade sticks for when friends come over to play, so I bought 2. Boy was that a mistake. Now I have to hide them when they come over.

Gulf War is such a game. You are in control of the M12 Hammer, a super-duper Army tank sent in to win another Persian Gulf War against Saddam Hussein. Helping you get it done is the OASIS (Operational Armor Stabilization and Integration System), a sort of self-repair mechanism that allows you to replenish your armor by driving your tank into deep bodies of water (don't ask).

The DVD seems to be a widescreen version but it is a pan and scan version with the top and bottom cut off! There are no extras and the worst part about the film is that it doesn't even include the original Korean audio track! You can only listen to the film dubbed in Mandarin or Cantonese.

This movie is so incredible, it's amazing that these Koreans did such a good job with it and it never was heard of outside of their country.The movie is a social satire/comedy/action movie. I'd call it a mix of Fight Club and Natural Born Killers with a much more comedic tone. It's a very serious movie throughout a lot of it also. I can't really explain the beauty of the movie, if you're a fan of 80s teen comedies too, then this will be a good movie for you.

It is young hoodlums creating havoc on a gas station, fighting, and a bumbling attempt at bullying. The bad boys have taken over the gas station after assaulting the manager/owner, whatever. The movie plays out in the entire night. There is no plot.Second, now I know why I got the DUBBED version, which was absolutely horrible!

Power Metal with a hint of Priest at its best. Even though all PF's albums are Power Metal with Priest, I believe the percentage of each varies depending on the album. I think their first 2 albums (PF and Jaws...) have more Priest than Power, then the following 3 (Nuclear..., Black Sun, Devil's...) have more Power than Priest and their next three (Seven Seals, New religion, 16.6) are more balanced, but also incorporated a more modern sound.Black Sun, then, is more in the Power Metal side, an album as good as Nuclear Fire (or maybe even better), and much better than Devil's Ground (to me, their weakest effort). Almost all songs are superb, just a few \\"not so strong points\\". I couldn't list my favorite songs, because that's almost all of them.

I can thoroughly recommend the playing, the two instruments used, and - of course - the works themselves, which are wondrously evocative, audacious and exciting. The recording was made in 1998. All but the last 4 sonatas were performed on a single manual Portugese instrument dating from 1785. It has a silent action, a pungent bass and spicy, rich sonorities right up to the top treble. The other instrument has two manuals and, dating from 1756 England, is closer in time to Scarlatti's own era. Rousset makes good use of the resources the two manuals provide, and accidentally kicks the wooden casing, in K 140.

One reviewer makes mention of that crime, but I didn't read his review, which is altogether too generous anyway. Singing this work in English is a catastrophe. The rhythms of the music and the accents of the words don't watch at all; it's comparable to watching a Clint Eastwood film dubbed in Chinese. In fact, the music has a lot of folksy charm, and the opera would be a frolicsome delight if sung with enthusiasm and matched with lusty dance choreography. But the singing is dumpling-stodgy, particularly the chorus, and the dramatic movement is hardly worthy of a high school pageant.

A must for developers to keep in their reference shelves."},{"rating":"1","title":"Comprehensive but badly written","review":"The fact that Stroustrup's C++ is arguably the most comprehensive C++ book out there, does not hide the fact that it is one of the most longwinded, opinionated, and overrated academic books ever written. I like C++, have been using it for years, and have referred to Stroustrup a lot. Usually I find what I am looking for, but at the expense of having to go through a lot of cross-references and self-important speeches (\\"I did this and I thought of that\\").Compare this with K&R C, where you'll find what you're looking for in little or no time, and which probably never uses the pronoun \\"I\\" (or even \\"We\\" unless including the reader). Brevity and humility are underrated and underappreciated.In my opinion, Stroustrup would have been 4-5 times better if it was 4-5 times shorter, and it would have lost none of its comprehensiveness in the bargain."},{"rating":"2","title":"Its esoteric","review":"I believe its a great book, but not for beginners.

For a few lines of source code (6-7) there is a descrpition in one short sentence !!!!!! This stands for examples aboot templates, lists, etc at the very beginig of the book.

Actully if you can extract the C++ knowledge from this book you will be able make your bench mark at C++ and then catch up any of the new languages very quickly. You can make use of the every cell in your brain to understand this book since the author speaks to our mind in a very understandable way with his language,C++!.So, don't be hesitate about your current C++ knowledge, go for this book and be a great C++ developer and make easy your life in programming.

I found the \\"Annotated C++ Programming Language\\" much more helpful (that's how I learned C++). And it is free online.The \\"C Programming Language\\" is by far MUCH MUCH better than this similarly titled book. Why didn't Bjarne have someone else (like his collegue's son) read it first before he actually publish it!!! Oops, I forgot. This is for professionals ONLY!!!I have to admit that it is a good reference for syntax and sematics because of its completeness. Even that, the examples are too complex to be understood and the features are badly organized."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"father\\" is not a good author","review":"I have some knowlege about C++. When I was buying this book, I thought I can improve my C++ very easily (especially my OO skill -- the core of C++) since he, the author, is the \\"father\\" of C++. When I read the book, I realized that \\"father\\" is not the best author to write the book. I found the book unorganized and hard to follow. Some sections in the book are useless (we might never use them). Why bother to explain it?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible writing style","review":"Yes, all college kids praise this book as if this is the only book with detailed c++ info. First of all, this book contains plenty of information on C++. The contents of the book is very good. However, it is poorly organized and hard to understand because Bjarne's writing style is very very \\"passive\\" like the previous reviewer pointed out. Unfortunately, if you are serious about C++ programming, you have no choice but to read this and try to absorb as much as you can. No matter what level you are at, this is definitely not an easy read simply because its terribly written. So, don't feel stupid if you get stuck reading this book =)The 3rd edition has added more new features of C++ compared to the 2nd edition but the writing style is still the same. Hopefully, Dr. Stroustrup will realize this and change his writing style abit. All in all, a pretty bad book, but you should read it anyway."},{"rating":"1","title":"In fact no star at all !","review":"Well, my only intention was just learn some C++.. But the book has more \\"advice from the guru\\" and some more unnecessary stuff than C++; the book could have been in a more compact form. Seems more than a book on large scale programming than a book on the language itself.Maybe not really good to do, but when I compare the book with K&R \\"The C Programming Language\\", I see that K&R is more compact and gives reader more knowledge when you read equal from each book.I did like C, but with the help of the book, I disliked C++, and when I have a relatively large job, I use C or a functional language.By the way, my \\"the C++ language 3rd edn\\" is for sale, too little used, in good condition..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect book !!!","review":"This is a must-have book for any C++ users who want improve their knowledge in programming.

It is a compact, dense, authoritative reference for the C++ language.It is not a handholding tutorial. It won't explain what a compiler is, or feed you the basic topics one nibble at a time. Although it can be used by C++ neophytes, it is aimed more at intermediate to advanced C++ programmers.On the other hand, if you are a beginner and like reading a compressed, no-nonsense text, this book may be for you.This book has been on my desk for a long time, and I have periodically referred to it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A wonderful book, but one that contains some pitfalls.","review":"This is destined to be a classic text. Modeled on the already-classic \\"The C Programming Language\\", it is at least as clear and better-organized. Be warned, though, that some of the features covered in this book are not actually implemented in current C++ compilers. This book covers what C++ _should_ be, and _will_ be in a few years. But not quite what it is _today_"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good reference .... BUT","review":"From my years of C++ experience, I would say that this book is one of the great reference books out there, but absolutely not for anyone who is learning the language. For read this book, you need a ton of C++ and OOP basics, even though you are a C expert. This book could have been better, if it were written in K&R style (which I personally think that, it was the best book on any programming ever). In fact, I'd love to give this book a 3.5 star, but I didn't allow to do so. (Anyway, since in Math 3.5 = 4, so 4 star will do). One last word to all beginners, \\"Please stay away from this book!\\" ...So,please don't say that I didn't warn you!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Long tunnel to illumination","review":"I give the book 2 stars, one of which due to the witty quotes at the beginning of each chapter. If you want to make yourself a competitive professional C++ programmer, and are willing to spend an excessively long time in studying this bible, I would say this might be the book for you. But for someone like myself who only want to learn the language to program for my own jobs, and want to learn the language in a minimal amount of time, this book is a nightmare. Admittedly it's an informative book, but to shadow its plethora of information, it is organized in the most disorderly way. Stroustrup obviously likes talking. The book is like a Russian novel, or some work by Thomas Hardy, too verbose! What we want to learn is C++, not English! And we want to learn it the quickest way. I guess I will keep the book for reference. Yet definitely I will not start learning C++ with it. Had Stroustrup marked on the book's cover \\"BEGINNERS STAY AWAY!\\", it could've been a great book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unclear presentation of concepts and code","review":"It lacks a clear presentation of the concepts behind the various language constructs. Often it explains indirectly, by supplying tons of (complicated) examples and personal opinions. Indeed, this is not a beginners book: You first need to understand C++ before understanding what should have been \\"The C++ Book\\"!Also, it does not contain a complete reference of STL, nor does it fully cover STL topics in the examples.The worst thing however, is the fact that all code is printed in a proportional font; which is especially bad for a language which uses a lot of punctuation. In this sense it's really unique (of all books I have seen about C, Java, Haskell, Lisp, Design Patterns, ..., it's the only one doing this). In addition, examples are sometimes badly formatted (probably to save space) making things even worse.But okay, if you already know C++ from better books ..., it does contain a lot of details not easily found together in another book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a great text or reference","review":"I expected to enjoy or at least reference this book a lot, as it allegedly follows the style of the excellent \\"The C programming language\\". In practice I rarely use this book (despite owning both edition 1 and 3). There are many good alternative books, and I recommend that you look at those instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"one of the worst written material on programming","review":"I am not sure how I begin but, one of the lousiest written book about programming I've every read. It's totally disorganised; the writer doesn't seem to know his audience; beginners? intermediates? what exactly? He begins with really advance topics, but suddenly jumps into really basics that mostly don't require any kind of skills. This's like start teaching mathematics with advice and \\"tour\\" on, I don't know, differential equations but, suddenly talk about multiplication table. No organisation and certainly not good for anybody with any level of IT skills. Sorry!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesomely clear explanation of C++.","review":"This may not be a beginner programmer's book, but for me it provided very clear explanations for the OOPS in C++. Written by one of the founders of the ++ in C, you can't go wrong with this book.Also the author's opinionated views on program and project modularity make this book an interesting read for anyone.No computer required to read through this book. The code samples are small enough to follow as part of the text.Great book."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great book on C++. But, only for experienced programmers","review":"This book is one of the greatest C++ books. The author Bjarne Stroustrup clearly explains each and every feature of C++ and at the same time gives warnings about potential dangers about using certain features improperly. For some, the book may seem unstructured but, if you are able to complete the first three chapters of the book, reading the rest will be easy and enjoyable. Particularly, the treatment of Virtual Classes, operator overloading and memory management are great. I highly recommend this book to anyone that is serious about learning C++ well. The other books I would recommend are \\"Effective C++ by Scott Meyers\\" This book actually summerises all the warning Dr. Strousrup has given in his book. Advanced C++ by James Coplien is also very good ( be warned that this book is little dated compared to \\"The c++ programming language\\" and \\"Effective C++\\")."},{"rating":"2","title":"Useful even for beginners with some prior knowledge of C++.","review":"The book is comprehensive. The presentation is somewhat layered and some language features are introduced within a discussion or an example. So some searching may be required on the readers' part. However the index is detailed and there are fairly extensive cross references. The chapter on templates is terse but if read carefully provides a complete presentation. (For a more explicit presentation consider \\"C++ Primer\\" by Lippman and Lajoie.) Unlike many others, I think that even beginnerswho have some prior knowledge of programming (eg: from a basic college course) and some basic knowledge of the C++ syntax can benefit from (and should strongly consider using) this book. I did. Personally, I cannot do without this book and I'm sure it will be on my desk for a long time to come. It is all in all a great medium and (possibly) long term investment for learning both C++ language and techniques."},{"rating":"2","title":"This one doesn't just sit on my shelf","review":"This is a great book. It doesn't just sit on my shelf like some books I have brought in the past. Being a Intermediate C++ programer, but still learning, I use this book alot when I have questions and to learn more about new areas. I recommend it highly to anyone who wants to learn more about C++."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't pick this book if you do not know OOP.","review":"At first, I thought that this book would be the best book about C++. Well, I was wrong. The author assumed that the readers have a knowledge about objective oriented programming. One of the problem that most of the C++ programmers encounter is the problem of inheritance. Well, there is no good chapter or section that really explain the OOP's inheritance. This book is not good for the reference, either. First, there is no thorough explaination about C++ features. Second, everything in the book is very confusing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Utterly fabulous, couldn't ask for something more.","review":"Even though slight imperfections mar the book (refer to later chapters to understand the present one). This book should be required reading for people who have programmed for a year or so. Anybody who has anything at all to do with OOPS would greatly increase her understanding of Computer software with a quick perusal of this book. Thank you Mr. Stroustrup for C++ and for the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Only a reference to Standard C++","review":"Stroustrup's book is a nice reference to any intermediate or experienced C++ programmers. It brings you \\"back to the basics\\" with reference about Standard C++. Though, the \\"back to basics\\" descriptions are not meant for beginners, but it seems more meant for programmers to reflect the meanings of the C++ language and any tricks you have forgotten. Given the complexity of C++, this book is best suited for people who either know the language or people who need a \\"refresher\\" of the language. Though, given \\"real life\\" situations, this book may not give you \\"earth-shattering\\" abilities since API's are the core of functionality to any program nowadays and now must complement C++."},{"rating":"1","title":"A reference book but not a course book","review":"This book is not for the beginner. If you do not know anything about C/C++ and want to learn C++ through this book, you are wasting your time. Go find other books. The author tries to mention every trival detail about C++ in the book. He should go back to elementary school to learn how to write understandable sentences."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not written very well","review":"A good book for a resource but certainly not as a tutorial on C++, simply because I feel the writing style is unorganized and boring."},{"rating":"1","title":"If this is anything like the 1991 edition, dont buy it.","review":"I was \\"bitten\\" by the 1991 edition of this book. Unlike the K&R C book, it provided no summary of the header files in an appendix in the back, and it wasted too much time in management and OO philosophy which was really quite beside the point. Not to mention Bjarne takes some things as articles of faith which people familiar with other, nicer OO languages would take umbrage at."},{"rating":"1","title":"Help the beginners, please!","review":"I'm sure this book is great for those out there who have some c/c++ experience/knowledge.

So Vol. 2 Disco Inferno shows not a single difference to Vol. 1 but missing an extra cd or dvd and is sold for the same price and the one I got from the USA has regional code 4 (South America and Australia).

The cd skips if you even touch the outside of it. It'll last you a really long time, though, I've had mine for over 2 years, and the only problem was once when the stop button stopped working for about a month. The mega bass is really good if you're listining to something besides heavy metal, it emphasises the music.

The only problem I have with this text is that there does not seem to be a web site for it to point out any text or equation corrections (if there are any). Since this is a first edition book (1989) - there are probably some errors but I don't have them. Also, I wish there were answers to the problems in the back of the text (or at least a student or instructor's guide with solved problems). It's pretty hard to know if you're right or wrong when solving the problems when there are no solutions or answers given! Other than this, it's a terrific book.

Thus, rather than paying to fix it yet again, I decided to just invest in a new watch. After searching a little in stores and a lot online, I found this watch and decided to give it a try. Since its arrival, I have to say I love it. That rich cobalt blue face is stunning, and I like the two-toned band. It even has faceted edges on its face, which I love to see catch the light and sparkle. My one minor complaint, if one can even call it that, is that the band is just slightly too loose on me, and even in removing the extra link, it tends to spin around my wrist.

He was a brave and courageous child, who despite suffering from a life-threatening illness that took the life of his three siblings, remained optimistic, and definitely had a wisdom beyond his years.If this were a rating for the author as a person, then he would definitely rate 5 stars and beyond. However, as this rating is intended for the poetry and for the book, then I have to be honest. The meter and rhythm of the poems are extremely awkward.While free verse poetry is not intended to have a regular metrical pattern, it is supposed to have rhythm and other poetic devices that make it poetry so that even when it's read aloud, one can tell that it's poetry, regardless of whether or not it rhymes. In all honesty, Mattie's poems sound like prose that has divided up into many lines to look like poetry."},{"rating":"1","title":"I can't believe I was forced to give this 1 star.","review":"I feel really bad that this kid has muscular dystrophy and is confined to a wheel chair, but come on.

Craig Brown is a terrific illustrator -- his work reflects the lush greens and bright tractor reds of farm country. These illustrations are definitely the high point of the book. And Brown knows his farm culture, having grown up in Iowa farm country. The story is simple and matter-of-fact, but your little truck and machine buff will love all the different things a tractor does. The book would go great with the John Deere models - explaining what everything does.

Polaris reminds me of bands like Buffalo Tom or Soul Asylum and that's definitely a good thing. Pretty much everything is covered here from the \\"Pete & Pete\\" show and Polaris's quirky brand of music added a lot to any already weird show. \\"Summerbaby\\", \\"Waiting For October\\", etc. are all good. One star off for poor production but overall I guess I can't really complain. The songs are heartfelt and I guess remind me of a simpler time in my life.

I went in expecting an exciting sci-fi adventure, and was very surprised to find a tense, realistic drama with characters you begin to genuinely care about. The plot concerns the construction of an enormous undersea tunnel that connects the US and England. The sci-fi element is secondary, almost an atmospheric necessity for the hypothetical story, but the technological predictions that are there are strikingly accurate. The story isn't as concerned with the actual construction of the tunnel as it is with the toll it takes on its creator and lead engineer, and his family, as he devotes years of his life to the project. The film has a somewhat distanced, procedural tone, which is extremely unusual, especially for its time. But as I said, the characters and relationships slowly creep up on you and create some unexpected emotional heft by the end."},{"rating":"1","title":"good looking belt","review":"When I orderd this nice looking belt I thought as pictured it would be woven the full length, however it came with a long length of flat belt that had the holes for the buckle, one morning when I put it on the flat belt part separated from the webbing, this was a nice belt that was just for Sunday,was very disapointed, Dean from IL."},{"rating":"1","title":"WAAAAAAAY OVERPRICED!","review":"You can buy this at Barnes & Noble for $10.00........this is waaaaaay overpriced for this old of a book, especially!"},{"rating":"1","title":"maybe,","review":"it was just me. but the book sucked. it seemed like sheets had a contract with bethany house for \\"x\\" number of books and he decided to just fill the covers with a bunch of personal anecdotes. if you're looking for inspiration and guidance of prayer, keep looking elswhere."},{"rating":"2","title":"Five Stars for \\"Authority in Prayer: Praying w/Power & Purpose\\" by Dutch Sheets","review":"A well written, easy to read, empowering text affirming the Christian's authority in prayer, stressing the believer's ability to utilize the power, which is indwelling through the Holy Spirit of God, in overcoming any adversity in life."},{"rating":"1","title":"Critical Politics Alienated me","review":"I have read and enjoyed other books by this author, especially Intercessory Prayer and Praying for Lost Loved Ones, but just a few chapters into this, I felt offended by his overtly right-wing politics. I'm a God-fearing, God-loving, prophetic and prayerful Christian who also happens to be of liberal ilk on many topics (issues of social welfare, for example), but he seemed to tar all liberals as anti-God, and I just don't find that a helpful or loving discussion in a book about prayer.

Not by the cleverness of the lyrics or the gorgeous waterfalls of harmonies, those are BETTY trademarks that captivated me in the first place at a memorable concert in San Francisco. I was thrilled to discover a new depth in the musicality of the band. Each of the three Betties plays an instrument; Amy the cellist, Alyson the bassist and Elizabeth the frenzied guitarist. But the amalgam has developed into a butt-kickin' rock band that made me get up, crank it up and shake it up all over my apartment.

It's the best board game I've ever played."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best game ever!","review":"I fell in love with this game when i spent a year in Germany. The gameboard is different every time you play, and it is very compact and travels well. It does require skill, but chance plays a major role too. It's kind of Monopoly-esque, but so much better. It's won all sorts of awards in Europe, and rightly so. PLEASE buy this game, and share it with everyone you know. The English-speaking world needs to be enlightened!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great fun for kids and adults","review":"This is a really interesting and highly addictive new board game with engaging play and great variety. The original board game can be played with younger kids, but gets more complicated as you add expansion sets. I highly recommend it. The only reason I gave it 4 stars for durability is that the card tiles like to move around a bit. It is not a static board (which adds to the variety) but it gets 5 stars for being a game that can be played again and again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic, but there are better","review":"OK Settlers is fantastic. But there are better games I assure you. Settlers is good in that it has mild strategy, and great player interaction. But terrible in that it takes 20 minutes to explain the rules to someone. Also, it stinks because there is such a huge dice luck factor. Everything hinges on good dice rolling. Try Princes of Florence for a much better strategy game. Ticket to ride for a better light strategy game.Boardgames rule!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Game Ever","review":"I was introduced to Settlers like many, a naive player with no expectations except that it was another lame nerd game. No game has ever proved me more wrong. Settlers is easy for anyone to play, will keep all players interested for the entire game, and will never get old. I know both guys and girls who love this game. Strangely, it is also the only game that I have never won once yet still enhoy entirely. The two expansions, Seafarers and Cities & Knights, only make the game better. With the option to increase the player size to a maximum of 6 players, this game wins on my list of best games ever created. 1996 Game of the Year still remains my best game of all history thus far."},{"rating":"2","title":"Why this game rules","review":"My wife and I received this game for Christmas last year, and have become addicts.

Worth every penny."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good for younder kids too","review":"Fabulous game. The box says 12 years and up.

Our family and friends request that we bring this game with us when we get together.

Each tile can produce a valuable resource that you can use to build or trade for your towns and cities. Be the first to gain 10 points and you win! We like it because the board is changeable and the dice rolls can be unpredictable so it is never the same game twice. Expansions are available to increase the complexity and number of players. Cities and Knights of Catan provides more options for improving your cities with comodities and better trade and defending your cities from barbarians and thieves. We will be getting the other expansions soon."},{"rating":"2","title":"We love this game!","review":"This is our favorite game. It's an easy game to learn, but it has a lot of depth and strategy to it. The expansion games \\"Cities & Knights\\" & \\"Seafarers\\" adds even more complexity without turning it into a chore to play. If we were could take only one game on a deserted island, I'd pick one that had an inflatable raft inside, but I'd hope this game was in the raft for the journey home."},{"rating":"2","title":"WE LOVE IT!","review":"The board changes every time which allows for different opportunities and strategies.

Using the very informative instructions, it took hardly any time at all to learn how to play this game. The set-up took some time because I followed the beginner's setup instructions, but now it is a snap to put the board together. I cajoled my family into playing and we all ended up having a great time. This game is simple enough even for younger kids to get the hang of and will teach them about economics and the importance of saving and planning... Great Fun!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Cooperation and not conflict wins on the island of Catan","review":"On the island of Catan, you want to rule. To do so, you must build a power base out of settlements, cities, territories, roads, defense and trade.Unlike most games where controlling territory is a key factor, there is no fighting in this game. Competition is more subtle and cooperation is a big help.The rules are very simple to pick up and play starts at a simple level but becomes more complex as each player's power base grows.An excellent game for families who are tired of violent overtones and undertones in so many board games.The board is made of hexagonal tiles made of heavy boar stock (thus the board changes with each play of the game). The pieces are usually solid wood (although I have seen some sets made with plastic).It has been said that Settlers of Catan is the only game of economics that does not use money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Board Game Ever!","review":"I play all types of board games, Monopoly, Risk, Stratego, Trivial Pursuit, and the list goes on.

Every round is different no matter who you play. Each time, you will improve, and you can really get into the game. I really like having to use strategy in my games, so that you actually think while you play. The only thing I don't like about the game is the fact that only 4 people max can play it. It would be great if the board was bigger and more people could play."},{"rating":"2","title":"the Settlers of Catan","review":"This was a present for a 10 year old boy.

For added excitement you can get the 5-6 player expansion or Seafarers of Cataan and Cities and Knights expansion packs. They are lots of fun."},{"rating":"2","title":"More fun and less oppressive than real colonization!","review":"For Christmas this year we got two Settlers of Catan and an expansion pack ... we're keeping them all! The game requires strategy but not so much you risk boredom between turns. We geeked out all night for the New Year playing Settlers and will probably play today if we can drum up a third person. The only con to this game of building, acquiring and strategy is there must be at least three players for it to really work. One of my favorite features is the ability to change the gameboard every game ... you never play the same game twice. We highly recommend the game to everyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliant story, riveting","review":"From the very start, I was absolutely riveted by this story. The writing is superb, the characters multi-faceted and sympathetic, the story is gripping.Snake is a healer out on her first rounds - her Proving Year. She heals with the assistance of an albino cobra named Mist, a rattlesnake named Sand, and a rare and beautiful dreamsnake, named Grass. However, when a terrible chain of events leads to her losing her dreamsnake, she is left without an essential part of her healing repertoire. Nonetheless, she feels she must find a replacement for her dreamsnake before she goes home.Being stalked by a crazy, having taken in an adopted child, and racing against the deadly winter storms in the desert, Snake makes her way, trying to find a replacement dreamsnake, and help and heal people as she is able.I was so impressed with this novel that I am going to add Ms. McIntyre to my list of favorite authors. If you have a chance, please don't miss it - read this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Orginal and well woven","review":"When they were doling out imagination, V. McIntyre stood in line twice. Her ability to draw the reader into the story so well, makes one feel as if one is co-conspirator with the protagonist. As to her originality, somehow she finds a way to the the everyday and make it both romantic and different. The tale flows in a upward spiral and succesfully builds to its very interesting conclusion. Except for the fact that the author's feministic imprint comes through too strongly in the novel, it would rate a 9.

This book, in an encouraging and uplifting way, lets you know how to identify and address your fears. Essentially, you befriend your fear. I think to completely 'get' the book's instructional message, you already have to be on the path toward what it says. I don't know if someone who denied they had fear would 'get' the book. But if you are truly committed to addressing your fears, you should read this book. It's not a religious book, though it does believe the way to fearlessness is through, what I imagine is, largely a Zen approach to fear.

Try 'Hard core Zen' (for younger crowd) or the book that got me started 'Nothing Special : Living Zen' and, 'Buddhism Plain and Simple'. Give it six months or so of 'Zen practice' (or meditation) and come back to this book and other Cheri Huber titles.Hope this helps."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too short and too simple...","review":"The main message of this book is that we should examine the process by which fear works within us. Unfortunately, we are not told how to do this. The author believes it is different for everyone. I might have been able to overlook this, but this was the _only_ practical advice given in the book.I thought the handwritten format of the book was nice to look at, but it is actually rather deceptive because it camouflages the fact that the book is very short - both in words and advice. It takes about 30 minutes to read the whole thing, and you may well end up feeling like you didn't get anything out of it.Save your money and check this one out at the library.

I did not enjoy reading it, but no one who does can be left with any doubts as to where Frank Chin stands.

When NKOTB was the biggest craze, I think I was the only 13 year old girl in the world who wasn't totally infatuated with them. Well, I'm all grown up now and from the maturity expressed in this album, so is Joey McIntyre. The album shows off his great versatility with the different varieties of music. For his first solo effort, Joey McIntyre should be extremely proud. This is a CD I never thought I'd own, but it has now become a favorite. PS - It's also good to see that an artist takes the time to read the reviews his fans have given. Such small acts of genuine gratitude prove that he is definitely more than just another pretty face."},{"rating":"2","title":"Joey Mac is back!!!!","review":"This CD is amazing!!! From the first time I listened to it I was in love. Of course, I used to love Joe way back when he was in NKOTB. From the sweet and catchy \\"I love you came too late\\" to the sad \\"I cried\\" I love all of these songs. For anyone who doubted he could make it on his own, buy this CD and you will see that Joey Joe is \\"hangin' tough!\\" He is back and in great form. I should know, I met him and got my picture taken with him. If you are reading this Joe, I met you after the signing in Framingham and I still love you. I wish him nothing but the best and hope everyone gets this CD because it is amazing. He may never surpass his NKOTB fame but he has never shown his talents so well. The boy can really sing now... you've got to hear him."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointing","review":"I had high expectations for this cd...I really did. What I got was a disappointment. There were some songs that I couldn't listen to without cringing...the words were very cliche.

(And I should know, I was fanatic about them years ago!)The album has a few good points...the songs \\"I Cried\\" and \\"I Love You Came too Late\\" I think were my favorite, as well as \\"Stay the Same.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointing material","review":"I've been a fan of Joe's since back in the New Kid days and I was very excited about his solo album. However, the type of music on this debut was less than inspiring and didn't offer anything new. I've been to a recent full-length concert of his and it was fun to bop around to his new songs during the performance, but his is not a CD that I am inclined to play in my discman. In fact, \\"Stay the Same\\" has been collecting dust on my shelf since the day I bought it because the songs are not something I'd choose to play at home nor request on the radio. I appreciate his writing efforts but the results are disappointing. Maybe now that he's got the first drafts out of his system, he'll go back to the drawing board and think up something better for his next album."},{"rating":"1","title":"I was looking forward to this release and was disappointed!","review":"I had been looking forward to this release for a while, but was so disappointed by it.

It's getting at the grass roots of one's feelings and leaves your raw an vulnerable. This may be true, but the same can't be said about lyrics or melodies and that's what you've got here. I was truly disappointed at this CD. My 10 yr old cousin writes better prose. I wouldn't even consider putting his lyrics on my refridgorator magnet. Lyrics aside, the melodies all run together. All the ballads, which comprise the majority of this album, sound exactly the same. The only reason I give this two stars is because he did make an effort to write/co-write most of the songs. And, his voice is now more tolerable than it was back in NKOTB. Now if he could just take some creative writing classes, his next effort might be worth the money. This one's going to my local second hand CD store."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rather disappointing","review":"I hate to say it but I want my money back. This CD was straight up boring.

I bought it a few eeks ago after re-discovering the New Kids not so long ago. If this album is giving the teenyboppers a run for their money then I'd hate to hear an album by one of these current boy bands, because this is just terrible. It lacks anything interesting and reeks of some of the cheesiest lyrics I've come across for a long time. There are about 2 or 3 tracks worthy of being singles, maybe just scraping the Top 20, but a whole album full of love ballads and cheesy tunes is far too much. The title track is nice enough, but then breaks into a terrible choir ending. It's basically a \\"Man In The Mirror\\" (Michael Jackson) wannabe song. There's nothing fascinating about Joey McIntyre that will guarantee him a long solo career. I give him one more album and that's it. He won't even last as long as NKOTB."},{"rating":"2","title":"Joe's got it (the right stuff)","review":"To all Joe's fans past and present, this is a 'must-get' album. Some of the lyrics in a few songs are a bit hackneyed and cliche, but overall, it is a great album. His voice has definitely matured since the NKOTB days, but, of course, Joe is still Joe and he will always stay the same."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome","review":"I have loved him since NKOTB days and his going solo has been the greatest. I think he'll go far in his solo career. I hope, that he will remember how he got to where he is and stay an easy going guy.

It isn't bad. I was a little hesitant, especially because he writes (or co-writes) most of the material. I was very impressed. The songs produced by Donnie Wahlberg are the hits on this cd, and \\"I Cried\\" already sounds like a top 40 hit. People that were not New Kids fans will even find this cd very good."},{"rating":"1","title":"A NICE EFFORT FROM JOEY MCINTYRE","review":"I bought this CD because I liked the title track and his second single, \\"I Love You Came Too Late\\", really caught my attention. So I bought it to see how Joey matured over the years. But I think that no matter how hard he tries, he will always be known as The New Kid, \\"Joey\\". A few of the songs sound like something that his former group would sing (Give It Up, I Couldn't Stay Away From Your Love, Let Me Take You For A Ride. It's an O.K. pop album for those who listen to the likes of *N Sync or Britney Spears...but that's it. I've heard a few of Jordan Knight's solo effort songs...I haven't bought his album...I wonder if it sounds any different?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Mediocrity at its worst...","review":"Okay, on a whim, I got this CD the first day it came out. I had heard \\"Stay the Same\\" and I thought it was sweet and that the rest of the CD would sound like that. Nope. Joey tries too hard to be R&B and pop at the same time. It's like he can't make up his mind. The other good song on here is \\"I Love You Came Too Late.\\" The CD doesn't have a repeat factor; that is, it's not a good thing to put on loop and listen to over and over. If he comes out with another CD, I hope it's mre thought out than this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"The BEST CD you can buy!","review":"Despite some other reviewer's biased opinions about Joe's CD, let it be known now that this is probably the best CD out there! And despite my own biased opinions (NKOTB die-hard for 11 years), trust me when I tell you this. The album offers a wide array of sounds. What makes it even more interesting is that 12 out of the 13 songs were written primarily by Joe himself. The depth of his words and interesting beats prove that he is more than just another guys swinging his hips on stage for 12 year old girls. Some of the best tracks on this CD include: Stay the Same, I Love You Came Too Late, Let Me Take You For a Ride, and Can We Get Down. And for any of you doubters that believe C2 Records pushed Joe to push a Teenie Bopper Album, all but one song was produced by Joe's own production company - Bowen Arrow - prior to C2's actual existance. This album is 100% Joe and 100% excellent!"},{"rating":"2","title":"GOOD CD!!!!","review":"I think Joey did an excellent work on the album!!

I guess it was a good start for him, since this was his first try at writing lyrics.

I'm very dissappointed. 25 reviews on here gave it 4 to 5 stars so I bought it. It is smaller than the original factory version which may explain the lower quality reception. It's jack also doesn't fit the adapter 1x2 jack on my delphi unit. you'd think they could provide the proper jack or adapters. Very poor Belkin.

Just one small northbound arc has no signal and that's probably due to the way I installed it, and not a defect in the antenna itself.Very good product.

I bought the Westek lights to install in an entertainment center and the lights are very bright at full capacity so the dimmer makes it nice to create just enough light while I'm watching movies.

Blackstar reminds me of growing up, stirring up memories of walking around in the city with my dad. Most albums simply can't do that for you nowadays. Mos Def's flow is tight, Kweli's lyrics are deep, Hi-Tek is well, Hi-Tek. Definition, RE:Definition are obviously the big songs on this album. I love this album to death, and it's one of the few CD's I've played so much that the disc shattered in my cd player."},{"rating":"2","title":"Seeing tha light..................","review":"The year is 1998,the hip hop community is in a state of dissaray, having lost two of its most influential and popular members, biggie smalls and tupac shakur, desperate for someone to take their place, hip hops fans, turn to so called rappers, jay-z and puffy and their materialistic \\"me\\" rap, but the average person buying these cds cant relate to the bentleys, the yachts and \\"bling, bling\\" and thats where blackstar comes in, tellin it how it is, and making it sound good too. Mos and Talib, know how to get their points across while making you bump two, songs such as defintion and, RE: Defintion,combine ryhmes about the violence that has been overtakin hip hop,and booty shakin beats , and songs like brown skin lady and thieves in the night, are jazy and chillin, but powerful songs. If all yall think Mos solo album \\"black on both sides\\" or talibs \\"relfection eternal\\" are good, check out Blackstar it WILL NOT dissapoint."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best new rap album of 1998","review":"Simply put, Black Star gets my vote for the best new rap album of 1998. Mos Def and Talib Kweli keep my hopes for real hip-hop alive."},{"rating":"2","title":"The ILL NATI","review":"I first heard blackstar on a rollerblading video. The track was respiration. from that point on I was hooked and wanted more. When i found out it was Blackstar I bought the cd along with Talib kweli's Reflection Eternal. All I have to say is there is no other duo out there like them. I mean don't get me wrong there both talented rappers but alone you dont get that extra umf. Together they could kill any duo. SO stop hatin and go out and buy this cd.

I got attached to one song, which led to three, then six...like the good stuff. DJ Hi-Tek, Talib's own, is one of the most musical producers of hip-hop. he mixes up the beat (as does Shawn J, 88 keys, etc...all on this disc) keeping the beat relevent to the music, allowing for proper muturation of the given tunes. One thing-I would take away half a star for inapropriateness of a certain song in the mix-won't say what it is though. this album is good to wake up to, or at bbq's, while studying, going to sleep, funerals, dog shows, etc. get the album."},{"rating":"2","title":"TOP 10 HIP-HOP ALBUMS OF ALL TIME!!!!!!!","review":"SIMPLY AMAZING!!! I knew Kweli and Mos Def were good, but damn. This album is ridiculous. This brings an old school feel back to hip-hop. This is real evident on \\"B Boys Will Be Boys\\" were Mos Def and Kweli trade lines and verses like they're in the park and someone is using their mouth and voice as a beat box. This is what hip-hop is all about. This brings hip-hop back to its roots just like \\"Illmatic\\", but it's not better than \\"Illmatic\\" which is the best hip-hop album of all time. Sorry."},{"rating":"2","title":"Shinin' Bright","review":"Why do I like this album? Because my kids can listen to it. Mos Def & Talib Kweli bring back the feeling of good \\"social-conscience\\" lyrics. The beats are up-to-par and *match* the group. The appearance of Common (Sense) on \\"Respiration\\" could be considered overkill because they can hold their own."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Bona-Fide Head-Nodder!","review":"Short and Sweet: This is one of the best hiphop albums of all time......even after 2 years it sounds fresh. The mighty Mos and Taleb Kwali trade rhymes and switch styles like nobody else - you can feel the chemistry between them on the album. Hi-Tek's beats and samples are perfect, always creating tension and showing a subtlety that is rare in a hiphop album, yet still adhering to the raw, underground hiphop aesthetic. Especially note how the music is so tight with what is happening lyrically. This joint is HOT! Better than Mos Def's solo album, this album holds up after YEARS of listening, something that can't be said for many hiphop albums. 'Nuff said, if you don't have this one you are missing out."},{"rating":"2","title":"Second Wave of Originality","review":"Back in the late 1980s and early 1990s, before chocolate chip-pop hip hop, groups like De La Soul and the now defunct A Tribe Called Quest gave a face and a sound to the East Cost rap scene; this face dispeared with the advent of gangsta rap and hip hop moguls. The Native Tounges (of which De La and Tribe were a part) left Excailber in the stone, waiting for King Aurthor to pull it out. Enter Black Star, a group with a sound mind, moral lyrics, and enough purity to pull the sword from the stone. It's not about the Benjamins with this duo; it's about creating music that not only makes you bob your head, but actually use it too. This album displays deftness worthy of a Grammy. But because it's not \\"popular,\\" it won't win one. After all, those worthy of such awards usually shy away from them. The album's only crime is that it does not vary its monotone beats too often; aside from that, I can't find a flaw."},{"rating":"1","title":"A NEED 2 STAY SOLO","review":"I believe Mos Def should drop that zero and stay my hero.

Mos Def should go to a speech counsler to get is sler. Twalib Kwali was doing alright until I caught that he just rhymes words which make no sence together. Mos Def is a racist person I might actual like him if he didn't dis the white people in every song.

They're talkin about grafiti. Its showing how ghetto kids spoke through the art of grafiti. \\"All you see is CRIME IN THE CITY\\" was spray painted on a car. ANYWAYS, this album is really good. I like Mos Def and Talib Kweli alot. They are two of the best lyricist in the game. My favorite song is actually \\"Respiration.\\" I like \\"Children's Story\\" and \\"RE:Definition\\" too."},{"rating":"2","title":"This set is intelligent, comtemplative, and slammin' at once","review":"I highly recommend that hip-hop heads add this lp to their collection, because it is one of the better albums released in the last five years. A far cry from the \\"money, cash, ho's\\" aesthetic that continues to dominate the scene, Mos Def and Talib Kwieli bring substance and emotions to their lyrics that define \\"keepin' it real.\\"While the album does have a sense of humor (\\"Children's Story\\"),it never strays too far from its message of self-awareness and perseverance. The standout tracks are \\"Redefinition,\\" \\"K.O.S.,\\" \\"Brown Skin Lady,\\" and the off-the-chain collaboration with Common, \\"Respiration.\\" Black Star confirms that there is indeed hope for hip-hop.Check out Mos Def's solo joint, too."},{"rating":"2","title":"one of the best hip hop albums ever","review":"Mos Def is great, and this album also captures Kweli at his finest (he has declined recently but on here: fire). Really, every song bangs, the styles vary greatly and the execution is flawless throughout. Also, if you can find the version with liner notes, grab it because it's rare"},{"rating":"2","title":"I wanted to give this album 5 stars!","review":"I really wanted to give this album 5 stars. Mos Def and Talib Kweli are to of the most lyrically talented and socially aware MCs in the business today. But the fact of the matter is this is a 3.5-4 star album. Tracks like Respiration (f/Common) and Thieves in the Night are strong representations of the groups talent. But for every two standouts, there is a flop. Songs like B-Boys will B-Boys were fast-forward classics. The fact that Mos Def's verse in Hater Playas had nothing to do with the subject matter really drags down the album. As a collections of singles you have lots to choose from. But as a complete package of an album it lags at some points. Regardless, this album deserves to be bought and will bring satisfaction to the listener."},{"rating":"2","title":"True Hip Hop at its Best Big UPS to Mos & Talib","review":"Buy it Buy it , only if you like good quality hip ho"},{"rating":"2","title":"Black Star","review":"This CD is classic.

The music is not too slow and has a nice beat. And there is nothing wrong with singing about heartbreak. I would prefer that over some of the dirtier lyrics out there. That is what musicians do. They sing about what is going on in their lives. It's alot better then cookie cutter songs made to do nothing more then please a crowd.

Yes his first single \\"I Don't Wanna Know\\" was a sensational hit throughout the states, but his album makes you somewhat fall asleep. He titles it \\"Hurt No More\\" but with the lyrics, one minute he says he doesn't want to know, and the next states he wants to know (just giving a brief example) its like he is still Hurt. Don't get me started on him singing live ( I saw a few of his performances live) but overall its an ok album, but just something I would listen to every day."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"When I heard \\"I don't wanna know\\" I absolutely fell in love with his voice, so I ran to the store as soon as I got my paycheck, and picked up his cd.Guh.What a disappointment.

What a waste of 15 dollars.If you liked I don't wanna know, I suggest you just go buy the single and save yourself some money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring and Uninspired","review":"I wanted to like this cd because I love the Winans family and I think its great for guys to show their sensitive side when it comes to relationships (which Mario does), but I find this cd to be BORING!! I am really surprise because he sounds so uninspired vocally and yet write passionate lyrics. He reminds me of Timbaland...someone who is a great producer, but a lame artist. Such a shame...some people can't have it all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Maybe if he could sing . . . .","review":"The lyrics are stupid and the beats are played out. Still, this album might have worked if Bad Boy had given it to an artist with some off-the-chain vocal talent to distract you from those issues. But Mario Winans can't sing, and the fact that nobody could be bothered to lay down a real melody or a good hook on most of these tracks really draws attention to his thin, reedy voice with garbage range and zero depth. Plus? He sounds as bored singing as I do listening, which means that unless you want to use this as a frisbee, don't bother buying it."},{"rating":"1","title":"REMIX<<<<MASTER<<<MARIO HAS NOTHING ORIGINAL","review":"Mario Winans is a remixing lame a$$watch \\"Sleepwalkers\\" the movie....he copied the song from the soundtrack16.

Mario Winans CANNOT sing!! Just because your family members can sing (Big ups to Bebe and CeCe) doesn't mean you need to pick up the mic. His voice is lifeless he sings in the same key and moans throughout the CD.

He was so unoriginal by using a beat that the Fugees already popularized in a their major hit.His single reminds me of the 1st time I heard Ashanti singing \\"Foolish\\", the beats they choose do not match the style of singing, so it just turns a classic beat into crap. His singing is so blah and very monotone. I listened to about 3 of his songs and almost broke my friend's disc in half. I want him to go back to Yellowcity and stick to producing or singing an occasional hook. Sorry if this seems harsh but Hay, somebody's gotta keep it real since some of you want to be too NICE!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Big Disappointment","review":"I was looking forward to his new release and found myself disappointed. There are 2 songs I like on this album. He doesn't have much of a vocal range. I also think the songs lack substance. I think he would be better of sticking with producing. If you like the song \\"I don't wanna know\\", go out and buy the single."},{"rating":"1","title":"Now You Know","review":"Mario Winans' breakout cd is not up to par. As a matter of fact this cd is wack. First things first the guy cannot sing as well as others out in the industry at the moment ( Anthony Hamilton, C. Richardson, Van Hunt...etc. ). His vocals need some work. Secondly there are too many weak wannabe soundalike dance tracks. None of them work and are pretty corny and wack. Thirdly weak interludes break up the already dismal flow of the album. Fourthly the lyrics aren't that great and can become tiresome without a great voice carrying them. In actuality there were only 3 or 4 songs that had some appeal mainly \`I Don't Wanna Know' and \`Shouldve Known', but the rest are skippable, generic filler tracks. You can tell Diddy doesn't put much effort into his R&B acts anymore with this album and Carl Thomas' album being less than stellar. Remember when Bad Boy used to dominate with Total, 112, Faith Evans? This album is a throwaway...don't waste your money."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Real Surprise","review":"Please IGNORE all the bad reviews because this album is amazing! Mario Winans has really grown in his vocals, he's trying different things and the result is awesome.Some years have passed by and music is at another level today, so it's obvious that he's going to move with the generation. Most reviews compared this album to the last one but I dont think they should.If you really love true R&B this album is a must have. Tracks like 3 Days Ago, So Fine and Can't Judge Me are an example of typical R&B. You can really relate to the lyrics and you know where he's coming from. This album is a whole new level and it's a success.Go out there and buy it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Agreed!!!! WACK IT IS!!!!","review":"This was definitely a waste of money.

I mean he is absoulutely horrible. She tries to sing out of the little range he has, and it sounds even worse. He sounds like he is whining, sorta like Keith Sweat, but atleast Keith Sweat had a stronger (but still annoying voice.) If it wasn't for his addictive (but repetitive) single, no one would've brought this mess. I swear he sings on the same note throughout the whole song, and the beat and mood of the song remains the same throughout the whole thing. Mario please stick to producing and writing because singing is not your peice of cake."},{"rating":"2","title":"sound album","review":"This album was hyped up so much that I had 2 buy it. I was happy that I got it as the production is excellent but his voice is a bit boring and not the best , his vocals on 1 of the early songs is poor.

Well worth buying to suit a chilled out mood. Holla Back"},{"rating":"2","title":"not too bad..","review":"This C.D isn't as bad as ya'll are making it out to be. Ok so some of the interludes don't mix well with the point he's trying to put across, but c'mon you gotta give the guy a break, not every man can make 14 or 15 tracks admitting to how he got played and hurt by a women. \\"Never Really Was\\" and \\"Turn Around\\" are two of the hottest songs on the whole C.D. Ever sence hearing \\"I Don't Wanna Know\\" I feel in love with his man's voice.. So he might be a little monotone, But if you listen hard enough you can feel his pain, the whole C.D moves me. I woulnd't say it's the best tracks he's ever produced, but it's sure as hell good!!!-- BlOnDiE"},{"rating":"2","title":"If You Wanna Know","review":"Mario did this album very well. Being the producer/Songwriter /singer every song is a hit.

Mario Winans has been producing and writing for years, some of the artists he's worked with are Monica, Ginuwine, and Missy. His first album \\"Story of My Heart\\" back in 97' was great too. This album has a variety. His talks about relationships from different perspectives. You can feel what he was or is going through from his lyrics. This is what soul r&b is about. His voice is different from most artists but it's catchy and sounds great. The tracks are really well produced too. His music can be compared to Musiq, Donell Jones, and Glenn Lewis just to name a few. If your looking for someone to really listen and feel, this is the one to pick up. Its well worth it. You can be sure Mario will continue to speak from his soul and release many more albums like this.

I wasn't a huge fan of Mario's previous CD's but this one caught my attention because of his first single, \\"I Don't Wanna Know\\". I was shocked when I heard the intro sample because it's the theme of one of Stephen King's infamous horror movies, \\"Sleepwalkers\\". It sounds pretty good the way they mixed it. I'm still getting used to the rest of the CD but I do have some favorites (\\"3 Days Ago\\" and \\"Pretty Girl Bull****\\")."},{"rating":"1","title":"Avoid at all costs","review":"I got burned on this and don't want anyone else to.

When I put it in to listen to it, I immediately knew something was wrong and closer inspection on the back of the CD reveals \\"all selections are new studio re-recordings\\". Garbage.

So I got more. After severe use indoore and outdoore, for workouts and long walks with dogs, shoes adventually got holes in a soles, so we got more. I guess, this is the most comfortable shoes I had for years. They are lightweight, inexpensive, have a good traction, have nonmarking rubber sole and you feel like you walking barefooted. I can recommend it for kickboxing training, kettlebell, jogging, even bellydance (better, than more expensive tennis shoes, and still feel,like no shoes).Only thing it is hard to do ballet style spins, when those shoes are new, because traction is too good. I used it on a hard wood floor, so may be on a carpet results may vary. Really good shoes, awesome price. I'll buy more later."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful shoe.","review":"I doubt these shoes because of friends in shaolin who swore by these shoes and I wanted shoes to use for capoeira. Well, the grooves on the bottom of the shoes make it very difficult to slide your feet backwards or spin on the ball of your foot because of an insanely large amount of friction so it does no good for me in capoeira but obviously they weren't made for that. There is an incrdibly large range for friction so if you need to keep your feet on the ground these shoes will definetly do that for you.Also - these shoes are INSANELY comfortable. Since I've bought these, I wear them nearly every opportunity I have. They're light, the padding on the bottom is perfect for your feet from the first time you put them on to the last. And stylish.Only drawback to them would be if you have any need to slide your feet backwards or rotate your feet it may be difficult - but, other than that its a wonderful shoe."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent and Comfortable Shoe!","review":"I do not study martial arts or wear the shoes as intended; however, I do wear these shoes nearly every day and have for about two years. I love these shoes. I have worn through six pairs so far (straight through the soles), yet I continue to buy them. The main reason is because they are incredibly comfortable. If worn indoors or rarely they would certainly be durable enough, but I wear them outside, every day, in the streets of New York, winter and summer. They really are a great shoe: comfortable, inexpensive, nice-looking and they have great traction."},{"rating":"2","title":"Grippy, light, flexible","review":"I use these for freerunning. Very good grip, very light shoes. It's got a very thin sole, though, so don't expect any shock absorption. Also acts like those toe-shoes that are so popular: the thin sole and lack of ankle support encourage 'natural' running and walking, which can take some getting used to if you're used to running heel-toe. But it's better for you to run on the balls of your feet anyway. On the shoe size, err on the side of going slightly larger than your actual shoe size. I did so out of stocking limitations and it's perfect."},{"rating":"2","title":"BEWARE: these are Tiger Claw, not Top One","review":"In the pictures, the red circle on the tongue is the Top One logo, but when I received these shoes in the mail, they were Tiger Claw. In any case, these are nice, affordable wushu shoes, but the Top One brand is better than the Tiger Claw. The biggest difference between the brands is the rubber, where these ones wear down much faster and have a tendency to crack along the sides. As far as practicing in them, though, I'm pretty happy with them until the rubber wears down. The flatness and rounded sides really help prevent injury. Anyone who practices wushu should really get a pair."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good value","review":"Well made and comfortable, very light. A little sticky for Tai Chi but still outstanding.

I think AMAZON should be more careful on how they sell certain products. If not, in a couple of years you'll buy an Ipad through amazon and you'll get a chinese replica."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Smelly","review":"I ordered these shoes to use for parkour training because of the grip. When my shoes arrived they had an incredibly potent and disgusting chemical smell. It gets on my socks and my hands. I could barely stand to be around them long enough to lace them up. They are sitting outside on my porch right now because they contaminate any room that they are in. None of the other reviews have mentioned this, so it could be a one time defect. I really hope the smell goes away, because they seem like excellent shoes otherwise and they cost very little."},{"rating":"1","title":"Return policy unacceptable","review":"This shoes run smaller to normal american shoes.

Those of you who are big fans of the powered battle armor/mobile infantry concept Heinlein made famous in Starship Troopers will doubtless love the fight scenes. Fans of classic literature should enjoy comparing and contrasting Tuchman and Wing with Montague and Capulet... and a striking new element of intrigue.Romeo (Ward Tuchman) and Juliet (Seladra Wing) are much smarter this time around; the feud between their families a hundred times as deadly. And there is no neutral authority with the ability and desire to set things right. There are not only duels; there are night raids with artillery support. The psyche of mercenaries, celebrities, and the pride of fine craftsmen all shine in this book.If there are any English teachers in the audience, I highly recommend this book as an extra credit assignment during the frequent \\"Romeo and Juliet\\" unit."},{"rating":"2","title":"Seen Her and Love Her","review":"I've seen this girl preform a number of times here in Richmond over the past couple of years and have to say that each time I've been blown away.

Scorching, burning, going almost dry food in it. No matter what happened, it suffered through my use of it and cleaned it up with it still looking like new when done. And, having this set makes it so more useful beyond as an ordinary pressure cooker. The main part of a meal might be in one piece while something else is cooking in the other.

If you like the Drifters and want a great recording of their greatest hits, you can't go wrong with this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Only 6 minutes of dinosaurs!","review":"I didn't like this video at all and neither did my son who LOVES dinosaurs. First, it's mainly about fossils and only has about 6 minutes of dinosaurs in the 20 minute video. The DVD states that it's 55 minutes long but the dinosaur section is 20 and then the rest is about horses. If it's titled \\"All about Dinosaurs\\" then why is more than 1/2 of it about horses.

I've had a number of really cheap hoses in the past and they've all been a \\"get what you pay for\\" situation. This particular product is fairly inexpensive and works incredibly well. I've been using it for months, on its own and with sprinklers, and its withstood a decent amount of abuse. So far, no kinks, no leaks, no issues at all.The color might be a problem for some situations, like a hose you want to keep hidden in the grass, but if the blue/white styling isn't a problem for you I highly recommend this product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best hose I've ever owned","review":"I read the reviews on this hose & decided to give it a try. Well I ended up buying two more. The hose is lightweight, & does not kink up. The water pressure is great. Hard to believe it is a 50 foot length, because it rolls up so small."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your time or money","review":"Based on the overall 4-star rating of this hose, I ordered one. The only thing we use the hose for is to fill up the bird bath in the front yard daily. Nothing else.After about 4 days I decided I needed a 2nd hose for the back yard, so I ordered another one. I should have waited.The next day, the 1st hose started to leak. When the 2nd hose arrived, I replaced the 1st one with it.The 2nd hose lasted about 5 days and it started to leak too.I've never had any hose in my entire life that sprung a leak so quickly, let alone 2 within a week of being put into service.With the poor quality of this hose, I'm beginning to question the validity of Amazon's user ratings. Are they being submitted by employees of Apex Hoses?Look elsewhere because these hoses are junk!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Hose Failed on 2nd Day of Use","review":"Although I have several of these 7612-25 (and -50) hoses with no problems, this one leaked at supply-end fitting no matter what I did, AND after only two days of light use, it totally failed with a huge leak a few inches from nozzle end. I actually started to balloon out several inches before it blew!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Highly recommended! My wife loves this hose!","review":"We purchased this hose in late October 2010. It is our favorite hose ever. It does not kink. It does not bind. It does not try to stay coiled. It is light and easy to manuever through our garden and around our house. We highly recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Defective hardware","review":"I just received three of these hoses through Amazon and tried them out. One is fine the other two leak out of the attachment ends. I replaced the washers, no luck. The ends are defective. They have a lifetime guarantee.

They can kink if they encounter a rigid obstacle. This usually happens in colder weather.

It looks great too!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't kink, but gets a hole","review":"At first I was pleased with this hose, it has a rather small diameter but was working well. I was using it in a limited capacity around the yard and simply by dragging it across the ground a hole wore through in less than 1 month. This hose is clearly not designed for use around the yard. I would stick to its actual application as a boat or camper hose that gets limited use and be sure not to drag it around."},{"rating":"2","title":"I wish I could give it 6 stars!","review":"I've used this hose for over a year out on my deck. I like to drink out of the hose when I'm watering my garden and so I got this hose for that reason. I'm delighted with it. I have many kinds of hoses on the farm here but this is my favorite. I'm in a wheelchair and the smaller diameter makes for easy handleing and a small \\"bump\\" when I roll over it. I have never had it kink. Ever. After a summer/winter/summer all outdoors I can wipe the surface and it looks brand new. No signs of any wear. Get this hose and I think you'll be very pleased. If you let your kids play with a garden hose they WILL drink out of it. Better safe than sorry. A nice product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great lightweight, safe hose","review":"First of all, I love the light weight of this hose. I have chronic pain, and used to dread watering my garden and hosing off the patio. There's nothing worse than a large heavy hose filled with water that gets stuck or kinked when you're already hurting! It's light weight makes it easy to move to other locations, and it's non-toxic, so I can sneak a drink for me and my dragons out of it, too!"},{"rating":"2","title":"You know, for kids!","review":"We recently purchased this water hose ($24.21) for our daughter, and there is only one thing I have to say about it: It doesn't smell like plastic/chemicals! Every other hose we've tried or used contained PVC, and if you've heard of PVC/phthalate you probably know it's bad. Don't take my word on the PVC/phthalate issue, read some empirically validated research and see for yourself! It's also lead free.But take my word on this: This is a great hose. The other reviews are right, and it is a wonderful hose to use for children who want to play in the water on a hot summer day! The durability, kink free feature, and solid construction are just bonuses. The real win here is that you're getting a water hose that's safer for your children to play with.One other note: You can register it for a lifetime replacement warranty. How cool is that?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great hose.","review":"I love that this is made of food grade materials; many hoses have toxic components (lead, etc.). Plus, this hose resists kinking. Great product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hose brass nozzle came off after 3 months.","review":"I'm very disappointed with this hose after 3 months of use. It was absolutely perfect for my use and exactly the right size, it also never kinked. When using this product with an attachable device like a water wand, the brass piece at the end starts to loosen and eventually comes off, leaving you with a useless hose which can't screw onto any watering nozzle. The only redeeming quality is that Amazon is letting me return it for a full refund after this long of a period due to the lifetime warranty included. For that reason I'm going to give it 2 stars, but I highly recommend getting a hose made in the USA like the platinum flexgen hose from Gilmore if a larger diameter is ok for your needs."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's the one","review":"After searching for a lot of different hose that won't hurt my back, this hose is the one, finally. I don't know if I got the right hose reel or right hose before, but now I know it's not the reel, you just have to find the right hose that works. This really is true for what its labeled on the package, durable, lightweight and it fits on my hose reel. Finally my husband and I don't need to talk about hose solution like it's a bad subject. I have a herniated disc, this hose is a good solution for that not like it will cure my back but it won't make my pain any worse. I can now enjoy watering my flower gardens. Love it! I ordered two 50 foot, I joined both to make 100 foot hose, it works."},{"rating":"2","title":"non-kink hose","review":"This is a great garden hose (that's the way I use it), saves lots of time and frustation because you don't have to walk back to a kink every few minutes and free it. I've had these hoses for seven years and am just now having to replace one. You can't find a high quality, non-kinking hose in 1/2\\" size at Home Depot or any other place that I know of. To get a high quality hose you must go to a 5/8\\" or 3/4\\" hose and those hoses are heavy, and especially heavy when full of water and are difficult to pull around. I have several hoses 100' or more (two or more 50' hoses connected) and this 1/2\\" size is easy to use."},{"rating":"1","title":"Misleading!","review":"A terrible CD!

I bought it as a gift for my former boss who was the owner of the company that made shopping carts. I thought that he would get a kick out of it. Before I gave it to him, I decided to glance at a few pages and ended up reading through the whole book before I gave it to him. I sort of felt bad since the book is now officially used. He loved it anyway. It was interesting and it has inspired me to do something similar."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very amusing read- but possibly too complicated for comedy.","review":"Received the book last week- funny read and the pictures are amusing for a while...then the \\"field guide\\" aspect of the book may be a bit too complicated for a \\"fun read\\". It's quite a complicated work-up that the author had contrived, and while impressive- I was using too much brain power while reading something that should be entertaining. I don't think I have enough room left in my brain to store field guide info on shopping carts- even just to make it til the end of this book! But maybe YOU do! :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great splitter","review":"The negatives you will read about this splitter on the internet have been corrected. Now comes with engine and fuel tank guard made out of heavy gauge steel. Also cheaper hoses have been upgraded. Honda engine is great and starts on first pull always. Easy assembly, took me about 1.5 hours. Very powerful. I have yet to find a piece of wood it would not split and I have split allot of knarly y's. Holds 9 gallons of hydraulic fluid which helps it run cool. Built extremely well and heavy duty.

He's evolved into just another authoritarian who's upset that not everyone shares his views, so, by golly, it's time for Big Brother to \\"regulate\\" what other people say and write \\"in the public interest.\\" So what else is new? Another writer could have set out the arguments in a more honest manner, but not Sunstein. Every time he seems to consider an objection, it turns out to be a caricature. His extreme legal positivism is presented as merely common sense, when it is a highly disputed approach in law. I regret having wasted my time on the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Release of the Stranglehold","review":"What really has Sunstein freaked is that liberal elites are losing their stranglehold on political discourse. The gates the gatekeepers have been guarding for fifty or more years have been outflanked. The American people are finding, much to their amazement and delight, that a wide range of sensible approaches to problem-solving that never even get mentioned on the nightly news are thoughtfully and exhaustively dealt with on the Internet by everyday people who possess rhetorical and journalistic skills easily the equal of 95% of the professional journalists out there.The Internet is a boon to true democracy, but a bane to the \\"expert, credentialist\\" culture. It should be amusing to watch these erstwhile champions of free speech (as long as it's their speech that is free) attempt to justify legislative measures designed to put-down the rabble. Sunstein's book is an opening skirmish. I expect much more sophistry to come."},{"rating":"1","title":"Liberal idiot proposes fascist solution to nonproblem","review":"Please, get this man a real job ... something he's qualified for, like maybe refilling the milkshake machine at McDonald's. His argument that there is too much choice, too much freedom of speech on the Internet is inane, unconstitutional and viciously patronizing. He would love to have a kill switch on the Web, such as the one now being used in Egypt. Very nice. Yes, please protect me from having any thoughts except that those with \\"managerial expertise\\" would deem suitable for the ignorant masses.

Sunstein LOVES big, mainstream liberal media and is quite clearly terrified that alternatives via the internet now exist for news dissemination, policy/issue discussion and consensus building. He has some policy proposals ---- for our own good, of course --- that should effectively silence those whose views he finds offensive. One is reminded of the words of the evil Alcalde in \\"Zorro, the Gay Blade\\" when told we have freedom of speech in this country the heroine must be allowed to speak no matter how objectionable he finds her words: 'All right, let her speak freely, but shoot anyone who listens\\".

This I must say was the best radio out there! The sound quality is absolutely superior, and not only blew the others away (including Motorola talk about, Kenwood and a few others) it was the most convenient to use. With its keylock, it prevents from accidentally being turned off or the channel being changed. The range is excellent and its small compact size is very convenient. The only drawback is that the ringer is not that convenient to use (which I don't really use anyway.) I am in the process of buying another one and would definitely recommend this to anyone looking for a 2-way radio! I never realized just how convenient these were for things like keeping together at parades, parks, shopping malls, camping, and a lot more activities we have done. Good luck and I wish you the best!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Radio","review":"I am an electronics enthusiast, this radio just didn't cut it, it may have an attractive case but don't judge a book by it's cover. Poor sound quality, most people would have great difficulty reading the instructions, weird layout, I personally recommend the Motorola Talkabouts, as one of the previous reviews stated that he had two Motorola's that failed to the elements, he must have been dipping it in and out of a pool or something, actually I have done that, I jumped in a pool with the radio on me, with no case, bag, or any protection for a full minute(typical me!), let it dry, 2 hours later, good as new. The motorolas are your best pick."},{"rating":"1","title":"poorly functioning radios","review":"We waited for our delivery with great expectation.

Maybe I'd have to smell it on someone else. After all the great reviews, and with a reasonable price, I decided to give Tabac a try. I just don't see why anyone might go out of their way to find this stuff. It doesn't smell bad, but it doesn't smell good.

But make sure you purchase a firewire cable (4 pin to 4 pin) and have software like Intervideo DVD creator or Windows Movie Maker to take advantage of video editing. It's a good buy without the features you don't really need!If you're looking to take good pictures, don't rely on the Panasonic camcorder. Instead, go buy a tiny digital camera with at least 5 megapixels. This camcorder can take pictures but they're less than 1 megapixel, which equals poor quality pix."},{"rating":"2","title":"very good tiny camcorder","review":"It is a very good budget buy for family movies. Sharp picture, no motor noise. Nize zoom (and mic zoom too!). Fit well in the hand. Few complicated functions, you may need the manual in the begining if you want use them. You can record more than 60 minutes with the standart battery. It would be nice if they had usb and firewire cables in the package, but you can find them really cheap on the net. The battery indicator may be improved. Overall, for 300 usd after the rebate it is a very good buy.

I like Amy Adams. I like jazz vocals. I couldn't stop watching this movie even though it was terrible. I was amazed at the low production values, the stilted dialogue, the clumsy plotline and the amateurish quality of the whole production. Although it is listed as a 2009 film, it was actually made in 2006, right after \\"JuneBug\\" and before \\"Enchanted\\". Amy Adams hadn't really hit the big time yet, and perhaps that is how she ended up in this lame film. You can blame Mr. Tallarico for both the directing and the writing.

Based on this film, it is unlikely that is going to change."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of a great talent","review":"I think that Amy Adams is a wonderful actress, but even she cannot get past the stilted dialogue and the low budget sets of this movie.

Well, as original as boy meets girl and falls in love can be. The plot is shallow and predictable, the singing rates above nails on a chalkboard, and the acting by the protagonist could be done by a corpse only after rigor mortis set in.

Very disappointed in how much money was wasted here. A partial refund by the seller would be appropriate."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's The Most Unique Scanner I've Ever Seen","review":"While it's true, scanners come in all shapes and sizes.The only scanner for my hard earned dollar is the Mustek Bear paw Scanner.This handy slim item weighs only 6 lbs., and has 5 features in one.Why purchase 4 or 5 different Computer componants when you can have it all with a Bear Paw Scanner.Why wait! Get yours,now!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Historical Fiction","review":"This was my favorite series as a teenager. I devoured each novel as it was published and waited impatiently for each sequel to come out. Phillips and Pella masterfully wove a plot that kept me on the edge of my seat, spellbound by the characters and the mystery. It is clear that the authors have researched Scottish history and culture. I learned more about that region through these books than from any history class. These books take the reader into the culture, allowing him or her to experience what it was like in that time, as well as into the heart and mind of each character. I became Margaret as I read.The development of spiritual themes is well worked into the plot and appropriate for the audience for whom it is written. I recommend this series and the sequel \\"The Stonewycke Legacy\\" highly and without reservation."},{"rating":"1","title":"am I missing something?","review":"Readers beware, Spoiler Alert bottom half of review:I bought this book based on the reviews it received on this site. It must be just me, but I thought this trilogy, though well-written, was incredibly disappointing. Did I really read 600 pages for that?? If you like satisfying endings, not 'turn the pages quickly, can't wait till this certain thing happens' just to have it never happen, then this book isn't for you!!!!!!!!!SPOILER ALERT!!!!!!........The fact Maggie and Ian both thought the other had died and NEVER laid eyes on each other again (until they were old and gray) made this book seem null and void. What was the point of reading it? Why even create these characters? It was depressing. Maybe it's real life and all that, but when I sit down to read, it's nice to escape real life, not see just how depressing it can be!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Stonewyck Trilogy","review":"CAN ANYONE OUT THERE TELL ME: What happened to the stand-alone \\"Lady of Stonewyck\\", published in 1985? It is NOT the same story as the final section of this compilation! In \\"Lady\\", Maggie & Ian are reunited and return to claim Stonewyck as their rightful heritage. In the \\"Trilogy\\", the story skips from Maggie as a young \\"widow\\" in America down two generations to her granddaughter, snd substitutes a totally different story line for the intervening years. I feel saddened and cheated."},{"rating":"2","title":"Insightful, beautifully written","review":"This is a very good read for someone who is about to travel to Ireland or has an interest in the country.

Mr. Watkins had a good way with words and gives a good look into the everyday life of a man in the Confederate Army. I highly recommend this book for anyone looking to get a good view of the Civil War."},{"rating":"1","title":"Generally Poor Quality","review":"After a review of available umbrellas, we chose this one. The main reason was the generally good reviews. The first order was returned to Amazon by UPS. Apparently, the poor packaging caused damage. We received a second one. The packaging was also fairly inadequate. However, we assembled it and put it on a patio table. The cloth material of the umbrella is poor quality. It is thin and translucent. It just feels cheap. The pole is made of a very thin gauge aluminum. The first moderate wind that we had caused the umbrella to blow over. The top section of the pole (where it tilts) deformed so that it is no longer vertical.Is there anything good to say about this umbrella. Nice color. Other than that, it is cheaply made and generally poor quality. I was originally going to give it 2 stars but then I realized that 2 stars would mean it was almost reasonable.I would not buy this brand or model again and would suggest that no one else does."},{"rating":"2","title":"Quick, great packaging and easy assembly!

Tilts easily and all parts were present and accounted for."},{"rating":"1","title":"THE PIC IS MISLEADING, it's MAROON NOT RED","review":"UNBELIEVABLE! I was looking for red umbrellas and ordered these, described as red. The picture in the ad clearly shows a bright red umbrella. I was severely disappointed when they arrived. Not only are they MAROON, or dark red, but they are exactly the same as umbrellas I could have bought locally for nearly $20 less! Ordering these was a huge waste of time. Do I have to ask if red really means red?"},{"rating":"2","title":"great umbrella1","review":"GREAT UMBRELLA!! GREAT QUALITY AND EASY TO OPERATE AND STANDS UP TO THE MONSOONS THAT WE'VE BEEN HAVING...

It also provides good shade and is very easy to open and close. Haven't used the push-tilt yet so I can't remark about it. The color is exactly as pictured. This came well-packaged and in a short amount of time. Overall very pleased. The price is great too."},{"rating":"1","title":"cheap one","review":"I used it for three months and then the pole broke where the tilt mechanism installed. It broke by itself... probably during one of the rainy and windy days. I noticed it later. My previous umbrella lasted 12 years. And I didn't expect this umbrella to break so easily.I'm not going to spend a penny on this brand again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another Great Story!!! But Doesn't Jusitify Length...","review":"I like a lengthy story, but KS's are only lengthy because of too many repetitive lines; she writes practically the same sentences throughout most of her books. That is a little annoying. That said, I thought Chase was perfect, Cassandra was lovely, and the story line held my interest. However, I could have done without the blatant description of Cassandra's wounds, Dr. Stone.This is a book well worth reading. KS is one of the few authors whose work captures the reader on page one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Annoying","review":"I listened to this on tape. The reader was very annoying, as was the way it was written, had to be written, his grey eyes...It was a soap opera on paper. Who knew you could, had to.. actually write things down the way the melodramatic soap stars have always spoken- in italics. The only thing that kept me going was to see how the story would resolve and now I feel like a sap for even waiting for that. Not for intelligent readers. I embarrass myself admitting I listened till the end."},{"rating":"1","title":"Painful start but worth hanging in there.","review":"Ms. (Dr.?) Stone's writing is intelligent, but the first portion of her book followed the romance recipe of mystery + loss + misunderstandings so much that I found it excruciatingly painful. But I hung in there and the undeveloped characters finally became people I cared about and by the end of the novel I wished the book would not end. I hope in her future books she gives us a little more character details in the beginning so that we can care about the people enough to keep reading."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Thick Language","review":"The Life of W. B. Yeats is an excellent book, so far as the reader will take it. The book is written in very thick, intellectual language, which fits a lot of information in each chapter, enough usually to fill a small booksworth. The book tends to be vague on dates, but very well describes whats going on in Yeats's life at certain time periods, and how he is reacting to it. It does not explain the poetry the best, but the book does leave an excellent sense of the person."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dacota Oversized 1 Pound Terry Cloth Bath Sheet 30x60","review":"Verry nice, soft and a good value.

For a towel that cost 6.00 dollars each you would think you'd get something a lot more thicker. Towels at Walmart or Kmart that are less expensive are thicker than the towels I got. Was very disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Low Cost HDTV","review":"I can still remember the jump from a SDTV to this HDTV \\"without a tuner\\". This TV might not be the highest resolution, but it is a great buy. I remember hooking my Tivo system to it, and the picture was so much better, without any HDTV programming. For games, it's great. You can adjust the color and video noise reduction if you have several things hooked up to your television. I just bought a Nintendo Wii, along with HDTV cables. The games look really good on this TV. I approve this buy. The only reason it doesn't get five stars is because of the lack of resolution sizes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing for a \\"little\\" SDTV","review":"I just bought one of these used, and I think it is GREAT!

Although i agree with the other reviewer that there are many uses for this product, such as being good trivets, the items just don't really cut it as potholders. trying to bend the squares in half to take a pot out of the oven is just asking for trouble, because they don't easily fold over evenly, and actually heat up after holding items with very high temperatures for about 10 seconds. also, you can burn the tops of your hands on top oven racks if you reach into the oven and you're not careful. i love the silicon cooking utensils and thought i'd love these too, but no....i find i'm still using the nasty looking oven mits i have, and I have not really been able to throw them out, unfortunately. i also find the potholders somewhat difficult to use with pans on the stove- they are just not very comfortable to hold."},{"rating":"2","title":"I like them","review":"I've read on here how difficult these pot holders are to bend. I was able to pick up a china creamer, by the handle, with them when I first got them. I also found if you keep your fingers on the buttons, they don't get too warm. I was able to pick up a casserole dish and place it on the stove with no problem. I burn my cloth ones. My mitten ones are too clumsy.

When used to grasp a casserole dish that has been in the oven for 45 minutes, my hand begins to get hot almost immediately.I only use them if I've got a big project going on in the kitchen and all of my other potholders are already in use."},{"rating":"1","title":"They Work . . . Less Than a Minute","review":"I bake cookies. The first time I used these, to take a single sheet of cookies out of the oven, before I had moved all eight cookies to the cooling rack, I felt the heat of the sheet through this product. I had to put it down before I was finished because it was too hot. The product does not work as well as a plain cloth potholder.

Other standout tracks are \\"None Of Your Friend's Business,\\" \\"Wait A Minute,\\" \\"Do You Remember,\\" \\"I'm Crying Out,\\" \\"2 Sides 2 A Story,\\" \\"All Night, All Day,\\" and the 7:23 long opus \\"Final Warning\\" (featuring Aaliyah).

Most of the production comes from the phat beat-maker Timbaland. His beats are so original and brings out the songs well. Some exceptional tracks are \\"Wait A Minute\\" and \\"None Of Ur Friends Business\\", songs about listening to your man instead of your friends, \\"No.1 Fan\\", self-explainatory, and \\"Final Warning\\", the duet w/ Aaliyah which is more like an arguement than a song. Ginuwine has nice vocal skills and shows them off in the remake of the song \\"She's Out Of My Life\\". The album is packed with energy and straight-to-the-point lyrics, including the hit singles \\"What's So Different\\" and \\"So Anxious\\". So if you liked his debut, then you'll love the sophomore."},{"rating":"1","title":"A total Waste of Money. Avoid this.","review":"This is the most pathetic piece of music I ever heard.

This book uses local references like poi and taro and of course musubi, but isn't very interesting otherwise. The illustrator is different than the person who did the other two and the illustrations are not as fun. In fact, I find them a little creepy. The Musubi man is freaky looking and his hair looks, well, like body hair normally under clothing. The eys of all the animals look like they are dilated on street drugs. I would recommend Takayama's other books over this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Musubi Man: Hawaii's Gingerbread Man","review":"The depiction of the Hawaiian culture through the art is nice.

I'm already a convinced Biber fan (I enjoy his quirkiness, which no doubt is what puts off some reviewers). This performance is not only lively it also allows you to fix on the fascinating sound world of scordatura strings (including the viola d'amore), giving a slightly other-wordly sonority from the opening Sonata of Partia I. The RFC understand very well that Baroque music is all about rhetorical gestures (\\"Affekten\\"). They have the benefit of a powerful church organ and a large choice of plucked and bowed continuo instruments (harp, theorbo, guitar, gamba, cello, ...) and they play with a virtuosity that's absolutely appropriate for this music. If you come across this disk, get a copy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Guilty of the banality when Baroque goes bad.","review":"I must take exception to the 5-star rating previously given. This music suffers from the worst offense of baroque music, facile ornamentation. Too much of it lacks a center, a ground, and so sounds like a long drawn out series of flourishes (a la Telemann at his worst). When I first heard this album on the radio, I thought that my judgement of Biber based on his \\"Battle Music\\" was too harsh. I was wrong - I had heard one of the few pieces of any consequence. Almost all of this material is just simply trite.The performance can't be faulted. RFC plays with enthusiasm and creativity. They just picked mediocre material.If you are looking for a Danish pre-Bach baroque composer whose name starts with a \\"B,\\" stick with Buxtehude: his string sonatas are deep, rich, and always revealing something new."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad TV","review":"This TV is a joke.

I believe we can get replacement parts from Kohler for \\"free\\", but no one in the family is handy and having a plumber take care of the replacement will cost as much or more than the faucet did.

I tried tightening the top and other pieces without effect.I haven't talked to Kohler yet, probably will today. If this is a problem with so many and to protect it's name Kohler should re-engineer a permanent solution or give us all credit for a different faucet with the same manufacturer list price.2/27/12 update - I had contacted Kohler and they sent me out a rebuild kit. I installed it and the leak went away. That was shortly after my previous post. Sorry to report that it's leaking badly again. What's that, about a year?

It doesn't help that the handle screw is the in BACK of the faucet, meaning no clearance to work with (unless you remove the whole faucet assembly from the sink).

My wife loves to use a swivel type sprayer that threads into the faucet. You know the type. They can be purchased at Lowes, Home Depot, Ace, Menards. Just unscrew the existing aerator and screw a swivel type spray aerator in its place. Just one thing... the back pressure just from a new aerator causes the faucet to leak a lot of water at the base of the faucet. A Kohler representative informed me this problem can be expected and only the aerator that comes with this faucet is advised to be used. To be fair, Kohler stands behind their products. Great parts replacement policy in their warranty. Problem isn't the warranty, it's the design of the product. I would advise anyone to steer clear of of this faucet and look at another manufacture with a better engineered product.

Faucet started to leak after 9 months. It makes a puddle on one side of the metal plate. I opened the faucet and found out water leaking from the o-ring sealing the swinging spout and the inner pole. Hard water just built up inside. When you swing the spout, the calcium just keep rubbing and cutting the rubber o-ring and makes it leak. Just a bad design. Anyone has any recommendation for a reliable faucet?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst kitchen faucet they keep selling","review":"I just got off the phone with customer service at Kohler concerning this faucet - 10412-CP Forte. Yes, they know it leaks, but they stand by their warranty and will send you out the same exact faucet. There are no parts to fix the leak, easier just to mail out the same exact faucet and try again and hope it doesn't leak with the same problem. I did this once before. I bought the faucet in June 2011, started leaking in March 2012, they sent the replacement and now 7 months later water is leaking out in the same spot with the new replacement. Looks like faucet only last 6 to 9 months before needing replaced. If you really like this style faucet, do not buy the retail version, go to a professional plumbing supply store and buy the more expensive version.

Then it started leaking water from where the handle meets the base. There was constantly a pool of water/sludge sitting around the base of where the faucet meets the sink. I replaced it with the exact same faucet because I didn't know how long the original faucet had been in use and I knew that it would fit. Also, there was a small kid in the house before I moved in, so I factored in that wear and tear and gave Kohler the benefit of the doubt.

It has leaked 3x (every time after the first year it was installed/fixed). We called Kohler and they sent the replacement parts for free. We JUST realized what the true problem was. When assembling the o-rings, bearings, and valve, do NOT use Teflon, plumbers putty, or sealant/lubricant containing petroleum. You MUST use a lubricant sealant (petroleum free of course) all over the o-rings, bearings, and the orange gasket at the bottom of the valve. We applied the lubricant seal excessively and have NOT had a problem since. We are now on our 2nd year leak free!

Full of predictable rock riffs and lyrics this doesn't come near the clever rockingness of old tracks like \\"If I'm a Man\\". They still play with skill and urgency, but in my opinion the songwriting and hooks just aren't there. Even the couple of decent tracks on this seem like efforts to reach out and say \\"Hey look, we ROCK, we're a ROCK BAND!\\".

It sounds authentic, although I suspect the tuba is an electronically simulated one, because no one can play the tuba with as much precision as it is played here! The Lichtensteiner Polka is sung in both German and English, the first time I have ever heard it this way.

The graphics and vehicle control is horrible. If they would have only spent as much time on the game itself as they did the introductory movie, then they might have something.Do yourself a favor and buy Need for Speed instead of this complete piece of garbage."},{"rating":"1","title":"I expected more.","review":"The graphics in this game are pretty good, as you would expect on the Dreamcast, but the rest of the game is a dissappointment. Most of the tracks seem as narrow as bike paths and have walls on both sides which make the player feel like a mouse moving through a maze. The cars don't feel like real cars, and they seem to steer from the rear wheels and not the front. After playing SPEED DEVILS this game feels like Pole Position 2. If you want a racing game that looks and feels awesome pick up SPEED DEVILS."},{"rating":"1","title":"really disappointed","review":"I was going to buy this game but after reading the mixed reviews here I decided to rent it first. I'm a big fan of racing games, but TD6 was a big let down. The graphics are horrible by DC standards (low poly models, small tiled textures, ugly mip mapped road), and except for a higher screen resolution, would even be marginal on the PSX. There are a bunch of controller settings but every single one has brake/accel on the triggers which I find really uncomfortable. The collisions are annoying (sometimes you go right through trees/poles and other times you don't). I hate to say it but TD6 felt slapped together and the whole game had an amature feel to it... like a good shareware game. Rent it before you buy it IMHO."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great playing, but who hired the techies?","review":"I have listened to this cd countless times, and I still have not gotten bored of it. Coin's sound, especially in the high register, is mesmerizing and bold, never sounding fluffy even in the faster movements, like Savall sometimes gets. Rousset's playfulness in the continuo is refreshing, and hardly ever distracting. The continuo gamba is also present, but sometimes struggles to be heard as opposed to the theorbo, which is almost always too loud. The interpretations are mostly stock, but there are many refreshing moments, especially in the choice of tempi. Overall I would have liked a more realistic balance between the instruments, but somehow Coin makes me forget the recording technical aspects."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oldies But Goodies - K-Tel Entertainment","review":"This cd was definitely not what I expected.

It even fits into a inexpensive carying case we had our for digital camera. It has a lot of great features and served us well on our vacation. Its been said before, but the only real drawback to this is the instructions. To Claridy: The camcorder can transfer still pics from its SD slot via a USB cable, you will need firewire to transfer it to the computer or use as a webcam - both which work very well. It also has all the necessary cables you will need if you just want to hook it up to your VHS/Home DVD burner via A/V cables and record, or just watch the playback on a TV. It could use an external audio mic output, but we found the internal microphone is quite sensitive and met our needs very well. Overall: Definately recomended"},{"rating":"1","title":"Decent but not great picture quality","review":"If you are looking for a camera that has everything you need to transfer movies to your computer this is NOT it. It WILL work if you get the cable and you use a software suite such as Nero (that often comes w/ DVD burners)- but these things don't come with the camera. The size of the camera is great as well as the battery life. The biggest problem, and an important one at that, is that we found this camera to have a dark picture- picture was a bit grainy and pixely and especially poor performance in low lighting. Battery life & size were not good enough to sacrifice sharp picture quality and bright picture & colors."},{"rating":"1","title":"OK Starter Video Camera","review":"I have owned this camera for several years now.

The DVD portion of the machine works beautifully, but I didn't buy this unit for the DVD player.....I bought it for its ability to replace my VCR, hoping that I'd no longer have to buy VHS tapes in order to record TV shows. This unit is supposed to record up to 40 hours of programming on its hard drive, which would make it ideal for anyone going on a long vacation. But the only way I can get it to record is by turning on the unit, setting it to a channel, and hitting the record button. This means that you have to MANUALLY turn the record function on.....as well as turning it OFF!! The RCA folks were of no help, in that they read from the same manual that I do....the one that comes with the unit.So, be very careful if you're looking to this unit as a replacement for your old VCR!

Not only do they step up the action, but the story itself is also getting better. With cliff hangars that will leave you wanting to buy season 5 and beyond this is a must have.

I'm 19 years old now and I've been watching DBZ since I was about 10 years old and DBZ is the best action anime action cartoon ever.

The title listed on Amazon is All-Time Greatest Hits~Paul Revere & Mark Lindsey. The true title is Paul Revere & Mark Lindsey Formerly of Paul Revere & The Raiders. That alone is misleading. Amazon does not show the front of the CD which is nothing but a blue background with red stars. No pics. of the muscians al all. There is a statement at the bottom of the CD that says \\" All selections are new stereo recordings performed by the original artist or one or more members of the original group\\". No where is it listed which performer is singing what song. In addition, the recordings are lousy and are not near as good as the original tunes. I am very dissapointed in this CD.

There are a few great songs on here, especially \\"Julia.\\" However, I have never understood why they changed \\"Thought crime\\" to \\"Sex crime\\" in the first song. My memory is that the book talks only about \\"Thought crime,\\" although I last read it in 1984, so I could be wrong. I find that its easier to listen to this Eurythmics album 20 years later than most of their other ones - in fact, I really just listen to a song here or there on most of the other albums. Grab a copy of this before it goes out of print! - the sales ranking is pretty darn bad."},{"rating":"2","title":"one song is excellent","review":"I liked the song Julia a lot, but I really didn't care for the other songs. Julia is a ballad about the main female character in the movie and book. The back up accoustical guitar on the song is just as good as the singing by Annie Lennox. Good lyrics, too.Other songs are a sort of disco/New Wave with themes from the movie such as Sexcrime and Room 101.Also, I saw the movie 1984 in 1984 and have to differ with those who say the soundtrack was not used. I am pretty sure that one song was in the movie and that was Julia--- may have been in the closing credits, don't remember exactly. I don't know if the use of one song counts or not.The film that inspired this record was very, very good by the way."},{"rating":"2","title":"Talk About A Crime!","review":"One of Annie & Davie's most stunning, original, haunting, and yet criminally ignored albums, both critically and commercially. Maybe it was the reticence of US radio to push a single that said \\"Sexcrime\\" in the title? Maybe it was the dismal, downbeat, and box-office failure of the film? Maybe it was because the label pushed this as a side project/soundtrack rather than a \\"real\\" Eurythmics album, but make no mistake, this is some of the Eurythmics' BEST work ever, featuring memorable songs like JUILA, I DID IT JUST THE SAME, ROOM 101, DOUBLEPLUSGOOD, and many more. Tellingly, while all the other Eurythmics albums got the deluxe re-issue CD treatment in 2006, only this album has been somehow left behind, discarded like one of those prisoners in Room 101. Look for it on import or in the bargain bins, but do get it - you won't be sorry - the mixture of Dave's cold, clinical soundscapes and Annie's fiery, passionate vocals (like Yaz) cannot be denied."},{"rating":"2","title":"Read instructions carefully at the front of the book before","review":"I am really sorry that Phil Brown found his recipe in this book hard to follow and left him scratching his head.

I've had the last one for over 5 years. I thought it had died but I took it apart and found the motor was just dirty from years of heavy use so I cleaned it out with canned air, inspected all the connections and fired it up. It runs like new again! I have no doubt we'll get another 5 years out of it. This is a VERY high quality product. It's Italian made, NOT cheap Chinese trash like most dryers you buy in the local department store. I got tired of dryers lasting only a few months (or days) before burning out so I bought one of these based on user reviews. They are expensive to buy but when you consider how long they are going to last they are actually far cheaper in the long run."},{"rating":"2","title":"Quiet yet powerful!","review":"This was a replacement for my previous Super Solano dryer, which lasted 10+ years, so my expectations were pretty well-set.

The mouse itself is approximately 3.5 inches long and 1.5 inches wide. TINY which worked well for my small hands but could prove problematic for someone with a larger hand.The one star is for Customer Service regarding the mouse. I was able to get through to Targus easily and use their 1 year warranty to get the product replaced.If you're looking for something cute and ornamental that you will use occasionally, this mouse might be okay but if you plan to actually use it for everyday functions, get a heartier mouse. This one won't last and you can pay a similar amount of money for a very good mouse, though unfortunately, it probably won't be pink which is obviously the biggest selling point on this particular mouse."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed, yet pleased","review":"The music was fun listening, however, the one title I was/am looking for is more of the original vocal song, rather than the music only song.

It's hilarious, lyrical, ridiculous, serious. Set in Scotland, Kathmundu, Cambridge and Morocco, with things to say about all of them.

Shoes are light, sturdy and highly visible. They are also very stable. Unfortunately for me the shoes don't offer enough cushioning. I walk/run 3-5 times a week for about 1hr. at the time. Even though, I had the shoes for several months,at the end of the week I had blisters on my heels from the lack of weight absorption. I have decided to replace the inserts with ones made by LifeFitness to see if this improves the comfort.

It too often reduces the actual complexity of events, avoids matters that challenge or contradict Mormon myth, views the Mormons as good and their opponents as evil, and all too often ignores the cultural context of the early church. It deals with the Mormon experience in a defensive manner while fostering the myth of Mormon innocence and religious persecution. Roberts emphasizes the persecution of the Mormons for religious reasons, but fails to explore systematically the causes of conflict that led to the assassinations of Joseph Smith, the Mormon prophet, and his brother, Hyrum Smith, in Carthage, Illinois, in 1844."},{"rating":"1","title":"Warning: poorly packaged.

My only complaint about it is if you have batteries in it and its plugged into the usb port on your computer you cannot turn it off. You can only change the switch from usb to batteries. So if you do have it plugged into a usb port you need to leave the batteries out to turn it off. They needed to install a 3 way switch, with the three positions being batteries, off, and usb.

Shortly thereafter, no blade movement at all. Then the actual blender attachment had the same issue. I would hear the motor running, whirring away, but the blender attachment sounded like there was some major mechanical problem - like metal was rubbing on metal the wrong way.

I don't know how much longer it will be before the whole setup becomes useless. The problem is, as other reviewers have noted, the stripped plastic teeth on the part that connects the motor to the attachments. I don't understand why anyone would make a product with a great motor, metal body, and well-designed attachments only to make the most important part of the whole setup out of cheap plastic. Once the teeth on this part are stripped, the machine is rendered useless. It was great while it lasted, though. When fully functional, the blender attachment was capable of making thick hummus as quickly as effectively as a food processor and reducing rock hard frozen bananas to delicious smoothies in minutes.

It allows me to quickly and easily puree some fruits and spinach with a little milk and some protein powder. It handles everything perfectly, but does trip over the spinach SLIGHTLY.

When I used it to make smoothies, I found that not only is it smaller and less expensive than a traditional blender - it's easier to use and clean as well. It left no large chunks of fruit unblended.One possible downside of this product is its lack of settings - it's either on or it's off. Also, you need to have a suitable container to blend in since it doesn't come with one.

Since then, I've experienced a number of issues that have rendered the product useless. First, the mini food processor never worked out of the box. And the blender attachment stopped spinning after 2 or 3 uses, despite my holding it together and finally taping it strongly, with a good connection to the power attachment using duct tape.I give up and have thrown it away.

It worked fine until the plastic teeth that drive the blades wore out about 3 months later, rendering it useless.

It clearly was a mistake, it broke after 5 uses, as many other reviewers have complained. The motor itself is working great but the mechanism to attach the motor part to the chopper/stick/whip is made of cheap plastic that ends up over-heating and blending the 2 parts' plastic dents together. So now it won't connect to the part with blades, rendering it utterly useless. I'm not even going to bother sending it back to Cuisinart as I read that their customer service is pretty lame and what use would I have of a brand new product that is most likely going to fail quickly?My advice to curious shoppers: avoid the hassle, either get one of their bigger food processors with good reviews, or go for another brand for a stick blender."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just broke mine - here looking for a replacement","review":"Used sporadically for a couple of years and tonight the plastic piece that keeps the attachments in place broke while I was blending a pot of soup.

Ok, you're probably wondering what are we chopping up with this thing, BRICKS?!? Oh, contrar, we use this to chop up my infant sons baby food, rather than purchase any of the suspect ready made stuff. The only reason that I gave them 1 star is because Amazon doesn't do fractions! I am satisfied that I will not buy anything EVER again with the name Cuisinart on it! To us, Cuisinart stands for stuff that you want to give to people that you really don't like.

However, I've been very disappointed. It did not chop things evenly at all, necessitating taking out bigger pieces for hand chopping. Then it failed to blend and when I checked to see if food was stuck in the blades, I found it wasn't turning at all. I was trying to blend fairly soft food. The final straw came when I tried to use the whisk and I could barely get it to turn at all. After suffering with this for many months, I'm getting rid of it. I wish Braun still made their very superior product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"This thing fell apart soon after we got it and had used it once or twice.

This unfortunately made it to only use number 2. It did a great job on blending soups but the plastic interior is really poorly made and began to strip quickly.

I reluctantly accepted it's fate as I couldn't find the warranty and threw the bowl attachment away. Then, yesterday, the blade would not spin when I was trying to puree my soup. The coupling, or where the attachment fits the handle, burned out again, literally just spun inside its casing until it smoked!

The chopper works perfectly for things like salsa, salad dressings, guacamole, dips and a quick (though somewhat uneven) veggie chop. It can't entire replace my large food blender/chopper, but it is SOOO much easier to pull out and do little dips, etc. The whisk is great though it would be better if it had 2 speeds. I find that the whisk is pretty powerful and tend to splatter things unless you use it *just* the right way. I don't use the blender as much, but the few times I have, it works fine.All around a great addition to the kitchen.

When I made my post-workout smoothie today it took me a few minutes to even get it to work then the motor housing was smoking like crazy. Totally annoyed for the money spent. I did use the chopper attachment one time to chop nuts and it was mediocre at best. Will invest in a cheaper model so if it craps out I won't be so mad.

This is how their \\"warranty\\" works."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor quality Hand Blender","review":"Initially I was quite excited about this product, as it is quite handy and useful for a variety of tasks. Unfortunately it has not lasted. The chopper I only used once on onions and then blade stopped rotating. I spent $10-15 for the replacement part, but unfortunately the replacement was no better. I ended up having to buy a black and decker chopper which has been great. The cusiniart motor works fine, but the rotating teeth are made of plastic and erode easily so it loses the rotary component. The same thing has now happened with the soup blender/smart stick - which I have been able to use a handful of times, but those days are over as well because the blade will not spin. It seems that other people have been happy with this product, maybe I got a faulty batch, but I am quite hesitant to buy cusiniart products now because of this unfortunate experience. They don't make things that last."},{"rating":"1","title":"Plastic teeth strip","review":"Don't let the brushed steel exterior fool you, the guts are all plastic. This thing feels solid, the motor gears have to be all ball bearings, but where the shaft connects to the gear housing, those gears are cheap-chintzy plastic and they stripped in 2 years of residential use making smoothies for myself maybe every other day during the summer. This thing is all show with no guts. If they build every exterior flashy part using stainless steel, at least make the tiny gears stainless steel, or shoot the shaft straight into the gear housing rather than having worthless attachments with plastic gears that strip too! This is a gross cost cutting dodge on Cuisinart part.Now, I'm going to buy a real hand blender, and spend the amount of money I should have spent in the first place."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great at first, but then falls apart","review":"I love Cuisinart products, and at first this stick blender was great. However after 4-5 uses all attachments start spinnning slowly and the stick starts wining (as if there is no resistance). Took a look, the internal connector is made out of plastic! Not really durable at all. Pay extra for the cool stainless steel look, but dealing with a plastic gearbox is asinine. Have called, and e-mailed CuisinArt, and cannot get a response from them = poor customer service. This stick blender is less than 6 months old...Shame on you Cuisinart"},{"rating":"1","title":"Sorry product, unworthy of the brand.","review":"I have purchased other Cuisinart products before.

The hand blender is great to use and easy to clean. The steel finish is very classy. We used it only few times before the chopper grinder attachment quits working about a year ago. Last week the blending shaft stopped working as well which was the end of my investment. The problem seems to be in the drive mechanism as it is manufactured from plastic. The teeth that connects the shaft of the blender to the motor breaks after several uses causing the blades to stop rotating. It is a flaw in the design. I would not recommend it for any one before cuisinart fixes it's design."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buy a different one...","review":"Yep same problem here - i just paid the $10 to get this repaired or replaced, I should have just skipped it and spent the $10 on a new one from somewhere else.I've had the same stripped teeth problem - the handle doesn't attach to any accessory - I've only had it 6 months! I can't see stripped teeth in the handle, but all I've ever made are soup and smoothies!! Used less than 10 times!Don't buy this if you can help it.

I always hated ladling chunky soup into the blender, thence into another bowl while I did further batches, making a mess at every stage. With this I did a big bowl of soup, put the hand blender into it and in maybe 15 seconds it was perfectly pureed. Moreover, a note in the manual led me to using it every morning to froth the almond milk I use in my latte, at which it does a fantastic job--again, 15 seconds or so and way better than you get at Starbucks (though a good barrista can still do a better job with steam). Terrific."},{"rating":"1","title":"Broke down after light use","review":"First, the plastic on the chopper bowl lid broke while I was trying to grate cheese (according to the directions). And then, after I replaced it (it took them 2 tries to ship out the correct part), something in the motor stopped working so that none of the attachments rotate at all (the motor is on though). This was a gift so I don't have a receipt. Cuisinart will not replace the motor under the warranty. Looking for a different brand now. It looks like it'll be sturdy, but it is not!"},{"rating":"1","title":"PIECE OF JUNK!","review":"If you're thinking of buying this product, please notice the large amount of 1 star reviews. Many customers, myself included, got a new blender that did not work at all. Aside from that, the attachments are terribly difficult to change out. I am young and have no arthritis but still struggle to remove the attachments. Only the whisk attachment works on mine. I haven't used it, just tested all the attachments when the chopper didn't work.

The less expensive version of this hand-held blender is much more user-friendly with a one-speed, 3-finger on switch."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stripped teeth on coupler","review":"One of mine also stripped the plastic gear. What a terrible design, the piece that gets the wear from inserting different tools and takes all the torque from the motor is made of an inadequate piece of plastic or nylon that strips out far too easily.

What a shame."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unrecommendable product","review":"Cuisinart CSB-77 Smart Stick Hand Blender with Whisk and Chopper AttachmentsAlthough bought two years ago, this blender had very little use and only for blending soup.

A product that has such high speed should not be using plastic teeth to join the attachments. Do not buy this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Junk","review":"I read reviews complaining that the plastic \\"teeth\\" to this blender wears down, rendering the whole thing useless. Well, even with the caveat, I purchased the item and sure enough -- few months later, the teeth wore down and I had to trash the blender and the chopper attachment. I wasn't happy with the blender even before -- it doesn't blend food at the bottom of the cup and the chopper attachment doesn't properly \\"grip\\" and chop the food -- but the plastic teeth thing is really ridiculous. An important component that attaches the motor to the blade should really be made better. This is a shoddy piece of equipment and I warn others to stay away. Cuisinart really needs better quality control and should be ashamed."},{"rating":"1","title":"versatile but poorly designed drive splines","review":"I have used this product for making smoothies, chopping fruits, making meringue, and many other things.

A great product that deserves its place in every kitchen. But after 6 months of regular use, the motor just died on us. We hadn't used it much for the first 6 months and by the time it died, it was past a year of use. So touch luck.I am not going to recommend a different product saying its better. I believe these products to have a limited shelf life and thus spending $50 on it instead of $20-$30 on inferior brands would really be no different.

The chopper barely worked from the start every time, and the whisk was pretty feeble and inconvenient to use, but I put up with those because the hand blender part was useful... the short time it lasted. The plastic teeth in the mechanism that makes it rotate get burned or deformed in some way, and it stops spinning all of a sudden. This can take a few weeks or months (I used mine quite a lot), but is definitely not worth it for the price (especially with the completely useless chopper and whisk attachments). I gave it 2 chances, and ended up returning it both times (to BB&B), so I am definitely not buying it again and would NOT recommend it to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Breaks after 4 months","review":"Don't buy this.

As my left index finger attempted to dislodge it my right hand squeezed the wand and the blade turned on. It all happened so fast. It has been a horrible injury that has disabled me. The pain was beyond what i could have imagined. It has been 6 months and i am still struggling to get mobility back.

So, this is to ask future reviewers who are dissatisfied with the product to be careful in what you say and be sure that your complaints aretruly due to the Cuisinart CSB-77 Smart Stick Blender being defective and not to user neglect or error.

I put it in a 20 degree bag in tempts of slightly less than 20. Slept on ice pack with a Thermarest pad and was surprisingly comfortable. It did feel nice to the touch.I really can't recomend this for anything other than sleep overs or a heated caabin type of camping.

It makes a great Spring, late summer, early Fall sleeping bag by itself (I was fine in the mid 50s). It is also excellent as a sleeping bag liner for the sub freezing nights if your sleeping bag is not rated that low. I am guessing, but I would say it adds about 15 degrees of warmth when used as a sleeping bag liner. Depends on the individual.The fleece is soft and feels fine when touching skin. The zipper has worked flawlessly and it has held up after 2 - 3 washings. Fits easily in the provided stuff sack.There are better options if you are looking for ultralight/backpacking solutions.

While sitting in my recliner, I pull the liner up over my feet (zipper edge down) for a roomy cover right up to my chin (I'm 5'11''), with plenty of length and width to spare.

I really wanted to play this game. It sounds and looks interesting. Too sad, too bad. The vender was great and offered to give back my money. The problem with this gme is that it was written for DX-6. I have DX-10. There is a patch to bring it up to DX8, but it wouldn't work.

We only sent them back because the finish, though very nice, was more of a chocolate/bronze hue or tint rather than the dark, espresso orb we had expected. It was too many shades difference to make it work. I do believe the fixtures we eventually went with are if lesser quality.

I've had this CD for years and have tried every so often to listen, thinking maybe I would appreciate it with time, but I cannot. It is a harsher sound, interesting, but not something I find easy to meditate or relax to. It has a totally different feel from Libana's other CDs, more Eastern European/Middle Eastern.

Her first album, Sellisternia (\`Feast of the Goddess') fuses elements of eletronica and acoustic instruments into a unique rhythmic experience.High Priestess defies the genre and the confines of conventional music combining her ethereal and haunting vocals with ambient, trance, jazz, psychedelic, Celtic, and world beats into a one of a kind sound.High Priestess is Pagan and her beliefs and style are echoed through out the album. The lyrics reflect her experience in spirituality, sex, and altered states of being through poetic verse and song.The most notable is \\"Oblivion, 1st Movement\\", a psychedelic-tribal hymn to the Goddess. For anyone who loves raves, world beats, Pagan themed music, or just wants something unique, Sellisernia is indispensable."},{"rating":"1","title":"It was not user friendly and then it broke!","review":"I broke and chipped most of my short fingernails trying to unlock where the keys are suppose to go.

Thanks to one of your reviewers I was able to figure this out. The key holders were so stiff I needed a needle nose pliers to open the holders. ( I am a man of reasonable strength) Not very practical when I get to the car dealership. After getting the holders open they needed to be adjusted or they would stay open. Perhaps the worse issue, is that many who gave this product a good rating, could not go back and adjust the star rating later after it broke. So the rating it got is artificially high. I will return it or throw it in the drawer with other bad ideas."},{"rating":"2","title":"MW312TN Genuine Leather Key Chain Holder Tan Wallet","review":"I needed to replace my similiar key chain holder wallet made by escort in Europe and finally found one that seemed to be perfect.

I'd recommend it to my friends."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Value, not the best","review":"Key holders do not come out of the wallet. they unclasp and the key comes out. A little cumbersome to add and remove keys. Works rather poorly with oversize ignitions keys for late model cars, but then again so does almost every key holder. Blame the automakers, not the key case makers for this problem.Big enough to carry a half a dozen cards of various types, along with some cash and reciepts.

This finally worked except that one of the hooks will no longer latch and is unusable. I am very disappointed.

She is so mature. The album is so hott!!!! I can't stop listening to track #2 \\"Does He Love Me\\" with Foxy Brown. What makes this album fun is that it carries many dance numbers like \\"Bad Boy\\", \\"Spinnin'\\", \\"Does He Love Me\\" & \\"Singles Night\\". Keshia also managed to place her other top 10 hits, \\"Unpredictable\\" and \\"Shook (The Answer)\\" on this album too. Keshia Chante really shows off her beautiful vocals in some balads too, such as, \\"True Colours\\" and \\"Come Fly With Me\\".

Either that, or I'm not sophisticated enough to know the difference between a German American favorite and an Oktoberfest favorite. Of course, there are more than 24 excellent pieces of German music, so it makes sense to add these 23 polkas, waltzes, schottisches, and marches to the list. Ah, yes, the schottische -- sort of a \\"skippy\\" polka, for those who have never heard one. It's getting to be a lost art, harking back to the days of Whoopee John Wilfahrt and the Six Fat Dutchmen. This CD is top-notch."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best inside account on the Simpson trial","review":"Professor Uelmen is doubly blessed. First, he has one of the finest legal minds in the country and, second, he writes in such a clear, cogent style that one need not be a lawyer to understand him. Despite knowing the outcome from the start, this book is a real page-turner. One cannot help but think that if the prosecution had a lawyer nearly as capable as Uelmen they might have won instead of the defense. But the best part of all is the insider's view: no other book on the trial comes close to explaining how the defense won a case that seemed at the outset to be unwinnable. Whether or not you agreed with the defense, this book demonstrates their superior lawyering."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dustbuster","review":"This portable Dustbuster works just fine, but now I wish I would have ordered the more powerful one.

After that, the battery dies and can't be re-charged. Customer service will no longer replace the product by mail -- you are required to drive to a service center (in my case, over an hour away and in a run-down neighborhood). Considering this happens to all Dustbusters now (this is my third), it is extremely disappointing to have a product that keeps failing, and won't be easily replaced. Why do I keep buying them if they keep dying, and CS is so poor? Because it's the best handheld vacuum out there (strong, cordless, easy to clean, etc.). Make sure to wait until you can get one at a heavy discount, so you won't be disappointed when you have to throw it out in a few months."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great hand vac, Battery ages over time","review":"Pros: Convenient and works very well for small pick ups. I paid about 20 -30 bucks for it, and it was definitely worth the price. I have used a comparable model of another brand and it didn't pick up squat.Cons: The battery life reduces over time. I have been using this for 2 years. I would say its life expectancy ranges from 1 to 2 years. It still works, but the suction force dwindles after the first few minutes. So I am back in the market for another product."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Good Value","review":"This hand vacuum picks up dust and dirt much more efficiently than the one we had before.

After a few months of weekly use (very light) the unit begins to slow down after about 30 seconds. Have attempted to buy new batteries but this seems impossible.

The solution to this is to keep your receipt and return the product back to where you bought it if you're not satisfied. In many cases the store manager (not the customer service clerk) may give you a store credit for your inconvenience even if it's past warranty. You must be insistent. If enough of this product (or any other) are rejected and returned by the customer in large quantities, eventually the quality will improve. For those of us who remember the junk coming over from Japan in the late 50's and early 60's, eventually no one whould buy \\"Made in Japan\\". The result was an improvement in Japanese products overall but not all of them, of course. Remember, you have the ultimate voice to insist on a quality product! Just be ready to pay a little more for it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just Awful!!!","review":"I was thrilled to have something for quick jobs.

At the time I bought it, they had a sale and I was able to get it for $9.99.This has lasted the past 4 years and still works like it did when I first bought it.I use this daily, we have 6 dogs, 1 toddler and 4 adults. We sweep 2-3 times daily and ave little messes on the carpet. This dust buster gets used a lot and it picks up sand, little pebbles, torn paper, etc....It keeps a good charge even 4 years later.

My opinion is that when I start this buster, what I have just picked up with it, comes out of the vents. I have changed the filters, as well as the filter types and with all the same results. Just seems that if I use this, I must take my larger vacuum out and go over the area again. Especially with younger children around the house, I want to make sure it is super clean. I like the size and recharging system. Cleaning this is dirty also. When the cover comes off, you must put your hands into the filter and remove the filter. Some filters, like the one I am currently using, can be cleaned and reused. I will be looking for another type. Sorry Dust Buster, but you busted this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Starts off great... but battery performance declines quickly","review":"We've had this vacuum for a little over a year.

Nearly impossible to empty the dirt tray. Paper filters to replace. And the dirt often fell out of the front nozzle. This one has great suction, is easy to clean, doesn't need filters and the dust enters the nozzle at an angle so it doesn't just fall back out if the front flap sticks open.On the downside it's a bit loud and along with the powerful suction it blows out a good bit of air which could be a problem in some applications. Very happy with this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Batteries Won't last","review":"I bought this just over a year ago and it worked great for the first few months.

I would have given it 5 Stars had I done a review in the first month of ownership. In less than a year of once a week use, you'll hear the motor rpm start dropping as soon as you turn it on. Vacuum power will be worthless in under a minute. Better to donate your money to a worthy cause and help save our landfills. At least I can say this product doesn't suck."},{"rating":"1","title":"PLEASE READ!!!

Iwould definitely recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"do not buy","review":"This product says it contains lead and you should wash your hands after use. It also says not to use around children. I returned it because of this."},{"rating":"1","title":"This product sucks!!!!","review":"I received this product and placed it in the charger and it turns out that the charger didn't work at all, or if it did there is no indication that it was even charging since the charging light didn't do anything. I called the manufacturer and got a replacement charger only to find out that that charger didn't work either. I assume the actual dustbuster was defective but was so tired of dealing with this product, I decided just to take the loss and didn't bother getting it replaced. What a waste of money!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Jack's dustbuster","review":"This was a gift to my brother and he is very pleased with the performance. The only objection is the cleaning of filter after each use. He said the recommended cleaning was to wash and let dry completely before the next use."},{"rating":"2","title":"Still evaluating ...","review":"I like the vacumm so far. Picks up well. Not too noisy. I had hoped it would run longer on one charge but it does last about 10 minutes as advertised. When plugged in to get re-charged, the little light comes on and stays on forever. You don't know how long you have to wait to use it again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad suction","review":"Our unit had pretty pathetic suction. I don't know if it was just one defective one or not, because we returned it and got the 14.4v one instead. That one is incredible!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Works great, at first...","review":"I have had this product for about 2 years. When we first got it, it worked great--lasted about 10 min. at a time. Now, we're lucky to get the floor cleaned up under the table before it starts to wear down. Also, the clip which holds it to the base just broke, and I see that I am not the first person to experience this problem. I don't see anywhere to buy a replacement base, at this time, so I may end up just throwing the whole thing away."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Hands Free Vacuum","review":"This unit has lots of power - compared to many other hand vacuums that I have previously owned. Much easier to to remove dirt trap compared to others as well. Good buy!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Battery life to about 2 min after a year of use","review":"When we initially got this product - it was great. The suction was strong and the battery life was long. Over the course of a year, the battery life has dramatically deteriorated. After a year, it only lasts about 2 minutes. The positive reviews are all from people who have had this only a short time. This is a disposable product - seeing that the battery isn't designed to be replaced."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Must Have","review":"I got this dust buster as a gift. I originally wanted it to make short work of the bird seed around my bird's cage, but i soon began to wonder how i lived without it. I don't even bother with a dust pan anymore, I just use this dust buster. I've used it for almost every vacuuming need, from crumbs on the table, even a bug or two...I've never had a problem with it holding a charge, although my charger is mounted in my laundry room and I only take it off the charger when I need it. I would recommend anyone to buy this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Would be good if not for the battery","review":"I can complain about the Dustbuster's nasty habit of lasting only 1 to 2 years, but what good would that do?

And to find out that you can't replace it. Very disappointing. Don't buy a dustbuster, unless you want to replace each and every year!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Battery life is 4 months tops","review":"My spouse operates this vacuum daily until the rechargeable nickel-cadium battery is dead to avoid any memory issues. Like the Black & Decker 15.6V CHV1560 cordless hand vacuum, the battery life is 4 months tops.Perhaps Black & Decker should replace the nickel-cadium battery with a rechargeable lithium-ion battery on all of their cordless hand vacuums."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't bust any dust","review":"After junking the Dust Buster 7.2V loser after about 10 months, I mistakenly bought the next more powerful one, the 9.6V version. It lasted about 4 month and wouldn't hold a charge. Buy another brand."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as great after a year","review":"I admit, this was a great vaccum for the year that I used it but after the year was up, its age started to show. It had a tremendous amount of power and could vaccum for up to 7 minutes before it started to die. At the end of its lifespan, it started to fade right after I started using it so I got about two minutes of slowly dying suction power.At this point, I've had it with cordless vaccums. I'm going to a corded model for now and leaving the cordless for the times when I need to pick up a few crumbs, as that's all it can do now."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for quick pick-ups","review":"This isn't the most powerful DustBuster out there. However, I use it daily for crumbs (and there are a lot of them), dirt, pet hair, and anything else that falls on the floor. It holds it's charge for several minutes and sucks up most everything. It is a little difficult to get all the debris out, but worth the price."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is a strong little vacuum","review":"I got this as a Gold Box Special on Amazon, so it was even less than the listed price, and it was really a bargain. It's a very strong little sweeper. It's great for sweeping the inside of the car. I especially like that I can just leave it plugged in without it overcharging. I'd buy it again."},{"rating":"2","title":"very good hand vacum","review":"we bought this vacum from walmart for 25 bucks about 6 months ago,actually it works great.my husband is using it for his new car and i use it for kitchen,the most important part to keep the suction power works as long as you can is to charge it for 3-4 hours and recharge it again but after fully emptying its charge [i mean after the battery is really dead] every time,and not to put it in plug after evey use,just after the battery is dead.ALSO it is not for big area cleaning.i recomend it to afriend."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not spend a penny on this book!","review":"This book and its main character, Inspector Banks, are the most boring, predictable book and character I have read in a long time.

I read all of Robinson and was delighted to see a \\"new\\" title. When I received it, it was familiar right away, but I knew I had not read any book by this title. This is a Pan paperback publication, and Final Account is an American publication. I expected the Final Account copywright page to list \\"Previously published as...\\", but it was not there. It was not possible to \\"look inside the book\\" to get the copywright date, so I don't know how you would have avoided this error, except to have read the reviews. Actually, it was ok the second time around!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Top Quality Mystery","review":"A mild mannered accountant is found brutally murdered in the garage of his country home, with his wife and daughter tied up inside the house. That is how this entertaining Inspector Banks mystery begins. We soon find out that things are not quite what they may first appear, and Inspector Banks and staff begin their winding path towards the truth.I have read several Banks mysteries, and although not my favorite, it is still very entertaining. Banks is, as usual, a great fictional detective. Robinson breathes life into the English countryside, and his characters are all fully developed. Robinson ranks up there with the best mystery writers today, and this installment is recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bloody barbaric detectives","review":"Oh my gosh,this book was a pain.The first 200 pages were ok but after that,the story loses heat and dragged on without a plot.The writing was mediocre and lazy as if he were in a rush to finish this book.Also,Banks was a very unlikeable character.He was lusting after Pamela when he was already married,he got into a fight in a pub and he came across as a very unsentimental man.Other than that,the detectives in this book,other than Susan,were just plain barbaric.They acted like criminals instead of detectives.And the part about the \\"shaved pussies\\"was totally disgusting.All in all,the book was a pain to read.The contrived plot,mediocre writing plus all the unlikeable characters just make this a very bad book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sixth Book in the Series","review":"It was the middle of the night when Chief Inspector Alan Banks arrived at the barn and saw Keith Rothwell for the first time or perhaps it would be better to say what was left of him. A short time earlier two masked men had brought the quiet accountant out of his farmhouse and blasted him with a shotgunIt was pretty obvious that this was a pre-meditated killing, the sort that a large wad of cash could buy, no questions asked, but Rothwell was not the sort of person to make enemies, certainly not ones that wanted to kill him. The investigation only muddies the water even more.The deeper Banks digs the more he wanders what lies beneath the surface of the apparently happy and contented Rothwell family.

But the shows...gosh.

Yet on EVERY SINGLE PAGE, the phrase \\"I've got\\" is used when \\"I have\\" would be grammatically more precise. Also, a picky point: the author rhymes \\"engineers\\" and \\"ears.\\" Sorry, but \\"eers\\" and \\"ears\\" don't rhyme; they're the SAME SOUND.

Slave Zero on the ultimate Dreamcast \\"ROCKS!\\" Let me start off by saying that this game has to be the BEST designed mech game I have ever played. Good stuff: The graphics are gorgeous. The gameplay is the most rounded seen in a videogame. Cool fast mech action. Addictive multiplayer. Good sound effects.Bad stuff: No online capabilities. When there is a lot of enemies the framerate slows down to about 30fps instead of standard 60fps inside of other dreamcast games. But there is so much action you hardly notice.BOTTOM LINE : BUY IT! YOU'LL LOVE IT!"},{"rating":"1","title":"get a different game","review":"When I saw this in the store, I thought it looked like a pretty cool game. The graphics are pretty good but the gameplay is terrible. It takes way to long to load scenes and because of this, I just can't get into the game. About 10-20 minutes is all I can take. There are lots of other Dreamcast games out there that are better than this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yowsers-- this game is not very good","review":"With a framerate that slows to a crawl and a less-than-engaging linear design, Slave Zero is a very disappointing game. The graphics are nice-looking, but actually playing the game will make you feel like you're watching a slide show. It makes me wonder how it got all these good reviews. My guess?

There was a lot to like here, but after all is said and done, action fans will be well served to hold back their hard-earned bucks for the likes of Kain 2 or MDK2 than put down the dough for this one. It's pretty obvious that the game's intent got lost somewhere between publishing deadlines, and the game could have been so much more.

Kwong's book, however, is a welcome change. His prose exudes wisdom, simplicity, sincerity, sensitivity, and warmth. Kwong's chapters gracefully navigate through various topics and bring the reader full circle, gently reminding him of the lesson he is bringing to the table. No Beginning, No End is written with incredible clarity; it is unadorned and highly accessible. Kwong has a lot to say, and he brings his collected thoughts to readers with an impressive degree of compassion and love. Quite simply, this is a beautiful, beautiful book."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Path With Heart","review":"This warm little book by Jakusho Kwong-roshi of the Sonoma Mountain Zen Center is comprised of insightful, touching, affectionate and almost invariably humorous teisho collected by Kwong-roshi's students throughout the years.Kwong, a disciple of Shunryu Suzuki (Zen Mind, Beginner's Mind) takes his master's teachings one (or more) steps beyond in NO BEGINNING, NO END. Each short essay is a lovely prose-poem.The reader knows, just from perusing ZEN MIND, BEGINNER'S MIND that Suzuki was a truly enlightened master---so with Kwong. This book is greatly recommended just for its air of gentle bemusement, which is, after all, the intimate heart of Zen by definition."},{"rating":"2","title":"thanks!","review":"this was exactly as shown, very good quality & i will buy more. they are beautiful. forcing me to write more than i have to say will result in fewer reviews from me."},{"rating":"2","title":"No Ego","review":"While this book may lack any new insight into Zen, it is most intimate. Jakusho Kwong expresses his thoughts and beliefs of Zen with very little ego, which is different from many of the Zen books I have read. This book is definitely worth the read to gather the sense of intimacy one needs with Zen. While I have noticed that many Zen teachers \\"book style\\" is much different from their actual teaching style, this does not seem to be the case with Roshi Kwong. After listening to several of his podcasts, he seems to have a consistent teaching style--very laid back and very little of his ego intermixed in the teaching.I hope that Roshi Kwong writes another book.

Laced with caustic wit and cunning observations of the underside of modern urban life, Reed certainly illustrates how powerful a negative influence can be on an innocent person.

This is a compelling novel with a solid story."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Face Without a Heart","review":"Rick Reed's fourth effort, a modern-day retelling of Oscar Wilde's \\"Portrait of Dorian Gray,\\" is a compelling and horrific examination of depravity and behavioral excess.

In all honesty i have never heard somebody so versatile with styles. Like you could stock it in every genre in a record store and still would fit like a glove. Like, every song sounds different, not one is comparable to the other, one is rap, the other is rock, the one after that is an acoustic solo, the next is an acapella, then a pop song, then a reggae song, its crazy. I'd say that anybody wether a hiphop fan or not will find something great that K-os has to offer in this amazing treat. Buy it for your grandma next Christmas holiday..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting style","review":"It reminds me of reggae style beach music.

The neutron bomb essentially releases a short burst of radiation with a low half-life that leaves buildings standing...basically a weapon which allows you to destroy the enemy without destoying buildings or leaving a nuclear waste. Dr. Cohen outlines the political difficulties associated with the development of the weapon and strategic application. A must read for any strategist or nuclear activist of any kind."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sadly, a must read on the subject","review":"Yes, I have read this book. And yes I have read other books on the neutron bomb (I will spare the jargon), nuclear policy, and Cold War history.Sam Cohen out-Tellers Teller here, making the case for how his technological child would play well with others on the battlefields of Western Europe. This book is, first and foremost, a marketing scheme for the product...the product being the neutron bomb.I find the section in which tank crews are described as being (somehow) zombified after irradiation especially disturbing. Make no mistake about it, the neutron bomb, or any enhanced radiation weapon, is as morally bankrupt an invention as the most deviously injurious of landmines.Sure, read this book--too bad everybody has not read it--but make sure you read other studies as well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of money","review":"This was a HUGE waste of money.

It's a waste of time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing comedy","review":"An incredible cast is mostly wasted in this lackluster comedy.

A few genuinely funny moments, though, and Nell Carter is a hoot."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unmoved By Telekenesis Comedy","review":"What do you call a comedy that's not funny? A must to avoid. This film struggles desparately to make you chuckle. I laughed maybe once in a scene where Chevy Chase's character, an air traffic controller with newfound powers, induces an orgasm in his girlfriend (Patti D'Arbanville) without physically touching her. A lot of the blame for the film's failure is in the performance of Chase. We are told, by other characters natch, that he is a cold heartless manipulator. There's nothing in his performance to suggest that. Chase's work here is pretty bland and one note as though he wishes he were somewhere other than here. I can relate because you can do better than watching \\"Modern Problems\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"An all time comedy classic","review":"This is a must have for any Saturday Night Live alum. fan.

His later movies (like the \\"Vacation\\" series) are in a different league altogether. The actors all seemed to be asleep at the wheel in this one, probably due to the weird plot and uninspired directing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Listen before job interviews or after break-ups","review":"This is a musical pep talk. Songs about being a better person, setting your sights on something better and realizing what a great person you are could work wonders. The Resolution album had an optimism that was pretty revolutionary for a rock album. I can't think of one that comes close in that respect-please let me know if you can. The track that hit me hardest when I got this in the 70's was \\"Can't Stop My Love\\". I had just lost my dad and it was a very healing song for me.

I bought this CD from Amazon, wondering if I'd feel the same way about it...If anything, I appreciate it more now.The artist depicts that giddy ecstasy of first love as well as anyone I've heard (\\"If You Could See Yourself,\\" \\"Karen's Song\\") but there are many moods expressed on this album, and a compositional sophistication that's rare in pop music. (Check out the coda that finishes \\"Constant Heat\\"--sheer genius.) The song that was the biggest revelation to me, years after first hearing it, was \\"Can't Stop My Love.\\" If I'm not mistaken, it's a plaintive farewell to a deceased or estranged parent. Startling, soul-bearing stuff.If you're a diehard cynic you'll probably hate this album, but for all the hopeful romantics out there, this is something to treasure."},{"rating":"2","title":"Annointed","review":"I am sure it's excellent.

Had she arrived on the music scene 10-15 years later, she probably would have been one of the most successful female musicians. Instead, she is probably best remembered for her role as Leather Tuscadero on the tv sitcom 'Happy Days'. However, for those interested in some great rock music, Suzi provides it.Suzi injects such passion and enthusiasm into her performances. The band is tight and keeps along with Suzi's energy.My favorites are 'Devil Gate Drive' and 'Stumblin' In', but all of the songs on this CD are awesome. This is a great CD to play in a car with the windows rolled down on a sunny afternoon.Suzi was a pioneer in female rock and roll history. If you ever get the chance to see Suzi perform, do not miss it.

I re-read the ending three times and I'm still not sure I know what happened. You turn the page to the last chapter, and think, 'am I missing some pages?' or 'is this some kind of misprint or something?' It just makes no sense.

Mary Brown maintains a fatalistic viewpoint on everything and she has a heroine who, when faced with a really bad situation, can't do anything about it. Summer couldn't expose the fact that the king slept with her beloved knight's fiancee in the first one, so of course she can't get rid of the annoying boy who destroys her love utterly in the second book.If you're looking for a miserable depressing book, read this series!

That reader, such as myself, often feels that the characters are at the service of some \\"hard science\\" idea: they are useful gadgets to help bring life to Mars, peer into alien ships, or--in this case--get going a space elevator.

These occurrences are related to the death of a woman that the seven friends once knew and it seems that the same dead woman is returning to them. The dead woman's return seems to be linked to a videotape that they all know about, but the question lies in what is on the tape. Nightmare is a horror film with some eerie moments and gruesome scenes, but the awkwardness of the story removes the engaging theme and leaves a flat cinematic experience as the suspense rests solely on separate incidents."},{"rating":"1","title":"Basic Lessons in Archaeological Method Needed","review":"This would have been a good read like the previous Violet novels and I would have given it high marks for the Incan cultural content, but Woodworth needed to study archaeology too and he obviously doesn't know the first thing about it. How do archaeologists think about sites? How are artifacts evaluated? There's a major plot point that deals with archeology. Woodworth's lack of knowledge in this area, kills the credibility of his story from the outset."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good adventure set in Peru","review":"I have read the two previous books of Stephen Woodworth but almost skipped this one when I read the overwhelmingly negative reviews. I am glad that I gave the book a chance. It is a departure from the first two books, which dealt with serial killers.

It is a good adventure story."},{"rating":"2","title":"Each book in the series is better than the last!","review":"Having read the first three of Stephen Woodworth's \\"Violet\\" books..I am completely addicted!

If you are into this series, you'll want to at least read this but if the next one is this bad, goodbye Violets."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pitiful - One of the worst training videos ever purchased","review":"This video was AWFUL! First, the production quality was poor. It was recorded in a dojo with hardwood floors and the sounds was almost unintelligible. But the content, in my opinion, was worse - it focused on teaching a single two stick kata which was described as a soft style dance. There were a few demonstrations of double stick warm up exercises like you would learn in an Arnis course, but almost nothing in the way of technique, strike, or block training. There were a few techniques for using the sticks against an opponent using a Bo staff, but this is not a complete weapons training course by any means. I will not be buying any videos from this author in the future."},{"rating":"1","title":"Strictly Kata","review":"Poor sound quality. If you are a member of this style, you might be able to learn the Kata. But the instructor is not a good teacher of kata. After the first half of the tape, there is rote expansion of how the kata could be used in kata. This is not a substitute for a combat stick fighting video. I will be looking into escrima."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a very complete instruction video.","review":"Nitan Bo Combat Stick Fighting... according to the description of this dvd \\"Each kata is expertly performed and every aspect of each weapon is completely explained including combative applications.\\"However, I agree with the review that says, \\"Pitiful - One of the worst training videos ever purchased.\\"The dvd gives a cursory view of some movements, but it is as if the \\"author\\" is trading on his belt ranking and his reputation... but the general audience are not members of his dojo, and are less impressed. I don't know where the five star ratings come from. Perhaps they have a different video? After viewing the dvd, I came away with little that I could use.The author seems somewhat older than perhaps optimum, and this video might be more effective and complete were he to train a student to demonstrate movements more comfortably."},{"rating":"1","title":"could be better","review":"This tape has several problems that one would think should not be. The first is sound quality. Alexander was not miked and you can barely hear him on the tape. When you can hear him his voice echoes through the dojo making him hard to understand.Another problem with this tape is the lack of a slow-motion performance of the kata. Although Alexander performs the kata at a slower pace, some of the subtle movements are hard to follow. In addition, his expanation of the moves is lacking. It appears as though there is an assumed base understanding of the kata.The reviews of the DVD are much better than the reviews of the VHS. Perhaps the slow foward options on the DVD help make up for the lack of a slow-motion performance. Given the option, going for the DVD may be a wiser choice."},{"rating":"1","title":"DVD blank, returned to company five weeks ago, not replaced","review":"I ordered the DVD over five weeks ago.

Looked at it from that perspective of knowing who it was by this time w/out knowing that I had read it. I knew that I had read it because I remembered Marie's cracking peach nail polish. I have remembered that image forever; it has been echoing in my mind. I think that I was skimming the book, and hadn't read the personal part before too. So, if I remembered parts of the book after probably 7 years, this has to be an extraordinarily poetic book. After I read the book, I remember thinking maybe I should become a psychologist (i really don't know what i am going to do yet, but the book really did make an impression on me nevertheless). So, this book deserves really to be in any library, and not on the basis of the author graduating from that school! The author comes across as being very compassionate and well spoken. She writes like an angel."},{"rating":"2","title":"Talented Author","review":"Earlier this year, I was cleaning out boxes left over from my son's life at U-Dub and snagged a few books that he had read during his undergrad years as a Husky. This one looked interesting, so I stuck it in my pile of on deck books. Last week I finally got around to Welcome to my country.I was pleasantly surprised by Slater's depiction of her clients. Not only are her descriptions interesting, humorous and deeply impactful, she is obviously a very talented writer, honest, humble and insightful. Should I ever struggle with a significant mental illness, will someone please find Lauren to help me? If all mental health professionals cared deeply for their clients/patients as does Slater - we might have made more headway with those who suffer in their own solitary world, often without hope and terribly misunderstood.One strong suggestion - make sure to read this book to the end fully and to the end.

I will not go into detail, but things like debugging memory problems or finding where your application crashed (in the source code level) having the crash address, to deadlocks and multithreading.- The best chapter in the book in my openion is the multithreading and deadlock analysis. The best treatment in a book. Its coverage is even better than John Robin's book.If you have to buy only one book about debugging, buy this one.

I can hear the style difference on bass, so if you like Boston for Fran Sheehan's work alone, you can probably skip this one.

Some of the material covered on gaming I have seen in early and I mean earlier books. To have a book released in 2003 and not cover or even mention Java 3D or OpenGL is shameful. I don't know what the reason for releasing a Game Programming book without covering modern material is beyond me but perhaps the comments by one of the authors that the primary reason for the book was to make money is the clue.

After about two weeks, it completely stopped recording DVD+R discs, though it would play back ones I previously recorded. I used Memorex and Sony. I tried a DVD lens cleaner with no effect. Because I bought the unit refurbished, RCA won't support it. The on-screen also doesn't work with a Dish DVR receiver, but that's minor. Fortunately it does still record on DVD+RW media and I can still get a 25 DVD spindle of them for under $10.00, so it's not a killer. On the bright side, I've recorded a ton of movies from the satellite and even in Normal Mode(4hr) it blows away VHS. Mostly I record in either 2hr or 3hr depending on the length of the movie. I can live with the fan noise. Also I only paid $128 for it and have gotten my money's worth out of it already.

The book is light on facts and analysis, but heavy on opinion. Most of the chapters just restate contemporary criticisms of contemporary management decision-making (e.g., greed). The authors have very little to say about warning signs and the accounting used by management to mislead investors. Those wanting a more substantive analysis of the issues and the perspective of an insider should read Arthur Levitt's new book, \\"Take on the Street.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Highly Recommended!","review":"In another era, we might have been tempted to shrug off How Companies Lie as just another polemic against corporate greed. In the wake of Enron, Global Crossing, Tyco and a host of other corporate scandals, however, we must (sorrowfully) admit that this book is as timely as it is insightful. Readers will gain much from the book's explanation of some of the actual accounting techniques that companies use to mislead investors, as well as its advice on how to spot telltale signs that a company might be cooking the books. While financial and accounting experts might find this analysis a bit basic, we from getAbstract recommend this book to all general business readers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your time","review":"This book is far too preachy and repetitive.

The writing was dry, confusing, and I was often pausing to look up words (both English and Sanskrit). I would only recommend this book if you are a scholar interested in reading every translation of the Yoga Sutras, or if you are a devoted friend of the author. I bought this book as a required text for a class. It turns out the writer (translator) is a friend of the teacher who assigned our reading list. What a disappointment!

The low light performance is not stellar but in a dimly lit room I've been happy with the results. Magic pix, low light setting, is fun but not really practical for moving objects. The 30x zoom is great! The digital stabilizer works pretty well up to 20x but beyond that you'll need a tripod. Still pics are fun and suitable for email but not clear enough to print for the photo album. If you want clear stills you'll have to spend $$.

The test questions are totally unrelated to the practice exam of this book. Almost all the questions are scenario questions. I suggest that you need additional references beside this book.Furthermore, this book is hard to understand. I have re-read so many times. The wording is poor. There are about 20% mistakes on the practice exam questions of this book. The reason I did not add additional references is that if you study the book from cover to cover, there is no doubt you passthe exam---I WAS WRONG.WARNING: The OCP exam had 2-4 long sentences each question with a multiple choice from A-F (2-3 answers).

If you need a good basic introductory text on PHP look to the 56 other PHP titles Amazon stocks. The examples in this one are unclear, the treatment of most topics is incomplete. While the introductory chapters provide an interesting overview of PHP's functionality, it cannot be depended on as a faithful reference for day-to-day use.Just compare its treatment of classes or data types to that in other texts. Or give a careful read to functions that require careful documentation-like formatting of dates. The book just leaves you confused or in the dark.

They fixed it within the 90 day warranty. Works great since then.As far as the camera itself, very nice. Video and still picture quality in daylight are sharp with very nice colors. It's fairly easy to use with many auto and manual functions. Contrary to instructions, it seems it works as webcam on Macs (OS 10.3).A few drawbacks- the 0 lux feature captures 1 frame per second to enhance light capture making video very choppy and virtually useless for veiwing; manual focusing w/joystick can be a bit difficult; does not come with memory card, tapes or firewire cable (neccessary to download video at least on Macs).Still recommend this camera as good compromise of quality and price."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tiny Camcorder works well, but controls are not intuitive","review":"I purchased the Panasonic Camcorder to record my son's wedding and, for the most part, I was well pleased. The quality of still and moving photos as good, and the size and weight of the unit make it very portable and relatively unobtrusive. The package that includes the camera, however, does not include a memory card for the still photos or any tapes for the motion shots, these added another $60 or so to the cost. The controls are not grouped in a way that makes operating the camera (zooming in and out, turning it on and off, etc.) particularly easy or intuitive and the icons that appear in the screen when using the joystick are also not intuitive, thus one must memorize all the various symbols."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another Vote to Avoid this Camera","review":"I agree with the previous reviews that my camera acquired serious focus problems after about 15 months, in every video we own you can hear me complaining about the focus.

If it were to be turned into a plot diagram, the line would perhaps rise to a little hill, before plummeting down to a stop. I have the feeling Mazer is running out of ideas, so she will simply recycle all her old ones, and stick them in a middle school environment. I know I'm getting bored with all her cute little wittisms, and all her identical characters that make up this poor series. The ending, too, had little profundity, leaving too many strings untied.

Example Miss Elizabeth: They focused on her first run with Macho Man Randy and her premature death, but did not even mention or show footage of her 4 year run in WcW where she served as valet for Ric \\"freaking\\" Flair and The NwO at the height of their popularity! Another woman, Sunny although they showed footage the DVD never acknowledged that after her WWE run and before her personal decline Sunny went on to be Tammy and had a memorable run with her late husband Chris Candido.

Once believing that our unconscious was a separate self, repressing sexual urges and manifesting desires through maladaptive ways, Wilson (through research might I add), discusses what the role of the adaptive unconscious is in maintaining our cognitive functioning.My only complaint is that he uses WAY too many literary examples to illustrate his points. Although I believe this is an attempt to make the book more readable from a layman's point of view, it comes at the cost of making the theories presented seem unfounded and even over-expressing the conclusions that we can draw from research.

Even though the volume is at 50, I can set my TV (Samsung S6187) volume to be 20 and it sound louder than the Bose Accousticmass 10 center speaker that I have right over the top of the TV.

If anybody else have this receiver, please let me know the volume level you set to get the loudness you want."},{"rating":"1","title":"Junk","review":"As a former Sony fan, I bought one of these because of the HDMI switching. Sadly, the thing could not reliably detect and decode a Dolby Digital bitstream from my Sony HD DVR. I had to either turn the unit off and on or switch back and forth between different inputs to get any audio. And the auto speaker setup didn't work very well. Pioneer and Yamaha receivers do a much better job with that. Also, the supplied remote would not accept some of the programming codes in the manual no matter how many times I tried. (And I have programmed a lot of remotes without any problem.) In my opinion, Sony doesn't care about quality like they used to.EDIT: I always read the manual and I have installed many receivers from various brands and never had one not recognize a Dolby bitstream. Sounds like junk to me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disappointing","review":"I had great expectations when purchasing this receiver, based on it's 700 watts of power for each speaker. After connecting and powering up, I had to turn the volume way up to drive the speakers. I expected a very powerful sound with this kind of power, not what I was experiencing. It was almost as if there was something keeping the power from driving the speakers. I had a 200 watt stereo hooked up before this, and it did a better job. Perhaps I had a faulty unit, but it was returned yesterday and I am not one to return items."},{"rating":"1","title":"save your money","review":"This is one of Sony's disasters. They design and market an HDMI amp where the HDMI doesn't function. You can't have surround sound thru the HDMI connections. You would have to run component cables to achieve this. So what's the point with the HDMI??? A joke. The speaker connects are very poorly designed too. You have to clamp down hard to secure the wires, hoping the plastic knob doesn't brake in the process. Go with Denon or JVC if you're thinking HDMI."},{"rating":"1","title":"over complicated piece of junk!!","review":"HDMI??????? 7.1??????? I have just spent the better part of 3 hours working on this POS and I'm no better off now then when it was in the box. This is not true HDMI when you need additional cabling just to get volume.

The HDMI passthrough did not work with my toshiba dvd recorder however as the toshiba has circutry that attempts to verify the HDMI connection before using it and it could not do this. I am not sure how many similar items verify the connection first but you may want to check your components first. Also I found the auto-calibrate feature to be innacurate in several ways. It biased the speaker balance to the left side and it was definately left heavy while listening to music. Also it left the subwoofer and surround speakers active even though I only have two front speakers and it specifically tests for this. Oh well. I like to adjust it myself anyway. Not a great loss. Don't be intimidated by the recievers feature set. Dive in head first and get used to it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sony Receiver","review":"I also purchased this product because of the quality of the receiver made by Sony.

I am glad I found it in Amazon."},{"rating":"1","title":"extremely disappointed","review":"I am completely disappointed with this receiver. The HDMI pass through would be a great feature if it actually worked properly. The problem I am having is that it allows feedback between the two devices linked through the receiver.

Spend your money elsewhere it would be a wiser investment."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"HDMI passthrough is a good thing\\"...SAY WHAT???","review":"picture a plasma display. or lcd. or projection...it doesn't matter. Now, you have a Blu-Ray player, HD-DVD player, DirectTV HD receiver - it doesn't matter. These are all generating HD contect to be displayed by an HD display . Throw in the DG800 in the middle, and you've LOST your 6:1 sound - pass-through means that any HDMI content will NOT be processed by your home theatre receiver...and this is a GOOD thing? Gimmee a break. And don't throw out \\"you can use optical\\"...sure you can...but you drop back to 5:1 DD. TOTALLY defeats 1/2 the value and purpose of HDMI. Bottom line, Sony threw in HDMI so that they could say that they have it. They'll come back in a latter rev of this receiver and actually implement it. Until then, this receiver is a joke, as is any receiver that does HDMI pass-through."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sony HDMI","review":"I purchased this receiver at Best Buy 3 days ago.

Lucy did not read as the same person as in the others. The mystery was hidden beneath a very cozy description of the real life of a working mother. Although it is very accurate, it does not make for a good mystery. I did not get to know any of the characters well enough to have the least idea what the outcome would be.

Her children are lazy brats who manage to get into all sorts of trouble. This time, they bring home their awful friends to make life even more miserable. Her husband is insecure and selfish.

Furthermore... if you read their online instructions they are miles away from what is written in their manualI'm a bit upset... and here goes my reviewThanksP"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Nice Pressure Cooker Set","review":"The \\"trivet\\" doesn't seem very useful, but the rest of the set is great. Had to read the instructions and practice a bit, and I used Miss Vickie's \\"Test Drive\\" procedure [...] for familiarization. Since then, we have been cooking under pressure several times a week for the past 6 weeks. No problems whatsoever. Been pressure cooking more than 30 years and this is a nice improvement over my old aluminum Mirro 6 quart with the rocker weight. These new stainless steel Fagor rigs use a spring loaded relief valve to maintain 15 psi. Smooth cover action too... just lube with veg oil, occasionally, and pay attention to the key mark alignment. When cleaning, I remove the operating valve per instructions, but so far it has remained clean and free of particlesI like it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Made in China!?!???","review":"Picked the Duo Combi set because I had read that the Duo Combi, Express, and Futuro were made in Spain. Imagine my surprise when I received a box with \\"Made in China\\" on it. VERY disappointed, as I paid more for the Duo Combi than I could have paid had I gone with another set. I have yet to bring it home or to try it. Maybe that will change my mind. Will update rating once I've used it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Be aware the cooker","review":"There is some black metal power fall off the valve. Every time after cook, you can notice it by rub the valve under the Lid. It will be very obvious when you cook rice, there will be black power on the rice after you cook. Even I do not think it is lead, but the powder looks very like lead and feel like lead. No mater what it is, it is always not good to have those powder on your food every time you cook and the valve will very likely be eroded soon. I contact with the manufacture but no response."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't get this!","review":"We received one of these as a gift. About 1.5 years after getting it my wife was cooking a pork bottom roast and the black parts (which are made of plastic) melted while she was cooking making the whole thing unusable. As if that alone wasn't bad enough, when she called them to try to exchange it for another they refused. Their customer service and commitment to they product SUCKS!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not buy - does not seal reliably","review":"I purchased the Fagor Duo set a couple of months ago. It has been nothing but trouble. It is incredibly hard to seal, often it won't seal at all. We are using this to make baby food so I keep trying to use it, but often it takes 20 minutes or more of messing around with the seal and the lid if I do manage to get it sealed. I'm a very handy person and a passionate cook, this should not be as difficult as it is. Often, when I put on the lid, the little yellow button will start to rise, but the moment I slide the unit closed, the seal is lost. It is so frustrating. The design is flawed.I don't know if there are better units or models, but the set I purchased from Amazon is garbage and a total waste of money. Spare yourself the frustration, burns and time and find something else."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the money","review":"I purchased this item 10/2011 and used it twice. On high heat the handles melt and give off horrible fumes!! Only use on low flame which takes a much longer time to reach correct pressure. Do Not Buy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Parts keep breaking","review":"We have bought a duo set in Bed Bath and Beyond. In less than a year the lower part of the handle broke, and the replacement costs around $15.It is now about 3 years that we own this pressure cooker and the valve has broken and it will cost me $16 to get a replacement part.I find it very annoying that such an expensive item keeps being costly over time. I guess it is great for Fagor to keep the money flow in, but they sell themselves as beeing Green, and therefore they should not use parts made to break every year or two!!!!Other than that, all the nice things written by other reviewers are true."},{"rating":"2","title":"I'm so happy I bought the combination set","review":"I spent a lot of time looking at reviews before I bought a pressure cooker. I investigated the premium brands, but wasn't sure if I would use a pressure cooker often enough to justify the premium prices. I finally went the middle-of-the-road route, and bought the Fagor Duo combination. Great choice for us. These are serious pots -- I've made a few coconut milk curries, and no scorching on the bottom of the pans. Stews and soups are fantastic -- it really does taste like you've been cooking all day. The smaller pot makes perfect pilaf in just a few minutes. The only downside is that I find sometimes the pressure gauge doesn't \\"pop\\" on its own immediately -- when I see lots of steam by the handle, and squeeze the bottom and top handles together, it usually pops up. Small issue though, really. The food has been fantastic."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fragile Handles or Poor Packaging?","review":"I purchased this pressure cooker set for my wife this past Christmas and the set arrived with broken handles. The handles on both pots were shattered and in multiple pieces. Due the positive reviews of the product, I did not hesitate to request a replacement which finally arrived today on January 10th. To our disappointment, the handles on the smaller pot arrived broken and in pieces again for a second time! Fagor's internal packaging clearly seemed inadequate to safeguard the contents during shipping. At the same time, it made my wife and I wonder about the durability of the handle material. Very frustrating to say the least. Buyer beware!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great pressure cooker combo","review":"I've had it for almost 2 years now. It's a fantastic set and I use it at least a few times a month. I also use the pots (and glass lid) for non-pressure cooking; they are great sizes. The pot bottoms are really thick and great to cook with. It's one of my \\"Go To\\" pieces of cookware and I would get the same set again in an instant if it ever got lost or broken.NOTE: This set comes with a silicone gasket which lasts far longer than the rubber gaskets I've used with other pressure cookers. When it's time to replace it you'll need the 10-inch gasket. You might want to order a spare if you're ordering this.To a few other reviewers: if you smell the plastic handle burning, it's NOT the pan's fault; it's yours. You have it on a burner that's too large for the pan bottom."},{"rating":"2","title":"The most important piece of kitchen equipment you will ever own.","review":"It's true. It's the most important piece of kitchen equipment you will ever own. Just go buy one right now."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wife loves them. Watch the handles.","review":"My wife loves these pressure cookers. She uses them for both pressure and normal cooking. Heavy bottom plate really evens out the head. Like other reviews, watch the handles, while not fragile, they are quite breakable but can be replaced."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Product!!","review":"I grew up with my mom always using a pressure cooker and this was the first time I bought and used one.I had to get the technique right with using a electric oven. It's best to use 2 elements one on high and move the cooker to a element on low as soon as it's in pressure.It's very safe and easy to use. Can't wait to make some cheesecake!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheap handle and valve needs replacing often","review":"Fagor leads you to believe their pressure cookers are advanced and have some sort of genius European engineering. I bought the marketing and purchased a Fagor Duo. It works, but no better than other brands I've had in the past. The handle is cheap. I constantly have to tighten it with a philips screw driver. Worse, the valve doesn't stay put. It dropped out, broke and Fagor will not replace it. This is a $20 part. Buy any brand but Fagor."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fagor does not back up its product","review":"I bought this product in August, and used the smaller pot right away. It works well. For Thanksgiving, I finally had cause to use the larger pot to pressure cook pumpkin for pumkin pie. As I was cleaning the pot, over the sink, it slipped from my hands, fell a couple of inches into the sink and the handle broke in several pieces!To my mind, a handle should be able to endure a bump on the sink! I wrote to Fagor, and their response was--go buy the replacement part. I really think it sucks that their handles are so cheap!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Love this cooker","review":"I bought this set of pressure cookers over a year ago. It is the most used appliance I have ever owned. I have used it for chicken, roast, saurkraut and pork. Vegetables turn out great. It all turned out delicious. It does not burn things. The clear glass lid is an excellent addition to this set. Buy this set and you will love it.

The characters have very little depth. Trains are used for traveling between planets instead of spaceships, with no explanation. The trains must always travel along specific paths, except when they don't. These trains carry functional spacecraft, but they are only used as weak attack craft. Main character wants to be a soldier/cop, but insists on using a non-functional gun. There are trains that render you dead if you accidentally get on them. The trains can be destroyed with very little effort, and frequently are, but people still want to ride them. All the problems are apparently caused by one particular alien in a vast galaxy wide invasion force. The ending seems forced, like they got bored and just decided to end it, killing off most of the regular cast, in one last grand bang."},{"rating":"2","title":"Carpenter music fans should buy this.","review":"This is probably the best in the Carpenter/Howarth association.The strict usage of synths to produce the broad spectrum of sound in 1987 is amazing!Carpenter's simple thematic (but effective) style is brought to scary life aided by Alan Howarth's studio wizardry.I have to say that the soundtrack is better than the mediocre film."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very cute, but WAY smaller than expected.","review":"I bought this along with some of the books for my daughter (whose name is Ella). When I got it in the mail I was very disappointed with how small it was. I was expected it to be at least the size of a Beanie Baby or maybe a bit bigger, but it wasn't! I know I should have read the dimensions before I bought it. However, I think it is way too expensive for how small it is. I didn't return it though, because it is neat to have the elephant to go along with the books!"},{"rating":"1","title":"never recieved the item","review":"i am very disappointed as i had order this item for my daughter for xmas and it never arrived even after i called and was told to waitto this day it has yet to still arrive and this was the worst experience i have had with Amazon so far"},{"rating":"2","title":"For Fans of Avail","review":"I'm a metal guy, so I can't claim to be an expert on hardcore/punk music. There are a few punk bands that I enjoy, and Thirty-two Frames is one of them. This 20 minute EP features 6 songs (plus 2 hidden tracks - one a Tom Petty cover). The music hits just the right combination of melody and aggression, and reminds me of Avail (and to a lesser extent Bad Religion) in many ways. It's a good album if you like your hardcore on the melodic side, and it's pretty cheap, so what have you got to lose?"},{"rating":"2","title":"FUN GAME","review":"THIS IS A GREAT FIRST PERSON GAME THAT HAS MANY OPTIONS TO CHOOSE FROM WHEN ON A MISSION......THE GRAPHICS ARE PRETTY COOL..."},{"rating":"2","title":"This game is definitely for those who like to take cheap shots.","review":"There is nothing like playing a game that requires every mission to be done virtually in complete darkness. Thief Deadly Shadows requires thieving skills such as pick pocketing and picking locks to open treasure chests and entering doors. Having to watch out for the gaurds is always a must even though you don't commit a crime. Hiding from the people who walk around at night really isn't necessary unless they see you commit a crime and they go and find the gaurd. When I have to attack somebody from behind knocking them out cold I always hide the body in a place where nobody will notice it and steal their valuables to sell at the black markets to make a profit."},{"rating":"2","title":"A SOLID STEALTH GAME!","review":"I love stealth games. Thief is a fun game. there's different ways you can play, have both factions aligned or one or none. either way THIEF is fun . Graphics are descent (get an \\"S\\" cable,If your TV has a hookup)..

The lighting and ambient sounds are wonderful. I've enjoyed playing this game for hours. It's kept me hooked and I've paid the next day having stayed up all night to work just *one more* mission. The only reason I didn't give this game a 5 stars is because it has a peculiar habit of losing the sound. Everything else works fine but the sound is completely gone. This is the ONLY game I have that does this. I thoroughly tested other games I had to make sure it wasn't my console."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Shelf Liner","review":"I tried two different clear, ribbed, non-adhesive shelf liners for our new cabinets before finally ordering this one when I couldn't find it locally. I'm not sure now of the brands of the others, but I got them at Menards and Wal-mart, and this shelf liner is better than both.This shelf liner is slightly more rigid and lays down flat easily, the material allows me to slide things in and out of the cupboard without the liner coming with and bunching up. It stays put. The ribbing is better than the others in that the ribs are taller but narrow and distinct, opposed to the whole liner being like rows of little hills... so it seems more air can circulate underneath.I put this in every drawer and on every shelf that might be subject to spills, leaks or messes, and I'm happy I did."},{"rating":"2","title":"even in china","review":"For my research on Chinese painters and painting techniques I am in China.

Nothing in it is useful except maybe the introduction to the question types. I suggest that you get the Powerscore Logic Games Bible, Logic Reasoning Bible (Mid August 2004 I believe), and the next 10 actual LSATs, or 10 more actual official Lsats. Read the bibles and take practice tests over and over again. Good Luck."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not official tests = Not official quality","review":"It took me a few days to realize that this doesn't contain any real LSAT tests. After I took the second test and noticed that some of the questions made no sense, I looked up some information on this book. It was then that I learned that the tests in this book were written entirely by Kaplan. Some of the questions are really ludicrous and stupid. I got the official 10 LSATs and those are much better, they actually have a correct logical answer for each question (go figure!). This book screwed me up until I bought the book with the 10 real LSATs. The Kaplan people that wrote the test questions in this book have no business writing standardized tests."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just plain ridiculous--went into the trash!","review":"I thought this would be a romance about a nanny who seemed to be like an angel, not a nanny who really WAS an angel! It started out with the angel showing up naked in the hero's yard, and went downhill from there. The angel, in the guise of a nanny, has sex with the hero(it was somehow \\"approved\\" by higher authority!) At the end, the angel/nanny disappears and the hero doesn't recognize her when she shows up again as a person, but she seems somehow familiar so you are to assume that they get back together again. Anyway, the plot was so silly that I couldn't even take it seriously. I don't expect my romance novels to be totally true to life, but when it comes to angels running around naked and having sex, it is too far-fetched for me to even get into the story. What a waste--glad I bought this one used so I didn't feel so bad about throwing it into the trash."},{"rating":"2","title":"Girl Power!","review":"If you didn't get it, watch it again!

The DOCTOR says to the kids (of single mom), \\"It's difficult to raise children right, and your mother had done it right.\\" This is 1948! Also, get this, for an immediately post-war movie -- they don't finish by moving OUT of the city -- they stay in it! A family! How great is that? There is even the odd little twist that the nice man, though sexy, I guess, for his time, is SHORTER than the lovely Irene Dunne, but it's not a big deal! And what about that cute song mom and kids sing? Speaking of which, the music is great. Jane Powell sings beautifully. Later, believe it or not, there's a harmonica concerto. This movie is odd but wonderful. At first I thought it was the stupidist thing I'd ever seen. Then I watched it again.

Most are simply warmed-over manuals, or \\"recipe books\\" that are no help in building a basic understanding of a given software package. This book breaks down every aspect of Photoshop, and explains the full function and possible applications of nearly every aspect of this powerful software. Deke's book is simply the best of it's type I've ever read. Some of my students don't care for his sense of humor (which seems to be more evident with every new edition, for better or worse), but most find that it helps break the tedium of the technology.

The premise (a Game that revolves aroung Dante and the Divine Comedy) sounds wonderful, but it is completely under utilized and finally dropped completely. The settings and descriptions are well done, and the pictures scattered about the book are a nice touch. But the confusing thing is that Ms. Langton has a very bizzare concept of what constitutes a 'mystery.' For example, in a traditional mystery, the reader does not learn who the villian is on page 6! This strange technique basically removes any mystery to the story, and turns it into a not-so-thrilling thriller.

Hey, I'm not trying to make it sound bad, it's just that this book might not be too exciting (especially when you have to write about it!)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Insightful Book","review":"As a school teacher, I found a wonderful use for this book in my classroom. My 6th grade history class studies the Holocaust and was participating in the Houston Holocaust Museum's Butterfly Project. This book helped my students understand some of the feelings and problems faced by children housed at Terezin Concentration Camp during WWII."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hauntingly Beautiful","review":"I ordered two copies - one for me as a source for some research I'm conducting, and one as a gift for my research mentor. It's a hauntingly lovely book, offering a perspective of the Holocaust most people are not aware of. I became aware of the artwork, some of which is on permanent display, on a visit to the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum in Washington, DC.This is a must have for anyone interested in Holocaust history or the different ways trauma and loss affects children."},{"rating":"1","title":"Writing a little overdone","review":"This book was purchased because my son's name is Andrew, but overall it wasn't as good as I had hoped. The writing seemed too embellished and the illustrations were the best feature. I was a tad disappointed in the content."},{"rating":"1","title":"Utter Garbage......","review":"The only reason I gave this album one star is because I couldn't give it zero.On the advice of a friend, I bought this album and I have not forgiven him since. Every track sounded just like the previous one, and I feel robbed of the time it took to listen to them. The singer is awful, the guitar lines are bland and the overuse of synth sounds can cause ones ears to bleed.Do yourself a favor and save your money for better uses, like q-tips."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Full-Range of Real Pilates","review":"When you enter this world, it's important to have the great experience of Real Pilates. This DVD shows basic, intermediate, advanced, and super advanced levels, all according to the original tradition. For $19.95 you can't beat it.The basic and intermediate workouts show the foundations, and no other Pilates video shows the super advanced level.

I second the frustration with one reviewer who has been waiting since December to get this DVD. I have received the mat workout and like it very much. However, I got a reformer for Christmas and have been waiting, and waiting and waiting ..... I'm not sure what the problem is. They shouldn't say delivery is 1-2 weeks when it isn't. Looking forward to getting it one of these days."},{"rating":"1","title":"What is the hold up??!!!","review":"Why is this DVD for sale on Amazon if it's unavailable??? What exactly is the situation?

So far I've rec'd only the mat DVD ( it took over about 6 weeks, but considering it was the holidays...ok).The estimated delivery time for the reformer series dvd is now between february and march 12.

It was packaged well, looked great and was a resonable price. The \\"Pod\\" is stable on a completely flat, rough surface. But do not put it on the dashboard of your car, on an outdoor glass top table in windy conditions. The base can be slippery on certain surfaces. It is also not heavy enough for anything but smaller point and shoot cameras. I removed the plastic pellets and put in BB's. It is much heavier, but work much better! Rock solid in any condition., I also used so no-slip backling cloth to keep it from sliding off smooth surfaces."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Pod-Red","review":"I own three sizes of these and they are excellent.They really stabilize your camera to extend your shutter speed/aperture range. My red one is almost worn out after many years of use.It works leaning against trees, poles, fences, on rocks, cars window edges, you name it. I like that the \\"beans\\" are removable and washable. This also allows you to change the way your camera sits on the bag because you can adjust the stiffness of the bag. The red is light enough that you can carry it attached to the camera. Useful at dusk or in a low light situation such as a pioneer museum building.I found the yellow bag a bit too stiff, thick and narrow for my lighter point and shoots even with beans removed. Works great with the heavier point and shoot cameras.Elegantly simple, very robust and well thought out.Highly recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't think I got what I ordered","review":"I am pretty sure I ordered the Manfrotto BOGEN TPR0017B The Pod - Bean Bag Portable Support for Your Camera, which is described as being 10\\" in diameter. I received the Pod which is 3\\" in diameter. I have a Canon 20D with the Tamron 70-300 lens that I was wanting to use the bean bag with and this one is totally insufficient. I'm not sure the 3\\" one would even work too well with a compact digital camera. I decided to keep the 3\\" one and try it with my small compact digital camera. I think it would be better without the screw too, where you can just place the camera on the bean bad so it can steady the camera."},{"rating":"2","title":"There are SO many strange things inside this book!","review":"You got it folks. The RIPLEY'S BELIEVE IT OR NOT 2005 SPECIAL EDITION book. That's right. There's nothing stranger than the truth when you read this. It's all real. Just like any other \\"Ripley's\\" book, there are animals doing amazing things, people with nothing better to do then to decorate of their possessions in a wacky way, people doing things to themselves, and from everything from entertainment to fun to just plain weird, this is a wonderful piece of literature. Also visit the museums! They're not bad at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"crooked mind, bad taste","review":"well i bought one for my son and after reading a few pages i almost wanted to throw it away immediately.

It is sad that people are so desperate for a scene that they will delude themselves into enjoying this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome CD","review":"All I have to say is the Climb To Safety with Derek Trucks is one of the best jams I have ever had the pleasure of listening to. It is rockin'. BUY THIS SET!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A solid album for beginner or veteran","review":"Well, I have about 100 panic shows and all their commercial stuff, so I'm not real excited about the song selection or special guests (although these are solid), but the production on their live stuff really shines - sounds just like a studio album, but has all the improv needed to get the groove goin' and they're playing real tight throughout the 3 discs...hearing an album like this really brings the limitations of audience and unproduced soundboard recordings into perspectiveCheck out furthurnet for panic live shows - I've been using it for over a year. It has more shows than you can shake a stick at, and not just WSP of course....BUT DON'T FORGET TO BUY THIS ALBUM AND SUPPORT THE BAND...and check out everydaycompanion for setlists, tablature, lyrics and more....you'll find details there on the sets these songs were culled from that aren't in the album's liner notes : )"},{"rating":"1","title":"Loaded with sodium.

Also has a lot of sodium.","review":"This stuff tastes about as bland as salted rice cakes, so it tastes healthy, but really I don't consider 8g fat (0.5g saturated) or 12% (4% saturated) of RDA to be all that great. Packs 28g (9% RDA) in carbs and 400mg (17% RDA) in sodium.It's not a bad chip but for health matters it's just a normal bag of chips as far as Nutrition Facts are concerned.On the other hand, it *is* baked, has zero cholesterol, and contains all-natural ingredients (mainly flour, sunflower oil, and sea salt)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Make haste!","review":"I never thought I would sell my copy of this book, but the above reviewer made it clear to me that it needs to be passed around.

One of them explicitly mentions it. This review is for the sandalwood oil. I'm in agreement with the other negative review.

Its not surprising that all the reviews here trying to justify racism are written by caucasians. So since all movies in the 30's were racist, it makes them ok....what a crock! So people shouldnt complain about this movie because they were generous enough to allow an Asian to star in a film instead of using makeup to make non-Asians into a what a stereotypical Asian is supposed to look like. Oh brother, do you guys know what the definition of racism is? Yes people have a right to watch this film if they are so inclined. But people also have the right to say films like this belong in the garbage. Would caucasians complain if Native Americans made a film that depicted the genocidal acts of caucasians which include racial overtones? Come on its 2006, get real people, and get out of the trailer park please."},{"rating":"2","title":"Karloff Used His Own Singing Voice","review":"Warner Oland played Chan for the thirteenth time and Boris Karloff co-starred in this somewhat overrated film.

Far from it. It is just a bunch of equations. None of the variables are defined for the equations. There are no useful tables. For example, everyone knows the equation for thermal expansion, but a table of expansion coeficients (not to mention other material properties), that would be helpful! but, of course, not included.

The only enjoyable character is the sister that is mentally insane. Who cares about length, the story is typical of any anime-ish game/ movie. Pretty princess get into deep and defies the gods. Who couldn't have thought that plot line up? It's predictable and it has a lot of \\"theme park\\" style games like hit the bulls-eye. It's not worth full or any where near full price."},{"rating":"1","title":"I Hated It","review":"So... I was looking forward to playing this, but I hated it. Hated. Loathed. I got so frustrated with it that I took it out of my PS3 and threw it on the ground and let it lay there for a few hours. The stupid throwing of the disk to hit the gong thing is so frustrating, I don't care who says it just takes a while to get used to. It's annoying - and I never got used to it. There's no meat to the game, it's just this weak storyline with freakishly sadistic characters -- all of whom I could care less about. Usually, despite any form of annoyance or stupidity, I play the game till the end. But not this time. I think I'm on the last level anyway- I hear there's only 6? Short (but at the same time way too long). Well... I'll watch the ending on youtube. I'm sure it won't blow me away.On the upside, the graphics are pretty. But, I just started Uncharted: Drake's Fortune which completely blows Heavenly Sword out of the atmosphere, hands down. So... eh... it's a double negative from me."},{"rating":"1","title":"good graphics if you consider this game was released when ps3 was released. hack and slash to the end = boring.","review":"good graphics if you consider this game was released when ps3 was released. hack and slash to the end = boring."},{"rating":"1","title":"over rated","review":"i don't get it. i'm not sure why this game is supposed to be all that. it's main character is unattractive and her voice is like a man's. the levels are easy,easy,easy, then impossible. the first person arrows on some levels are easy then others so difficult it's not enjoyable. i don't recommend this game to anyone other than very experienced gamers."},{"rating":"1","title":"corrupted game","review":"When my husband placed the game in his Playstation it took a while to fix as it said that the game had been corrupted (whatever that means) After 15 minutes it finally worked.

For the \\"Hack them up\\" genre it played very well. Graphics are superb and looks great on my 55\\" HD-TV. Be aware that unlike Assassins Creed at 1080p it is only 780p. Not as good as the GOD OF WAR on the PS2, but to be fair the games are distinct and this one is fun, none the less. Probably 7-9 hours of fun for a hardcore gamer. About a week for your average casual player. PS3 games are overpriced... so shop around and wait to get the best deal."},{"rating":"2","title":"this is really the best game right now for PS3!","review":"Do you wanna know about a good and complete use for the sixAxis and great play mode? do you want to play a very exotic game with very amazing graphics? if your anwer is YES! this is the game for you! Heavenly Sword is a game make like movie, rich in cinematography, details, scrip, art direction, music and actors. So im already told you about de Good...The Bad: this is really a short game, and thats to bad, you can beat the entire game in six or seven hours; but i really love to beat this game again and again; and the other thing... King Bohan's Reminisense of gollum, please no more Andis Serkis Face for a while please."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful Game","review":"I'll just add my voice to the chorus on this game - it was great fun with beautiful imagery, memorable characters, and a nice blend of quality cinematic sequences and elegant action. I don't care if it takes 9 or 10 hours instead of 40 or 50 - it was the proper length for what it was. The story played out very well in that time frame - it's just arbitrary to say it needed more content to reach a certain length. I also enjoyed playing a game with female characters who aren't just a t-n-a fest - that's sort of hard to find."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beautiful Warrior, Ugly Mechanics","review":"I know I should have listened to other reviews saying this game had awful controls and lot of repetition but what can I say, who doesn't love a sexy woman as a main character?*Spoiler Alert*There are times where you are positioned to either snipe with a bow and arrow or defend against an army with a cannon. Don't get me wrong that sounds awesome but; the controls are way too impractical. I am not complaining that the game is hard by any means just the controls are really sloppy and do not enjoy a game where the player has to adjust due to ugly game mechanics. If you can tolerate the horrible controls then by all means get the game if you cannot then do not even think about getting this game."},{"rating":"2","title":"Heavenly Babe with a Sword","review":"The demo got me hooked and when i got the game, i was extremely impressed. it was a bit short but challenging with awesome game play and use of motion sensing.

The gameplay is very repititive and bland. Characters in the game are horrible and the controls sucked. Not to mention the game, after I installed it, actually caused many bugs in my PS3 console. The PS3 had difficulty playing Blu Ray movies as well as other games and after I uninstalled HS the console went back to working perfectly.

Graphics and cut scenes of landscapes was amazing. You can see the detail and work that went into it.Had a hard time memorizing so many combos as distinctly prefer games without combos. Ended up using 2 or 3 combos for the game now.Why 2 stars? The combos got to the point I ended up putting the game aside for 2-3 weeks only to start again to find did not know how to play anymore without going to the combo chart to relearn them. Right now more so using the 2-3 moves and hoping the mashing gets me through.This was also the first use of the motion control of the hand controller which used in the other character - very fun after the learning curve. Fly with your arrow takes on a new meaning.The graphics saves the game but the play value would be a rental. The British accent on supposed Asian characters was a distraction."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice concept, poor execution.","review":"I cannot believe how many five star reviews this game has received. Have you people really played this?I really wanted to like this game. But as I found myself quitting to play something else over and over, I never was quite sure if it was out of boredom from the repetitive gameplay, fatigue from the mindless button mashing, or nausea from the terribly over-acted voice work. It was dull, painful, repetitive and had a surprisingly shallow story throughout. The needlessly tacked on SIXAXIS elements were especially annoying.I eventually did finish the game, but I didn't really care. I have never turned it on since.Heavenly Sword wants very badly to be God of War. Unfortunately, it doesn't come close."},{"rating":"1","title":"It gets a star for the graphics... but not much else","review":"I was really psyched to play a God of War style game with a likeable, female protagonist. But the motion controls on this game are simply awful and the gameplay feels like a chore. Either I have to try to hit things with an arrow or cannon, or I'm mindlessly crunching buttons.Too bad because the game is actually gorgeous to behold and the plot initially engrossed me. But it just got so frustrating that I had to stop a 1/4 of the way in."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great short game","review":"This game is short, but a lot of fun. It uses the six axis controls really well in the sniper type missions and I found the overall gameplay rather enjoyable.The voice-acting talent is outstanding, especially for the main antagonist. I will say for that reason alone this game will remain in my collection and will not be traded in.Overall I give this game a 4 out of 5."},{"rating":"2","title":"Never Before Seen Graphics !!","review":"I'm sure this is the best looking game ever made to date ..

The PS3 is finally showing its true colors and some exclusivity as well. The game plays very well and incorporates the SIXAXIS motion control into the combat damn near flawlessly. The story was very well scripted and the voice acting was awesome (Andy Serkis added a lot of character to this project), it had me hooked the whole time. I think its fair to say that Heavenly Sword deserves the 'Goddess of War' comparison, it really is great. The only one thing that I can complain about was that it lasted all not that long. I'd say about 6-7 hours of gameplay was involved. Although very short, I enjoyed every minute of it. A must buy for any PS3 owner."},{"rating":"2","title":"Heavenly Sword Review","review":"I purchased this game for my boyfriend for the holiday. We haven't played this one yet, but I've played this game in the past. It's great! The graphics are awesome, and I love that the main character is a girl! I would recommend this game to everyone, except young kids, like 12 or under. Only because of some of the violence. Overall, this game is really fun and exciting to play."},{"rating":"2","title":"Big fun for sword-lovers","review":"I like this game overall. The images and intros are great. There is a lot of demos movie-like and many grphics to enjoy. Many enemies to kill and they fight smartly against you, in packs. That is a major note, since I get bored of killing foes in a mechanical fashion. This is not the case. Lot of movements and tchniques makes this game almost unique. I just miss a little tha hability to jump, magics and spells to kill more enemies when the are too many and a freer camera to enjoy the landscapes! In general it is a great game to play."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Story---Movie potential---funn funn funn","review":"The story is Great! Characters superb! Challenging game!

The lead is just slightly off in this role, I'd say, but he's good, and the suspense toward the end is playing it too close for my taste, but the movie is good. Good plot, not too simple. Wish we had a little more about who was pulling the bad guys' strings. The utterly careless nature of their doings is a bit over the top, but that's the breaks when you're dealing with bad guys from the near future in Scandinavia."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderfully Imaginative, Clever and Consistent","review":"Enjoyed it! This I believe was the first of a series of stories of the Polesotechnic League and introduced the flamboyant character of Nicholas Van Rijn. The story moves nicely with the human-heroes trying to get back to an area of safety (because the food on this world is poisonous.) In order to pull this off they have to work with two waring factions on the planet. Along the way you learn all about the culture and the world these factions live on. There is also a extra lesson on leadership supplied at the end. What I enjoyed the most was Anderson's \\"World Building.\\" Which was Wonderfully imaginative, clever and consistent."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good guide of life","review":"This book is an easy guide to understand your life. What you have and what you need to live as happy as you want. It does not tells you how you'll be a millionaire but how to be happy with yourself and your family.

This book covers every Constructor, Driver, Circuit, and Record since the British Grand Prix 13 May 1950 when Giuseppe Farina won this 70 lap race in 2hr13m23.6sec driving for Alpha Romeo SpA. However, the book may seem dated as it ends coverage with the European Grand Prix in October of 1997. Most of the current Formula One drivers are covered though maybe with a different team. There is also a nice Forward by the British voice of Formula One, Murray Walker. A good reference book for any F1 fan with an interest in the history of this sport. Remember, no glossy photos of brave drivers or the powerful and beautiful cars they pilot, just some Black and White shots here and there and interesting facts and figures about Formula One in between."},{"rating":"1","title":"Full of Statistics?","review":"If you want to know all of the numbers of F1 they are here.

I refuse to play this game anymore and will NEVER buy a Chessmaster game again. I find it incredible that so many people are willing to put up with this garbage!

Though not the hard sampled funk you probably most associate them with if you have their KEEP ON BUMPIN' and MASTERPLAN albums, this CD is still worth a listen... I think around that time a lot of the great funk groups from the early-mid 70's wave were begining to lose steam... or atleast soften with the times... you can feel a bit of that, however, its still a pretty good album and I'm sure plenty of people were shaking their booties to it at the discos !"},{"rating":"2","title":"The only Moe Bandy cd you need to buy.","review":"Only thing you need to go with this cd is Joe Stampley's greatest hits.This cd is great if you liked his songs back in the 70's and 80's including the duets with different artist."},{"rating":"2","title":"photo preservation","review":"Good overall book on keeping, organization, and presentation of the various types of family photos.

The resurrection of the downtempo-lounge movement of recent years is a reflection of the original musical craze of over 40 years ago. It is nice to see that artists such as Willie Bobo, the Gilbertos, Stan Getz, Sergio Mendes, and other artists that my parents grooved to, have now come full circle for a new generation. Although this music may sound a bit dated to those born after 1985, those who can appreciate music before the MTV age can chill out with a cool drink and some headphones, stereo lounge chair optional. This CD is a nice tribute compilation of various artists and gives us an idea of TC's inspirational roots."},{"rating":"2","title":"Can't get enough!","review":"I first heard this compilation in the Pacific Restaurant in Dublin. I asked the server for the name of the CD and ordered it right away. I'm a boomer and was heavily into the \\"Top 10\\". Finally, I've matured beyond that. Thievery has done a great job of placing the music so that it flows along. The instrumentals are catchy enough to linger in your head and complex enough to engage you in multiple listenings. First rate. I'm ordering this for my daughter!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This is where they get their inspiration","review":"I remember the first time I listened to a record by Thievery Corp. I became instantly aware of how different their sound is. I could not help wonder where this pair gets their inspiration, and what serves them so well in their constant stream of well engineered sounds.Well...this is it!I think they did a great job in letting their public know what inspires them to conceive the sounds they so well create.The songs in this compilation range from Bossa Nova to early Latin Jazz...a truly remarkable spectrum of early sounds that planted the seed for part of what is now known as loounge music."},{"rating":"1","title":"What the...?","review":"Well, if you are expecting the signature sound of THievery that we all love, you aren't going to find it here..no way. None of the cool percussions or downtempo beats. It's all jazz. 75% vocal jazz...it doesn't fit the mold of these artists.

I listened to the whole record in denial thinking it would get bettter but it just didn't. They basically sampled almost complete tracks from some not so hot Verve recordings and put it to a bossa nova style beat, which Thievery is known for however they used that same beat on practically every track. I would not recommend this record if you like their other records."},{"rating":"1","title":"Elevator jazz","review":"This is 60's jazz. Be aware before you buy, the label in the store was misleading. Not remixed, just picked off old albums and listed under Thievery Corp's name. If your not into the sound of hokey old jazz, stay away. I like the sound of today's music, influenced by the past, not 40 year old elevator tunes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thievery in the Verve Vaults","review":"Like everyone has said, this is NOT a Thievery Corporation album, but a compilation of music from the Verve Records vaults, put together by them. With that said, if you are a record collector that has come across countless Verve albums in the bins, and have been curious about the other artists out there, this is a perfect way to begin. The prime guilty pleasure here is bossa nova, with shades of jazz thrown in, and while you may not have heard of any of the artists covered here, many of them have not been heard since their original releases 30+ years ago. Excellent, hunt down the vinyl version as I did."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thievery Corp kicks!!","review":"If you are r expecting the usual sound of Thievery Corp in this album, u ain't getting any here.

Often bands struggle trying to keep their sound fresh and test out things that don't quite work, this is true of every long running band and can be the death of a band if they don't inspire confidence in their fan base from the get go with solid releases. So it is a testament to W.A.S.P. and Blackie that they're still tearing it up to this very day. This is a gem in the mighty saga of Blackie Lawless and the ever shifting line up that he calls W.A.S.P.

Also have Neon God 1 and The Sting. I had every W.A.S.P. album but Electric Circus and The Last Command. Runs the gamut to masterpieces like the debut to stinkers like Helldorado. As it is, W.A.S.P. are one of the more unprediuctable big name global metal bands besides Cradle of Filth. An acronymn for We Are [...], this album is somewhere in between on the W.A.S.P. hall of greatness.

Anyone who's heard Still Not Black Enough can attest to the auditory anguish of a W.A.S.P. album absent of booze guzzling mogul and lead guitarist Chris Holmes. Dying for the World is nothing new. It treads no uncharted waters and falls more in the vein of The Headless Children than their much touted comeback album Helldorado. The songs are dark and the overall tone is of horror and despair. All in all there's not a stinker present, even the mellower Hallowed Ground that addresses the issues and tragedies of September 11th holds up rather well.

I was captivated by the year by year synopsis of Vince Lombardi's life, and how it was centered around football as a fledgling national pasttime. I would highly recommend this book as a gift for any football enthusiast."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Greatest Coach Ever","review":"Vince Lombardi was a real hero of mine. I don't know why, I was a child of the 60's and he stood for many things I was against, but he struck a chord with me and I literally loved the man and am a life-long Packer fan as a result.This is a good book. I get tired of the authors continued resurrection of Lombardi's weaknesses and his wife's need for alcohol. Once is OK, but after every Lombardi victory, the author is compelled to resurrect Lombardi's sad family life. It might be true, but I don't need to re-read about it in every chapter."},{"rating":"2","title":"A lesson to be learned here...","review":"Overall, a truly enjoyable read. I find it disappointing, however, that like many of the \\"Baby Boomer\\" generation (perhaps best typified by the subject of his last major biography) Mr. Maraniss deems it necessary to attempt to debunk the \\"myths\\" surrounding a truly incomparable figure -- perhaps reflecting the need of this generation to justify their own personal shortcomings. The true irony of the book is that the larger than life persona of Lombardi, his contribution to the game he so loved, and his commitment to a higher standard of ethics and morals shine through unscarred, despite the author's attempts to convince us otherwise."},{"rating":"2","title":"An excellent, unbiased, detailed biography","review":"I previously read Michael O'Brien's \\"Vince\\" and found it to be a very good read. However, David Maraniss has cast aside the myth of Lombardi even more effectively and created a detailed portrait of an honest, driven, passionate man.Lombardi is a fascinating character, and this biography does an excellent job delving into the contradictions in his beliefs, his love for his players and football, and his family struggles.Maraniss paints such a thorough picture of the character of this man that the final pages (which deal with the Coach's fight against cancer) are heartbreaking.Anyone who enjoys reading biographies about interesting people will enjoy this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"the man\\"","review":"picked up this book thinking it would give me a motivational boost...didn't get much of a boost, but did read an outstanding biography. i've heard this book quoted as the \\"best sports biography ever written\\", and i have no reason to doubt that. it is a book that looks at lombardi's life as if we were viewing it through a 1960's 8mm video movie camera. would recommend it to any and all!"},{"rating":"2","title":"In simple words: Buy this book, it is awesome work.","review":"If you thought that Vince Lombardi was merely a powerful voice and just a great football coach, think again. In this book, you will learn the full story behind the man whose name graces the Super Bowl trophy. You can actually feel for the people who encompassed his life, and what he went through just to become head coach of the Packers. I am a Buffalo Bills fan, so this book is not just meant for the green and gold faithful, but for anyone who wishes to learn about the greatest football figure ever. When you read this, you will soon learn why he was so successful in his life."},{"rating":"1","title":"BOOK DEFECTIVE","review":"This is not a review of the book as in the story but the physical book itself.

Coach was screaming at his players to make them better and my dad was screaming at my brother and I to do the same for us. Like the players we hated the yelling but like the coach and players we would all forgive and forget. Every time I would read a name of any one of the Packer players I would get a smile on my face and think back to the old days of watching the Pack on Sunday afternoons following Mass and a fabulous Sunday dinner with my family."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book","review":"Definitely the best book I have ever read. I really enjoyed reading this book...it presents so many interesting facts of Lombardi's life. If you are expecting this book to talk about football from beginning to end then you should look for another option."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great American biography","review":"I just finished this book today and loved it--LOVED IT! I have been a long time athlete and fan. I remember as a kid we used to watch those old great NFL Films and I thought Lombardi was the greatest. This book captures the mystic of Vince without being too sentimental and soft. Mr. Moraniss paints a beautiful picture of one of the most celebrated Americans in history. I could not stop reading the book. I will look for other books by this author. His writing is divine."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best","review":"Before the infusion of big money, widespread drug use, on-field clowning and off-field thuggish behavior, there was a time when the sport of football was taken seriously as a metaphor for a principled life well-lived. Perhaps no individual was a more visible exemplar of that philosophy than Green Bay Packer coach Vince Lombardi. The author of this brilliant biography, David Maraniss, knows the territory of sports and society. He won the Pulitzer Prize and has written popular and award-winning books on baseball great Roberto Clemente, the 1960 Rome Olympics and numerous political topics.Rated one of the top 20 sports books - see [...]."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another Hero Eviscerated","review":"A hero of mine as I sat transfixed each Sunday in my teens, the author clearly questions Lombardi's intelligence, morals, mental stability, family life, religion and will to win at all costs. He was driven, yes. Perhaps that was commendable. But he married a woman he likely didn't love (or didn't know how to) and had two children he barely tolerated and seemed ashamed of. All three are shown to have severe mental problems...and Lombardi himself wasn't far behind. In the end, he was mostly a fraud driven to win at all costs. And while such determination can be praised, its underpinnings are fascinating and tragic at the same time."},{"rating":"2","title":"AN AMAZING MAN.........A GREAT BOOK.","review":"This book was a real joy to read. David Maraniss has the gift of telling a great story, and he chose a very special person. It is a must read for any NFL fans, but will be thoroughly enjoyed by all.Lombardi was quite a character and this book tells so much about the \\"greatest coach ever.\\" It also adds some insight into what it takes to be a great leader.I look forward to Maraniss' next book, no matter what it is about."},{"rating":"2","title":"Outstanding","review":"Maraniss's work accurately shows that our heroes have warts. His book is a constant study of myth vs. reality. Living in Wisconsin, the myth of Lombardi often outweighs the reality. Even after peeling back the layers, he's still the most dominant figure of his era in his sport. But, not even Lombardi was perfect."},{"rating":"2","title":"More Than a Biography","review":"You can call this a biography, or you can call it a cultural biography, the story of a remarkable life and a remarkable time. Or you can call it what it is: a great book about a great man by a great writer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Insight","review":"David Maraniss gives an incredible insight into the life of one of the best football coaches to ever walk out of the tunnel. Vince Lombardi's legacy is detailed with a sort of vividness that only Maraniss can describe. He takes us on an incredible journey through Lombardi's childhood to his time at West Point coaching for Red Blaik to eventually becoming Head Coach of the Green Bay Packers. It is a long, but incredible read that I thoroughly enjoyed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Way too much info","review":"I love sports biographies, especially about coaches. Woody Hayes, Bear Bryant, Knute Rockne... I have read a bunch. I like them to be sort of an extra long Sports Illustrated article, a nice recap of their life, career, and personality, or what made them the leaders they were. I don't need an entire chapter on a Friar's Club meeting, or whatever it was where they had a post season banquet. I don't need fight songs, especially unknown or unimportant ones printed out. This book sometimes spent 5 pages detailing something that needed only one page to describe. At points, it was painful to read. I just think he was the wrong writer for the subject matter: not that he wrote in a way I could not understand, but I've read more interesting math textbooks in my life."},{"rating":"2","title":"OUTSTANDING! THE QUINTESSENTIAL LOMBARDI !!","review":"I wholeheartedly agree with the comments of the other readers who have reviewed this book. Excellent research, writing, documentation, and particularly the insights gained via interviews with players, friends, foes and family make this a must read for football fans and/or those wanting to know more about the life and times of St. Vince."},{"rating":"2","title":"An era gone by","review":"We all look to the past to lament the passing of the good old days, days when things were so much better. The author writes of how people of Lomabrdi's era did the same amidst academic scandals at West Point and other mishaps of morality. Yet Lombardi really is the pillar of a lost era, when pride and performance did still matter. I highly recommend this book to anyone who believes that this nation has lapsed into an era of cynicism. The lessons imparted by Lomabrdi are dearly needed in today's society. While he was not a saint, he was an individual that believed in himself, his God and his country. This is not just a biography of a legendary football caoch but of a man who came as close as one could to exempfliying the American dream."},{"rating":"2","title":"OUTSTANDING BIOGRAPHY!","review":"Without a doubt,the best biography I've ever read. The author does a great job in writing about one of the top leaders of the 20th century.He is very thorough in his research and brilliantly separates the man from the image.Even though,Lombardi was very human,he still had more integrity,pride,and character then most of today's spoiled baby boomer athletes and coaches.Yes and even Presidents. A Must Buy."},{"rating":"2","title":"HIT ME!!","review":"As a former professional football player under another coaching legend, Don Shula, I want to thank David Maraniss for writing such an incredible and compelling account of Vince Lombardi's life. I wanted to suit up all over again and run out onto the field!! Maraniss weaved such a captivating story as he chronicled Lombardi's journey. It was fascinating to read about the great mentors in Lombardi's life, his family, his players, his philosophies, his imperfections, his weaknesses, his practices, his legend. Lombardi, through the Maraniss narrative, showed me once again that greatness is worth \\"paying the price\\". To me this book is about striving for your \\"personal best\\" and the lessons one learns in traveling this challenging path."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book about a fine man","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed reading Maraniss' book. Maybe there was not enough football commentary for some, but I thought there was enough. After all, the story was about the man's lifetime. I think the best biographers are those who can reveal the strengths as well as the weaknesses of an individual. The author reveals weaknesses and flaws without disrespecting Lombardi. Lombardi was not a superhero; he was a very human person who took opportunities that came his way and dedicated his total self to meeting each challenge and succeeding. He was a fighter to the end, and even cancer did not claim him easily. There is much we can learn from this biography and I would advise spending the hours necessary to carefully perusing it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Compelling Read","review":"I read Maraniss' Clemente book a few months ago, which was unbelievable.

I ENJOYED THIS BOOK VERY MUCH. THE LEGEND OF LOMBARDI COMES TO LIFE IN THIS TELLING OF HIS LIFE. A GREAT READ FOR LOMBARDI FANS. I WISH IT HAD MORE DETAIL ABOUT HIS RELATIONSHIPS WITH HIS PLAYERS. I FELT IT SPENT TOO MUCH TIME AND DETAIL ABOUT TRIVIAL MATTERS. THIS BOOK COULD HAVE BEEN CUT DOWN BY A QUARTER IF SOME OF THIS INFO HAD BEEN ELIMINATED. STILL WELL WORTH PRICE AND A GOOD LOOK AT THE LEGEND IN HIS COACHING AND HIS PRIVATE LIFE. VERY RECOMMENDED."},{"rating":"2","title":"This Books Matters...","review":"Maraniss opens his book with a thought provoking first line (\\"Everything begins with the body of the father\\") and he keeps the story flowing from there. Maraniss follows Lombardi from his youthful desire to be a priest, his high school days and his college football career and on to the pros. The book highlights the grit and determination of a tenacious man driven to succeed. The book is very well written and visually very descriptive. Maraniss tells a terrific story."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lombardi","review":"I thought the book gave a great deal of background in the life of Vince Lombardi.At times it gave more information than is needed. If you are looking for a football only book this may not be the book for you. At times the book gives a lot of information that is redundant and the are several 2 to 3 page sections that will bore most people. I am a Vince Lombardi fan and parts of the book I found fascinating. I would not reccomend this book to the average reader. It is basically a biography. If you are a fan of Vince Lombardi, the Green Bay Packers, or professional football in the 50's and 60's then read this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best sports biographies I ever read","review":"I couldn't help feeling that I was right there in frozen Green Bay, in the 1960s, at one of the Lombardis' Sunday post-game cocktail parties, and everywhere else Vince Lombardi went in his life, while reading this great book.It's a great read, very vivid, about a great coach and (as Maraniss illustrates) not the greatest father in the world. In other words, a portrait of a human being who did great things with his work, but who had foibles like everybody else."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful Gift for the Sports Fanatic","review":"I bought this book for my husband as a Father's Day Gift and he loves it.

A true journey into Turkey, during her most trying times, it stirs the soul."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fabulous book, but NOT the KINDLE edition","review":"I loved this book but feel I need to warn Kindle readers: the kindle edition of this book is missing a very interesting and important afterword written by the author's son, which describe's Orga's life following his exit from Turkey, and thus finishes the story. The author's attempts to survive and make a living and build a family in England is every bit as fascinating and well-told a story as what comes before.I didn't realize the afterword existed until I read some of the hardback reviewers' comments here. I'm not sure why the Kindle edition doesn't include this afterword, but perhaps a different publisher produced the version with the afterword.it's a real loss.

Beautifully written (thanks to his British wife's editing) and easy to read, I can imagine myself in Istanbul, having visited many of the places described in the book.The afterword written by the author's son was not part of the original edition, but helped to explain the rest of the author's life and the book.A very worthwhile read."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best K dramas","review":"Having just finished My Lovely Sam Soon, I didn't think anything could equal or top it, but City Hall did in some ways. The two leads are terrific, but Kim Sub Ah is what makes this series so special. I've watch a lot of Korean films & series, but very few actresses have the charm & versatility on camera that she has. She just sparkles here. The music is one of the best scores I've heard, but sadly, the OST apparently is no longer available it appears. If you like K dramas, don\\"t hesitate on City Hall. It's a joy & you will love it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"City Hall","review":"I love both the main male and female characters, very funny.

The stamp head is small, and the letter engraving is very shallow, meaning the 'B' that gets stamped into the wax is very thin and difficult to see. Sealing wax also sticks to the thin circular ridge around the edge of the stamp, leaving jagged edges.

There is lots of information on where to eat, shop and drink, but not as much practical info as some other books. But the descriptions of neighbourhoods were great, and much more in depth and seemingly of a Londoner's prospective than some of the more dry guides. The fact that it is written by Canadians was nice too, they mentioned some things that only people coming from North Amerca would care wbout, the UK writers don't have the same perspective on space for example!I would highly recommend this for young singles, but not as much for older professionals or families, because of the emphasis on nightlife, etc. But it is still an excellent supplement to another relocating guide."},{"rating":"2","title":"Slightly outdated now but still a gem!","review":"Although this book is now somewhat outdated, the information is great. The book can be blunt but this is a good thing, unlike some travel guides it will tell you that you don't have to take in absolutly everything and tell you why you can miss it. It is a really refreshing book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sparkling Fun!","review":"This is a great little novelty addition to a work or home office. While a lava lamp usually suggests something over-the-top and tacky, this small and sleek unit is surprisingly classy. The gentle sparkles are beautiful, and relaxing to watch shift and change. It's great to enjoy on an everyday basis, plus fun to see the reaction of others seeing it for the first time...it always brings a few admiring questions.However, I disagree with the product's claim that the coiled cord stretches to four feet - I don't have it stretched nearly that long, and it is at a somewhat delicate and precarious angle. After it was knocked over and fell a few times the top lava clear plastic part separated from the base, but it still works fine when fitted back together. Since the parts are so prone to separating I would be careful about traveling with it and prefer to keep it stationed in my office.I was surprised by how much I enjoy this item! It's very pretty and fun to watch."},{"rating":"2","title":"lava lamp","review":"Bought this as a lark.

I had it recording in a matter of minutes. You do have to format the mini dvds, but that is easy to find in the manual. The quality of the recording looked great on my computer screen. I bought office depot mini dvds and they worked fine, for the great price. This Panasonic is great and recording straight to mini dvds is a wonderful idea. I would have given it a 5 star rating, but the finalizing of the mini dvd took a while and you have to plug it in, you can't do this using the battery. Also I was warned, that if you use the dvd-ram instead of the dvd-r, they will not work on all players and they prefer to work on Panasonic equipment. This is why I opted for the non re-writable mini dvd-r from office depot. I also bought the PNY SD card from them and the card reader, all very affordable and easy to use."},{"rating":"1","title":"I would not buy it again.","review":"If you buy this camera, remember to buy also additional DVD copy software (IntelVideo Copy - around $70), plus only Panasonic DVD-Ram mini DVD disks (also expensive). Also, after my experience, if you erase one DVD-ram disc at least twice, on the third use the movie will have many video or audio problems. Not knowing this problem, I ruined my friend's baby shower video. Panasonic customer service is not helpful at all. A representative was even surprised that my camera does not have USB cable!!! Other then that - let's say, once you cannot return this camera to the store, because I opened it and used it, you can still enjoy lightness of the camera. One more thing: you need to purchase the light also; this camera does not have built-in light - you will need it. ... So, how much does the camera cost after all???"},{"rating":"1","title":"No USB Port, does not use DVD-RW that is compatible with most drives and dvd players","review":"Has good features, but the biggest downsides are it does not have a USB port and it uses DVD-RAM discs (re-writable) which do not work on most of the DVD players.Note that it does not use DVD-RW discs that come with most notebooks and desktop computers and allow re-writing.So there seems to be virtually no way to transfer your videos to your computer, other than buying a DVD Multi drive that can read DVD-RAM discs."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good camera","review":"I've bought this camera about a year ago and I am very happy with it. The batery charges fast and lasts long, the movies are good in quality (clear, not blured, the colors come out exactly the same) and the camera is light enough. The only problem I've had so far is that you cannot record in the dark - the movie comes out darker than it seemed and you can hardly see anything. Otherwise I am more than happy with the camera."},{"rating":"1","title":"The time has passed. Don't do this.","review":"Do not buy this - time has passed this by. It's cheap, because you can do so much more now than you could in 2006. You simply cannot manipulate the videos you take on this - no USB connection to upload to a computer, no software to make changes if you could. Get a miniDV or something more modern. The miniDVD has passed. May it rest in piece."},{"rating":"2","title":"Modern style cookbook","review":"I love the wine country, so this was the cookbook for me. If you enjoy fresh food, herbs, salads and healthy living, you will enjoy the recipes here. Includes recipes for red onion ravioli with thyme cream, fettuccine with gorgonzola and pine nuts, horseradish crusted salmon with dilled cucumbers, and apricot hazelnut tart. Also, includes recipes for basic things like puff pastry and grilled corn. Ingredients for the recipes in this book are easy to find.

I was disappointed in the quality of the hand-painted exterior, but it is still beautiful nonetheless. This ornament arrived in a plastic box with GM logos. No mention of Corvette to be found on the packaging, but the license plate does read 1957. This is not a negative to me however since this ornament will be placed on his tree."},{"rating":"1","title":"Missing the point, somewhere?","review":"Er... so this was probably misfiled in the comedy section; all it is is a couple of discs worth of a woman talking, with an audience whooping and cheering whenever she mentions a particular section of society. There's some awfully uninspired material about Scotland, as though the mere fact of travelling to a foreign country was somehow incredible, and the rest is some strange form of observational comedy, omitting the comedy. Perhaps Cho is some kind of avant-garde performance artist, who wanted to see if she could be reliably unentertaining for the entire show, and still have the crowd laugh at her. Except for the 9-11 joke at the start, and if that is the high point, that really says very little.Other reviews suggest it might be amusing if you can see the audience reaction, which implies either you should buy the DVD instead of the CD, or alternatively that the audience does all the work, because it certainly doesn't seem from listening to this that Cho does."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not that helpful","review":"While this book offers some theory and concept, there is not much hands-on practical information.

During installation I would recommend using pnuematic tools to unfasten/refasten the bolts. It'll cut your time by more than half if you were to install with a regular socket wrench. Also get a buddy to help you out. This would've been extremely tricky to do on my own.A nice feature of this receiver is that the side mounting plates are welded so it is one cohesive piece.

Only had one problem. I thought I had received the wrong item because it was to narrow to fit over both sides of frame. I used a rubber mallet to make the two ends a little wider. After doing this it fit just fine. Curt or the seller may want to include an installation note explaining what to do if it will not slide onto the frame. Don't hammer to hard or you will widen the ends to much creating a new problem.All that aside I am very please with this product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Highly Recommended","review":"This hitch was fairly easy to install, its good to have a set of 1/2\\" drive sockets. It is not necessary to remove the whole bumper, but I did so I could spray the inside of the bumper with clear coat rustoleum spray also sprayed the installation hardware(Tip: If you remove your bumper,first remove the two license plate bulb assemblies.)

Many cliches from the 1970s and 1980s are found here, and American readers may wonder why the Irish author, who lives in London, needs to restate them unbothered by any of the later criticisms and discussion. The reviewer who commented on how \\"dualistic\\" this book really is, and how blind its author is to the style of argument he himself uses but castigates, was right on the money."},{"rating":"1","title":"No advance in the dialogue. . .","review":"I was looking forward to reading this book because of its topic and the various aspects covered - as well as the author's reputation. However, I was disappointed. First of all, the tone struck me as hostile. It's almost as if O'Murchu were baiting the Vatican to censure him. If that's too harsh, maybe he is simply engaging in catharsis because of the admittedly difficult positions espoused by the Church throughout the centuries. Anyway, the other thing is that he didn't seem to break any new ground. The book was mostly analysis, with little (as far as I could see) recommendation for positive action. Also, it had been done before. Patriarchy has been appropriately bashed already. I had hoped for something that could be seen as the next step. But that seems impossible, since all the institutions we know are bankrupt and half the human race (the male half) along with it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where is the \\"framework\\" for reclaiming spirituality?","review":"I expected this book to present a path to reclaim spirituality and present \\"new\\" possibilities for a more integrated worldview of spirituality. Instead it is a book on what seems to be exploration and more condemnation of patriarchal based religious views. I'm disappointed in that there is no real fundamental presentation of the advantages of reclaiming spirituality.

I am glad to see it available in CD format now. I only wish I could find the movie on video tape somewhere. Because I work with medically injured and misdiagnosed individuals I feel that this uplifting music will be good therapy for many of these individuals. The songs on this CD focus on such things as \\"Working Together\\" \\"Pulling Together\\", hoping for a better world, having a good sense of self-worth by realizing that everyone has strengths and weaknesses but that we are all part of the \\"world circle\\" and each of us is important and has a place and purpose."},{"rating":"2","title":"Music is so special","review":"The sound track and all the music from Lost Horizon, just makes it so special.

Not at all. Their first three albums are represented in only 1 song, \\"Blurry Eyes\\", and it's not even a good representative. You can't sum up the band's work in just 12 songs no matter what ones you pick.If you want an introduction to L'Arc~en~Ciel, buy their albums. It's the only way. Each album is so unique, each album is its own experience, and you can't understand L'Arc without hearing them all.So, to reiterate, buy this album because \\"Anemone\\" is a really great song. But otherwise it's just a collection of some of the band's songs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't be fooled","review":"This is a very powerful handheld vacuum cleaner. If you just need to clean up loose this like salt or cracker crumbs it will perform great. Should you actually try to use the beater brush attachment you will be very dissappointed. I bought this cleaner for the purpose of cleaning my curtians and stairs. I own two cats and virtually all of my in-laws are allergic to them. Everytime they come, I have to clean the house top to bottom. My upright vacuum (Dirt Devil Vision Lite model 008650) weighs a ton and was not designed to use on stairs. I thought this little cleaner might be just the trick. The brush worked great the first several times I used it. But after about 20 uses it began to slow down. I cleaned it very thoroughly but never saw the initial performance again. Eventually, it stopped working at all. I urge you to buy something else, if the beater brush is a selling point for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just awful...","review":"I thought that buying this little vac was going to be a good investment with my new cats. Nope. It was a huge disappointment, especially for the price. The filter becomes clogged with dust within a few minutes of use, and suction goes down to nothing. There's no bag to change, so you're forced to shake the filter out or wash it. Theoretically, I suppose it could be used to vacuum up bigger, solid particles that won't clog a paper filter (e.g., sand?). But if you have a normal house with dust or hair, this little vac is not for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't bother","review":"I echo the former review. The filter becomes clogged almost immediately and the motor starts to overheat.

But as other reviewers have pointed out, it's not designed to be used as a main vacuum cleaner, only as a supplement for smaller jobs.But the problem is that the filter is a poor design ; it's small and clogs after every few minutes of use, even when only used for light cleaning & dusting jobs. And cleaning the dust out of the pleated filter is not an easy task. Another smaller annoyance is that if you want to use your nozzles from your other vacuum cleaner(s) you already own, you must use the included, short flexible hose as an adapter because they won't attach directly. But I often like to use the short hose anyway, for the greater flexibility and reach it gives."},{"rating":"2","title":"Inexpensive and perfect","review":"I have used this palette for a few years.

Filmed outside and in real locations, not just a studio or backlot. With actors devoid of white shining teeth and flawless makeup, It gives the feel of the seedier side of life and London. The show is as worth watching today as it was 10yrs ago. Helen Mirren and the other actors give compelling performances, you can almost forget it's not real. Great series, well worth watching from the beginning."},{"rating":"2","title":"valuable marketing information","review":"This book is one of the best marketing books I have ever read.Kim Gordon writes in a clear and easy to understand style. Instead of inundating the reader with lots of abstract, academic business theory, she instead relates practical, real world marketing information that she herself has already tried and tested. For a relatively slim volume (222 pages including index), this book covers a lot of ground --- including writing great sales letters, relationship marketing, and creating press kits. I can't recommend it highly enough --- especially considering the book's low cost.Check out Kim Gordon's columns at entrepreneur.com."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very practical advice","review":"This book gives very good practical advice for marketing on a budget.

A couple of features are missing, which is very frustrating: 1) You can't shuffle or listen to two or more groups at a time. For example, you can create up to 8 group settings like Classical, Rock, Christmas, etc. But you can only shuffle through ALL 8 groups or ONE group, you can not choose Classical & Christmas. 2) Only 13 characters of text for naming a CD. I suggest if you want these features spend more money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't peform basic function","review":"I own the 200 disc changer. It worked for about three weeks, after which it started chewing up discs. When the carousel turns, discs get caught on plastic parts designed to hold the discs in.

As it is, I am limited to one group. Around Christmas time, though, I'd like to be able to pick my Christmas group, Children's group, and Classical group to all play together randomly (skipping over the metal and dance music CD's).For someone with a CD library of under 200 CD's, this is a great idea, as you can store your CD's inside the player and never have to handle them again.I'd buy it again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what it should be","review":"I have the CX200 which has a jaming problem.

The first time you heard \\"Flying in a Blue Dream\\", \\"Summer Song\\", \\"Cool # 9\\", or \\"Satch Boogie\\" live you may have been knocked off. But to hear these songs over and over again is not worth the 20 dollars spent to listen a handful of Super Colossal songs performed live. Although Dave LaRue's peculiar style gives this CD an agreeable taste (specially on \\"Circles\\"), and Super Colossal's \\"Made of Tears\\", \\"Crowd Chant\\", \\"Ten Words\\", etc., are played rather nicely, many of us Satch fans would rather hear Time Machine or Strange Beautiful Music tracks.

Bizarrely, they ended up adopting a Cajun style, and a unique most un-London swirling accordian / fiddle mix.They released an eponymously titled album in 85 or so, which sank without trace partly because the band had effectively already split, partly because it got no airplay but mainly because the record company went bust.I bought it at the time and played it to death - it was quite brilliant. Everyone who heard it promptly ran off to try and find a copy (which was not easy).Most (all?) of the original album is on this CD, along with some earlier pub stuff which they clearly like and I don't, much.Frankly, if the idea of a Cajun band from Deptford appeals in any way, then buy it.

Captivating perspectives, rich in composition. Handsomely reproduced so the printing effectively achieves resonance. Definitely one for the coffee table. If you've had the opportunity to drink in aerial vantage points when flying commercial airliners, you will be in for a treat because of the immediacy inherent within most shots.

For instance she has a cottage that she added roses to, but doesn't show you how to do it. She touches up faces to look like a china doll, but not the details of just one stroke or clone.

But Jeannot, who is a dynamic figure, goes beyond the spiritual-only concerns Father Michel has invested in Jeannot's upbringing and becomes a revolutionary, concerned with the plight of the poor on his island.He is elected president of the country, and institutes a series of sweeping reforms that put his own life in danger. Father Michel begins to question what Frankenstein's \\"monster\\" has been \\"created.\\" Moore looks carefully at the three institutions fighting for power here: the Church, the military (representing greed and the \\"standard way\\" of doing business), and the \\"people\\" (Jeannot).

It is the early 1920's , the place is New York City. The murders replicate those written up a century earlier by Edgar Allan Poe and the two sleuths who set out to solve the crimes are none other than Harry Houdini and Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, who, in reality, were good friends.

The party age ranges are from toddler to teenager, and are identified in the table of contents for easy reference. We have used a number of ideas for different theme parties. The book focuses on a wide variety of party ideas, but doesn't address the typical party themes, like Valentine's Day, holidays, etc. It does have a ghosts and goblins party and we used some of those ideas for a Halloween party.

Each article is virtually the same thing, with a change of topic. A teacher describes some \\"issue\\" they faced in their classroom, describes how they handled it in a pc way and then tells how all the students and parents loved it and concludes by congratulating themself on what a great teacher they are."},{"rating":"1","title":"Politically correct, insidious garbage","review":"I would call this book nonsense if only the ideas inside of it weren't so off base as to be harmful. Giving kids a proper view of reality should help them navigate the world better. This book and its lessons will not do that...it actually steers them in the opposite direction. The book provides practical ways in which your children can be taught about the horrible injustices of capitalism and the wonderful world of communism (it teaches only about the wonderful theoretical parts of communism, on a child's level). Whites are persons of privilege and only whites can be racist because only whites have the power to be oppressors. Basic skills are trashed.

Just not from here."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Product, but Bad Price!","review":"This is an excellent product.

Instead pick up one of the classic original 5 albums (up through Brothers & Sisters) or something from the current 10 year-long reunion. Seven Turns, Where It All Begins and An Evening With are exceptional CDs from the recent era. \\"Reach\\" followed Enlightened Rogues which is also a great record, which makes this record sound even worse.

(but that's about it)","review":"The two Arista Records albums are the weak links in the Allman Brothers Band catalog. Reach For The Sky (1980) has a few good moments, but it's nothing to write home about. I do like Angeline, though. Gregg's vocals are great on that one. Hell And High Water features shout-and-answer co-lead vocals from Gregg and Dickey, and From The Madness Of The West is a fair to middling Dickey Betts instrumental.

It may have been fine, but was packed so badly, all I received were glass shards and a scratched up frother.When I send a package containing glass, I make sure the outer box is large enough to allow packing around all sides of the object, not just on the bottom. Amazon did not do that. I make sure that the glass items can't clash against each other or against other items in the box.(The maker's packing, which could be seen under the clear plastic-topped box, had elastic bands to secure the items, but the bands weren't fastened over the items.) Amazon should have easily noticed the pieces rattling against each other and sent another. I know I would have. When I ship glass, I make sure the outer box is labelled \\"glass\\".

Great for bright sunny days, but otherwise awful. I have just got it out again after 6 months left in a drawer (holiday time again!) and the LCD display doesn't work. Even if you look through the veiwfinder instead, there is no display. As camcorders are so cheap now, it will be better to replace than repair.

Buy something else...you have been warned!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Battery, focus problems","review":"While the tiny size of this camera is a major plus, it leaves a lot to be desired in performance. The biggest problem I found is focus. Unless I have a defective one, it simply will not focus on zoomed-in objects, either in auto or manual modes.In low light (and frequently in daylight situations) the auto focus swings wildly back and forth as it can't make up its mind what to focus on. Getting to and operating the manual focus is awkward. The battery life is also a major minus. If you are doing any extended shooting you need to be plugged in to AC - your battery will not last beyond half an hour or so (maybe even shorter!) Low light shooting produces very poor results. Again, the major plus is its compactness; you can carry full video capability at the size of still camera."},{"rating":"1","title":"Picture Quality and Focus","review":"This is a nice camcorder at this price for kids; the recorded pictures plays well on LCD but on TV it is very bad it is all granular all places and color is spread all across. The camera doesn't focus instantly when zoomed in or out; picture blurs at that moment and remains for few more seconds.

I thought perhaps this would be different, but I see he is set in a formulaic rut, where characters are wooden, plots are obvious, and all the old archetypes get trotted out in the hope of capitalizing on their popularity.

She said that watching this is even more boring than listening to her teacher."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great review of geometry","review":"Knowledge of geometry is very essential if you plan on going farther along in math and science (especially physics). The concepts of angles, area, volume and triangles come up over and over again in trigonometry, calculus and physics, so the stronger you are with those concepts the better off you will be down the line. For what you need for an actual geometry class, while all the material is very good, the section on geometric proofs is great. Jason does not do a ton of examples of proofs because they would just end up getting repetitive, but he does walk you through how to approach them and how to properly word all the statements in the proof. While you are not going to get exposed to everything in a 9 hour DVD course that you will in a full class, if you learn the material on the DVD well, you will know the core concepts that everything else builds from so the things that are not on the DVD should not pose a big problem."},{"rating":"2","title":"Geometry Tutor","review":"Good product, deliverd on time and the leassons were quite good organized.

It was loose and scratched up. I did not want the hassle of having to return it so I had to watch the whole tape at once to make sure the scratches did not prevent it from being played.

In this case we have a tendentious book in which the main intention is to deceive."},{"rating":"2","title":"Exellent!","review":"Was Yahshua clashing with the Pharisees over Torah obedience? No way. He commanded us to obey Torah. Nehemiah Gordon does a fantastic job demonstrating the real dispute between Messiah and the Religious leadrs of His day. It was not about Torah, but about their \\"Takanot and Ma'asim\\" man-made religious traditions that kept people in bondage. This is written in the pages of the REnewed Covenant scriptures, but church doctrine has blinded us to this truth. You will read the B'rit Chadasha (New Testament) with fresh eyes after you read this.The Video is even better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Title might be misleading.","review":"I thought this book was going to cover more of the New Testament than one book. I really like the approach taken and the way the author explains the steps he went through in arriving at the conclusions he suggests in this book. I was prepared to go more in depth. Very thankful for his realization that his audience may not know what is meant by/implied with various Hebrew terms and titles. Good job at anticipating the background information that Christian readers will need to understand the path that he takes towards truth.

The first track, theCD's single, is a throbbing, tight track with aGREAT female vocal. Tracks 1-5 and 7 are allexcellent. Track 7 is not a dance track at all,rather a melodic chill-out. Track 3 would be myfavorite, with rolling deep bass, a funky techline and similar phat female vocals.The only thing that detracts from this being afull on five star album is the vocals on track6... I ask myself time and time again why danceproducers even think about using cheesy malevocals. Featuring lyrics such as:\\"Deep inside of me... There's a psychadelic sea\\"Eeeeek. Come on man.

I was sorely disappointed.I found the beats okay and the previous reviews are correct in that the production is good... it's just that the basslines are a really drab and the lyrics at times are painful. I had to sell it within a few days of buying it because it placed an icky dent in my music collection.I just found that the comparison to HYBRID was unwarranted and may have set my expectations too high.

The directions made it look difficult, but this one was much easier than the other one to put up, and it really looks outstanding. It was so easy to match the pattern between sheets- the seams don't even show. The sheets were pre-cut and numbered and not too big to put up by yourself- though it would have been a bit easier with a second set of hands. Caution though, this thing is HUGE- 8.5 feet by 13.5 feet. It goes from the floor moulding nearly to the top of the nine foot ceiling. If we'd had crown moulding in that room we'd have had to cut it.

It also shows the Kittens as they relax whilst traveling to concert performances.

Constructively.... 1) Kill, Kill, Kill...I just finished a full day of duking it out with truckloads of Golems and Dragons only to find a Barrow Downs full of silly little goblins, ghosts and such...whats the point. 2)The game is too much about gold and experience and not enough about quests and adventure. 3)The storyline is transparent and passive, partly because most of my efforts are centered on $$$$, experience and Kill, Kill, Kill but mostly because, suddenly, for the last 2 to 5 percent, we shift gears from a medival slaughter to deep sea diving and a futuristic Space Ship and the games over.

I played every game of this gorgeous series. On the last M&M 6, it is put on a new high level. But in this sequel, it seems to do the same thing without new surprise. To be fair, this game is still lots of fun. I like the storyline very much--- in the game, whevever you are so careful, you MUST choose your route between good or evil, and then become the foe and the killer of the other side. This is life. And numerous quests make you always has something to do. The most disadvantage of this game is the unnecessary lots of monsters. I hate myself doing the same thing again and again, accept a guest, kill the monsters, get the item. (In fact I am not killing the monster, I'm killing my time....)

I've played so-called 'great' RPGs (Diablo, Baldur's Gate) and although those games are good, something about the Might & Magic series, 7 included, I like better.

I always liked the Might and Magic (MM) series. It was fairly simple but the built-in journaling and mapping tools made it less of a pain than other RPGs. Unfortunately MM seems to be frozen in time and this version doesn't appear to have any changes from previous one. There is a new storyline, or more precisely, a new variation of a Might and Magic storyline but graphics, sound, monsters, spells, skills and interface at all the same. I couldn't get the game run with DirectX under Windows 2000, software mode only, although the game is listed as NT-compatible. Keyboard shortcuts would stop working and occasional clipping problems got me stuck and forced a reload to get out. The sound is what really drove me crazy.

The three remixes of Tel Aviv are incredibly wide-ranging, from Stephane A.'s deep house mix to Peter Kruder's electro-bop to Charlie Dark's moody Afro-house. Pole's mix of \\"Ten\\" is typical Pole, warm sounds and stop-start dubs, while the Salvador Group's long and stripped-down take on \\"Free\\" changes tempo halfway through for a nice contrast.

This is truly a book solely for those who have an immense background or interest in Biology, and not for the typical student. I suggest you stay away from this book, or take AP Bio. That way, you would at least understand much of the information, much less, retain all of it without falling asleep! ALERT: you will need at least a month to merely review the book.

There were elements of the book that I did like, such as the don't mixed these up on the test day, located in the margins. These inserts provided general bits of info that were important. My recommendation is to buy this book only if you are well versed in all the aspects that are covered in the SAT II Biology.

Seriously, the amount of detail in this book is silly. You might be better off studying from your textbook. The practice tests are completely off, and those stupid stress relief guides at the end are just there to add more cents to this book's cost. The purpose of a preparation guide is to provide an organized, structured review, condensing as much of the course into a single, cohesive unit. This books fails in that aspect. You are never going to be quizzed on what oxaloacetate is from the Dark Reactions! And enough of those \\"I got 560, but with this book I got 800!\\" stories. It won't happen.

This also lacks practice. for those seeking good score but does not meet the criteria above, get the princeton to read and barron to practice. if you go to the same school as me, i reccomend you dont get this as well, since we did not have the best teachers (unless if you're lucky).

One of the very best things about this set is the variety of styles - chorus with organ, solo, some beautiful instrumental arrangements, some jazz arrangements, and so on. This contrasts with an older CD we have where one chorus-organ piece follows another until you get bored.

The quality is passable, it might not last for a second child, but the play value is great.PLUSES:- Wood, not plastic- No noises/voices, etc. other than ones the child makes up- Oven looks like the real thing (window, handle)- Unisex colors- Sink is big enough to actually put in play dishes and \\"wash\\" them- Compact and lightweight, yet sturdyMINUSES- Strange paint smell, which I hope will dissipate- Edges not sanded down in spots- Water knobs fit loosely and wiggle a bit (feel cheap)- Seems expensive for the size- Oven magnets too strong to open door without having to hold the entire toy -- I put felt stickers over the magnets to lessen the pullOverall, a neat launching pad for the imagination.

The first one arrived without the hanging rack and hooks, so we had to send it back for a replacement. The second one had all the parts, but they don't fit together well. The faucet and hanging rack fittings are too small for the holes so they are very wobbly. Also, don't let the picture on the website/box fool you: the hanging rack is NOT tall enough to hang many of the accessories that are shown on it. We purchased the Alex completer set that matches the items on the picture and only one pot (the smallest) will hang from the hooks. The utensils and the other pots are too long to hang from it. Seems like Alex Toys has some quality control issues.

He was able to do more with less than many others in similar situations. With no education and being looked down upon by most of his peirs that is an especially impressive achievement.Henry's work is also good in that it allows us to contrast biographies todaywith the ones from previous times. Henry pays little attention to Foresst's role in the Klan and portrays his slave trading and slave holding in the most positive light possible (dim though that may be). A more modern biographer might well blaze a blinding light upon these activities to the exclusion of his battlefield achievements.I would recomend this work to the reader interested in the Civil War.

Some nice camera work, not too many indulgent SFX.One senses the film captures the warmth and essence of the concert and you don't even get tired of the numerous shots of Lisa Germano's back. I am a Neil Finn\\\\ Crowded House fan but don't take his two solo albums out of the rack very often these days.This band kicks his recent material into the right gear and takes off. Check out the sustained sonic duet of Finn and Ed O'brien on 'In My Head'.

In addition, at over two hours in length, the DVD features songs that are not on the CD, such as \\"Driving Me Mad\\", \\"Four Seasons\\", \\"Fall at your Feet\\", and more.I could go on and on about the quality of Finn's songwriting, but hopefully if you are reading this you are savvy enough to know all that already.

Along with great songs like Go to Hell - my personal favorite song in this album, You gotta dance - more of a disco song, but gives a dark alice twist to it, I never Cry - a nice ballad, I'm always Chasing Rainbows - another good balled.

The songs \\"Go To Hell\\" and \\"Guilty\\" are worthy of note because in them, Alice pokes fun at his own shock rock lifestyle. (\\"You're something that never should have happened\\"and \\"I'm a dirt-talkin', whisky-drinkin', woman-chasin' minister's son\\" respectively.)

While there is some nice guitar work on this album, I can't get past the stupid lyrics. So many, nudge-nudge, wink-wink passages. And while I understand the humor, it just gets to sound like your old drunken uncle telling you the same corny story over and over. Alice Cooper always had humor in some songs...just not EVERY song ALL of the time.To me the best rocker is \\"Guilty\\". Great guitars and a pretty cool song. \\"I Never Cry\\" is a great ballad. Nice song. But seriously folks, that's about it. Alice singing \\"I'm Always Chasing Rainbows\\"??? Chuck Berris should've gonged him right then and there."},{"rating":"1","title":"Album Lives Up To Its Name","review":"Many found this album as one of The Coop's greatest offerings, however I found it as his biggest disappointment. If not for the title track, Guilty, and Wish You Were Here, the album would be a total flop. The rest of the songs were written with a mellow twist and lack the classic hard-rocking Cooper sound. It's a Cooper album that is much different than any other, but not in a good sense. When listening to the album straight though, the span after Go To Hell ends until Guilty begins is almost endless. Cooper somewhat rebounded with Lace and Whiskey which has more definitvie Cooper tunes, even though the album is not a popular pick for Cooper fans.

However, they are functional, i.e., heat resistant to 500 degrees F, skid and slip resistant, and dishwasher safe, and I can put them to a ton of uses. Frankly, though, I was just too lazy to go to the bother of the return process, i.e., boxing them back up, requesting a free postage return label, tracking the package and return/refund.

Polachek's research was extensive and he looked at sources, especially those in Chinese, which very few Westerners have previously commented on. However, it would appear that the emphasis on the influence of the Literati groups may be over the top in certain areas. There were certainly different groups in the Qing Court, but were they really so significant as to be the most important factors in policies regarding the Opium War? Chinese Emperors were well known for their absolute power in policy decisions over their court oficials.

In fact, they are really hard core hillbilly/country artists. On some cuts they sound a bit like the Louvin Brothers, but theirs is a rawer, older country sound.

Inland Empire was way too fragmented, and frankly it felt lazy. A lot of sloppy camera shots, sequences that moved too slowly, this film had a lot of unfocused moments that made me feel bored. I did not finish the movie. I give it 2 stars instead of 1 simply because there are a few good moments that I did enjoy."},{"rating":"2","title":"If you like David Lynch, you'll want this DVD","review":"As a David Lynch fan, I wanted to see anything he had done.

I have enjoyed David Lynch weirdness in the past (Lost Highway, Mulholland Drive, Twin Peaks, etc.) but this movie was just terrible. Imagine three hours of ambient music and random nonsensical scenes with no connection whatsoever, not even a semblance of a plot. Even the actors have no idea what the movie is about (just read one of the interviews on line). This was a self-indulgent P.O.S. Save your time and just rewatch Twin Peaks.Also, I really have no idea why people are ranting and raving about Laura Dern's performance."},{"rating":"1","title":"an argument winner for the anti-lynch brigade","review":"I once had an argument with some friends who detested The Beatles. I love them - even an earlier, deceptively simple song like 'Please Please Me' is sheer melodic genius. These friends thought their 'argument winner' was \\"Ok...what about 'Ob La Di, Ob La Da' then, huh?!\\".Hmmm... 'Inland Empire' is David Lynch's 'Ob La Di, Ob La Da' - lousy output from a very fine artist. I loved the intrigue of 'Lost Highway', and 'Mulholland Drive' still haunts me. But with 'Inland Empire' the riddles and twists left me absolutely cold. The Lynch ingredients are there but the cake just doesn't rise. I guess it's what can happen when the usual budgetary constraints of film-making are lessened to a large degree by the opportunity to shoot digitally. Discipline and restraint can go out the window as the director gets carried away with his new-found 'freedom'.Quite liked the rabbit sitcom though.... One star for that."},{"rating":"1","title":"no thanks","review":"Just when it would get interesting it would cut off to some other nonsensical stuff.Enjoyed watching Laura Dern, just not sure this was the right vehicle for her."},{"rating":"1","title":"Two Pretentious Thumbs Sucked","review":"I've had half-remembered dreams three times more coherent than this film.

Nothing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Razzie of all raspberries","review":"This was the worst movie I've ever seen. Boring doesn't come close. Disjointed, ridiculous, plotless, ugly. UGH. Not in the same class with Twin Peaks or Mulholland Drive. This doesn't even seem like the same director that made those movies. Weirder than weird this one was."},{"rating":"1","title":"Whats the Point?","review":"I am a big David Lynch fan but this film is nonsence. Yep sure David is once again delving into the subconcious and dream states but he has done it before and better. At least in films like Mulholland Drive you can follow the film to some degree and try and peel back the mystery. Inland Empire is purely a nonsensical opportunity for David Lynch to throw as many of his weirdo ideals and artistry into the one film and not care about any structure or form. At three hours in length and moving at the pace of a sloth this film is truly an endurance test which is quite frankly not worth the effort. Save your crazy stuff for your art shows Dave and get back to making films like Blue Velvet and Wild at Heart which prove how much better a discernable plotline can be."},{"rating":"1","title":"I Can't Believe I Watched the Whole Thing","review":"Definitely the absolute WORST movie I have ever seen. I usually don't sit through a movie if it's bad, but I sat through this one, unfortunately. Completely boring, no plot, nothing interesting. 3 hours long. When there was only 15 minutes of it to go, I could not bear to watch it any longer, but watched it anyway in hopes that the 2 hours and 45 minutes I just wasted would at least be redeemed at the end. Sorry it wasn't. How can this possibly have so many good ratings I don't understand. The worst, and most boring , and the stupidest movie ever. And what did the stupid rabbit head scenes have to do with anything? For that matter what did any of the movie have to do with anything? It made absolutely NO sense. Someone must have been paid to write good reviews about this joke of a movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Let's hope the rabbits don't breed.............","review":".........and produce another film like this one. As usual, you think you are following along with the film (despite the rabbits in the room scene) and, all of a sudden, it degenerates in a long winded, confusing, boring series of unrelated and unconnected drivel.The movie was billed as a horror in the International Film Festival I saw it in. The only horror part in the movie was when I suddenly had this scary thought that it would never end.I should have been warned off when I saw the 2 clues \\"David Lynch\\" and \\"Surreal\\" but no, I thought, \\"nothing could be as bad as Mulholland Drive\\"One could make better use of 3 hours by staring blankly at nothing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lights, Camera, A x X o N N...","review":"An actress named Nikki (Laura Dern) is plunged into a nightmare universe of alternate identities, time-warps, and inside-out reality after she takes a part in a cursed movie. At least, that's what I get out of it. Dern is incredible in this nearly one-person show. All others, including Jeremy Irons and Jason Theroux, are incidental at best. Ms. Dern carries this 3 hour (4 hrs and 15 min. when bonus \\"more things that happened\\" is included) trip through wonder-hell. David Lynch has fashioned his best dreamscape yet! The logical trappings give way early, leaving us disoriented and confused. Add in a deep sense of dread for an utterly insane experience. If you happen to be a Lynch-virgin, I would recommend starting w/ ERASERHEAD and working your way through DL's catalogue before jumping into INLAND EMPIRE..."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of Lynch's best films!","review":"With out going into detail of what the film may or may not be about, I will say that it is possibly the most disorienting and disturbing piece of cinema I have seen in a very long time...maybe ever! By the end of the movie you feel like you've been slapped around in your seat for 3 hours. But considering how boring and nonexperimental movies have become today this is a wonderful thing. Highly Recommended!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Avoid at all cost","review":"This is by far the worst movie I've seen in my life. We had a chance to see it with my wife during the premiere screening in Europe. The viewers at such events, who are usually fond of ambitious movies were leaving in such numbers that we were afraid that no one would survive till the end."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unlike all the 5 star reviews, I'm not pretending to enjoy this so I look smart...","review":"This is up there as one of the WORST movies I've ever seen. The only reason I finished this rubish was I figured it had to go somewhere, hell he had three hours! If you want to make a movie about the evils of Hollywood then do it, don't make some rubbish that feels like your viewing it through the eyes of an 8 year old with A.D.D. who forgot to take his meds. Trust me, this movie couldn't get any worse. My only explination for these 5 star reviews is I think people are trying to look all arty and smart when in reality its just a mess.

I love Dune; favorite SciFi movie ever. So it hit me hard that this movie was such a complete and utter failure. I feel I have been robbed of the price of the movie, of three hours of my life, and it was done by a friend. This movie was beyonbd disjointed, it was shattered. It exercised wierdness not to set mood or advance plot, but just to be wierd. Save your money and pray the next offering shows Lynch's old promise."},{"rating":"2","title":"An amazing feat in film","review":"I ordered this with two-day shipping. Amazon got it to me before the second day. It was in mint condition as all of my orders have been. I'll continue to shop at Amazon. INLAND EMPIRE is my favorite Lynch to date. It is the fullest expression a filmmaker has ever put to film. You can tell, because Lynch--who is always painfully particular about detail, has had the freedom of movement, lenght of film, lighting variability, independent control, and budget of digital film. He says he will use only digital now. I think his film open broader as they go, and I'm excited to see what the next one will bring."},{"rating":"1","title":"Baffling, Confusing, Incomprehensible","review":"Truly the most challenging movie I've ever seen. I was baffled and confused. Why couldn't I understand what was going on? Where was the plot? WHAT was the plot? The movie seemed to be about something, and then it wasn't. It was moody, atomospheric, dreamlike, surreal, and extemely disturbing. I was intrigued at first, and then finally, in the end, just angry for wasting so much of my time and energy on it. I searched for the meaning of it, and read some things that helped me, although not much. But seriously if one has to go through all that trouble to make any sense of a film they just watched---well, then this is the perfect film for you! Good luck and don't say you weren't warned."},{"rating":"1","title":"Big disapointment from a great filmmaker","review":"If you can imagine David Lynch making an 8 hour home movie to test out a cheap digital camera, then you've pretty much got Inland Empire. Really really long and rambling, without any of the sureal beauty of his other movies (many of which are fantastic). Fan or not, give this one a pass."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bloated Lynch Film","review":"With some major editing this could have been an awesome movie. I love lynch and there are some very interesting scenes. It's just too long to endure.

Bravo, Mr. Lynch. I'll subscribe to your coffee.Lynch's objective is not to have an audience who can tell what his films are \\"about,\\" or to \\"understand\\" what's going on, but rather to give viewers strangenesses to live through and to be inspired by.Laura Dern is magnificently mysterious. Her character is as hypnotizing as the moods invoked by the experience of \\"Inland Empire\\".Every character is beautiful and every frame is a work of art.Lynch's use of sound, light, color and music are, as they always have been for me in his work, essential elements of modern expressionism.A x xx i on!"},{"rating":"1","title":"poor sound bad picture","review":"It is odd how few reviews mention the sound quality of this DVD: it is barely audible and you will have to turn it up maximum to actually hear something. Once you have sorted out the sound and sat through about half an hour you may note that you are not seeing much either: this is because it is either dark, or blurred or simply so obscure that there is simply not much to see. I do like David Lynch, I love Mulholland Drive and am a fan of Twin Peaks, but the sound and image on this DVD are obscure to say the least... leave alone the actual meaning of the movie, on which is it is hard to focus."},{"rating":"1","title":"Inland Empire","review":"What has happened to David Lynch? I'm loath to say that sometimes it may be best for an artist to be restricted by producers and executives because, in this self-distributed venture, Lynch has left the planet. \\"Inland Empire\\" makes \\"Eraserhead\\" or \\"Mulholland Drive\\" or even \\"Lost Highway\\" look like \\"Just My Luck\\" because it hasn't the slightest degree of cohesion.[...]"},{"rating":"1","title":"Profoundly Disappointed","review":"Even by David Lynchian standards this was a convoluted, incomprehensible mess. After enduring nearly 3 hours of jumbled vignettes of disjointed scenes, many in camera obscura, many in Polish, and many with people wearing donkey heads (??or mouse heads), with an obligato of blaring, jarring noises, I finally succumbed to the inevitable: this is simply not good. Lynch is making too many demands upon this humble viewer. I know. I know. It's phantasmagorical, artistic genius that I've just witnessed. Well, maybe. But nevertheless it was not in the least understandable nor, for that reason primarily, enjoyable.I watch movies in the main to be entertained, sometimes educated. This opus did neither. I came away bored and dissatisfied. I felt like I had just been privy to someone's psychotic nightmare."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why? why? why?","review":"This isn't really a movie. It's more like an abstract video with a bare semblance of 'plot.' It does have a cool, ominous soundtrack. Clearly, this is an art film, meant to be looked at and contemplated, not necessarily enjoyed as entertainment. For me, it just wasn't worth the effort. Watch if you are a dire fan of David Lynch only."},{"rating":"1","title":"Like a bad parody of a David Lynch film","review":"Just awful. A series of surreal vignettes with no meaningful connection. Laura Dern looks very confused; she must have tried reading the (nonexistent) script. And while it's true she plays 'confused' very well, that doesn't carry the film. David Lynch finally made a boring film."},{"rating":"1","title":"I think I'll stick to Blue Velvet","review":"Somehow I made it through the 3hr marathon called Inland Empire. As confusing and bizarre as Lost Highway and Mulholland Drive were, at least those films were interesting, in a bizarre and creepy way. This film, Inland Empire, was creepy, but not all that interesting. Can something be creepy and boring at the same time? Mr. Lynch has done it. (and Blue Velvet is one of my all-time favorite films). Maybe I'll need to see it again, maybe in a year, but I can see why no theater screened this one (not even the so-called art cinemas). 2 stars because I still respect David Lynch as an artist. Speaking of \\"straight \\" films, anybody remember the \\"Straight Story\\", directed by Lynch?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Long","review":"Three solid hours of nonsensical, esoteric allusions to reincarnation. It grapples with the deep truth that our current lives can be likened to a needle stuck in a record groove as our dormant spirits go through life in a vulgar body entriely unaware that we are treading the same doomed path we have trod time and time before; only in this film Laura Dern seems to lose the comfort of that unawareness and all her lives start playing out at once.It is so abstract and goes on for so long it gets nigh on impossible to enjoy. Also, much like Twin Peaks, it offers no hope or positive energy, only an overwhelming sense of the all-consuming, dark void over which we have no control, making for a very bleak and unforgiving experience.Not one to watch on a Saturday night with a bowl of popcorn."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very strange, pretty entertaining","review":"Even seeing some of his other movies, and hearing about this beforehand didn't prepare me for the craziness that was in store after popping this DVD in. I'd have to say I enjoyed the first hour the most, as it was the most linear and easiest to follow. And then the movie suddenly gets really bizarre and somewhat incomprehensible. I really wasn't sure how I was supposed to decipher what I was viewing, was this actually the curse being played out? Was it some kind of metaphoric dream interlaced with random scenes of the past, present, and future? Lol after watching it there's plenty of discussions online if you want to try and screw your head on straight afterwards. I enjoyed the movie, but don't wish to spend another 3 hours with it in order to watch with an experienced perspective. I don't mind that he made this movie, but hope his next one returns to his previous style with a less surreal narration. I'd actually give it 3 1/2 stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"David Lynch, Neo-Feminist","review":"Can't wait for the DVD version of Lynch's latest. Laura Dern plays multiple characters as Lynch shows us that women's roles in society have not changed much despite the fact that it's now 2007. Females are still looked upon as objects, as the passive recipients of whatever men wish to dole out to them, and as incapable of achieving any kind of enlightenment or redemption whatsoever. Dern is magnificent, and Lynch is at his confounding best. One of the best films of the milennium so far."},{"rating":"1","title":"Useless until corrected.

Uncannily, Southern anticipated the emergence of 'porno chic' in mid-70s America. As well as chronicling a porn shoot, this book also makes its own unique contribution to the erotic arts, with a stream of wildly unhinged and increasingly tasteless set-piece sex scenes. And isn't that dedication (to 'the great Stanley K.') the most back-handed ever, given that the character based on Kubrick is both pretentious and foolish?"},{"rating":"2","title":"A dark and raunchy satire!","review":"Terry Southern floored me with Candy, and I couldn't wait to read another one of his comic -- albeit raunchy -- satires. Blue Movie did not disappoint me. The story of an accomplished filmmaker's attempt at creating an adult movie with famous actors in it is dark, stark, smut, fun and entertaining. There are a lot of political aspects that might offend some people, but the point of the story is that it's satirical - i.e., truth without apology. I couldn't put this book down. This novel is as outrageous and sinister as Candy. Are you in the bargain for a satirical read? I suggest Blue Movie. Terry Southern is brilliant.

The first day I got it, & read the first chapter & was upset for randy. The second day, I worked a 12 hour shift, but read the second chapter on my lunch break. By day 3, i was free from work & finished the rest!! What a powerful essay of one man's life. I feel admiration for the courage it took for the author to slit his wrists & bleed a very personal life on the paper for strangers to read.

The focus is very narrow and pertains to some selected countries. The analysis is very limited and does not consider the social backgrounds of the countries in question, when they are developing nations.The question of globalization should be treated with a balance Anyone who touts only the good side of an idea should be looked down with skepticism. Globalization is not the silver bullet. The authors back away from their responsiblity in educating the readers about the downside of this phenomena.In summary, a one sided view of the world, lacks breadth and would not contribute much to your understanding.A better book would be \\"The Lexus and the Olive Tree\\" by Thomas L Friedman."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not thrilled","review":"The item was purchased for my daughter, no sparkle and it would bend pretty easily.

Her love song to public radio \\"Are You Out There\\" was the song that brought me to this CD. But \\"What Do You Hear in these Sounds?\\" knocked me out, moved me. In this song, she said things about therapy that are pointed, poignant and thrilling. \\"But oh how I loved everybody else/ When I finally got to talk so much about myself.\\" \\"Party Generation\\" is a catchy anthem.

They include pictures of the Scopes trial, a lynching, the Jonestown massacre, and many more. The text is straightforward and rather sober, with a generally liberal bias. Its target readership is young adult. It perhaps understates the impact of 'fringe' religions such as Scientology. The account of the origin and rise of the televangelists is particularly good.

There is a story about a casual sexual encounter that seems entirely out of place in this day of AIDS. Italian men are portrayed as habitually unfaithful to their wives (\\"The Italian Mistress\\"). There are excerpts that characterize the \\"average Italian citizen\\" as an inveterate cheater. Italians, we are told, are breast-obsessed. This book is a paradigm of the sort of travel writing that romanticizes the exotic \\"other.\\" I see no reason to think that this brings anyone closer to the \\"real\\" Italy and it is silly and simplistic to think otherwise. It would appear that in these days of political correctness it is still considered acceptable to portray Italians in a patronizing way, in contrast with almost every other group or ethnicity.

My Sony takes 1 MP stills, has excellent video, but @ 1MP, the stills are not nearly print worthy. This camera is actually smaller and lighter than my Sony.The 5MP still camera function gave excellent results, both with flash and with natural light and outside. Shot for shot it produced either as good or better prints (4x6) than the Sony CyberShot.Digital video is this unit's short coming. I did identical shots inside and outside with the Sony and Samsung. The Samsung's video quality was very poor, looked more like analog or standard 8mm quality. Inside, with natural room lighting, it was pretty much unacceptable. Outside, the shots lacked the crispiness of the Sony.

I had to deal with many customer service people, but finally got them to agree mine was a \\"lemon\\" and they sent me the SCD6550. Now 10 months later, the video and playback on this duocam has broken. You see a black screen with yellow blocks on the LCD and through the viewfinder.

Not overpowering but certainly noticable and unenjoyable.

First I do like the idea of not a lot of crap I don't need, like artificial sweeteners and preservatives. But this stuff tore my stomach up. It foams really bad in the blender. It turns a 12oz shake into a 24oz shake. I can only handle a half scoop or my stomach is in knots. ON's whey doesn't do this and if I want I can take 2 or 3 scoops of that.

I put the milk in the microwave for about 30 seconds prior to adding the protein. Warming the milk helps it mix with the other ingredients.

My judgment told me not to believe and I was duped. I can drink anything as I usually just mix my protein with water and chug it. I've never complained about taste, until now. This stuff tastes TERRIBLE. Water is the worst. I've tried it with milk and gatorade (yes I even went to gatorade to mask the taste). Still tastes awful mixed with both. Now that I have to mix it with all sorts of other stuff to bear it, I have defeated the sole purpose of me buying it in the first place.
