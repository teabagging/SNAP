Queen Latifah is known to be the first female to be a solo rapper and get a record deal. She has also become a top television actress and movie star. She got a Grammy and became the president of her own company. Ladies First is about a girl named Dana Owens who is from Newark, New Jersey and how she becomes Queen Latifah and the things she went through because of a tragic death.The content of the book is organized pretty well. It starts when her mom, Rita Owens, talking about Queen Latifah's younger days, then moves to Queen Latifah talking about what became of her. The book is quite easy to read. It has vocabulary and slang of a ghetto life style.The book rates a five stars, as it is extremely interesting to read and written well enough that readers are easily able to become involved. I recommend this book to anyone who listens to her music or understands her lyrics."},{"rating":"1","title":"It was bad","review":"Lady's First is an uninteresting, boring, and pointless book.

They indicated that it was a domino effect, and they recommended replacing 4 circuit boards including the control board, Y-sustain board, upper driver, and lower driver board. Parts alone would cost more than $700, and even then they would not guarantee that it would be fixed. I am very disappointed in the reliability of this product. My warranty was 12 months and it failed not too long after that."},{"rating":"1","title":"Burned Out after two years","review":"Like some of the other reviewers, I had this TV for about two years and then it just burned out. No picture. The price may look cheap, but if you have to replace your TV every two years, it's really quite expensive. Also, because HP is not a common brand, you can't program universal remotes from cable/satelitte providers to work with it. So, you will always need two remotes. The speakers/sound of the TV are wildly inadequate. Also, this TV has serious burn problems. The parts of the picture on the sides of the screen were signficantly brighter after moderate use. This was due to viewing some non-widescreen broadcasts, which apparently dimmed the more-used pixels significantly.

I had such high hopes going into this one because of some of the fine supporting actors, namely Claude Rains and Warren William. But no amount of debonair Englishmen or American smooth operators could counteract the terrible Lon Chaney Jr as the eponymous Wolf Man. Alright, so he's not much to look at (being turned into a WolfMan did him no disservice, actually), but what I really objected to was that Chaney's character was, well, a creep before he ever met up with those darned gypsies. Look at how he meets the girl: he gets a hold of a telescope and starts peering in bedroom windows. That's not the most romantic hero I ever saw, you know? And just why was he alienated from dad Claude Rains anyway? Was it for this kind of nasty voyeurism? And how could such a lumbering fellow ever have sprung from the loins of elegant Claude Rains either? Bad, bad dog!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I hated this movie because the wolfman wasn't in it for long","review":"The only thing I liked about this movie was the cover. I have watched most of the horror classics ,and I did not like this movie because lon Chaney jr. played larry Talbot more that he did the wolfman.

I guess my attention span is far shorter than a lot of people's. I found this movie to be very slow with almost no action and zero scares. I much prefer An American Werewolf In London, The Howling, and Silver Bullet. I liked the scene where Lon Chaney first realizes he's a werewolf, and starts sprouting fur. Other than that, I was bored. I hope the new Wolfman is more entertaining than this."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Wolf Man DVD","review":"This was purchased as a gift for my son.

I bought each dvd as packaged/marketed as the Universal Monster Collection. I returned all four. The Wolfman's iconic scene of his transformation by Lon Chaney, Jr into 'The Wolfman' was totally missing. Not skipping...missing as it not on the dvd copy. I also watched 'Frankenstein' and the entire scene where the monster is befriended by the blind man...missing....as in not there. This scene is the most pivotal of the entire film, speaking to not judging by people by appearances. These are very low quality, incomplete versions. I read several of the 4-star reviews and all I can say is that I had a completely different experience. In all fairness, I did not screen Dracula or The Mummy as I didn't have the time to waste and I do not want to support whomever is distributing this junk."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wolf Man","review":"The Wolf Man is one of the lesser of the great Universal horror classic but still a classic. It is about a werewolf who doesn't want to be one. The only real problem with the movie is a lack of motivation. We know that you don't want to be a werewolf. If you want to see a better movie see the original Frankenstein but still don't miss the Wolf Man!P.S. Does anyone remember the ending? I forgot it and it's really bugging me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best DVD of the year?","review":"The movie is wonderful. It transports you to that ill-defined time and place that is the world of the Universal horror classics. It introduces you to a number of memorable characters, most importantly Lawrence Talbot, the man destined to walk and stalk as a wolf by the full moon. Lon Chaney Jr delivers a pleasant tragic performance, and the supporting cast is particularly outstanding. The DVD presentation is terrific. An excellent transfer, with THE BEST commentary I've ever heard and a very strong documentary accompanying it. This is easily the best DVD release of a Universal horror classic so far, and could be the best DVD release of 1999. If you have any interest at all, don't hesitate to buy it."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Werewolf Classic is Back!","review":"Universal is pulling out all the stops for their Classic Monster Collection. The Wolf Man is arguably the best of the series along with Dracula. Everyone knows the classic story of Larry Talbot, but this loaded DVD makes the experience even better. First off, this has one of the cleanest prints out of all the Classic Monster DVD's. The picture is so clear, it's amazing. There is also some nice extras, the best of which is an hour long documentary hosted by John Landis(An American Werewolf in London). There is also some nice Wolfman picture archive, a trailer, a very insightful feature-length commentary by film historian Tom Weaver, and a trailer. If you want to start watchin the classic monsters now, then The Wolf Man is the perfect place to start."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another Universal Classic","review":"It wasnt until the last few years that i began watching these old horror Universal Classics and I have not been disapointed. Wolfman is truely an errily gothic movie. The makeup for Lon Chaney was really good for its day and he makes a believable character. Lugosi foretelling the future to the first victim I thought was really superb acting. The feeling of intensity as he tells her to run for her life after foreseeing her fate was incredible. Too bad Lugosi did not have a bigger part. Hard to belive this was panned by the critics upon release. This is truely an excellent movie with the sets, the lighting and the acting to most horror pictures. Again, another must for anyone interested in Universal classic horror!"},{"rating":"1","title":"something fishy","review":"i purchased the legacy collection(green cover, 4 films/2 discs) at an un-named superstore this morning while finishing my christmas shopping. well, lo and behold, this version was inside(the original film plus second disc of extras). i checked here and other sites which also listed it as NA. someone at Universal screwed up."},{"rating":"2","title":"Give it up for Shaggy!!!","review":"Wow the original Wolfman, give it up. Good flick, not too much terror, so the whole family can watch it. Lon Chaney will ALWAYS be the Wolfman, and will ALWAYS be remembered as the Wolfman. Check out his dad in this flick too, it's the corrupt French official from 'Casablanca'.If you ever want to flirt with a woman that you've spying on with a telescope, don't do it this way. Chaney is given lines that wouldn't even work on a drunken two bit dame in a nameless bar. Lame dialogue even for a innocent 1940's movie.You never see Chaney actually transform into the WOlfman, the first time he does it you just see him change from the shins down. You only see his face transform to human after his father kills him.The blonde in this flick is indeed hot. Too bad she didn't show up again in the sequel 'Frankenstein meets the Wolfman'."},{"rating":"2","title":"Used for Football","review":"My son used these socks as part of his football uniform.

I ordered God's Gladiators and read it cover to cover the day it arrived. I immediately went into a long clinical depression (my first) while I tried to wrestle with the dark world he has invented. Now that I am well medicated and almost a year into therapy, I can see the book for what it is, and objectively: The Ravings Of A Liar Or A Madman. If the book is meant to be a metaphor, Wilde pointing out that the devil story IS a metaphor only makes it appear the rest of the book is not. I think this old man has gone bonkers, right out to lunch, and is quite possibly schizophrenic. Try holding up any of his claims to scientific scrutiny and I bet we'll find nothing that can be proven. This is a sad and dangerous book by a sick man who used to have something to say. Total BS. I wonder what Wayne Dyer thinks of this crap?"},{"rating":"2","title":"His best and most revealing work","review":"Stuart Wilde lays it all out.

Jude must have them at any cost, even if it means bumping off hubby's new girlfriend! This sets up some nice insane behavior for Jamie Lee to sink her beautiful teeth into. MOTHER'S BOYS is a fairly tense, nearly bloodless movie. The fun comes from watching the Jude character grow increasingly reckless, dangerous, and downright lethal. Oh yeah, she does flash a boobular as well, if you're into that. My goodness she is well put together!

Oops! Daddy has already found a new girlfriend. Oops again! The kids like the girlfriend! Of course, mayhem ensues, right up until the literal \\"cliffhanger\\" ending.The director either ran out of film, or decided he couldn't possibly wrap the story up neatly, because the big climatic scene suddenly simply ends without explanation or resolution.The best part of this film is watching Jamie Lee do her best impersonation of Sharon Stone in Basic Instinct.

The plot is pretty simple (ok, paper thin)- but don't watch it for that; if you're like me (a Jamie Lee Curtis Fan - yes, I confess) this was kind of fun to watch. Her other film roles have generally been of her as a fairly squeaky clean, wholesome person or as a victim. But in \\"Mother's Boys\\", she really goes the other way (to the dark side that is). And she looks great, and is very sexy in this role - especially when it comes to showing those great legs she has, which she inherited from her mother (Janet Leigh). It also reminded me of \\"A Fish Called Wanda\\", where she REALLY showed those great legs.Any way watch and enjoy!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Grey hair","review":"Unless you have lighter than medium blonde hair, this just appears grey. Me and my friends tried it and it worked on me, only because I have light golden blonde hair but on everyone else it looked grey. Also, it even turned my hair a grey if i put too much of it in.

It is full of inaccuracy and questionable advice. For example the author states the biopsy is painful. I had one last week with no pain whatsoever. He also states that his doctor made an appointment for him to have surgery the next day. There is no way that would happen. The colon must heal for several weeks before surgery can be preformed and the urologists will want to discuss treatment options. Prostate cancer is very slow growing therefore it is not urgent to remove it immediately. There are many, many more examples. It is scary to thing how many people may have missed their chance to remove their cancer and instead followed this book. Once the caner goes outside the gland there is NO turning back and NO cure is possible at that point. A cure is 100% if the glad is removed in time to stop the spread.

There is no clinical evidence to support the authors assertions."},{"rating":"1","title":"Many Conclusions and Opinions- Little Evidence","review":"Offers many unique and very unusual opinions, but unfortunately almost none are supported by direct references to a study, clinical trial, or scientific article.

Unlike many other books with a religious character, Wade's status as a pastor is part of his character and motivations, not a stereotype. Newcomer, Amy is a young woman struggling to find a home for her unborn child and Wade promises to deliver her three miracles - a place to live, a job, and a father for her child. Ms. Macomber delivers a miracle of her own in the final installment of the Sons of Texas.

I personally hate all of those bands, but also listed was MxPx. I had heard of these guys before but never really gave them a listen. I went on here and looked at some albums by MxPx. This was the first one I looked at and it got some pretty good reviews. So I figured since I had some blank CDs lying around that I would burn this. I'm very glad I made that decision.

Of course some said that it wasn't as good as Life In General, don't get me wrong (L.I.G. is a great album) that is ridiculous, this album was so well put together, smooth catchy beats and the lyrics and the way Mike Herrera sings them go so well with it. Some of the songs on L.I.G. just do not sound good, period, simply put. I like lots of the songs on L.I.G. but definately not all, I honestly am saying I enjoy EVERY song on Slowly Going The Way Of The Buffalo, my favorites are Under Lock And Key, Set The Record Strait, I'm OK you're OK, and Inches From Life, the rest rock too.

And God Rocks!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best MxPx album to date.","review":"I'm surprised to see that a lot of the reviews of this album claim that this was not when MxPx was at their peak. Slowly Going the Way of the Buffalo, the follow-up to their breakout alubm Life In General, is easily their best effort to date. I can't say much about guitar or bass (since I know nothing about them), but Yuri's drums on this album are intense! Mike's vocals and lyrics are slightly more polished than those of earlier albums and the band hadn't yet hit complete \\"pop punk\\" status. This album is some good fun rock.

I had only heard small parts of songs from the online segments, and that doesn't really tell you anything. As soon as it came, i put it into my CD player and haven't taken it out since. This is the best album I ever bought. MxPx is great. They sound sort of like Blink 182, but their lyrics are much better. Mike's vocals are fantastic on this, and so is yuri's drumming. My personal favorites are 'Inches from Life', 'I'm OK, you're OK' and 'The Final Slowdance'. Of course all of the other songs are good too. This is a must-have album for any fan of punk-rock."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great CD by a great band","review":"This is the first of their albums that i bought, and i loved it so much, i bought all the rest!

My honest idea of the cd was that they weren't playing anthing that i hadn't heard on other punk/pop cd's although i am a fan of punk music, the cd was just too predictable. I play guitar myself and could arlready tell the basic feel of the song within the first song. Don't buy this unless your one of those people who has been led to believe that the only acceptable rock music is christian rock music because think you will burn hell otherwise."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome Christian Punk Band","review":"To all of you who dont like this band cuz they talk bout Jesus Christ their Lord and Savior,,,,dont listen!

I reccomend it to everyone!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A smooth...punk sound","review":"This cd is great! I just got it and have listened to it about ten times. All its songs have a smooth, punk sound that is great. If you like a little bit more raw or hardcore sound, I suggest you go with \\"Teenage Politics\\" or \\"Pokinatcha\\" the bands earlier cd's. MxPx and Blink 182 are greatest punk bands ever."},{"rating":"1","title":"MxPx punk? More like mainstream rock","review":"MxPx is one of the best punk bands ever. I've listened to them since Pokinatcha, and theyre next two albums blew me away. I had very high hopes for this record, but it came extremely short of them. Yuri doesn't do those really fast heel-toe beats at all on this record, which was a big part of what made them so good to begin with. Also, I didn't notice any religious references on this record. I'm not christian at all, in fact I'm islamic, but it was always nice to hear a good band try to push a good message along, and I don't think I heard any of that on this. To sum it up, MxPx seem to have lost their punk roots and gone in a more mainstream rock direction. It's a good cd, but is mediocre compared to previous material."},{"rating":"1","title":"Somewhat disappointing...defintely not what I expected.","review":"The first two songs I ever heard from MxPx were Grey Skies Turn Blue and Wrecking Hotel Rooms and I completely loved them. I was looking for more of the same when I bought this album and what I found was all fast, hard rock. I bought this album because it was so highly recommended both here and on various christian rock playlists. Now it's not like I don't like this style of music, it's just that virtually every song sounds the same because of the same overbearing drum rhythm. I'm hoping that it grows on me, but at the moment I'm kind of repulsed by it.If anyone knows any songs or artists that are closer in style to the first two songs I mentioned, please email me at erpartlan@yahoo.com. Haha, don't worry, I'm not a kid, I just don't have an account. Also, can anyone tell me if the other songs in Panic sound anything like the songs in this one?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Where did Jesus Go?","review":"Um this isn't very good. If you want to know about sellout then ask this band. Jesus takes backseat to a bunch of crappy girl songs. A lot of the songs or pretty boring. It does have high parts(I'm OK You're OK, Fist vs. Tact) but most of it kinda blows. Get Pokinatcha or Life in General just because they're way better. Just because one song say Jesus doesn't mean you are still a Christian band"},{"rating":"2","title":"Yeah, that's more like it.","review":"This was my first MxPx Cd. I have got their newer stuff and they are much better than this one. I now realize that this Cd though a great one, is very Mellow. You can tell, because they have some really slow and poppy songs on this Cd. The best tracks are 1,2,3,4,9,12,14, and 15. Buy this Cd, but Ten Years and Running is the Best!!!!!!!! Also while your shopping here be sure to check out Big Wig, Smiley Kids, Midtown, and New Found Glory okay. If MxPx released another album like Teenage Polotics they would have been going the way of the buffalo."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great Album","review":"I've met the fellas from MxPx and have spoken with them for a bit about this whole thing about people thinking they are a christian band. I am getting sick and tired of people calling these guys a christian band. Yes, they are christians but they aren't a christian band. Creed sings about God more than MxPx does and people don't label them christian music as much as people do MxPx. Just listen to this album for the love of the music.

While all the other reviewers are sitting around arguing about whether mxpx is a christian or punk band, they are missing the actual quality of this cd! It makes no difference whether it's christian rock or not, they are still the best! I bought this cd after The Ever Passing moment and have also listened to their other cd's and this has got to be one of, if not their best. Every single song is full of energy and is good quality music! I really love song numbers 9 and 3, but there isn't one that I don't like.

It's \\"punk\\" with the edges dulled, \\"punk\\" that you can listen to with your mommy.Basically, the music is as contrived as their squeaky clean church club image and prep school hair dos. The fact that MXPX reside on an inpendent label is just a footnote attached to the fact they are interchangeable with the blink 182s and new found glories of the world....you know, once punk rock was about rebelling against the establishment. now it IS the establishment.welcome to 2002"},{"rating":"1","title":"Christian punk is not only an oxymoron, the music's TERRIBLE","review":"Punk rock, from day one, was anti-religion in all it's forms. It was about anti-oppression and anti-control. MxPx not only embraces the fascist god in their music, the music itself is horrible! I'm not giving a blind judgement; I owned the CD. It got extremely tedious and boring. In summary, the CD is bland, the music is boring, and all the things christianity supports, i.e. homophobia, racism, sexism, etc. are atrocious. If you like the type of music, I'd advise you to support a band with better morals. DOWN WITH CHRISTIAN PUNK! Write me with agreements or hate mail."},{"rating":"2","title":"great cd!!!","review":"Who the hell cares if they don't sound christian?

(See, I thought it would follow the trope of slave-girl-breaks-free-and-kicks-some-ass). Let's get right down to it... the early plot builds up to the gang rape of a virgin (librarian, I believe). Who really enjoys being gang raped.She then hooks up with her first / dominant rapist (well, he buys her, she is a slave). And then it goes into a morass of Gor-politics and chest pounding.I am so horrified that this book is being rereleased for $20.00. It wasn't worth the $3.95 I paid in 1990, it's certainly not worth $18.95 now.Unfortunately, it's the sort of book you can't scrub out of your brain. 20 years later you will still remember this protagonist enjoying being gang raped. (And, additionally, not feeling any, you know, pain, as there's some drum music and that mysteriously turns her on.)Ughh.

I was getting so frustrated trying to find out where I was at in the book, because it would say the same thing every other paragraph!. To say that this book is actually literature would be the biggest lie ever. The whole first chapter accounts for about 2 minutes of just struggling and crying, then talking about how the sky is soooo blue, and then some more crying.

The book has an interesting premise, as we discover that the Omegas have deviated from their previous course and are closing in on a yet-unexplored solar system. There, low and behold, we discover a civilization which is seemingly doomed to perish from the Omega clouds.Despite a great overall theme, this book drags, and drags, and drags. There are annoyances as well, such as the decision to throw \\"the protocol\\" out the window almost immediately. I forced myself to read approximately over 250 pages of Omega, but finally gave up. This is only the second book in my lifetime that I've abandoned.Not an interesting read. Die-hard fans of McDevitt may find some interest here, but in general this book disappoints greatly."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hated It!","review":"Wow, just awful. The writing is not terrible, and neither is the setup. But this book could have been so much more. The beginning tantalizes a glimpse into large questions: why are there so few planets with intelligent life? Are the Omegas malevolent or simply indifferent? Who created them and why?And, sadly, the payoff is never forthcoming. None of these questions are answered in more than fleeting, trivial terms.What is endlessly, monotonously explored is the target planet, whose inhabitants are identical to humans, to within an engineering approximation, in almost every aspect. What a monumental lack of imagination!I actually put this book in the recycling when I was finished. I am bewildered by the other positive reviews here. To each his own, I guess, and truth be told, I'm not a writer and respect anyone who can put together a book full of words. But yikes..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Goompahs _ Ewoks... Evil Clouds and other Curiosities","review":"The plot of _Omega_ is fairly cool and the book started off very promising. The story develops quite well but then suddenly plummets into a Care Bear meets Ewok expose on a remote and endangered planet. The \\"alien\\" creatures, the \\"Goompahs\\", turn out to be cute, roly-poly hillbilly-esque beings living in a 12th century English settlement displaced lightyears away from Earth. Lost me there.I recommend skipping this one. Unfortunately this book was boring enough to chase me away after investing some 200+ pages into it. Only one other book I haven't finished in over 2 years solid."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Waste of a Great Premise","review":"I only bought this book because it finally promised to reveal the secret of the Omega clouds. What a complete waste of a great premise! Although McDevitt doesn't actually confirm beyond all doubt that the \\"reveal\\" is indeed the truth, the idea is insipid, boring, a waste of something that could have been really interesting, and doesn't even really make sense when you think about it (SPOILER: why build clouds that zoom off course to planets light years away if you really just want them to drive to a certain point and explode ... makes no sense).Aside from all that, I found the characterization inconsistent, and frankly, boring. If you want to read something with real creativity and excitement, try something by Neal Asher or Peter F. Hamilton.This is the last McDevitt book I will ever buy. I collect SF books, and have an extensive library, but I can't justify keeping this one. Into the trash it goes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Unapoligetic fan","review":"I pretty much advance order everything that McDevitt writes as soon as it gets listed on Amazon. Omega is another one of his excellent books. It should be read in sequence after Engine of the Gods and it provides details filling in other McDevitt novels' plot lines."},{"rating":"2","title":"Omega by Jack McDevitt","review":"This is a great book as are all of McDevitt's works. However, I have never seen this before in all my years of reading, the copy I received from Amazon had a mix up in printing. Pages 83 through114 were missing. In their place were pages 371 through 402 which which were also in their right place in the book. So I never got to read 33 crucial pages of the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very light","review":"I picked this up in an airport bookstore hoping for a tight, believable plot.

What a bargain!!! Being a drummer, I really appreciate the intricate rhythms played wonderfully by drummer/percussionist Martin Deller. There are no guitars on this album (except bass) and any resemblance to one is really a mandolin. The Violin is brought to life by Nash the Slash and at times is haunting. Subsequent FM albums have Ben Mink (later to hitch up with K.D. Lang) on violin. This group demonstrates there is another Canadian power trio other than Rush, a favorite group of mine. Years later when I found the CD, it was nearly $22.00. The price offered by Amazon is outstanding. This album is a must for fusion enthusiasts."},{"rating":"2","title":"Please release this again!","review":"Black Noise was a spectacular album back when it was released.

Although the sound and musicianship is excellent, the songwriting sometimes left a bit to be desired. Taking ourselves a bit too seriously perhaps? That was, however, the style and appeal of 70's art rock and \\"FM\\" is certainly under rated in this category. Notably, \\"FM\\" member Ben Mink went on to write and work with country singer K.D.

It was sad, funny, and included a love story in the middle of all this. It opened your eyes to death and when he was saying goodbye to his daughters (Hopkins) really made me cry.

My favorite part was when Bill and Joe are about to cross the bridge and Bill asks,\\"Should I be afraid?\\" and Joe replies,\\"Not a man like you.\\" Oh this movie was so sad! It was great!!!!!!!!! My very fave movie-it even beat Titanic on my list!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliantly acted and beautifully told","review":"Having never seen a Brad Pitt movie, Meet Joe Black took me by surprise. The chemistry between Brad Pitt and Claire Forlani was more powerful than any I've ever seen. It was amazing that Brad Pitt could play DEATH with such an air of innocence. The peanut butter scene had me in stitches. The love evident between Death and Susan jumped off the screen making the final scene at the birthday party when Susan realized who Joe was all the more heartbreaking. Overall MJB was incredible."},{"rating":"2","title":"Death takes a Holiday remake very fresh","review":"Communications tycoon, Bill Parrish (Anthony Hopkins) has everything. He's got a business he's built from scratch with his own hands and ideas, two daughters he loves, and many friends.He's also got angina and a voice talking inside his head. When that voice finally manifests, it's Death alias Joe Black (Brad Pitt). Mr. Black is ready to make a deal. Parrish gets a little extra time if he'll be Death's guide to life.Parrish accepts the offer. Death discovers he has far more to learn than he thought.This is a wonderful thought provoking drama that leaves you with a good feeling and tears in your eyes. Brad Pitt, who I didn't think could act until this movie, even holds his own against Sir Anthony Hopkins, which is no mean feat. \\"Meet Joe Black\\" is a film you'd want to buy and occasionally view again. Every time I do, I get some new insights."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brad Pitt's Best film","review":"Many critics, and if I remember correctly, even Mr. Pitt himself, were highly negatively critical of this film. This, in my opinion is Mr. Pitt's best work, including the current Button movie which is excellent. Anthony Hopkins and Brad Pitt work so well together. Mr. Hopkins is, as always, top-notch. All the roles were perfectly cast and acted. Each time I watch this well-made film, it is like eating my favorite desert: over and over and wanting more. Brad Pitt and the peanut butter is so sweet.

The most contrived, stiff, pretentious film I ever saw. Yes, I sat through the 3 hours. Terribly cliched dialogue, and the daughter cries crocodile tears through the whole film. Brad Pitt's character is Mr. Death, and the film asks you to relate to and empathize with Mr. Death and asks you for tears during the Spielbergian violin well ups. Every tape of this film should be burned."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bored to meet him","review":"MJB is so inferior even to the re-made-for-TV version of \\"Death Takes a Holiday\\", starring Monte Markham, that I can't pan it enough. The Markham vehicle had some wonderful moments when Death's imminent victim starts to realize the consequences of Death being \\"on vacation\\" - terminal cancer victims, torn by agony- unable to die.... the best MJB could do was to show \\"Joe Black's\\" fascination with human sensory input - the peanut butter joke becomes excruciating. I'm delighted to hear the movie died at the box office."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible","review":"It's very sad to read reviews written by teenagers. Do you really think this is a great movie?! Brad Pitt is one of the worst actors in the world. Even when he's acting with a great actor like Hopkins his performance is always ridicolous. But, of course, teenagers that think Pitt gorgeous don't think that way. That's why they spend their money buying movies like this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"This was the worst movie Anthony Hopkins has ever been in!!","review":"Slow, boring, and pathetic sums it up. Brad Pitt can't act for his life and the whole movie wasn't acted well. Anthony Hopkins is my favorite actor and perhaps that was the only reason I went to see this pathetic excuse for a movie. If it were possible to give no stars that is what this movie would get. No, wait, it would be a negative four."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overly long, bland","review":"With two wonderful actors, I didn't think the movie could go wrong. Well, it did. First off, the movie was unnecessarily long. It truly didn't need to be as long as it is, it clearly drags in parts. I think if the length was shortened and some mundane pointless scenes thrown out, it would have been a pretty decent film actually. Now, the movie isn't horrible, its more of a snooze fest. Both Brad and Anthony give wonderful performances, as usual, but I just didn't feel anything. The movie is not really emotional, or dramatic, though I think it may be technically labeled a drama. It was hard to pay attention sometimes since parts of it were quite boring and felt unimportant to the story. This is one of those films that you wish was better than it really is. It has it's moments, but ultimately, its pretty bland."},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic Brad Pitt and Anthony Hopkins","review":"Like Legends of the Fall, this film unites Brad Pitt and Anthony Hopkins, Great Chemistry! The quality of HD-DVD is almost always impeccable, unlike regular DVD's that vary considerably. I suppose it's because the manufacturers understand the expectations. Great music, great cinematography and a fun story. Even Brad Pitt's slight over-acting seems to work in this film. Well cast!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Almost perfect","review":"What a cast! Anthony Hopkins his usual professional self and Brad Pitt doing as well. It would have earned a 5 star rating but for the times that the musical background overwhelmed conversations, especially intimate ones.

I'm a dance teacher among other things and some music makes me want to dance and some not. You can read all the negative reviews of this movie and come away with the idea that is not worth watching. I beg to differ. Watch this with friends and observe their reactions. I watch this movie every few years, and it touches my heart as no other movie has. When life is over I hope I walk out of it the way William Parrish (Anthony Hopkins) does, and I pray I am escorted there by someone like Joe Black (Brad Pitt)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Meet Joe Bust","review":"This movie was a true disappiontment in the blackest sense. Even the clever ending could not salvage this bust. The actual plot lacked substance but the subplot of the main character's life was interesting for about 10 minutes of the first three hours. Way too long to waste my limited time on. Just rent There's Something About Mary for the 40th time and your night will be much more enjoyable!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Good to watch instead of taking a sleeping pill!","review":"The first time I saw this was at the movie theatre with a couple of friends. Well needless to say we all fell asleep. So I figured I would it give it another shot. Since it was a midnight movie. And once again it put me right out. This movie just drags on ENDLESSLY! Just when you think it's about over, you end up having another hour or so left. I still find it hard to believe that a great actor like Anthony Hopkins was in this movie. Oh well, to me this was a waste of time and money"},{"rating":"1","title":"Felt like 8 hours","review":"If you like scenes where the characters stare at each other for 10 minutes while moving there lips slightly and tilting there heads a little then this one is for you. I'm not exaggerating, 10 minutes, maybe longer. The only real entertainment comes in trying to figure out what the director could have been thinking. There is also a section on the dvd where the actors talk about what a genius the director is and how all the actors they worked with were geniuses(Very funny to watch after seeing the movie)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh for goodness' sake. . . .","review":"Gaseous, gaseous, gaseous. Nothing but bloat, nothing but air. No substance, no sense of realism within the story's own context (why isn't Brad, when brought back to life, a mangled quadriplegic?), subplots with exactly NO suspense (when is Hollywood going to learn that leveraged buyouts do not a compelling story make?). Everyone speaks in hushed tones -- barely audible monotony. I kept having to turn up the stereo just to hear the palaver. I noticed that the Amazon reviewer, in his review, kept saying things like \\"If you stick with it\\" and \\"You will be rewarded for your patience.\\" A great film, my friends, pays off in every frame. This film was (rightly) panned when it arrived last year; there's no need to get all revisionist about it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Appalling Hollywood Bunk","review":"This cloying, self-important, vacuous exercise in sheer futility is - without exaggeration - perhaps one of the very worst pieces of trash ever churned out by the seemingly-bottomless rubbish bin known as Hollywood. Brad Pitt's pretty-boy smugness is twice as empty as the plotless script - the guy has obviously gotten by a good deal of his life without much effort, and it shows in his performance, (a performance, which, might I add, received more than a few laughs in the theater during some of the most supposedly \\"serious\\" moments of the film). You almost feel sorry for the great Anthony Hopkins, who doesn't seem to know what to do with the lines he's being fed. I would rather watch Animal House II for 48 hours straight than waste another two hours of my life sitting through this one. I already regret having wasted 10 minutes writing this review."},{"rating":"1","title":"One Of The Worst Movies I've Seen","review":"In this highly implausible movie, death, who has been around since the world began, for no logical reason decides to personify himself for the sake of an unremarkable business executive. Brad Pitt, with hair that looks like it was cut off and pasted back on, decides to use the body of a young man who had just met the business man's daughter. So he arranges a car accident. Using the body of the deceased young man, he introduces himself to the main players. But rather than coming off as Death (which had some real possibilities had this been a dark comedy), he appears more like an alien from outer space and is clueless about the social mores of modern man.This movie had some potential, but it is horrible. The actors do what they can, but the script is terrible! It's really just a bad movie on all levels."},{"rating":"1","title":"Meet Joe Who ?","review":"I have to admit I throughly enjoyed the first half hour of the film. The interaction between Pitt and Hopkins in the study was masterful. At this point I thought I stumbled apon a gem in the sea of melodramatic garbage. It turns out I was in for another disapointment. Does Martin Brest have to make susan cry constantly."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst 3 hours I've spent in a long time","review":"My wife is a Brad Pitt fan, and even she hated this movie. I am truly shocked at the 35 favorable reviews here (only 2 negative). I must let readers know that critics were right the first time. This movie must be an embarassment for Hopkins if not for the other actors. The plot was full of holes, Pitt's character was very unlikeable and the movie crawled at a painful pace. Hopkins was great as usual, the scenery and photography were luscious, but this was not nearly enough to make up for the shortcomings of htis movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Acting technique battles spoil movie","review":"Too long gazing into space.- For them and me.- Emotion in this movie is displayed by the two so called lovers looking left then right then briefly at each other's face to portray anything from constipation to puzzelment. Where was the chemistry? If death is all knowing why does he act like a teenage kid on his second date. Credibility was indeed missing. Brad Pitt was very inconsistent with his character analysis. I was not confident with his performace at all.Each one of his scenes he appeared not sure of what he was suposed to do - so looked left and right before proceeding, a bit like a school kid before crossing the road! I could not come to terms with his kiss of death! Should not the victim have died ! Two plastic people in a very plastic movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring, contrived, tedious","review":"Long, drawn out dialogs. Tedious and inconsitant melodrama. Ranks right up there with \\"Legends of the fall\\" for stark, empty performances. This is not a romance. It's just drama for the sake of drama. Devoid of substance, lack of palatable characters, dragging on and on. With no one to empathize with you are left without any payoff after having sat through 3 hours of drivel. A contrived speech by Hopkins in the last 5 minutes leaves you shaking your head and wondering why they even bothered. It was spurned at the box-office for good reason. No merit. Save your money."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the movies I liked most ... it's so touching !!!","review":"I loved this romantic film and its soundtrack. I saw it at the theatre on January and I'd liked to see it again. I laughed, smiled, almost cry... It is by far, more touching than Titanic and has so many valuable messages to remember ... the importance of enjoying our lives, that love for your family or for your partner must be unselfish in spite of the odds and risks, and maybe a subtle encouragement that let us believe that soulmates do exist ? Was this movie that long ? Well, I did not realize !!! I read the newspapers comments and they didn't do justice at all, don't know why... I think Anthony Hopkins, Brad Pitt, Claire Forlani, Marcia Gay Harden (Allison, the elder sister), Jeffrey Tambor (Quince, Allison's husband)and the Jamaican woman did a brilliant job, the soundtrack is really beautiful and Brad, besides his excellent acting performance, looks so cute! Give this movie a chance, please, it's worth watching..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brad Pitt does it again:)","review":"Well, Brad Pitt shows remarkable depth for being the guy who went on Oprah and said his favorite candy is Twizzlers!

Good choice, Brad..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Meet Joe Black is the best movie of all time!!","review":"The very first time I ever saw a preview on the television of Meet Joe Black, I knew it was my favorite movie. I saw the movie the day it came out at theaters. Brad Pitt, Claire Forlani, Anthony Hopkins, and the rest of the cast were just amazing. I loved the scene when Joe (Brad) and Susan (Claire) first kissed. It was so romantic. And I loved the ending! I think all of the critics and the people who didn't like this movie are stupid. I would definetly recommend this movie to anyone. It is full of so much emotion. Martin Brest did an amazing job. I wish something like that would hapen to me! And it is not too long!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The critics were on holiday.","review":"I didn't see this movie in the theatre because of the critical reviews. I did rent it after listening to the soundtrack. The length of the movie was so necessary to letting the characters explore their feelings instead of quickly cutting to the next scene. I appreciated the directors foresight in this area. I was gratefully surprised by how much I enjoyed this thought-provoking film. One itty-bitty change at the end would have made this a 5 for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Meet Joe Black Review","review":"Love Anthony Hopkins in this role, Brad Pitt also plays great role. Great movie, little long but you want notice.

What I would have missed! It was sensual, frightening, and finally romantic and moving. I cried so hard I had puffy eyes for a whole day. The film is gorgeous to look at in every way, has a lot to say about life, character, and time; but most of all, it's just a lovely well-acted film that satisfies in every way. The Jamaican actress and Pitt's conversations with her are spellbinding."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is the BEST movie I have ever seen","review":"When my wife and I finished watching this movie (from video tape), we turned and looked at each other and simutaneously said \\"That was REALLY a good movie!\\" TOO BAD your price is so HIGH! I'll wait until it is available at a REASONABLE PRICE."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's a hidden beauty...","review":"I suppose the movie was either not promoted well or came out at an auspicious time - it was just swept under the carpet. But after stumbling into this movie accidentally, I have been telling everyone about it. It is a beautiful movie marked with sensitive acting & realistic (albeit having the grim reaper follow you) interpersonal scenes. The story line is quite intriguing. Definitely, Brad Pitt is phenomenal in this movie; his portrayal is both believeable (again, if you could be so lucky to have him as the grim reaper!) and very moving. Although this is not primarily a \\"chick flik\\", there is one particular love scene that is SO REAL, it should frighten Jennifer Anniston!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A good movie, freaky but unrealistic!","review":"Meet Joe Black should be rated R. Dont show this to a 10 year old. It was very good, extremely powerful, but in a way too scary. I loved the dvd effect."},{"rating":"1","title":"Way to long...","review":"Why did death have to make brad pitt get creamed by a car ..wouldn't his body be all mangled..oh ..it's Hollywood and they needed a big SHOCK scene.. why not just have him have a heart attack..so much of it is like this ..if Death is watching us why?? why is he like the Terminator when he shows up and can someone PLEASE tell Hollywood to stop making all their movies about Billionaires ..you want real love ..passion..family, talk to a post man or a cop ..Hollywood..BLAH....."},{"rating":"1","title":"Excitement takes a holiday","review":"I recall a review from when the movie was released, stating that the director never passed up an opportunity to milk an emotion out of the actors. Having finally seen the movie, I understand what he was saying. Every shot it seems goes on for a third too long; every close-up is tight as the actors and actresses (fine cast by the way) run through their emotive ranges. However, milking emotions will only get you so far. At three hours it just got too tiring and boring. If it had been tightened up to 120 minutes, everyone, from the movie's investors to its producers to the audience, would've appreciated it more."},{"rating":"2","title":"DON'T OVERTHINK THIS ONE","review":"Based loosely on the premise that the Devil will negotiate with mere humans, this story strains the limits of credulity at times (whether it is because Brad Pitt is an ineffectual actor or the role was absurd is not clear). If you are willing to let go of the fact that Satan has never tasted peanut butter and seems unnaturally interested in it, you may be able to enjoy what is a sometimes sweet and sometimes poignant film about regret, greed, love and hope. What more could one want from a chic flic? P.S. My husband wanted it for Christmas. Hmmm."},{"rating":"2","title":"MEET JOE BLACK","review":"I LOVED THE STORY,BRAD PITT AND ANTHONY HOPKINS...HOW COULD YOU LOSE...IT WAS A STORY THAT PROVES WHEN YOU LIVE WITH A GOOD HEART, YOU NEVER HAVE TO BE AFRAID, WHEN THE END COMES..."},{"rating":"2","title":"EXCELLANT!","review":"I can't get enough of this movie.

That was hilarious!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"We rented this movie (DVD) yesterday and I was very dissapointed. I expected a great movie, in stead we got a perfect sleeping remedy! (I actually slept very well for the first time in weeks) Brad Pitt is playing mister beautifull (who he isn't) and the scenes are tooooooo long. The movie has no plot, you could have seen this one coming after watching 30 minutes or so. So unless you have trouble sleeping, don't spent your money on this movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Utter nonsense","review":"Nonsense plot, only manipulative effects used here. Thomas Newmans musik normally elevates the film experience, here is is implemented in a manipulative manner, and seemingly endlessly (although somewhere I think I heard Arvo Pärt's Fratres, often wonder why I never encountered that piece in a movie before). Claire Forlani's is constantly filmed with reflections in her eyes, how romaantic. Death falls in love! Blaaaahhh"},{"rating":"1","title":"Final cut is not a toy","review":"This risible movie falls just short of being a legendary disaster. Barring it from greatness are its ultra-glossy production values, the always wonderful Anthony Hopkins, and the undeniable charisma of Brad Pitt who (though it kills me to say it) survives even such dignity-threatening scenes as the hospital visit to the Jamaican woman in respectable shape.That said, this is still the most excruciatingly protracted screen death since \\"Cries and Whispers\\". I trust that the enormous financial failure of this movie will guarantee that Martin Brest is never allowed final cut again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Long and often boring","review":"This film was mostly lost on me. I enjoyed the Pitt character though. His performance is vague, and weird, aptly playing death and all. Probably the best Ive seen from him I would say. The score was excruciatingly dramatic to the point of almost making me ill. and long ? you betcha, we got bland and lots of it !I agree with one of the other reviewers here too, all the romance just distracts from the \\"Ive come for your soul\\" premise.Clair Forlani as a doctor seemed quite absurd too."},{"rating":"1","title":"I Laughed So Hard...","review":"The only reason I was in the theatre was to see the opening day premiere of the Episode I trailer (little did we know Lucas was about to destroy his own franchise). We ended up staying for the movie.Which was a mistake, because when Brad gets hit by 3 (THREE!!! Talk about overkill!) vehicles near the beginning of the film, I could not stop laughing at the overwhelming stupidity of it. I guess the director thought so little of his audience that he had to really make sure you understood that he be dead. Anyway, I couldn't stop laughing, so I left the theatre.Any movie that thinks so little of its potential viewers that it has to drive that particular point home in that particular way deserves to never be seen, and I'm happy to oblige. Which is too bad, because I like the cast...even Hopkins, who has coasted through many a film on the stink of his banal Oscar-winning role. Brian Cox was the superior Lecter."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Black, Dark","review":"I didn't like this film; thought it was weird. Made me uncomfortable. I felt all the characters in the film felt uneasy too. But then I don't like Science Fiction movies. (except for Harry Potter) But, if you like Science Fiction movies that aren't in outer space, and super weird, you'll probably like it."},{"rating":"1","title":"It gets worse every hour...","review":"Hopkins and Pitt are great...in fact, their chemistry merits a better movie altogether. The original was/is beautiful...this updated version is convoluted, misdirected, overlong and lost in some Yuppie-Vigalante premise. Yuk!Everything is overdone...the editing, the production design, the (groan!) dialogue, direction and even the hairstyles. Poor Continuity couldn't keep up with Brad's ever changing bleached bangs.Love the casting and the costumes...every suit is fabulous. Everything else...blecch. The most memorable moment (which should tell you A LOT) is Hopkins being led off to the hereafter with the witticism, \\"Don't blow smoke up my as*...it will ruin my autopsy.\\" Egad! MEET JOE BLACK...the series!???"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Father/Daughter movie!!","review":"This movie was so very touching about the importance of listening to your heart when chosing your life's mate ... Anthony Hopkins was tremendous, Brad Pitt did a great job too. Wonderful love story.. yes it was long, but I saw it twice at the theatre .. once each with both daughters!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Film","review":"This film is so different than the others by Brad Pitt. The character is very familiar in the beginning. As the story unfolds you see a vastly different character and I believe it is some very good work on his part. The cast is filled with accomplished Actors worthy of 2 hours of your time. They are emotional and believable. I'm sure you will enjoy this film."},{"rating":"2","title":"ANOTHER GREAT MOVIE ABOUT LIFE (AND DEATH)","review":"Before I begin, let me tell you to not be deceived by the \\"Special Edition\\" title. The so-called \\"Special Edition\\" is nothing more than a 15 minute Entertainment Tonight clip that is common to many movies looking to cash in on a \\"New and Improved Special Edition.\\" The interviews are poor and the making of the movie is not covered in much detail.But as for the film - the film is great. Anthony Hopkins, one of the best actors today, gives another great performance as a billionaire with a heart. Imagine that? :) A tale that only Hollywood could write in that Hopkin's character has the \\"fairy tale life\\" with a billion dollar business, a giant mansion and is given the chance to face his death before it occurs.A tear jerker for those that are touched by good romances and heart-throb stories. If you haven't seen this movie, you will not be disappointed. A \\"feel good\\" movie with excellent acting and directing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing Movie on Many Levels","review":"Here is a young Brad Pitt, but that is not what makes the story.

It is now one of my most favorite movies of all time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Much Brad not Enough Bread","review":"The 2 stars I gave this movie was mainly for supporting roles and the idea of the movie, I thought they could've made such a great picture. They had the right actors and right idea but it did not come together as expected."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love can be found even in Death.","review":"This could very well be the best of my top 5 favorites. Along with excelent performances by Anthony Hokins and Brad Pitt, and original idea that takes us away from the traditional love story can be found in this movie. Some lines in this film will leave you questioning everything you ever considered to be love, and make you will to risk everything for it. Gripping, and at times magical, Meet Joe Black is a movie for anyone who knows what true love is."},{"rating":"2","title":"LOVED IT!","review":"I loved this movie. I have watched it four times and will be watching it again and again. Although it is long and a little \\"draggy\\" in places, I thought the movie was excellent!

It was a wonderful, weepy fairy tale with the happy ending."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of My Top Ten Movies of All Time","review":"There is little about this movie not to like, unless you just love non-stop action. Even so, there is at least one scene that may satisfy that craving.This is sure to be a classic if not already. Anthony Hopkins is superb and Brad Pitt is excellent. Its one of those movies you want to see over and over curled up in a blanket with your partner.I highly reccommend Meet Joe Black"},{"rating":"2","title":"Outstanding Performence!","review":"This movie swept me off my feet about how even the most unexpected things can happen while you are waiting for something else."},{"rating":"2","title":"High Praise for March - not Pitt","review":"The primary reason to buy this DVD set is NOT for \\"Meet Joe Black\\" (a forgetable, dry movie), but for the amazing \\"Death Takes a Holiday\\" from 1934. For some idiotic reason this is the only way you can buy it - pinned to Brad Pitt's coattail. Frederic March was one of the greatest actors in the history of film, and his performance here is moving and fascinating. Anderson's screenplay gives him a lot of difficult material to interpret. Overall, a brilliant, thought-provoking film. It should stand alone and not have to share space with \\"Joe Black.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Yes!Yes!Yes!","review":"This movie was excellent.

Tender moments mixed with coarse elements of human nature provide a definite quality to the film."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing movie!","review":"The movie was a little long but I enjoyed every part of it. Great chemistry between Joe Black and Susan.I enjoyed the ending alot too. Totally worth watching."},{"rating":"2","title":"Touching and inspiring","review":"This movie, although long, was very good. The end brought tears to my eyes, and I couldn't get my thoughts off the subject of death for the rest of the day, because this movie brought up new aspects of the topic to think about. Brad Pitt is as good as anyone could be on playing the character of Death, which is a slightly controversial role. It's all a matter of opinion, how you play it, and Pitt's interpretation seems to be telling people that there's nothing to be afraid of while at the same time exercising his power over the mortal race. Excellent film."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Movie","review":"After viewing this film I must say that I enjoyed everything about it. The storyline was great and the acting was admirable. The chemistry between Pitt's and Forlani's characters was incredible. This is demonstrated not so much in words spoken as it is in the eye contact generated between the two. This was one one of those movies that I just did not want to end. Equally as entertaining as Brest's last movie Scent Of A Woman."},{"rating":"2","title":"BEST MOVIE EVER MADE!!!!!!!!!!","review":"This movie was so great. I'm tired of critics complaining about the 3 hour length. I still didn't want it to end. There is so much emotion and drama that you forget about the length and find yourself being drawn in with the charachters. Brad Pitt should have gotten an Oscar for his performace and Claire Forlani was so good in her role. I LOVE THIS MOVIE and everyone should see it. I saw it 6 times in the movie theater and you should too!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Powerful Love Movie","review":"I think those few people that don't like this movie probably can't relate to it. Just ask yourself if you've ever fallen in love or lost a love one. If you have experienced this, you can definitely relate to this movie. When Joe says to Susan \\"I love you now and I'll love you always\\", it will leave you breathless. This movie sends out a powerful message about love. To make the journey and not fall deeply in love, well you havn't lived a life at all. Give Love a chance! Give this movie a chance! Watch it with all your heart and you will realize how great love is."},{"rating":"2","title":"the love scene","review":"There isn't much left to say after reading the other reviews. I would agree with all of the positives. It is one of the most beautiful films I have ever seen. The nuances of acting by all of the main characters is sensational, and reduces the need for thick dialogue. The ending left something to be desired, but the writers did the best they could considering the direction the plot had taken. The best part of the film, however, was the love scene between Forlani and Pitt. It was breathtaking and moving, the angles and lighting were immaculate, and the music is romantic yet poignant, and I the whole construction nearly brought me to tears. It was phenomenal, maybe the best I've ever seen."},{"rating":"2","title":"You gotta see this one - the acting and music is amazing!","review":"Hopkins is perfect as a wealthy powerful businessman, and loving father. Claire Forlani is beautiful, sensuous, intelligent and fun. Brad Pitt is mysterious, terrifying, passionate, quirky, and funny.

Buy this for Freddie March!","review":"Sadly, this is the only DVD you can purchase of the most excellent \\"Death Takes a Holiday\\" starring the delectable Fredric March as Death.

Pardon while I puke...."},{"rating":"1","title":"What Were They Thinking?!","review":"I was very disappointed with this movie and was grateful that I purchased it from a bargain bin for only $3.00. Based on the 1934 movie, Death Takes a Holiday, with Frederic March , this movie is pretentious, overly long, boring and even silly in places. Aside from a really bad blond dye job, Brad Pitt seems to sleep walk his way through the proceedings, (one wonders what the quirky Johnny Depp or earnest Keanu Reeves would have done with this role), and Claire Forlani as his love interest is bland and uninteresting with little or no discernible chemistry between the two. The always reliable and highly talented Anthony Hopkins manages to give his always stellar performance with minimal embarrassment. Aside from the 1934 version you can also find a 1971 version with the talented, although unfairly forgotten, Monte Markham which is still superior to this remake."},{"rating":"1","title":"Is it over yet?","review":"Is it physically possible to stretch a barely 90 minute idea into a full blown 180 minute film? Well, despite all theories, this movie seems to prove it possible. How? Endless, endless, ENDLESS scenes that serve no purpose. Dialogue so painful. Symbolic shots that you just don't give a damn about. A stupid sub plot about corporate take over that does not serve a point!! Although I have sat through 3 hour films before and lived through them to watch it again just because they didn't feel that long, Meet Joe Black in the isolated movie watching world where there is no time piece, feels like 7 hours. Anthony Hopkins, a great actor, is not at all the saving part and Pitt, well, try something else to impress us. And as for director Martin Brest, what were you thinking? If you're going to make a 3 hour movie, put an idea or two in it. And as for the ying yangs who gave Brest the approval for final cut, I want those three hours back!!--wc"},{"rating":"1","title":"...","review":"This isn't as slow as the press reviews made it. But it is slow. I loved the beautiful cinematography and the beautiful Claire Forlanni. Brad Pitt seems like a nice person, so I don't dislike him, but I'm an actor, and I'm a better actor than he is, and I'm better looking than he is! (As monumentally conceited as that sounds!) And I'm out of work, and he's making $20 million for giving sub-par performances like this one. Brad Pitt is evidence that the cream does not rise to the top. Anthony Hopkins, however, gives a wonderful, underplayed, natural performance."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Worst Movie Ever Made","review":"As an extra who worked in this movie, I think I can give a review of this film from a different point ofview. The basic problem was the script, which neededso many rewrites, the final product was a mishmash.The director demanded so many retakes (40 for BradPitt to kiss Forlani) any chemistry between the actors was lacking. All the extras were invited forthe premier, which was so tedious, I almost walked out. The director went so over budget on this farce that I'm surprised he ever worked again. Brad Pitt fans may swoon over his performance, but if therewas any saving grace to the film it was Tony Hopkins. He is a true gentleman, yes... I had several chats with him, a fine accomplished actor,who was smart enough to insist on only five retakesin his contract. Don't waste your money on this film."},{"rating":"1","title":"long-winded&boring","review":"aside from Sir Anothny Hopkins who is the only true actor in this film this is a pure Vanity mess.Brad Pitt is way overrated.he doesn't add anything to this Long-winded&boring film.this is what's wrong with films today.only special films deserve 3 hours or more not movies that can be done in two hours or less."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh dear oh dear","review":"Quite THE most tedious (what seemed like) 6 hours of my life.

I think it is best not throw one's total belief in any one writing, but his book does have interesting thoughts. Some parts are quite unbelievable and should be taken with a \\"grain of salt\\". All of these books can be obtained from the author at a web site under \\"Right Use of Will,\\" or can be found used at Amazon or ebay. If this is really from Source, it might help to understand who \\"God\\" really is although many will not want to give up the rosy image of God that they already have.

By the time Christmas arrived and he opened the Cd, a couple of months had already passed. To my great disappointment we found that the Cd does not work. We tried to clean it but still no result. Unfortunately the time limit when we could return the item had passed. Therefore we have not had the privilege to hear this Cd."},{"rating":"2","title":"Funny Movie","review":"Although this is a secular movie, it applies a lot of Biblical principles. It was a funny movie and also touched the heart. There were times I would be crying from laughter and other times, crying for joy. This is a must see movie. I cannot wait to see the other movies with the same characters by the same producer. This was a great movie for me to see. I can relate to the attorney's wife from my past marriage. God will provide."},{"rating":"2","title":"GOOD","review":"Funny and InspiringDon't listen to the Movie Critics; us REAL people loved this movie. It was very down to earth and funny. But it also shows how God can and will work things out if we will simply trust Him to do so. There is also some good Gospel Music in this flick"},{"rating":"2","title":"Outstanding Movie","review":"If I could rate this movie any higher than a 5 I would. Tyler Perry is a great Play Writer and also showing to be a even greater Movie Producer. This Movie hit right at home. The line is not outrageous because this does happen. Now Madea is another story. She is out of this world. If you understand how Madea was created you will get a better understanding where Tyler is comming from. He started this Movie from a play Diary of A Mad Black Women. He also has other plays available on DVD Madea's Family Reunion, I Can Do Bad All By Myself, Meet The Browns & Madea Family Reunion . This is a must see movie. You will not be disappointed. Madea will have you rolling on the floor. Now on the Big screen is Madea's Family reunion. Just like Diary. Don't mess with Madea's family. Tyler dis an outstanding job. everyone do not understand what we go through. But we do go through Tyler just put the issued out there through comedy. Don't hate if you don't understand. Tyler keep up the great work."},{"rating":"2","title":"diary of a mad black woman","review":"Touching and gastly funny ! truly entertaining with a point of view.

However this movie is not for everyone if you don't like dramadies then this is not for you. A lot fo people told me you have to black to understand this movie and you really don't. The themes of this movie are universal. My favorite is when Madea goes crazy with a chain saw I laughed so hard that my face hurt afterwards. This was a very good movie and Madea is one of the funniest characters to ever hit the big screen but this movie is definatley not for everyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"incredible","review":"This is by far my most favorite Tyler Perry movie, much better than Witness Protection Program.

I love Tyler he's the best at what he does."},{"rating":"1","title":"21st century minstrelsy","review":"If a white person had made this movie, there would have been protests in the streets.

The success of this cinematic solid waste is a guarantee that there will be sequels. God help us all."},{"rating":"1","title":"False advertising! This is not a comedy!","review":"After seeing the YouTube scene release that featured Tyler Perry I laughed so hard I had to buy the DVD. The DVD cover would also suggest that the movie is about Tyler Perry's mother character, and he (SHE) is the mad black woman. Unfortunately this movie is only 10% of Tyler Perry's gut busting comedy. The other 90% is a stupid \\"relationship drama\\" that wasn't worthy of a movie storyline. The \\"mad black woman\\" is actually the young girl."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a Comedy","review":"This movie is being described and sold as a comedy. It is not one.

If you are looking for a comedy I do not recommend this at all."},{"rating":"2","title":"Surprised","review":"For years people always acted stunned when when I told them I've never seen a Madea play or movie. Feeling like I was on the verge of getting my B card revolt, I finally gave in and watched this movie. And I'm stunned. yes, yes. I admit it. I was expecting some over glorified ghetto movie with TP vamping it up like Lawrence's Big Momma. What I got instead was a strong movie about the power of forgiveness and second chances. I don't always like Kimberly Elise, she has the tendency to over act, but her performance was picture perfect for this film Shemar Jackson is still trying to prove that he's more than just a pretty boy did come off a little too perfect but that was the material more than him and he still managed to do a pretty descent job. Overall, this is great entertainment."},{"rating":"2","title":"Watch it, watch it, watch it","review":"When I saw the title i thought it was one of those black movies with over-exaggerated acting. But damn it was an all in one package. There was Romance,loughter, crazyness and to top it all it mad a strong man like myself at one stage to shed tears. It was a lesson learned that \\"Be nice to people on your way up because you'll meet them on your way down\\". The movie taught me to understand the value of a true black woman who will always be there when odds are against you."},{"rating":"2","title":"A real picker upper","review":"Hey, when i first saw this movie, i was down.

This movie is one of my favourite, i watch it all the time (Shemar Moore's gorgeousness is one reason but there are many other's).

I thought I would give his other movies a shot since Kimberly Elise was in the movie her performance in For Colored Girls was so moving.I decided to rent this movie in hopes of an interesting story and extraordinary acting performances. After watching I saw the characters are boring and cliched. it felt like this movie is unorginalI was not pleased with the movie overall. I did not like the main character she was to weak for me. I did not belive her to be a mad black woman I understand her problems but I did not get anger from her character.I kept thinking about Eddie Murphy in the Nutty Professor films as Perry does play multiple roles in the film all I could think was Eddie Murphy did a better performance then Perry with that in mind i stopped watching the movie midway. since I watched half the movie i am giving it two stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pass The Plate","review":"Usually when I see something this preachy someone passes me a plate for a donation. What a shame this excellent cast was wasted on such a rediculous movie. Not only was the story in your face with an I'm-better-than-you-because-I'm-a-Christian attitude, but it was also predictable.

It was so funny."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad Community Theater","review":"After enjoying the Oprah episode devoted to this movie and Mr. Tyler Perry, I couldn't wait to see this DVD. Unfortunately, I like Mr. Perry much more than I liked this mess of a movie. I love to laugh! Didn't laugh much in the first 40 minutes or so, which is the amount of time we waited until we just turned the thing off. You don't \\"buy\\" the premise from the git-go -- this beautiful rich woman being physically dragged out of her house by her rich mean husband, instead of merely being divorced by him, is a ridiculous scene that set me up to disbelieve and be confused by the entire rest of this mess. I love Mr. Perry's creativity and personal rags-to-riches story, but this unfunny and over-the-top movie made me uncomfortable, like I was in the front row seat at a bad community theater production."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stop Being Dumb, Black America!","review":"As a black man it really ticks me off when people give this movie a good rating cause it's for blacks. Just because it's about blacks doesn't mean all the black people gotta be like, \\"It's good and if you don't think so you must not be ghetto or you're a racist.\\" Then of course we have to see Tyler Perry on Oprah because Oprah is a stupid, hypocritical woman who wants to be seen as a strong black female then accuses people who don't let her have her way as being racists. It's a bad movie. The jokes are not smart or funny and put a bad name on black comedy. If you want to see something funny, smart, and still black go pick up a Chris Rock HBO special on DVD. These kind of movies are predictably dumb and make us blacks look like idiots."},{"rating":"2","title":"I love Tyler Perry","review":"TYler Perry is so funny...This moving had me laughing from the beginning to the end...I have all of his plays on DVD.....Tyler is the best........."},{"rating":"2","title":"Diary of a Mad Black Woman","review":"Diary of a mad black woman by Tyler Perry is one of my favorite all time movie's.

Always keeps me laughing. This movie lets you see Madea's attitude AND the other actress' revenge on an abusive husband. I loved it. All men need to watch this one and see what can happen if you abuse your woman. And Yes, I am a guy. I can't stand abusive people. So I really enjoyed watching her pay him back. I definitely recommend this movie. It's a comedy, but at the same time it teaches a good lesson."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"I open my Bible to that New Testimony and see all that red and I just give up.

This movie ended up being more of a drama than a comedy. Also why would Orlando take Helen back after she ran out on him? He just proposed to her, she sees on TV that her husband got shot, and she runs to the hospital to him.

We were talking about music and bands. He asked if i had ever heard of Proceed and to check them out cause he produced two of they're albums. I took his advice and was glad I did. Proceed is exactly the type of Music/Band that I love. Very minimal EBM with the hard edge synths. Pounding bass lines & rhythmic drums. The vocals are hard and low with English & German lyrics. This is their second CD. They sound very similar to Orange Sector meets Spetsnaz. Pontus shares co-lead vocals on a track & has a hidden track of just him and it sounds like Spetsnaz of course. If you like great minimal EBM & bands like Nitzer ebb, Ionic Vision, Fixmer/McCarthy, Militant Cheerleaders, & especially Spetsnaz and Orange Sector, you'll Love This Disc!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Openers, Great Album","review":"I saw EBG as the openers for the Allman Brothers Band. They had just released Struttin' My Stuff. Mickey Thomas (who was also with the Jefferson Starship) Kind of wrecked the sound, and in my opinion Juke Joint Jump was probably the best of the Capricorn Records releases. Great stuff. This was the release prior to Struttin', and is my favorite of the bunch. Not a bad song in the bunch."},{"rating":"2","title":"I still have CHILLS running down my back...","review":"Mullen is magnificent! He took me where no other writer has even previously done.

Time and time again Mullen sent CHILLS down my back!!Have you ever found your self throwing fake punches while watching Boxing on ESPN or while watching the Rocky movies ?Throughout the 300 some odd pages I was throwing jabs and crosses into my pillow because of the extreme adreline rush of Kurt's and Tom's swims, and throwing upper-cuts towards the accusations of Dara's enhanced swims.Gold in the Water is GOLDEN and it often left me looking at the ceiling and questioning whether I had ever really pushed myself to greatness...or if I ever could.

He's not a voracious reader, but he zipped through Gold in the Water in a few days. Then he started passing it around his swim team. Last month, I read it. Mullen brings together a combination of understanding of the sport, empathy for athletes and coaches and a journalist's attention to truth and detail in putting together this book. The story of these athletes preparing for a year and a half for the two minute-event that will decide whether on not they make the Olympic team has all the emotion, conflict and suspense of a great novel. This is the best sports book I have read since Boys of Summer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good but why does Doug die?","review":"I liked this movie -- the action was solid and the plot good enough but I was disappointed that they killed off Doug Masters. Sure he's a showoff punk (as we saw in the first movie) but we all grew to like him and root for him as the first movie progressed, and I think it was a real mistake to kill off the series' main protagonist like no big deal. It seems to me that if the producers could do anything to send the Iron Eagle films down the toilet it was to kill the hero, but other than that I liked this movie. It was as good as 'Firebirds' with Nicolas Cage, but without all the dumb jokes and comments the pilots in that movie made that rendered that film mildly annoying.

Some of the latches on the board are a little hard for her and she still has not mastered them, but most of them she can do well and will do them over and over again. One of the latches seems really hard to turn - even for me, but I think maybe it's just the way the piece was assembled (screwed in a little too tight).I purchased our board at a local store and wasn't thrilled about the price of $[...], although I didn't have to pay for shipping. Considering how long my daughter has played with it (and still plays with it a few months later) I think it was a worth-while purchase.

We bought it when DS was 2 he mastered all but one quickly and it ended up in storage at Grandma's house. On the plus side, if you shove it hard it fits into the M&D; storage piece with two different puzzle sizes, not the one with spaces for a single type of puzzle. And even with gentle play it looks sad with torn bits.I think something with zippers/snaps/buttons/latches would have been more interesting. M&D; also makes one but it has even worse reviews than the latches board.These are the Tag Toys ones: [...] In retrospect, the least expensive version also has a place to hide things that DS would have loved at 2 and would still love at 3.

This is the perfect solution. We have owned one of these before and it lasted forever, so we chose the same model. Well constructed and holds a lot of wet clothes, even in windy conditions. The only downside on this one was that the tension on the different lines was not correct and it sometimes does not want to wind back in like it should. It does if you are patient and work at it though so overall I would recommend it for anyone needing a \\"portable\\" solution. Make sure the unit is mounted securely however, especially if you have any wind to deal with."},{"rating":"2","title":"Clothesline for a family of five","review":"We've had this clothesline for three summers now and it's still working great. I try my best to give the dryer a rest when it's nice out but with a family of five you need a lot of line. I'm able to hang up two or three loads of laundry at one time. With a good clothespin bag to move along as you hang, you can get the clothes out fast. If you're serious about line drying then you need this."},{"rating":"2","title":"My third retractable clothesline","review":"Having had two retractable clotheslines before, I looked for one on the internet. I knew I couldn't replace it where I bought the last two. My first one wore out. I was unhappy when icicles fron the roof of my two story house fell on my retractable clothes line. The icicles were so big that they broke the housing of my clothes line. I knew I wanted a new one just like I had previously. I was very happy to find it. I am 74 years old and have used these lines for probably 35 or 40 years. The second one was about 10 years old."},{"rating":"1","title":"DO NOT BUY","review":"We have utilized 2 of these units in the last 3 years... why? They both were susceptible to plastic failure. The maker should use metal at the stress point, that being the line tension adjustment screw on the left side. Worked well for a couple of weeks then when the lines started to sag, the tension was adjusted and the plastic broke rendering the unit useless. *** PLEASE DO NOT BUY *** A waste of your money!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Plastic Failure","review":"The Cloths line worked reasonably well for the first few months, but then the plastic knob on the left side broke and, apparently, cannot be replaced. The piece is actually a ratcheting lock that keeps the line tensioned. Without it the line will just sag and is useless. As stated above, this part should not be plastic.I went to the company website \\"Whitney Design\\" and there isn't even a link for support or parts; check it out. That's a question I should have asked before paying $55 for this; \\"Does the company support what they sell?\\"I would not buy this product again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Built in Obsolescence","review":"I bought my clothes line in August 2006 and the one in the box was broken. We replaced it and now it is June 2007 and I need to replace it again. The locking knob on the side is not built to last and is broken again. That is the reason we had to replace the first one. I live in the Midwest so I do not use my clothes line all year and it has not had enough use to be replaced. I highly recommend using a clothes line just not one with built in obsolescence."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sunline Retractable Clothesline","review":"I have used one of these clotheslines for 11 years, and am about to purchase another for a second home. I have found it to be sturdy, and well worth the money. The line is the standard-sized vinyl-covered clothesline, not the flimsy \\"portable\\" or travel-style line. Although the line no longer tightens with the one-hand knob, I can use both knobs together and tighten it just fine. Aside from this, the only problem I have ever had is that one of the lines broke from chafing against the aluminum bar housing -- that was easily repaired by shortening each of the lines a little and re-tying the knots. Except for hanging it and installing the hook at the opposite end of your drying yard, this comes assembled and ready to use. Highly recommended -- it will last a long time if you don't abuse it."},{"rating":"1","title":"DO NOT PURCHASE!!! POOR QUALITY","review":"We have utilized 2 of these units in the past 3 years. Each one was susceptible to the same fault, the locking screw will work, but the plastic that attaches the screw to the line holder breaks off leaving no tension on the lines for the clothes to hang. Kind of hard to explain but I wouldn't buy another. The company could provide a better construction material or method of construction, mabye using METAL that won't break! *** DO NOT BUY ***"},{"rating":"1","title":"Clothes dryer","review":"Not a very good idea unless you are six feet tall.

After reading \\"Presumed Innocent,\\" which I consider one of the genre-breaking books in crime fiction during the past 20 years, I turned to this. The beginning starts off brilliantly as the first chapter is the perfect mix of pathos and plot setting. Everything, however, goes down hill from there. A self-pitying (sexist) protagonist, aimless flashbacks, odd occurrences (and re-occurrences) by weak characters, and a plot that is convoluted (and seriously dated by today's financial standards), the book grows increasingly painful until the final page. Upon completing the work, I set it down, not with satisfaction, but with disgust at having wasted so much time. I gave it two stars instead of one probably because I admired Turow's first book so much that I wished this had been a better reading experience."},{"rating":"1","title":"Did not meet the burden of proof","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed the read and will probably read some more of Scott Turow's books in the future. But basically I was disappointed in this one. The plot was quite convoluted, but in the end, not credible. The characters seemed to be thoroughly developed, but many behaved completely inconsistently making the story seem totally contrived at the conclusion. Who would have guessed that an unrepentant, reprehensible cad would suddenly suffer the pangs of conscience? Besides I was rooting for Sonny and Sandy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Slow to start, but wow!","review":"When I first started this book, I didn't know if I would keep reading it. I am compulsive - when I start a book, it is extremely rare for me not to finish it even if I don't like it. I thought about putting this one down, but decided I need to give it more of a chance. I was very glad that I did. Once I got into the subplots, I found it hard to put down. The subplots went a little too far in my opinion, but it made for a very interesting story."},{"rating":"2","title":"Deep and interesting read","review":"This book is not necessarily a great courtroom drama, but more of a character study with some mystery thrown in.Much better than Grisham."},{"rating":"2","title":"Probably the best legal thriller writer","review":"He is probably the best, not for writing a suspenseful book, but because he has an amazing gift for words and it is very difficult to predict in which way his books will go. Grisham may provide a faster read, but you do not get as much out of it. However, Burden of Proof is not as good as Presumed Innocent because it takes a while to build momentum and the details of Dixon's business become a little stifling."},{"rating":"2","title":"I Love Turow!","review":"I purchased this book because I enjoyed Presumed Innocent and Innocent by Turow. The Burden of Proof has different characters but the premise is somewhat the same: dead wife, family secrets, and legal thrills. No one does this kind of novel so well!! This author will not appeal to everyone, in spite of the popularity of Presumed Innocent. If you are expecting JUST legal thrills, look elsewhere. If you like excellent writing and complex characters you will love these books. He's a master of character motive and plot twists.... Not an easy read, no action but I could not put this book down."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Burden Of Proof","review":"A few of you thought there was not enough legal aspects to the story line, and too much of the personal relationships. I found the mix to be a good balance. Getting to know the characters' struggles and joys throughout this novel was one reason I found it to be a good read. There was enough legal talk intertwined in my opinion, and the balance kept me up reading late into the night! If you liked Presummed Innocent, you will love The Burden Of Proof."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's ok reading....but nothing spectacular","review":"I've heard that Scott Turow's other books are much better.

The reader is taken into a Jewish family, where the main character, Stern, does not know anybody except his colorful, scheming, affluent brother in law. His son, daughters, son in law and especially his wife of decades are strangers to him. So are his close neighbors. Yet Stern is a successful lawyer, must have a reasonable amount of intelligence, one should hope. An unlikely situation, but entertaining enough. It seems like he really doesn't want to know what makes his family tick but stumbles into their secrets. Rude awakenings! That would be a better title, because the legal aspects of the book read like murky morass. I think the author failed his burden of proof to convince me, that this is a good novel. His style is tiresome to read, however the proof is there, that fiction has no limits, because it demands no burden of proof. Rude awakenings for fans of this author, I assume!

However, the writer made one fundamental mistake which every lawyer tends to make from time to time. He had to show off his knowledge of \\"big words\\".Unless the writer intended for this book to be read by scholars only, my advice to the average Joe is to ensure that he has a dictionary opened when he begins to read because the plot is buried in grandiloquence.I am myself an attorney and an English major and I found this book tough reading because I was basically stumbling over unnecessarily big words which made it difficult to appreciate the plot fully.A great writer is able to get his ideas across in uncomplicated language.

This is a complex story of a middle-aged man, who loses his much-loved wife to a mysterious suicide. Turow develops the personalities of his characters, and weaves a multi-faceted plot line, just as occurs in real-life circumstances. \\"Burden of Proof\\" is one of the best novels I have ever read, and quite different from \\"Presumed Innocent\\", which most folks know from the Harrison Ford movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"A well woven tale","review":"This is the second Turow novel I've read and I'm hooked. He's an excellent story teller and really knows how to take a plot through unexpected twists and turns. This book is solid evidence of his skills and I recommend it heartily.I know how popular Grisham is and I've enjoyed some of his writing, but I'd rate Turow as easily the better writer. This book has plenty to help me reach that conclusion: family and business deceit, awkward romantic liasons, legal and personal grudges and jealousies, securities fraud, etc. Try it, I'll bet you'll like it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worthy of a second (third?) release","review":"When Bo Hansson originally composed the music on (Music Inspired By) Lord Of The Rings he of course had no idea that the trilogy would become multi-million-dollar-mega-blockbuster movies at the hands of Peter Jackson.

(Music Inspired By) Lord Of The Rings is an excellent album, beautifully capturing the atmosphere of Tolkien's books.

Originally released in 1970, at the dawn of the \\"progressive rock\\" era, this instrumental recording is short on the pomposity that marred alot of stuff from that time, but is high on whimsy and laid-back, otherworldly atmosphere.

Unfortunately the teacher didn't spend enough time to work on the tones and I have a feeling though I remember the words but people could not understand me when I talk. It's because Chinese is a tonal language and a sound can have 4 different tones and each means completely different things. I searched and found this DVD, it's really incredible. The teacher used violin, piano, voice and hand gestures to demonstrate and explain the different tones. My teach spend ten minutes on the tones, in this DVD the teacher spent hours focus on the four tones... by the end of watching this DVD, I already feel more confident. The video quality can be a bit better. But the teaching style is super innovative and effective.

Horror is what they find, and Babe has to rise to the occasion to save the day. The themes and moods of this movie are much different than the first one. Whereas the original Babe was very lighthearted, with occasional scenes of suspense and thorror, this movie is the opposite. Here there are mostly scenes of suspense, with only some lighthearted scenes. The comedy is not that good, but the special effects are a lot better.

I tried cleaning it with professional disc cleaners. I tried to watch this movie for over 30 minutes and finally just went out to F.Y.I. to get the real thing! I'm so upset! Lately I've been getting ripped-off ordering this way! This person knew this DVD was scratched when they sent it to me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shocking!","review":"Whoever likes this movie, feel free to like it. But really!! I heard in my local newspaper how they were going to rate it PG-13, with every curse word imaginable except that one - and they squeezed everything down to \\"darn\\". Seeing this, I was a little freaked that two year olds were watching this with their older siblings who were really 4 years older... it's shocking!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Babe & Babe, Pig in the City","review":"Both DVD's are in excellent condition; It was great toget both of the DVDs for such a low price and in such great shape,Thank you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Definitely not worth it!","review":"The first time i saw this movie, it really creeped me out. If you didn't listen carefully, it got very confusing. It is a dark and strange movie that most kids would not understand and would be a little frightened by. This movie should never have come out. I gave it 1 star because no stars isn't a choice on the list! It doesn't even come close to the sweet and darling first version. Most definitely a YUCK! on my list."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT a kid's movie","review":"This was most definitely NOT a kid's movie. I only wish I had checked reviews prior to renting this movie to watch with my young daughter. She loved the first one, so naturally, I thought the sequel would be in the same vein. Boy, was that a mistake. As the other reviews indicate, it was a very DARK movie. While some of the dialog and action was funny, overall, it was aimed to an adult audience."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for young viewers (zero stars)","review":"The freshness and wholesomeness of the first movie is noticeably lacking in the sequel. It is a very dark and depressing movie; almost the flipside of the original. Placing the primates and other animals in human clothing and having them perform 'tricks' is one of the lowest forms of entertainment. Totally degrading the animal and the viewer. The only good point in the movie is at the end when the chimps are allowed to 'act like chimps'. The first movie was unique and quite enjoyable for young and old alike. The second is a severe disapointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"creepy movie","review":"I agree with the reviews that call this movie disturbing and frightening. My kids (6 and 10) were freaked out by this movie and its bizarre, terrifying scenes and effects. (These kids are not overly sheltered, either: They love Austin Powers and the Terminator movies.) We saw Babe, Pig in the City quite some time ago and I forget the details, but count me in as one who found the previews and the build-up to be stunning misrepresentations of the actual content."},{"rating":"1","title":"I would rather watch a SEAL HUNT","review":"BE WARNED... there is NOTHING in Pig in the City that makes this experience worthwhile for anyone who appreciated the original! There is senseless hurt, suffering and death of animals in this movie.It may sound petty to say \\"Hey, animals suffer in this movie!\\" but in the light that Babe is shone, it is WAY OUT OF CONTEXT... this is NOT a movie for your kids... or anyone for that matter.It is about as entertaining as watching a seal hunt. (you have been warned)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Entertaining","review":"I didn't like this one as much as the first one, which I tend to watch again after a year or so. The first one is definately on the \\"need to own\\" list, but I don't feel as strongly about the second film.It's still a fun to watch family movie, and I do recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Come, gaze into the abyss","review":"Draw a bath and grab a razor blade - it's the bleakest film ever made! Babe travels to the city and learns that the world is a great big dark pit of despair and suffering.Cringe! in slack-jawed horror as animals and cancer-stricken children flee a hospital fire.Weep! as a depressive orangutan tries in vain to maintain his dignity in a world that strips all dignity away.Sob inconsolably! as innocent animals tell (with children's voices) tales of the unspeakable cruelties they have suffered at the hands of Man.Finally, fall! to your wretched knees and pray desperately in the implacable face of an uncaring universe for some small sign that life is more than an endless black night of pain and despair that makes a mockery of hope and a cruel joke of the conceit that there is any kindness or joy to be found in the barren desolation of this cold and merciless world."},{"rating":"1","title":"A let down","review":"Not as good as \\"Babe\\" by a long shot. Still the characters we continue to follow act as we would expect. Frankly I'm not sure why the film creators felt the need to go to a city to further Babe's adventures. I'd recommend strongly that you watch it on television or rent it with some others before investing your money in it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yes, there is cruelty in the world","review":"My first hope of this movie was it would be as light hearted and happy as the first. As we watched the movie I realized this was something far different. I had to turn it off because my daughter was crying, she has a soft spot for helpless animals. The dog hanging itself by his chain over the bridge and the dog getting hit by the car was just to much for her because I taught her to love of animals. Even though they did not die in the end, she couldn't get over these scenes and refused to watch it (she is 11). I watched it because I couldn't believe it. I don't recommend this to sensitive animal lovers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bound to Become A Classic!","review":"I've read the reviews that label this movie a little \\"dark\\", but isn't human nature a little dark as well? The messages are many without overbearing moralizing.

It will become a valued part of my DVD library, to be watched over and over again."},{"rating":"2","title":"On DVD","review":"Before we only owned this on tape, so now it is very convienent to use. It is a great for kids and adults!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Movie For Everyone","review":"The late Gene Siskel named \\"Babe: Pig in the City\\" as the best movie of the year. One of his reasons was that it celebrated the joy of film making. The story it tells is one about understanding who you are and respecting others. A moral many people should take to heart.If some people believe the story of the film to be too violent and shows a disrespect for animals, I would say in reply that it is the opposite. Also, is there a life that does not have misfortune? This film tells a story about misfortune and shows that even if you are comming from a world of mistrust you can find a common ground with others and even live in peace, happily ever after.The story is a charming one with a good deal of humor but also, like any good comedy, has a few tears mixed in."},{"rating":"1","title":"Repulsive","review":"Let me start by saying that Babe is in my top 3 list of favorite movies of all time. THIS movie, however, is DEAD LAST. I was thoroughly disgusted by this shockingly violent movie. James Cromwell (Farmer Hoggett) blew off criticism by saying \\"the first movie had a dark side as well\\". This is a movie that should never had been made. Babe was a beatiful movie which was at times bittersweet. Kubrick's A Clockwork Orange was less shocking than this movie, and yet they still target it at children? Disgusting."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Watch This Movie If You Are Depressed","review":"The first movie Babe was dark and sad at times but had many high notes, however, this movie was sad and depressing for the most part. The animation and special effects were great. The mice made the show as well as Ferdinand the duck. I feel this movie is too scary for the little ones. Talk about a bad hair day for the Pig. At least the Pig prevails. Although we all know how cruel people treat animals, I don't think children are ready for this one. As a animal lover, I found the movie heartrending even though things worked out. In the real world, they usually don't. If anything comes out of this sad movie, is perhaps a child who may show more compassion to animals. Leave the moral lessons to me. Glad I saw it before I took the young 'ens."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best family movie ever made since...the first Babe!","review":"Funny, loving, intelligent, all these qualities are from the pig and the movie...

A far cry from Hitler's barbarism, the camps in the Phillipines carried their share of inhumanity, starvation, and sadness. But Mrs. Whitfield's book gives us a window without bitterness. Her three years were dangerous, exciting, sad, and funny--simplistic adjectives which do not do justice to her special style of writing. For the young and old--and all of us in between."},{"rating":"1","title":"DO NOT TOUCH!!!!","review":"I happen to be a fan of Fred Olen Ray's movies, but you must fight all urges to buy this one, folks. First of all, the picture quality wasn't that great. I've seen worse, but it is poor quality and very grainy (which suprises me given the good quality of other Retro Media titles). Next, the acting is atrocious. I can usually deal with bad actors and actresses (as I said earlier, I'm a fan of Fred Olen Ray's movies) if the plot is decent enough or if the story is at least entertaining enough. But this is absolutely the worst movie I have ever seen! There are no, I repeat, no redeeming qualities in this movie. So, why did I give it two stars you ask? The extra materials, that's why. There are some pretty neat things on the rest of the DVD (such as Nite Owl Theater bloopers, outtakes of the movie, and, of course, a new episode of Nite Owl Theater). But believe me, it is not worth the price of the DVD. STAY AWAY!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Wish I could have seen it","review":"I'd like to be able to write a review of this, but the widescreen DVD version didn't work in my home player or in my PC.

The plot is obviously a ripoff of \\"The Wasp Woman\\", the special effects are practically non-exsistant, the monster is stupid looking, (I did like the teeth) and I've see better acting in porno movies. The only redeeming feature of this turkey is the physical appearance of the woman actors, the're for the most part pretty darn good looking.

Yes, this movie is so vividly colorful and amazing.But on the flip side, it is profoundly sad and gut-wrenching too. I ended up having to stop watching it half-way through and come back to finishwatching it a few hours later.One thing that bothered me though was the discontinuous story-line. It was often hard to follow as the story seemed to jump around chronologicallyand some of the situations were confusing and unclear.But all in all, I did like the movie and found it amazing to watch.

Once again, Hollywood compensates for a poor story line by over doing the special effects.

There is the ultimate romance here - chasing ones family and soul mate through the afterlife, but like vampire movie -it's seems to make up its own rules about spirituality, Heaven, Hell, suicide to move the plot along.

Heaven is an Escher painting, complete with people flying about. Hell consists of naked, writhing bodies incessantly moaning, and a lot of dust.The film also keeps making unintentional comments - for example, we discover that the two white upper-middle kids voluntarily chose minority identities in the afterlife and that their father does not question this decision for a moment. It would have been amusing if they had swapped genders as well as racial identities.The only half way decent moment is when he goes to hell and steps on lots of heads in his search for his wife.But the best moment in the film is actually the alternate ending (the DVD has it).

I can't exactly say what made it such a frustrating experience but I walked out of the theater thinking that I would rather be run over by a semi than be forced to sit through another screening of this film. I love Williams, Cuba was amazing in Boys in the Hood, and the visuals were spectacular, but the film was so bad that even the great FX didn't allow me to give it more than 1 star. Probably the hardest movie to sit through of 1998, (and Armageddon came out the same year!)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Heart-wretching","review":"I absolutely couldn't wait to see this portrait of life after death.

Ten minutes into this movie and I could care less where Robin's character was, what he did, where he went, what he thought! Boring! Boring!

This movie isn't worth your time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing in the box","review":"I bought this movie to give as a gift. When the gift was opened and the DVD case was opened there was no movie. By this time I had thrown the packing receipt away. I was very disappointed.

It turned out to be a huge disappointment for both of us."},{"rating":"1","title":"Liars telling lies","review":"What dreams may come is based in the lie that all dogs go to heaven. Maybe dogs do.

It is a big insult considering the fact that he's acting is really outstanding. I cried when I watched that movie. I heard from the the critics that this movie is not realistic, okay....is there anyone out there discovered what is life after death? None. They are desperately trying to turn down Robin when the truth is they cannot. You know guys (critics) this movie focuses on what life may comes after death. It is not that \\"this is what happen when we die.\\" Because no one in this world will know. I guess you should pay attention again this movie and think hundred times.Anyway, I would like to congratulate the stars, director and the whole staff for giving us this kind of movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sumptuous visual feast as filling as a cracker.","review":"I was hoping to come away from this movie with more than the empty feeling than I did. Even though the visual presentation was intriguing and beautiful, why the Vail's? No one appeared as they were until some prerequisite had been met on the part of the newly deceased. Williams sucked in this quasi-emotional serious piece. I was unable to feel any empathy for his self absorbed wife, the piece meal way we learned why she took her life her left much to be desired. I had no pity for her character, and thought she should have been left in hell where she belongs. I guess I am blaming the wrong people, the screenwriter and the director share equally for bringing such crap to the screen."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Creative but lacked something","review":"I saw this movie and I really didnt think it was funny, touching, and to me it really didnt make much sense.

Had a few moment of deep thought and revealing of true love experience, not based on a phsyical level."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic romp with loads of style","review":"First of all let me say that this movie is HARD to watch. It starts out with tragedy and takes a very long time to swoop out of it - in the end it is an uplifting movie, and amazingly crafted both visually and philosophically - but for the majority of the movie it grips you hard by your emotional core and doesn't let go.The visual style is incredible, the special effects way ahead of their time, and a take on both cinematic presentation and the afterlife unlike any I've ever seen before.It can be at times a little heavy-handed and overly serious, but with both incredibly strong performances across the board and a deeply compelling story. This movie definitely goes high on my list as a little-known must see movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great movie and performance by Robin Williams!","review":"I loved the movie, but disagreed with their interpretation of what happens to a person who committs suicide.

I'd give the visuals a 4.5 out of 5 (based on the year this was filmed it was amazing and still holds up for the most part besides a few scenes here and there) and the colors and set designs are amazing. I'd give the plot a 3.5. Just take it all in as someone's view of the afterlife and of love and it makes for a pretty heartfelt, moving and unique story."},{"rating":"2","title":"Read the book TOO","review":"Anyone who has read the Matheson book 'What Dreams May Come' know how vividly the picture of this magical world Chris creates with his mind can be painted in your head. The way they changed the plot around in this book is interesting, but I thought the book was way more inticing and that if you read the book before you see the movie, you will have a greater understanding of the movie and will enjoy it much more. The pain that Anne goes through is one I have known well. A feeling of want and of need and of trying to figure out what is going on in your head before you scream. Wow. Good movie. Even better book."},{"rating":"2","title":"super cool","review":"the story is ok, chicks dig it, but if you appreciate computer art and special effects this is your movie. The artists went all out on this one, it mind boggling to think how they could have done what they did with this movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Talk about killing a perfectly good book!","review":"It's not like I hated this movie. I thought Robin Williams did a good job and visually, it was very unique. Of course, I had to be one of those people who reads the book before seeing the movie. And I think we've all seen good books get slaughtered on film. So, although a good movie, it severely lacked everything that made the book so great. Actually, it was practically a completely different story taking place in the same settings (Ala \\"Jurassic Park\\"). Of course, there were other things to. The kids die, and when he gets to heaven, he doesn't really seem to care. The camera work when he first dies was poorly edited. The entrance to Hell looked like the stage at a Kiss concert. Little things like that. But in short and without going into a much longer speech, I just want to say that for once, if you are really curious about the story of a man in heaven who goes to hell to save his wife, then just read the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"What Dreams May Come","review":"From a Mans point of view, I extremely liked this movie.

I think this is the kind of products that deserve a double DVD and sleeve book. I hope sometime a deluxe edition will be released."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent movie","review":"This was a movie I saw for the first time in high school. I think it is an excellenct movie, especially for the creative arts type of person. It was created with a wonderful imagination and is a one of a kind type of movie. Highly recommended for anyone open to interpretation or interested in art of all kinds."},{"rating":"2","title":"Incredible","review":"\\"What Dreams May Come\\" is an amazing film. It didn't do well with the critics, but it seems clear to me that those who disliked the film have never found someone to share a relationship similar to that of Chris and Annie. The storyline is not unrealistic---indeed, I have never identified with a film so closely in my life.See this film. It's truly one of the most powerful films ever made. If you're a skeptic, listen to what this film says about love. It's all true. If you've found your soulmate, see this film with them.

Several times I wanted to turn it off and cough it up as a few dollars lost but struggled through watching it. I kept thinking... Who wrote this? Who would take the time and expense to produce this? Were they all smoking something? Were they all on drugs? Do the people who love this movie... is it because at some time in their lives, they've used drugs? For the SPIRITUAL to have so much PHYSICAL was so ludicrous. You knew what the ending was to be but had to struggle through this absurdity and it was boring. I think even one star is too high but they don't have a \\"No Star\\" category.Robin Williams has made some excellent movies and his acting is good in this one but it was all a waste. This movie DID go to my \\"Not Keeping\\" pile."},{"rating":"1","title":"Closed Captions/Subtitles unavailable in English","review":"This DVD is marked as closed captioned, but what's missing is that there are no closed captions or subtitles in English, only in French and Spanish. I don't know French or Spanish, and need English closed captions. Luckily I got this DVD from the local public library rather than bought it before I found out I have no access to the movie through lack of English-language closed captions. There's no way to add this information near the top when the specific features of the DVD are given, it only says that a movie is closed captioned or subtitled or not, so I can only give this information down here in the comment section.Amazon.com, please allow for the ability to say whether closed captioning means English or not. It's not meaningful to say a movie is closed captioned if it turns out none of the closed captioned languages are in English.I wish I could give zero stars rather than one star, because this movie wasn't even accessible to me at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"What Dreams May Come","review":"My Dreams include dribble like this never being made again. This movie is true to the Hollywood formula of \\"Tear Jerkers\\". It is completely void of substance. Looks are only puddle deep with this bad dream."},{"rating":"1","title":"A complete and utter disappointment....","review":"My British Literature teacher assigned this movie because it deals with theology and we read poets who express their theology in their poetry. I can honestly say I will never watch this movie again, unless forced to. (And yes, I even told that to my professor!) This movie was such a disappointment after about the first 45 minutes or so, especially when it got to the hell part. I even had to quit watching at that particular part because of boredom. I was also disappointed because of Robin Williams' character giving up HEAVEN to be with his SUICIDAL wife. Now how lame is that??? Yes, the scenery was nice to watch, but the plot was, and I am being nice, HORRIBLE. If you want to watch a movie, I recommend NOT watching this, unless you want to watch a horrible movie. Sorry Robin Williams, you had better luck with Mrs. Doubtfire."},{"rating":"1","title":"This one gets negative 5","review":"I can't believe anyone with depth could like this. It was lame in every area. First of all, the special effects were weird and stupid. They got in the way of the story. The characters were not likeable and so annoying. I didn't believe in the acting, and I didn't care what happened to them. I can't believe this forced, waste of effort moved as many people as it did. Maybe they liked the subject matter. A lot of people just check their brain at the door when they see movies, and like anything that is feed to them. This movie is as bad as it gets."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing judgement on suicide","review":"Just saw this at a friend's home. I always like Robin Williams. I did not know the whole story but liked that its about the afterlife. I did not expect anyone to \\"go to hell\\" for suicide after loosing their children and then later their spouse. It was a turnoff. I dont believe those in deep despair are to be jugdged totally by this desperate single action. Its as if their whole life counted for zero and a horrid few months or years of unbearable grief makes them horrible enough to burn forever. How mean and how silly for US to come to that belief. I think when outside horrors kill one's spirit and ability to go on, that many suicides are not thought out in any way. And they are very personal..not meant to harm anyone else. PTSD comes to mind.. loosing all one's family is another. (and the Bible was written by man btw) Suprised Robin would do this movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"blecch!","review":"This film is visually ambitious and sometimes spectacular, but that, in my opinion, is where the quality ends. An apalling mawkish screenplay and an embarassingly unctuous insipid performance by Robin Williams made me squirm through much of this film. He can be so phenomenal with the right material, and this simply wasn't it. Also wasted in this lurching mess is the estimable Max Von Sydow. Don't waste your time or your money on this bomb."},{"rating":"1","title":"How embarrassing for two wonderful actors!","review":"I saw this movie in the theater when it first came out. I thought surely with Robin Williams it would be great. How wrong I was!!! This movie is soooooo weird! You'll feel like you've taken acid(along with the director) and wonder what in the world the director was thinking when he wrote it.

I have no idea why I didn't think of this first. The visuals in this film are incredible but prepare yourself for a very, very sad film. It's somber throughout and you may have problems wanting to watch this again simply because of how brutal it is on your emotions. I can stand it. My wife couldn't and refused to watch it again even though she loved it. I would have changed some things in the discussion of God and heaven and hell nevertheless, I highly recommend this film to anyone who wants to feel what true love is all about even if they don't have it in their lives."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful visual effects and a great story","review":"This movie is unlike any other movie in the sense that the visual effects alone invoke feelings that the characters are conveying. The story itself is a mixture of intense love and overwhelming melancholy. The visual effects are a work of art, creating an illusion of what I would compare to stepping into a Salvador Dali painting.What Dreams May Come is a surreal and amazing film.

I was entranced by it. I have since read this book about once a year because I feel that it is that wonderful and I get something new out of it each time I read it. I had always hoped that they would make it into a movie. Lo and behold, 15 years later they did. I couldn't wait to see. When I did I was extremely disappointed. I hated that the screenwriters felt the need to change the original story line so much, because I did not see the need to change so lovely and magical a story line. For me, that completely ruined the movie. If I had not read the book first I would have probably enjoyed it more. If I were Mr. Matheson, I would have felt violated by all the changes, which in the movie, turned out to be contrived, cheesy and predictable. The only aspect of this movie that I did enjoy was the visuals.

Have a look at this movie. It shows the difference in thought that comes from love and thought that is based in fear. Most importantly it is a brilliant portrayal of how we create our reality by what and how we think. The film shows you that death is an illusion and that there is a very grand purpose to life. And for those that have not read Coversations with God book 3, do so and see how the two are linked!"},{"rating":"1","title":"First BAD experience","review":"This DVD would not play on any of three players, Sony Home Theater System, Blue Ray Player and standard table top DVD player.

If there is any kind of movie likely to provoke violence,it's not's fight club or clockwork orange(now they are great films,and far more meaningful and challenging than this sappy mess)it's ...movie's like this.

I was very disappointed with the outcome. It seemed that the whole movie was chaos and tried to pass only by its amazing visuals. I didn't believe that he loved her enough to go to Hell for her, and I thought that the whole picture was just a wierd dream that one of the scriptwriters dreamed up one afternoon.

This and Map of the Human Heart actually get me on a pretty primal level.This film is an odd bird though, lots of people don't like it, claiming its too sappy and that lots of it just doesn't work. Ironically many of these same folks actually like Ghost, go figure.Anyway, the film is very pretty unforgiving I guess, in that you simply have to accept a certain package of ideas and relationships, and the film doesn't really reach out to help the audience do so. Storywise its Orphius in the Underworld, but that part of the story really is only the final act.It is a BEAUTIFUL film though and it makes an interesting trilogy with Ghost, and Somewhere in Time."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Marriage of Heaven & Hell.

When I first realized that the characters taking Robin Williams through the mindscape were his children, it all hit home with am emotional whallop that I will never forget. There is a strong message here, not only of the wrongness of suicide, but of the infinite possibilities open to us if we decide to look for them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Breathtaking, mindexpanding, Sun for the soul.","review":"The one movie of the year to watch if you question yor existance on this planet and your purpose.

This is the story of him trying to get back to his wife. The special effects are amazing. And of course Robin Williams is good as always. But it was just too long, a little boring, and there wasn't that much there to work with. Some of the points I didn't agree with, that is being a Catholic. But I'm not saying it was a bad movie, it was okay. I just probably won't watch it again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Depressing and draining","review":"I didn't think this movie was nearly as visually stunning as everyone seemed to rave about. It was very depressing and energy draining. The acting, in particular, was sullen and depressing with sporadic manic episodes, displayed mostly by Robin Williams. Robin Williams should stick to what he does very well--comedy. He's pitiful at drama."},{"rating":"1","title":"What were they thinking?","review":"Sure, the artistic design and special effects are great, but were the screenwriters drunk when they spewed out the script? The unusual premise aside, the characters are not believable and the plot is choppy and contrived. People think this movie is \\"deep\\"? Come on! A film isn't deeply philosophical just because it is about death and the afterlife. It has to make sense too!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Overview of several couple therapies","review":"This is a collection of chapters written about couple and marital therapy.

To judge from other reproductions of the same pictures, the quality of the reproduction seems mediocre. Here you can learn only what Matherw Fox, a Domican, thinks about these visions. To find out what Hildegard said about them visions -- which is far fresher and more stunning that what Fox has to say -- one will have to look elsewhere. As an introduction to Hildegard, I would suggest \\"Hildegard of Bingen, A Visionary Life\\" and \\"Secrets of God: Writings of Hildegard of Bingen,\\" both by Sabina Flanagan."},{"rating":"1","title":"A gross mistreatment of a wonderful mystic, w/gd photos","review":"It is terrible shame that the best affordable set of reproductions of Hildegard's images is by Fox on Fox. His text is a series of misquotes which misrepresents his source throughout all his commentary, juxtaposing quotes to put words in Hildegard's mouth, often ones which would have enraged her. There is a costly but much better reproduction of the visions by A. Fuhrkotter published by Turnhout, Belgium in good library collections or for those who can afford it. I encourage anyone interested in Hildegard to go for the reputable scholars like Newman, Flanagan, Davies, and Hart just to name a few."},{"rating":"1","title":"A 0-star review would be more appropriate.","review":"This book is not worth buying: what a shame they killed good trees to produce it! Matthew Fox is renowned in the world of academia and learned theology for his sheer flakiness. He is no Hildegard authority, but only a Fox authority (MUCH less interesting).

Artisan ruined another great movie called Joshua Tree (or Army Of One, as the DVD cover for that movie incorrectly states) with the DVD, which featured a similar DVD transfer (very poor).

The awfulness of the acting, with one exception, eclipsed even the painfulness of the concept. Brad Pitt, never very gifted as an actor, here hit rock bottom, fortunately early in his career. When I say fortunately I mean for him, not for the rest of us, who have had to endure his later somnolent roles whose dreadfulness is said, by some, to be compensated for by his abs and pretty face.I am sure this movie would have sucked out my life and left me a vegetable, except for the performance of Catherine Keener, whose brilliance as an actress has, alas, never been rewarded with the success that she deserves."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brad Pitt Sparkles as a Surreal Anti-Hero","review":"Brad Pitt is obviously the main draw here, and although he brings his great physical beauty to the role, as in every role he plays, it is not all he brings.

I love this character, and found the most interesting aspect of this particular book how the case affected him.

The last three books have left me sorely disappointed and this one put the finishing touch on my feelings for this author. This entire book felt like a very long and trite \\"Law and Order\\" episode. It was superficial and empty as compared to his earlier works. I kept waiting for something to happen but, when it finally did, it was utterly predictable. Please do yourself a favor and read his earlier works (The Poet, etc.). If your done with those, I recommend Robert Crais' early stuff (before Hostage and Demolition Angel)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Searching For Redemption","review":"This is another excellent entry in the Hieronymous Bosch series, in which we continue to learn about him, his past, and what makes him tick. In CITY OF BONES Bosch investigates the death of a boy killed 20 years ago, whose bones are found in the Hollywood Hills. As he uncovers evidence about the crime, Bosch meets a female cop who awakens feelings and memories for him.As Bosch continues to work the case and piece the crime together, he confronts challenges and hurdles that complicate his life and add complexity to the story. Connelly takes the reader along with Bosch through his struggles and for me it became apparant he was looking for redemption by solving the case. Does he find it? That's open for discussion. In typical Connelly fashion, there are a few surprises and a stunner at the end, after you think the story is over.

I have read and listened to many Connelly books featuring Harry Bosch. Up til now, I have heard Dick Hill as the narrator, and he is matchless in his interpretation of Harry Bosch and all other characters on Connelly's books. I'm sure Cariou is a fine actor, but with the voice of Harry Bosch so firmly entrenched with Dick Hill, I was distracted while listening to this audio. Cariou doesn't even seem to realize that both of Harry's partners (Kiz and Edgar) are African American and instead made Edgar sound like a nasal voiced whiner. I see that most of the rest of the series (I'm following them in order) feature Cariou's voice - so I will have to think hard about continuing to listen.

It did keep me interested through the whole thing but it was a not so thrilling ride. I guess I was just too shocked that the end wasn't what I wanted it to be. I was let down with the ending. I'm glad I read it, but doubt I would recommend it as a *thriller* but more of a police mystery. Kind of a monotone storyline that is somewhat predictable.

The only one worse than City of Bones was Chasing The Dime which I left on P. 192 a couple months ago. City of Bones is, generally, the same good read but the person finally pegged as the killer in the end wss never proven to me---the most incomplete villain ever!! At the risk of invading a writer's mind, I think Detective Edgewood should have been the killer of the boy as well as the eventual \\"killer\\". It would have made for a more intriguing subplot with the two of them connected in a sinister, perverse way!!! lol. Chasing The Dime, a non-Bosch story, was bogged down in way too many pages of boring technological details of nanochips and patents. It did not seem to be Connelly's forte.

Many writers write just about the same book every time. This novel is a real gem in the detective/thriller genre. I don't think I've ever read one as good. The characters, the dialogue, the plot, and EVERYTHING come together in a superbly well crafted tale. I defy anyone to figure out whodunnit before the final pages. Yet it makes perfect sense. Connelly was always good but with this book he puts himself up there with the greats. Hope we see more of hero Harry Bosche."},{"rating":"2","title":"Terrific","review":"This being my first Michael Connelly novel I only knew him by reputation and didn't know what to expect of his writing. I bought it take on a short vacation and ended up reading the entire novel on the car ride en route. Needless to say, I was thoroughly enthralled by this book.Detective Harry Bosch's endeavor to solve a 20-year-old murder of a 12-year-old boy made for an interesting plot. But it was Connelly's ability to seamlessly move his characters in and out of a shifting storyline that kept the pages turning at a brisk pace. I found his writing to be very fluid and very readable. And I really didn't come across any dead spots in the book. I suppose that at some point the final outcome became predictable but, for me, that didn't dampen one iota my enjoyment of \\"City of Bones.\\" Other reviewers have stated that Connelly has done better in some of his other books in the Harry Bosch series. That being the case, I certainly will be reading many more of Connelly's works."},{"rating":"2","title":"Exciting but flawed -","review":"Connelly is among the best of the contemporary, gritty hard-boiled school. Maybe even the best. For me, this was a very taut, well-paced thriller. The procedural element was excellent. I would give the book a 5 except for two things. First was the Brasher sub-plot, which I thought was going to be great, but ending up feeling psychologically invalid. What happens might have been made believable, but perhaps Connelly was afraid it wouldn't be surprising enough. Instead, I was angry. Secondly - the end failed. It might have pure emotional dynamite. Perhaps if the Brasher situation had been more believable, I'd have believed Bosch's final choice. But again, I just felt set up, that it was done for effect rather than emotionally inevitable for the character. Nonetheless, mystery writers of this caliber are difficult to come by, so the book still ranks high for what it does do well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bosch does it again","review":"Always love a Michael Connolly.

If you want a spine tingling, look-under-the -covers story, read Truman Capote's short story (based on true facts), \\"Hand Carved Coffins\\" in the book, MUSIC FOR CHAMELEONS.A game of CLUE with my 5 year old nephew would have been more mysterious than this yawnfest."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pointless","review":"I had high expectations for this book but I was disappointed after reading it. The story moves at snail's pace for about half the book and then different events happen unexpectedly and rather suddenly.

NOW I DRAW THE LINE> I will not buy this book nor listen to it. Mr.Hill's voice is Harry. I will accept no other. No offense to the reader. he may be great-------but not for Harry. Connolly made a bad mistake not using Mr. Hill. I won't buy another of his books until Dick Hill is the reader------at least when they are about Harry Bosch.

There were loose ends that never quite came together and we came to the final page wondering what did we miss.

Well, I still loved it and wait to find out what Harry will do if he is no longer the dedicated detective."},{"rating":"2","title":"Longtime Connelly fan","review":"It goes without saying that Harry Bosch is one of the most interesting characters to come along in a long time. Just when you think maybe you have a handle on him-surprise.I particularly liked this book because of the psychological aspect,we see more of who Harry is and what drives him.Of course, it goes without saying that the story is never dull or plodding.

I really tried to like this book and read on in the hope that the limp storyline would pick-up pace or that there would be a new twist. Unfortunately there was no revival, it just never happened. The plot drudged on to the sorry, sad and predictable ending, that inched towards towards me uncontrollably.If you are a MC fan you will read the book anyway for the same reasons that I did and also the inexplicable reviews above. Make your own mind up. For those new to MC, looking for a good read- keep on looking because it is not here.I really hope MC gets his touch back as I and am sure others are loosing interest. Where have the talents of the author of 'The Poet' gone? This latest effort is mediocre at best. Would it have gotten published if it were an unknown author? - I think not.Time to find a new read.

It was very interesting until the end. There were a lot of storyline off-shoots that just weren't followed through on. I read the end feeling I must have missed something. A lot of questions were left unanswered, at least in my mind. There were interesting twists in the story but they fizzled out in the end."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boooorrriiinnng.","review":"I've read every book Connelly has written and I hate to say it, but I think he is getting VERY lazy. This book is a quick easy read, but completely unengaging. I can't believe it is getting such good reviews here. The plot \\"twists\\" are easy to see and not surpising. The list of suspects are completely non-threatening and don't get me started on the [less than satisfying] ending.

I wish I'd never read this book... it soured the taste of the whole Bosch series for me.In short, this reads like the procedural history of an authentic police case, but it's just not a case that's \\"bookworthy.\\" No cliffhanger moments, no truly suspensful life & death struggles... there is just nothing compelling about this dusty old case, no credible justification given for the investigation's urgency or for the media frenzy, and no real sympathy created for the victim.BTW, \\"The Last Coyote\\" did a *much* better job of bringing an old case to life and making the pursuit of its solution truly exciting than did \\"City of Bones.\\"Connelly's a great author, so the book is not rife with cliches... that and the fact that at least *one* character (Bosch) was well developed made it worth two stars instead of one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Michael Connelly can do anything!","review":"I have read almost all of Michael Connelly's books ... and continue to read the rest of them.

However, he seems to be losing his touch with City of Bones. The story started out well but faltered 2/3 of the way. You'll know who is the killer when he is introduced, so there's no surprise at the end. Harry Bosch, despite all the back cover blurbs saying it would change him forever, is still the same, the ending notwithstanding. Maybe we're getting numbed by the current CSI, The Shield, Boomtown, Law & Order assault, but then again, that's just me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tight plot.....unputdownable!","review":"In my opinion, this is the very best Bosch novel to date. The plot is as tight as the sheet on a new recruit's bed and full of twists and turns that kept me guessing until the end. Bosch is maturing as a cop and as a human being (and I'm glad his superiors agree with me) in this haunting tale of his search for the killer of a young, abused boy. I highly recommend this awesome author. Keep up the good work....I can't wait for the next one!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"City of Bones is weak, void moon is too","review":"I have enjoyed all of Michael Connelly's books but his two most recent have been let downs.

It certainly seems so as these don't compare to his first works."},{"rating":"1","title":"Make no bones about it ...","review":"City of Bones has been put together like a skeleton - only there seems to be a few bones missing. Michael Connelly's eighth Harry Bosch title is disjointed and disappointing - a letdown from his usual brilliance evidenced in A Darkness More Than Night, Void Moon, Angels Flight, Blood Work, and The Poet. The plot sees LAPD veteran Bosch investigating the discovery of a child's skeleton, buried for 20 years. However a storyline that starts with so much promise also become buried. The characters are flimsy and the investigation, a facile victory.It seems even the usual brilliant Connelly became bored and rather than deliver his usual twists and turns, sent this story down a deadend street."},{"rating":"2","title":"Harry is a complicated character","review":"A sad, bittersweet book.

Traveler's Tale, their third album, was not quite psychedelic, not quite progressive, not quite commercial...it's a tepid album in search of a musical personality. It also suffers from the absence of Gary Quackenbush on lead guitar, who left after two albums and was replaced by less-talented guitarist Ray Goodman.The album was also poorly produced, with a muddy sound further clouding the murky musical waters. This was their final shot on a major label (Capitol). Their two previous albums (SRC and Milestones) are much preferred over this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lines from the film don't match music, distract.","review":"Look no further than the Tub Scene track.

This horse's life is filled with good times and bad, kind masters and cruel masters. The way Black Beauty loves and tries to do his best for all his masters shows his humble spirit and his need to be loved. He goes through whatever hardship comes his way and his trust in his grooms and his masters is lovely. To hear him speak of how he must do his best in everything and always be good and patient is really heart-warming, and though he is a horse, a very timid and human spirit lives within him. He often speaks of how silly and stupid things like check-reigns and blinkers are and how ignorant certain foolish people can be. He knows that not all people are like that and tries to not show his despair when an amateur is in control.

This story is in a horse's point of view, but it seems so human-like. It shows how life has ups and downs, for every living thing.This story teaches us kindness, and to help others in need.

I can't wait my daughter to grow up for us to read \\"Black Beauty\\" together."},{"rating":"2","title":"An amazing classic!","review":"This book was great! I would definitely recommend this book to anyone who wants a classic tale, with a really original idea. It was really amazing to read about the different hardships Black Beauty had to face during his lifetime, and to realise the cruel treatment that a lot of horses had to endure during the times when everyone used horse and carriage to get around. I thought this was a very powerful novel, and you don't have to be a horse-lover to enjoy it. There wasn't a single boring bit in it! An amazing read!"},{"rating":"2","title":"It was the greatest Book I vere read","review":"This book is phenomenal. I enjoyed reading this book from the beginning to the end, unlike most books.

When Beauty is misused as well as other horses, that is the part that makes me sad. Horses are so sensitive and should be treated with love and care."},{"rating":"2","title":"Black Beauty : a wonderful Book","review":"I thought Black Beauty was a great book because it teaches some good lessons, like patience and a willingness to work hard. This horse had a truly pious soul and through the kind and cruel masters, whether he was loved or unloved, he always did his best and struggled to do his duty faithfully and completely. He was humble and timid and it was heart warming to hear him speak of always having to try his best and serve his master well. It was so sad at times when he thought of his mother and when he pictured aloud what he had seen other poor horses go through. This book brings some tears but it is a truly wonderful book rooted deep in reality."},{"rating":"2","title":"My daughter is thrilled!","review":"My daughter was dying to find Black Beauty and since bookstores in our county all went bust we couldn't find it anywhere.

The gift card was glued flat to the ribbon. This is a sham. The owners and managers of Amazon should be punished. Me too for being so stupid. That's what Amazon takes me for, stupid. I deserve this crappy book. Oh yeah, I can return it. Yeah pay more money and waste more time. I'll take my loss. I was gonna save me a real life trip to the bricks and mortar Barnes & Noble store...Amazon not anymore. At least on Ebay you expect to be ripped off. On EBAY you take your chances and hope.

The horse seemed to accept that his life was to be controlled by humans (he never longed for days of roaming the wild prairie, for example) but he always wished that his masters be kind.Some were. Some were not. Sewell saw lots of cruelty toward horses and part of her reason for writing the book (as it says in the forward to this book) was to show the torment that many horses faced.I especially liked this version of the book, filled with illustrations of horse terms and places in London and depictions of complicated events in the story."},{"rating":"2","title":"a nice classic","review":"I love horses, and I saw the movie and liked it.

Blacks Tents is a chronicle of his periodic escapades, (which spanned a total of twenty-six years) migrating, hunting, raiding, feasting, and starving amidst the Ruala tribe. Certainly, no modern writer better captured the essence of the vanishing nomadic Arab culture in such nostalgic and wistful terms. Among the many interesting segments found in the book is an account of the only know meteorite shower to have caused human casualties.

Unfortuately, I was wrong.Sound quality was pretty good but, in order to achieve that quality you have to get the earpiece firmly in your ear. This is where my pain came in! The hard earpiece had to be lodged in my ear in such a way that, after about five to ten minutes, I had to take it out because of discomfort. While I did use it I tested the microphone by leaving myself voice mail messages both at home and on my cell phone. The sound quality was poor.

Most pathetic moment: the nude scene. Basically an alien takes her top off; \\"Look upon them as you ponder the remainders of your worthless little lives.\\" or something to that effect. Justification: \\"When (this alien race) shows you their breasts, it's a death sentence.\\" ugh. Watch for the Leprachuan (noted for being tiny) balloon up to about 50 feet at the climactic end.

The movie is good because of the camera angles and origanalism. \\"12 Monkeys\\" is like a wierder, better, cookier \\"The 5th Element.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"More movies could be that well done.","review":"Even though the movie is loosely based on the French \\"La jete,\\" it does not really matter. \\"12 Monkeys\\" is more creative; it takes a different aspect of the original story and adds to it a more twisted plotline. Don't be discouragerd it the movie makes no sense at first. Watch it again and the meanings will speak themselves to you. Appreciating this flick will be those who like the grotesque and the bizarre as presented in many cinematographic successes of the late 1980s and 1990s. Enjoy, explore and be amazed. The acting is actually better than what can be expected from a second rate performers who starred in either weird (Stowe) or beat-me-up action idiocies (Willis)."},{"rating":"2","title":"good movie, great DVD","review":"Excellent quality DVD, with some great extras.

I saw it a few years ago and wanted to view it again maybe even a couple of times since it is so strange.

Two weeks ago I watched the new Blu-ray version and loved it even more. And the bonus features were excellent as well. I can't remember seeing them all before. On this film, I've always enjoyed the writing, casting, directing, acting, special effects, production values, (you name it) and now it's a good Blu-ray. It has replaced the old DVD version in my \\"All-Time Hits\\" collection!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Another peak for Bruce","review":"Bruce Willis has some excellent movies (Pulp Fiction, Nobody's Fool, Die Hard) some pretty good movies (Striking Distance, Sixth Sense, The Whole 9 Yards) and some awful movies (Hudson Hawk, Last Man Standing, Blind Date.) This sci-fi thriller is one of his better ones, albeit not the best. It probably does qualify as one of Brad Pitt's best movies, though. Good Sci-fi, great plot twists, interesting characters. Definately worth watching."},{"rating":"2","title":"Captivating","review":"My brother bought the DVD because it had Bruce Willis in it. I don't think he really liked it, but I found it fascinating.

I was very impressed by it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not For Every One","review":"I personally am an afficionado of sci-fi flicks;especially ones dealing with time travel or the theories and probabilities involved with it ! This film is not for those with short attention spans or who hate to figure out certain story details for themselves. You must pay VERY (and I do stress very) close attention to the timeline and details of this movie for it jumps in and out with the blink of an eye. If you don't from the beginning, then you are already lost my friends ! Just what are the Twelve Monkeys you ask ? I will not tell, for it is the basis of the film. It is part sci-fi, part thriller, part action, and major SUSPENSE !Excellent casting and acting with Willis, Pitt, and Stowe.Pitt's looney tune role is superb and believable. Willis' character being literally pulled apart mentally and physically from one timeline to the next is chilling and mesmerizing. Do not compare it to other time travel films or sci-fi movies; This one is in a class of it's own !"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic!","review":"I waited so long to get this and I don't know why?

The crazy scenes are so realistic. This movie does alot of switching back and forth, and you must pay attention to the whole movie to keep up. But they cleverly entwine all scenes into one masterpiece. Definitly worth adding to your collection..A+++++++++++++"},{"rating":"2","title":"Time Travel Monkey Style","review":"This movie was full of surprises and some really great acting. My only complaint is with some of the science. Consider the scenes in 1990. Kathryn had a deja vu of events that take place in 1996. This leads us to believe that all time (1990, 1996, 2030, etc) occurs simultaneously. The movie also has the premise that events can not be changed (Cole says many times that the virus can't be prevented). But, small events are changed. For example, Cole causing bruises on a policeman and kills two bums. Why is it not permissible for large events be changed (e.g., stopping the virus from being released)? If the past was indeed set in concrete, then the only acceptable thing that Cole and the other time travelers could do would be to observe and not interact. That is why I give this 4 stars instead of 5. Otherwise, it was a great movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Yup. No monkeys. Stellar performances. Awesome movie.","review":"Once in a while you get a sci-fi movie that's really science fiction, that challenges your mind, that forces you to think about reality, and that, in addition, is brilliant filmmaking as well. 12 Monkeys is one such movie. Willis and Pitt five excellent performances, and the flashes between future and present keep you engrossed. The constant fake-outs to sway the viewer into thinking Cole is just another psycho work, even though you don't want to believe them. Every little clue is heartstopping. Well, sure, I guess Madeleine Stowe's performance wasn't all that impressive, but it passed. The world should know by know that Bruce Willis is an actor, not some dumb action hero like Arnold, or Steven Seagal, or Van-Damme, who never succeed in other roles. This is an incredible movie, folks. See it now, or the Army of the 12 Monkeys shall be upon you. Argelfraster."},{"rating":"2","title":"Surprisingly good job by hack Pitt","review":"Of course, anyone could act nutso on screen/stage...it's not difficult.But I have to give the man his due...after watching some of his perfectly awful acting jobs (Thelma and Louise, Legends of the Fall, etc.), Pitt finally did a good job.Of course, Willis and Stowe were simply amazing as usual. And former Python Gilliam rocked as always.Bravo!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Gripping Sci-Fi Intrique!","review":"Science Fiction with time travel and deadly world of germs actually keeps your attention. This is a film that features Bruce Willis (as time traveler from the year 2035) and Brad Pitt (an insane son of a rich influential scientist).The movie works on all fronts despite a bizarre plot. Terry Cole (Bruce Willis) is a prisoner in the year 2035, where all earthlings must live underground to escape a deadly plague on the earth's surface. Terry is asked to travel back in time to the month before the germs were released and try to change the future. He ends up in a insane asylum in 1990 the first trip. His psychiatrist, Katherine Railly and a friendly inmate Jeffrey Goines (Brad Pitt) are his main contacts and he feels that they may help him find the clues to the epidemic that killed 5 billion people in 1997.Original intrigue keeps the audience interested and involved with the surprise ending. Food for thought in our time of worry about pandemics."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Splendid Horror Film","review":"This is one of the most intense visual experiences of the '90's, with Gilliam fusing medieval and futuristic imagery to form a frightening vision of all time merged into one terrifying present. This is one of Willis' best performances, one that should be well noted before some critic dismisses him yet again as just another action-movie hero. Willis practically bleeds humanity as the unwilling prophet of doom. He captures that rarest quality, one that most actors can't do--humility. David Morse is quietly chilling as the angel of death. If the film has one flaw, it's the lack of comedy that infuses most Gilliam films. As I get older, I need a little humor to accompany my apocalyptic despair. This one *will* give you nightmares."},{"rating":"2","title":"An extrodinary vision of crossroads in human life","review":"This is one of my favorite movies of all time. Terry Gilliam's vision of the world is very provocative and intriguing. The acting is great, the story is excellent, and this is probably Brad Pitt's best performance ever. I have both DVD versions - with and without DTS soundtrack. However, the non-DTS collector's edition has a glitch - when you press 'menu' key on the DVD remote during watching a documentary about the making of '12 Monkeys', the DVD player freezes and you have to shut it down, in order to return to the movie. I've tried this on 2 discs - mine and the other one, that I've rented from the video store. I have plenty of DVDs, and this is the issue with this particular movie. If someone had similar experience, please post the message, stating that. This way I know, that there's nothing wrong with my equipment. But again, the film itself is a real gem."},{"rating":"2","title":"12 Monkeys is Brad Pitt's best performance","review":"This is one of my favorite movies. I have seen it many many times. Brad Pitt deserved the Oscar for his performance. Im not a Pitt fan, this is his only role I liked him in. He was outstanding. One of the best jobs by a supporting actor that I have seen.Willis was exceptional as well. I would say it was one of his best efforts, if not his best."},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic Sci Fi, Classic Willis","review":"Excellent movie that should be on any SCI-FI fans list of 'must see' movies. I'm a fan of Willis, but he did better than usual in this movie. The plot is well reasoned, and the acting is exceptional. The cinematography is excellent, and the scenes are all well designed and evocative."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Thoughtful","review":"When I saw this movie in the theaters, I thought it was going to be alot like Seven. Although they really weren't, it was still a very excellent, thoughtful movie. I would always recommend it to friends, so I finally decided I might as well buy it for myself instead of renting it so many times!"},{"rating":"2","title":"good","review":"a pretty good movie, good acting, great atmosphere. an earlier reviewer asked a couple of questions. one was how the psychiatrist recognized the Willis character? it was from the picture of the WW1 soldier, the one she shows Willis later on. the other was about the scientist on the plane. that's the scientist who comes back from the future to get the information about the virus. she can't stop the epidemic since the madman has already released the virus at the airport security check. she can only gather information to fight the disease in the future.and finally, i never knew madeleine stowe was such an attractive woman! yowsa-yowsa-yowsa!"},{"rating":"1","title":"worst movie","review":"This is one of the worst movies I've seen in a long time... It is terribly boring... I kept trying to stay awake through the whole movie.. About on half hour before it was over, I just couldn't handle it anymore... What a waste of time and life... BORING, BORING, BORING...."},{"rating":"1","title":"Less than it seems","review":"Can't touch the actor performances, but the story is more a competing morass of themes that leave the ending dead. There is no real convergence of meaning because the themes never come together. The psychiatric world is characterized accurately, especially in Dr. Railly's self-affirming statement to her supervisor.Cole never figures out what his flashbacks are all about, and at the last minute takes an about face to change the future he knows can't be done. What the time travel, psy-world, and animals rights activists have in common is unknown from start to end. Each of these themes aren't explored and converged to produce anything stimulating.Rent it if you're bored. A much better story and drama is The Fifth Element."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a Bluray quality","review":"I was dissapointed with the picture quality of this movie. This isn't a Bluray quality. Keep your DVD, if you have one, don't waste money by buying this movie on Bluray."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's Gilliam, so you know what it's like.","review":"Dystopian, but in an angry and pointless way. Great acting by a stellar cast. Brad Pitt should have won an Academy Award. But Gilliam ruined it with his trademark film noir style, bleak, sarcastic, and dull. Tediously dull. Cheap production values. And to call this science fiction insults all real science fiction movies. Avoid at all costs. Hang with some bums under an overpass in the winter and you'll have a sense of what you missed plus you will have a better time."},{"rating":"1","title":"12 Really Dumb Monkeys","review":"What a disappointment! It sounded like a good story.Man comes back from the future to save his world and almost goes mad. But in this movie it seemed that everyone had gone mad, or just dumb! The longer the movie ran, the more I wondered where everyone's sense had gone.Bruce Willis moves forward and back through time in a plot that seems so illogical that it becomes painful to follow. The threatening scientists from the future who force convicts into \\"volunteering\\" for certain death assignments to the past start singing \\"I found my thrill on blueberry hill\\" to Willis when he comes back for yet another time trek. Has he gone mad? No, I think its just the plot.Brad Pitt plays a spaced out manic mental patient with moves (and even lines) stolen from Dennis Hopper in Apocolype Now. Watch the two movies and you'll know exactly what I mean.Or don't watch 12 Monkeys and save yourself the frustration of this flick!"},{"rating":"1","title":"stunned with how bad this was","review":"I am amazed at anyone who thought this was a good movie. It was shallow and boring. There was nothing of any intellectual or thought provoking nature. I am always amazed at how people can be so enamored with pure drivel and then be totally bored when an in depth movie comes along. I would give it zero stars if I could."},{"rating":"1","title":"Warning!! Not a happy ending!","review":"If you are the type that likes happy endings, avoid this movie! Bruce Willis dies and he doesn't save the world, and the journey to this depressing conclusion is no fun at all. It reminded me of Arlington Road, where the terrorist uses the good guy to blow up the building at the end of the movie. Also, in this movie, the repetitive flashbacks to Bruce's airport dream were overdone. By the 3rd time, I was saying \\"I got it already\\", and by the 5th or 6th flashback I was ready to throw something at the screen. In the featurette, Terry Gilliam said that he thought he had managed to snooker the major studios into producing a \\"European art movie\\". He did, and I hate European art movies. On the other hand, if you like such things, you'll probably like the film. It was well acted."},{"rating":"1","title":"Low Quality.","review":"I'm a big movie nut. In this day's high-definition image and sound, quality makes a difference. But, I'm not overly concerned about quality. I give wide margins, especially for movies that were made before this recent HD movement.Except that this version of 12 Monkeys so lacks quality, that it actually inhibited my enjoyment of the movie. I remember seeing this movie in the mid-90s, and really liking it. It immediately went on my top 100 movie list. But, after seeing this version of it, it has dropped off my top 100 list.The low quality video and audio is so bad as to make you believe that the movie is more from 1975, rather than 1995. It makes the whole movie look like some made-for-TV movie, instead of a major motion picture that had critical acclaim when it was released.Buy the movie, but just not this version. Very disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"More Duel, Less Drool....","review":"Ok so Bruce looks fab naked and not afraid to slobber in every scene and act barbaric, guess those goons from the future will do that to ya... the whole timeline is absurd, conflicting, and arbitrary so I assume the confusion masks the weak script... the long protracted chase scenes were unbearable and just wanted to see more action and lead flying.... a Brad Snatch teaser imho, coulda done w/o his input but a headliner nonetheless... Madeline looks gorgeous as a blond and Bruce with a wig is hot! incessant discomfort, discord and disorientation makes for commercial yearning.... GEICO! ;}}"},{"rating":"2","title":"time travel at its near best","review":"This film takes place in a world where as knowledge knows it, the non-human animals have taken over the world, as you watch the film you will realize this, and many other great twists of the film. It was a very great film with some great themes of time travel, such as changing the past will alter the future, and sometimes it is who you least expect it. I don't wish to ruin the film for those who haven't seen it so I leave it off here"},{"rating":"2","title":"To watch not once, not twice....maybe more than a few times","review":"Really great....this is one of those several-times-watched movies of mine (and there's not many of those). This is the type of movie you watch, and then invite your friends over to watch, simply to see and hear their reaction, and then discuss it with them. A whole new respect for Brad Pitt's acting and adaptability to roles emerged after this movie, as well as thorough appreciation for both Willis and Stowe and the way they carry they carry thier roles out, and infuse the film with their presence. See this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Essential Sci-fi Movie","review":"This is one of the essential Sci-fi movies I think. Here you can see all the classics dilemmas on this kind of movies, and specially, how baddly could be the human.Also you can see how could be some time travel dilemma, how someone came from the future could change his own past and his own future.It's not a sweet movie but anyway you could enjoy it."},{"rating":"1","title":"One of the worst movies ever made","review":"Absolutely one of the worst movies ever made in any genre. The \\"plot\\" verges on incomprehensibility, which is actually OK since you do not know and do not care for any of the characters.The phrase \\"12 Monkeys\\" actually appears to apply to the people who wrote and directed this stinker."},{"rating":"1","title":"One Hour Enough","review":"I only watched one hour of this movie. After an hour, I stopped it and tossed it into the garbage. It was long enough for me to realize that I just didn't care about the story; I didn't care about the characters; I hated the background music (it was annoying, repetitive--I'm sure there was an artsy reason for making it this way); there was not one scene, not one thread in the film that made me want to know what was going to happen. I didn't even think the acting was all that good. I wanted to like this film, but it was just a waste of time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't even bother","review":"This movie bites.There were not 12 kung fu masters like the title implied.

Don't even bother watching it."},{"rating":"1","title":"avoid this movie","review":"I was searching through Amazon for some different kind of movies to watch - saw this had almost 5 stars - WHY ?! The acting is fine and Brad Pitt plays a great insane person, but the movie itself is HORRENDOUS. And I wasted 2 hour of my life (2:05 to be exact) to watch Bruce Willis time jump a bunch of times to build up a somewhat complicated plot spoiler alert!!!) just to see him FAIL TO STOP THE VIRUS IN THE END ?! So what was the point of making the movie ? This was worse than just having the bad guy win, the entire plot for the first 2 hours of the movie was to build up on how they were going to stop it, just to see in the end - they don't ?! AVOID THIS MOVIE AT ALL COST."},{"rating":"1","title":"You call this a movie?!?!?!","review":"Sorry guys, but this movie(?) was an absolute bore. Both Willis and Stowe have made some good movies, both before and after this piece of crap, but c'mon!!! I've seen better acting during high school plays. This ludicrous film should be avoided at all costs unless you're suffering from insonmia and need something to put you out for the night. 12 Monkeys. One can't help but wonder if that's the name of the movie, or if that's who wrote the script."},{"rating":"1","title":"Brad was the only hilight","review":"I thought I was going to be watching a very special movie based on all of the hype and reviews. I wasn't looking for a Die Hard movie and had no real expectations beyond what I mentioned. I was really disappointed with how disjointed it was and to be quite honest, the lousy acting. The only real joy was Brad Pitt. I don't normally consider myself a Pitt fan, and, I didn't realize he was actually in it. He stands out in this move where I think Bruce essentially mailed it in."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gilliam's Masterwork","review":"This movie is excellent! The story is convoluted, the ending leaves you wondering what's real and what's not: and that's what makes it a classic. You're not going to find the typical Hollywood trash here. (Thank goodness) Great film, great DVD, great buy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very well done.","review":"Great acting, great script, great direction, great everything. Brad Pitt and Bruce Willis show that yes, they can act well. I still think Pitt deserved the Oscar for his role. And how come Willis was automatically looked over for what was obviously his best performance ever? It does get a bit confusing at times, but if you watch it once or twice, you'll get it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A new classic","review":"This movie has many twists and turns and is at times somewhat confusing. It is remarkable however, that it all comes together and makes perfect sense in the end. 12 Monkeys has an element of sci-fi which is necessary for the plot, hover the focus of the film is on the action, drama and suspense that combine in a way that is reminiscent of classics such as Hitchcock's Vertigo (of which a small clip can be seen in 12 Monkeys) Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"may have to watch it twice to enjoy","review":"This is definitely a movie that needs to be watched from start to finishe with no interruptions. I really did not like this movie years ago when it first came out, but I decided to watch the movie again.

Blow mind! Not for those who are conservative in loving and appreciating art!

It has quite a few defects just during normal playback, and the additional content is exactly the same as it is on the DVD... which looked bad on the original, and looks TERRIBLE now.Unfortunately, there aren't many HD DVDs to choose from yet, but having your expectations set at a reasonable level can't hurt. :/ I suspect this one will be like the first Tron DVD release, and coming out a ways down the road (assuming the format survives) to compare against newer releases."},{"rating":"2","title":"This was an interesting tell all book.","review":"I thought this book was as good as any other Deathlands book. I enjoyed reading about Ryan and J.B. in the early years. I was really surprised about Doc being in the book. But it answered the question about why Doc always carries those two balls with him. It also explains how Trader received his rad poisoning. For anyone that read Pilgramage From Hell they would now know what happened with Trader. I have read every book by James Axler and there has not been one book I've been disappointed with. The only disappointment with this book was it being to short of a story. I hope to read more books on the Trader in the future."},{"rating":"1","title":"A let down","review":"After waiting for well over a year to read this novel, and being hyped about it, I found that it was a serious let down. The story was sub-standard and poorly written. The villians were stereotypical card board cut outs. The situation was just another standard back stabbing fight for survival. But the worst thing is that there were two major mistakes in the first 60 pages. I won't tell you what they are but suffice to say I almost put the book down and couldn't continue. However, the last part of the book, the section dealing with the birth of the series was just incredible. That section gets a five out of five from me. And after 12 years we finally get a chance to see what Trader looks like."},{"rating":"1","title":"A missed opportunity","review":"What could have been a great chance to tell the story of Trader and the war-wag days has been squandered, resulting in a decidedly sub-par Deathlands novel. Serious inaccuracies, some poor writing and a pretty lame plot threaten to make this book almost not worth buying. The bit that really does make it worth buying has nothing to do with the story at all. Right at the end of the book there are essays on the birth and evolution of the Deathlands saga. They really should have made the entire book like this, it's totally fascinating stuff.Treat the story as nothing more than a folk tale and not part of the Deathlands canon and you might be able to put up with its failings. All I hope is that if someone tries something similar in the future, and I hope they do, that they put a bit more effort and thought into it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Much ado about nothing.","review":"We the loyal fans of the Deathlands saga, were let down. The story was only about 200 pages, the story was rushed. Axler or whomever should read their books.The way we know the trader, was not the way he was depicted in this story. Where was his infamous quotes, none were present in this story. Plus he gets poisoned, just like a \\"rube.\\" The story should have been 348 pages then do the history of Deathlands and Outlanders.I enjoyed the extras, but the story was bad. they fit everything into 348 pages.

Oh, the ending lets the world know that for unsaved folk the joke will be on them if they don't get it together. And the best part is the book shows exactly how anybody can get it together.

The buffoonery begins (still on the first CD by the way) when Zakiyya comes home from college and her old school friends want to take her out to a seafood buffet to eat. They begin to tell her how to, ummm, how shall I say it? expel her bowels so that she can eat more.

I wanted to like it so much. I love Christian fiction, I read it regularly. This however, was amateur at best. There was little to no character development. The story line is rushed an underdeveloped. It was like on one side of the page she was in high school, on the next; in college, on the next; graduating, on the next; getting married. I'm exaggerating a little, but there was little effort to develop the story lines in between, that it really feels that way. If the main character was experiencing something difficult, we barefly \\"felt it.\\" There were just surface words that alluded to a tough time.

It's a virtual remake of the first one (not that parts 2 and 3 weren't), and brings no amount of originality to the series. Even appearances by Matthew McConaughey and Renee Zellweger can't save this turkey from getting tossed to garbage pile. An over amount of campy humor doesn't help any either.If you haven't seen any of the TCM films, and you want to, just stick with the first one.

The atmosphere was not there, and the result was an artificial movie that just never got off the ground. Moreover, the acting was unconvincing (to put it kindly), especially Matthew McConnahay, who was poorly casted in his role, although he did try to pull it off. Because the movie was so poorly casted, the execution was terrible. The result is a generic movie that is lackluster and subpar in quality. \\"TCM-The Next Generation\\" lacks spirit, heart and charisma...it has no character and is deficient in every conceivable area. A very sad and disappointing addition to the series that has taken a nose-dive since the original classic."},{"rating":"1","title":"Highly Over-the-Top black comedy, Could have been better","review":"Outrageous black-humored remake of Tobe Hooper's 1974 horror movie features four teens in a car crash visiting a house where Leatherface and his insane family live,but all four die but it isn't Leatherface killing them it's Leatherface's crazy brother Vilmer killing only 2 teens while Leatherface kills one with a sledgehammer. The black-humor is the movie's redeeming value and this movie does feature some hilarious scenes like where Vilmer uses a remote control for his robotic leg,Leatherface yelling and screaming non-stop,and instead of eating people they have a pizza for dinner. A way,way over-the-top black comedy is watchable and a whole lot better than part 3 but only worth a rental but do not buy unless you seen it first."},{"rating":"1","title":"Incomprehensibly horrible","review":"As a fan of the first three films (for different reasons), I have to say that I am literally angry for having wasted 45 minutes of my life (I watched it at 2X after the first 15 minutes) with this horrible, horrible film.There isn't a single worthwhile moment here. The acting is beyond awful, there is NOTHING funny about it (and this coming from somebody who thinks Part 2 is the greatest black comedy ever), there is nothing scary about it, and they DECIMATE characters like Leatherface (who is reduced to a moaning transvestite that is incapable of murdering anybody) and GRANDPA. HOW DARE YOU B*ASTARDS EVEN HAVE GRANDPA IN A SCENE AND THEN HAVE HIM DO NOTHING?!?!?!?!I'm so angry I don't know where to begin. See #1 if you want to see a scary movie; see #2 if you want a black comedy (and the low point of Denis Hopper's career); see #3 if you just want to laugh at the crazy character Alfredo. This one is an abject disaster."},{"rating":"1","title":"One of the WORST horror films EVER!!!","review":"When I first heard of this movie, I was exicited. I was kinda disapointed when I learned that Tobe Hooper wasn't directing it, but I realized that it had the next best thing, which was Kim Henkel, co-writer of the orignal TCM. I was also interested in seeing two good actors (Matthew and Zellwegger) appear in a horror series which never really contained any big stars (besides Dennis Hopper).I thought that this had the making of a good sequel, but I was sadly,SADLY mistaken. This movie is terrible. Surprisely, the acting is horrible, and the plot is stupid. This not just an awful movie, but it's just so disappointing too. I expected too much, I guess. This movie is easily the worst of all the TCM sequels. And that is not a good thing because all the sequels are bad as well"},{"rating":"1","title":"A Decent Plot but a Bad Movie","review":"First of all, I have not seen any of the other TCM movies, but with Renee Zellweger and Matthew McConaughey I figured I would watch it. Of course there were the typical horror movie moments...group of friends get stranded, many chase/fight scenes, the girl running (Renee Zellweger) trips and falls alot, she runs up the stairs instead of out the door, ect. Although I expected some of this, I think this movie tried so hard to be scary that it just wasn't. This movie also had bad acting, although Matthew McConaughey was very good. However, I am giving two stars because it was fun to see Renee and Matthew in this movie together, and I thought the story line was okay, but maybe if they had different actors or a different director it would have been better."},{"rating":"2","title":"different","review":"a goodyet weird movie i loved this movie im a huge huge huge fan of the chainsaw series the only thing i didnt like about thismovie letherface as a drag queen although he does humerous things sometimes and has some good chainsaw scenes hes stupid. matthew is very disturbing as vic the house crazy with a mechanicalleg and a girlfriend he abuses he cusses alot hits poor jenny to death while spitting on her thats a sick and pinful scene to watch he sets girls hair on fire hags them on meat hook hit them to death torture to death and grandpa has a tenny role and he looks alot younger and can walk! another thing i dont like is a mysterious man named rowan who seems to be the boss and has rings on his stomace.verey intense torture scene a pint of blood is barley seen the family members are ok theres a funny know it all name w.t or something like that. a different and disturbing sequel men dressin as women"},{"rating":"1","title":"What happend to you Leatherface you used to be beautiful?","review":"This movie is an insult to the TCM series.First off their is on good acting in this movie.Also their is no suspence what so ever.And the most important thing is they made Leatherface a cross dressing freak whos afraid of his own family.Dont be tricked by the cover the killer is not a women.

There's far more weird humor in this one than anyone could have expected. It's shockingly funny and contains gags (pardon the pun) that only Chainsaw fans would appreciate. The pizza gag is a funny follow-up to a line from part 3. The spoken word intro is a great commentary on parts 2 and 3. Leatherface even resumes his cross-dressing from the original Texas Chainsaw Massacre. There are some great cameos too. All of this means that this wouldn't be the best Chainsaw for newbies to start with. Those expecting straight serious horror also may not appreciate it at first. Next Generation is a playful parody of the Chainsaw movies that's obviously not intended to be taken too seriously."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'm sorry but huh?","review":"A family of backwoods hillbilly a-holes terrorize a group of prom kids and one of them chases the kids around with a chainsaw.

This one isn't about gore. It's about torture still (and that's really what Texas Chainsaw Massacre is about) but a more psychological horror (for the victims). It's hard to explain because it's really creative how twisted the characters can be without much gore. There is a lot of disturbing dialog; and that's the huge difference people either don't like or understand. They even may not like this movie because the characters are truly nasty in this way lol. There's also a bit of more explanation as to who these people actually are in this film (I won't spoil it though because it's really funny how you discover the reference-just look for it).

Just when you think it can't get any stupider, or weirder, it does. The whole thing makes very little sense.

This movie is nothing but crap! They tried to let us see a different side of the family, but they were far from succeeding.

If you ask me that sounds a little bitter.Really, if your into a movie full of excessive violence at the expense of plot (Hey aren't we all?) Then pick this film up. It's not much for anything else.I think the only thing this movie had going for it is:1.) Renee Zelwegger getting brutalized constantlyand2.) Mathew McConaughey getting hit in the face with an airplane prepeller.Other than that, it doesn't have much else... No wait!! It also stars Robert Jacks! Who we all remember played the club owner in that movie Slacker....... Okay okay, I pulled that IMDB.. But still.. ROBERT JACKS!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Are you kidding me?","review":"At first I was no fan of the origional, but now i enjoy it a lot, and the remake is a fun time, but this..!!!

It is an insult and a disgrace to the good name that is the original. It is banal and pointless, and watching the scenes it stole from the from the original make you feel like an idiot for ever thinking they were scary.

Director Tobe Hooper does not return for the final movie probably realising the film's future had run it's course.From the reading of the title, you can't expect much from The Next Generation. We already know it's going to be a basic rehash of the first and that there will be no plot continuity whatsoever. The only thing this film offers is the dishy Matthew McConaughey as one of the crazed generation. and also the beautiful Renee Zellwegger as the hapless victim.This is one of those films you will see at 3 o clock in the morning which is probably a good thing considering how weak and pathetic the film is.

What I don't like about all the sequals is that you have all new characters and you have no idea who they are. If you seen parts 2/3/4 you would think Part 1 was terrible too. Part 1 is by far the scarriest movie I have ever seen in my entire life! Part 4 was made in 1994 but wasn't even released till 1998 because no one wanted to see this garbage!! horrible horrible movie...I saw it once and that was enough for me.

Bad acting (Now I understand why Matthew McConaughey tried to stop its release). Very bad writing, and bad direction. Leather Face was just stupid. There was no suspence, no sitting on the edge of your seat, no anything. Some movies are so bad that you just laugh at them...this went beyond that, I wanted to cry. One more thing.

Again, young folks are attacked by a backwoods family of bizarros. Henkel updates the story from 1974, and throws in some new elements, but this mess never gets off the ground.

How could such a confused and confusing web page have come to on Amazon? For shame!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible view of the English Civil War","review":"I bought 2 copies of this program accidently because I thought they were both different. One on amazon.co.uk and the other on amazon.com. They haven't yet made a decent program of this war, not that it's a very interesting war, but it's odd that no one is prepared to make a docmentary about the only republican government in England and the only civil war if you don't count the war of the roses, which was more a dynastic struggle. Please someone in England I know it's a banned subject, but can you make a program about this war worth watching."},{"rating":"2","title":"bobby blue bland greastest hits","review":"outstanding service delivery service, wraped excellent, the old school music goes back, when life was sweet, every one had ajob who wanted to work."},{"rating":"2","title":"Greatly enjoyed","review":"I received this book for a Christmas present several years ago (I believe I was 13). Even now, I still find myself frequently picking it up and glancing over its many pages.Many buildings are simply represented, and because of this overwhelming variety, the book serves as an excellent introduction to those who feel lost in the immense world of architecture (like me). The written portions describing the buildings are very concise, giving you adequate backround information and description. Photographs are on the smaller side, taking up half a page, but are well-chosen and give a \\"feel\\" to the writings.I still find quite a thrill in flipping through its many pages, viewing the great variety of architectual works contained within it.Greatly enjoyed, and extremely edifying! Buy it for anyone who shows the slightest inkling of an interest in architecture. It will fascinate any creative mind."},{"rating":"1","title":"terrible","review":"These nails didn't come in the original box, the box was double size and the nails were in a big plastic bag, literaly in a heap.

Dramatic, enticing, eloquent, heart-wrenching, beautifully tragic. What more can I say? Yu Watase does push some emotional buttons here, taking her well-developed characters to the max and putting them in situations that show their true colors(especially Yuhi...read the book, and you'll see what I mean). If you've seen the anime and think you don't need to read the manga, you're completely wrong...So much was left out of the tv series...The characters really are taken to a whole new level(especially Shuro,in my opinion(but that's another book, not this one...).

The war, ostensibly about religion, but, as usual, really just about aristocratic power conflicts, especially between the Hapsburgs and the Boubons. The war redrew borders and cemented Europe politics until WW1. Written in the 1930's by a woman historian, it is a difficult read with 500 pages of endless political intrigue. I enjoyed it, but it's only for those seriously interested."},{"rating":"2","title":"recommended but with one intolerable flaw","review":"This book provides a fine overview of the subject and I recommend it. However, it is burdened with the infuriating weakness of presenting untranslated French, German, and Latin phrases within a book that is published for English-speaking readers. If I were an editor I would not tolerate it. First, the author is not justified in assuming that English-speaking readers have her command of foreign languages. For example, those of us who study science tend to know less in this area than those in the humanities. Two languages, maybe, but we seldom speak or write a third. Second, it is an inappropriate demand on the reader's time to translate these blocks of text for themselves. I did so, but I was as mad as Hell for having to take the time to overcome the author's carelessness."},{"rating":"2","title":"An excellent summary of a difficult war","review":"I finished this book on Dec. 21, 1968, and have never found a better book on the 30 Years War. I read 50 books in 1968 and this work won my \\"best book read this year\\" award. The book is full of little touches that make it more than a history, e.g.: concerning the monument to Gustavus Adophus' greatest victory, Breitenfeld: \\"The monument still stands, set back from a quiet country road in the shade of a line of trees. Three centuries have smoothed every scar from that placid landscape...\\" or these words on the death of Ferdinand II: \\"On February 15(1637)at 9 in the morning his body and soul parted one from the other, the one to moulder in the vaults of Graz, the other to receive the reward for which he had laboured so long...\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Machiavellian machinations","review":"This is the best single-volume account of the Thirty Years War(1618-1648). The war was very complex but Wedgwood provides singularclarity. Other interpretations are possible, but her vision is strongand memorable. The Machiavellian machinations are head-spinning, one hasto read carefully, the reward is a solid understanding of not only17th C dynastic politics but how Medieval politics operatedbefore the rise of the nation state.Wedgwood is an old-fashioned historian like Gibbon, retelling the eventsin highly-readable prose, focused on the \\"great men\\". This can beproblematic, the Thirty Years War was more than just the decisions madeby a few elites - social, economic and other forces were at work. Hersources are almost all 19th century. There are no new insights on thewar, it is a retelling of established views. As a political narrative itis not only a great work of history but also literature."},{"rating":"2","title":"As a spiritual history","review":"This book is a rewarding journey into a spiritual world that I (and I think most of us) want to believe exists, yet we have trouble holding in awareness for any extended period. Robert Haynes gives us all a work that holds its fixation on this spiritualism and holds us as readers there in amazement. For this, and for this alone, the Grand Unified Theory is a wonderful work of art. Haynes skillfully carries his reader up, up, and up....and holds him/her there for the duration of an exalting read. Since there is no such thing as a Grand Unified Theory in science, there may be the inkling of one in our hearts, and this books gives us a glimpse."},{"rating":"2","title":"Incredible","review":"Simply wonderful!

To make matters worse, the instructions are totally, utterly and completely worthless. I am a college educated professional, and after one hour screwing around with this watch, I finally threw up my hands in frustration and returned the damn thing to Wal Mart where I bought it. Nobody can understand the directions, and it's impossible to figure it all out because the instructions that came with the watch are so poorly written. Nobody, not even my watch repair guy, can figure out how to set this stupid piece of crap. Furthermore, the icons in the digital window are so tiny you will need a very good magnifying glass just to see them and try to figure it out. I do not recommend this watch to anybody.

Chapman has the rare ability to strike a golden balance between theory and practice, and between rigour and informality, such that the theoretical actually illuminates the practical. His discussion on power transformers is the best I have seen anywhere, and he maintains that same high quality throughout the book. Along the way, he has even managed to correct a subtle misconception that I had held for several years concerning Lenz's law. The print quality is superb and the diagrams are sharp and clear. I would like to answer a comment that another reviewer had against this book, namely, that this book uses log or semilog scales. I think we should be grateful that Mr. Chapman had the good judgment to use log or semilog scales, or else we are going to have a book that is hundreds of miles long and wide!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good","review":"The internet is the way to go for college text books.

To understand it you should have some knowledge of electric machinery and then this could be considered as a complement to that.

I was very much looking forward to receiving the book, largely based on the other reviews. But when I got it, I was disappointed enough that I actually returned it. Already a believer in the importance of fantasy play, I felt Gussin Paley was preaching to the choir, and I wasn't interested in only reading transcripts from children's fantasy play. The book is very thin to begin with, but without the transcripts there wouldn't be enough to form a book.

Perhaps I would be better off ordering the Tools of the Mind book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dramatic play book!","review":"Used this in a college class about play!

The thing is VERY light, which should be a good thing but I felt it moving every time I did. Finally the darn thing just fell apart. One minute I am talking...I get home, tell my friend I will call him back, I disconect it from my phone and go to take it off my ear to find that the receiver bit is still in my ear!!!

However, it has a piece that fits behind your ear, so it doesn't just fall out, like plain ear buds do (I must have funny shaped ears, because I just can't get those to stay). I will admit, the first one I owned did fall apart (the rubber ring came off the earbud and wouldn't stay when I put it back together), but I chalked it up to my fooling around with it and trying to add other parts to the ear bud to make it more comfy. So I bought another, left it as-is, and I've loved it. I have owned other behind-the-ear headsets, but none is as comfortable.As to sound quality, I've never had problems hearing the other person and I've never had complaints that they can't hear me when I'm wearing this headset.In all, once you find the trick to keeping it on and then leaving it alone, it'll stay on for HOURS.

Most of the songs on this album are not enjoyable for listeners over the age of 20. 'Only the Loot Can Make Me Happy' is a rediculous remake of Surface's 'Only You Can Make Me Happy'. At least the Surface version was based on emotion, not materialism."},{"rating":"2","title":"IT'S SO SMOOTH","review":"We have waited for so long, but finally here it is: one fine piece of art.

Everything sounded like everything else."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great album- well worth a listen","review":"I have to say that this album surprised me- 'When a Woman's Fed Up', 'Home Alone' and 'I Believe I Can Fly' certainly make the most of what this man has to offer. 'The Opera' seems more like a joke than a song though. This is R&B at it's very best- quality tunes and a quality voice & rap talent. Probably it's biggest downfall is that a few songs sound similar, but it's still a brilliant album. Don't miss this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"PLEASE!!!!!","review":"I have total disrespect for someone who swears that God is in their lives, do an article (Ebony) about the change in their life and then turn around and do a CD that describe their lust for money.

I had much more respect for him as a person then."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Double CD Album by R.Kelly , NOT HIS BEST-3.5 STARS.","review":"With The R. Album, R.Kelly introduce himself as the R&B King of the Soul music. This Album has great music in both CD\`s BUT the only problem is that there are some filler tracks in the Second CD. Those Songs are: \\"2nd Kelly\\", \\"Ghetto Queen\\", \\"Down Low Double Life\\"(How many remixes he has to do), and the Weak Song\\"Dancing with A Rich Man\\". BUT, THE REST OF THE ALBUM IS JUST MASTERPIECE SONGS.THE BEST R.KELLY ALBUM AND THE BEST ALBUM EVER MADE IS \\"TP-2.COM\\" AND THEN \\"R.KELLY\\"(SELF TITLE ALBUM).BUT THIS is ANOTHER CLASSIC BY KELLY SO GET IT, IS GREAT."},{"rating":"1","title":"would have been stronger single","review":"though r kelly is a talented song-writer,arranger and producer this two disc set is one to many.home alone,if i could turn back the hands of time and a few more songs make the cut.but it becomes more excess than substance.and way to many guests."},{"rating":"1","title":"He could've done a much better job!!!!","review":"To make a DOUBLE cd is one thing, but to make a MEDIOCRE double cd is sad!!! The only songs I really listen to are \\"If I Could Turn Back the Hands of Time\\" (the best song on the album) and \\"Get Up on a Room.\\" Most of the other songs are fast-forward material.

Kelly","review":"This album is another example of how artists want to go platinum easily by double CDing their album. There are songs that sound good and others that don't.

It is clearly the best song on this CD. R Kelly's new album is very diverse he goes from having a slow song with Celine Dion to singing the chorus on a song with Cam'ron, Noreaga and Jay-Z,(\\"We Ride\\"). Continuing R Kelly's tradition of well crafted songs is \\"When A Woman's Fed Up\\", which summarizes what's going on in a relationship when it's about to end. If R Kelly would have made this a single CD, I would have given him 5 stars, but you have to admit there are about 5-10 songs he could have left off this CD. \\"If I Could Turn Back...\\", \\"Spendin' Money\\", \\"When A Woman's Fed Up\\", and \\"One Man\\" make up for any failures. You make em, I buy em. You produce em, I buy em. The Sparkle album is also tight. Get Yours!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Cd put out by RKelly, very moving","review":"This CD is the best I have heard in awhile.

Kelly fan from the first time that I saw him on star search. His music is rich, filled with emotion and smoove beats. His fourth CD like the other three are nothing less than what would be expected of R. Kelly. He keeps it real!!!! The question of whether or not he is down with Kirk Franklin should not matter(no one can really judge you, but GOD). I understand that he is giving his audience what they want to hear, and if secular music sells then he has to do what he has to do, to pay the bills. He has to make a living just like everybody else, but most importantly IT IS ONLY ENTERTAINMENT!!!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"R. KELLY HAS REALLY GROWTH AND DIVERSITY ON THIS CD","review":"I LOVED IT. I'M NOT A BIG FAN UP RAP; HOWEVER I DID ENJOY HIS COLLABORATIONS WITH, KEITH MURRAY, CAMERON AND FOXY BROWN.

I WAS LISTENING TO THIS CD AT WORK AND I HAD TO LEAVE BECAUSE I GOT SO EMOTIONAL. HE ALSO HAS A BEAUTIFUL BALLAD WITH CELINE DION.

The first reason is because i like the lyrics and secondly because it sounds damn good for the strip clubs for the male strippers to entertain the women with. For the ladies, trust me on this one, it comes from the experience. Secondly, he has made a well organized cd collection which was well produced."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why 2 CDs?","review":"First of all, everything ran together, I felt like I was listening to the same song over and over. He got down on When a Woman's fed up and the cut with Keith Murray, but other than that, straight garbage!"},{"rating":"2","title":"It's good","review":"When I first bought this cd, I thought I had thrown away 20 bucks, but I've had it for almost a year now, and I think it's pretty good. Kelly is able to blend the hip-hop style with his smooth singing though some of his slow flowing songs are somewhat repititive. Home Alone, Only the Loot, We Ride, and Did you ever think are strong hip hop tracks while spending money, ecetra, turn back hands.., are smooth tracks. I'm your Angel, Looking for Love, and the I believe I can fly are also very good songs. You can almost listen to cd 1 straight through, but cd 2 may make you hit the track forward button a few more times."},{"rating":"1","title":"STRICTLY FOR THE CHARTS!","review":"I am so dissapointed that an artist with so much talent will put out garbage like this.Afer the release of the previous C.D.

Tom Berenger (jungle dude and sniper) and the other guy (a government twit sent along to pester Tom and cause all sorts of trouble, kind of like an armed George Stephanopolous) are sent to Panama to 'take out' a bad guy. The problem is Miller (government guy) doesn't seem to know much of anything and refuses to listen to someone who does (Berenger). After a while, this became annoying and I kept waiting for Tom to whack him over the head with something. Unfortunately, he never does. In a scene where they are sneaking through a barnyard, I was waiting for Miller to step on a chicken when he was walking backwards-SQUAWK!! Neat parts of the movie are when Tom Berenger disguises himself as a haystack and watching the Panamanian militia run through the jungle like a bunch of squirrels. I gave this movie 2 stars because you get to watch Tom Berenger."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sniper","review":"It was the DVD that I was looking for but I wanted it in widescreen.

Paul Stuart"},{"rating":"1","title":"WRONG ATTITUDE","review":"\\"Sniper\\" could have been a good movie, but because the lack of details like; You need equipment and supplies which results in heavy backpacks if your mission is lasting for some days or weeks. Your infiltration might have to be done by foot, and that demands a lot, especially in high snow wintertime. You get tired, wet and cold(in my area) from time to time. You might have to lay still, waiting for your target for several hours or days. Since details like that are kept away from the story, my experience is that the movie has resulted a lot of people signing up for selection without understanding the hard work it is. This results 90% \\"cowboys\\" signing up, and only 10% with the right qualities So it might be considered as good entertainment, but nothing else."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor","review":"Sometimes one (this one anyway) feels like some lightweight viewing. This is so lightweight that your television may have to be weighted down to stop it floating away. Now light-weightedness can go with good quality. Alas, in this case, it doesn't. The 1-D Mr. Berenger appears to possess two expressions, grim and grimmer, not to mention all the charisma of the average cornflake packet. The plot is feeble and unconvincing.The film does have one major selling point - it is vastly better than the staggeringly bad \\"Sniper II\\". I believe there's a \\"Sniper III\\". I'm already avoiding the shelves of DVD stores where it might be located, so as to avoid contamination in any way by it.My humble advice; save your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Should have bought only the first one.","review":"Sniper \\"one\\" is a good entertaining movie.

The dolby digital produced an ambience of jungle sounds that drew me into the movie's setting; much like the rain in Matrix. But be careful: this version has only dolby surround sound. Perhaps the best thing about the movie was not part of this deal. I was snookered, but only because I did not look closely enough at what I was buying.

Henty often uses a standard formula for his stories, but this one deviates by having two main characters and allows the reader to experience the great invasion and retreat from Russia from two angles.

Caught by the Yankee Navy, he masquerades as an abolitionist agent fighting the slave trade from within--and finds himself running slaves once again, this time north on the \\"Underground Railroad\\" to freedom.

There was even a plastic dress flange that fit inside the old flange (which was stainless) to color match the sink, and this even fit inside this new flange. Although I did not need to use the plastic flange, it does match the slightly off white appearance of the sink better then the pure white flange, so it looks like nothing ever change, except for a beast of a new disposal capability.I could not find this flange at any local retail places, and the local places did not even have a stainless extended flange, so thank you Amazon for have some fairly niche products!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Snap ring not included?","review":"Lost the snap ring to this Disposer and needed a new one.

I think really the only song I liked on this album was \\"Glory Be\\". the rest of the songs are just your typical 80s style songs. and the last song on this CD drives me crazy, I can't stand to listen to it.

I didn't hear Flash the first time round but bought this on the strength of the reviews they were getting on Amazon.I have not heard other Flash albums so I do not know if this CD truly represents the band , but if you give this four or five stars then I guess \\"Close to the Edge\\" by Yes has to get 20.Flash are definately progressive and that they sound like the first two \\"Yes\\" albums is self evident but is that enough. \\"Yes\\" improved well past these fledgling steps.Flash seems second division to me and the singer is less than convincing. Sometimes the lyrics are clumsy and really pretentious. With so much great music out there to discover I don't know why you would tether yourself to this.

And while I mostly agree with some of the social ranting, this just isn't good literature. It becomes tedious and tiresome and absurd - the run on sentences enough to choke a reader. In the past, I found Mr. Koontz' books to have a clever premise, to be thought provoking, and to have an \\"unable to put down\\" element. This one I put down quite easily. Actually, Dean Kartoontz seems to be the scary monster that is emerging - too great now for a critical editor that would chop this book in at least half? However ... if you wish to read something that is as tedious as listening in excruciatingly complete detail Grandma's latest surgery and the subsequent ill conceived complications and reverberations and protracted recovery, well, then this might be just the book for you!"},{"rating":"1","title":"This was the worst Koontz book! EVER!!!","review":"I have never thrown away a Dean Koontz book but last night I could not take it anymore! By Chapter 12 they were still riding around in Dylan's SUV, being chased by an invisible nobody and Jilly was still being an annoying, very dislikeable character.I knew I was not going to like this book when she was introduced with her plant \\"Fred.\\" Her pointless chattering drove me crazy. I was thinking to myself \\"Is Koontz for real?\\" And then after she meets Dylan, she continously tries to bait him into arguements and they talk about nothing for over half of the first 100 pages!!!!Please, if this was your first time reading one of his books, this was one of his worst, give him another chance. Try Fase Memory or my all time favorite, Intensity."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good read","review":"This was the first book I've read by Dean Koontz, so I can't compare it to his other works.

There were certain things in the book that could have been changed to make the story more believable, but overall this book was enjoyable."},{"rating":"1","title":"I've got to stop buying Koontz novels","review":"They're just so available. However, the plots just seem to get sillier and sillier. The \\"justice brigade\\" (or whatever they call themselves)? It's too cartoonish. Luckily I listened to the audio version and was able to get a lot of work done while it played in the background. Since the action moved so slowly -- including the incredibly tedious and copious conversations with Shep -- I could easily tune out periodically without missing anything. Just like you won't be missing much if you don't read the book at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Major disappointment","review":"In \\"By the Light of the Moon\\", Dean Koontz violates Elmore Leonard's rule of writing #10---\\"Try to leave out the part that readers tend to skip.\\" There is a lot that can easily be skipped.Once you strip away the redundancies and verboseness, you will find a pretty suspenseful cat and mouse thriller. However, you must abandon 100% of your disbelief.The plot is at its most interesting when the focus is on the nanotechnology computers.Two of the three protagonists are almost interesting, but the autistic brother is truly tedious. The villains are evil and easy to dislike.For true Koontz fans only---and some of them may have a problem with this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Couldn't even get halfway through","review":"I have read all but a few of Koontz's books over the past 10+ years and his writing is getting more and more formulaic and less interesting. He forces a kind of humor onto the characters that is embarrassing to read: he is totally off the mark with the humor and it left me groaning. I could only get through about 70 or 80 pages before returning it to the bookstore, but in those pages, the main female character was grinding me and I found her to be unbelievable as someone I would empathize with or tolerate for 400+ pages.Dean Koontz has continued to disappoint me with his last 3 or 4 novels. His previous release to \\"By the Light of the Moon\\" was an improvement over his two before that, but he is nothing like he was in his prime, with \\"Watchers,\\" \\"Strangers,\\" and others from the previous decade.All in all, I think I am done with Koontz, sad to say."},{"rating":"2","title":"a VERY good story!!","review":"Anyone of Dean Koontz's books are awesome and I recommend anything that he wrote but \\"By the Light of the Moon\\" first comes to mind. The story is not only very suspensful but very...deep. It gets better as you read and if you have a night to yourself then please read this book! Get yourself some hot chocolate and a blanket and you're set. :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Good Read","review":"Build, build, build. Koontz again demonstrates his uncanny ability to spin a quality yarn. The suspense built at a breakneck speed (literally at 100 mph+ in one scene). My heart raced along with Dylan as he flew down the interstate. Koontz is a master at keeping the reader just outside the margin of understanding without isolating him from the forward movement of the story. This combination makes for a truly exciting read! The ending was rather abrupt for me. While the wrap-up was satisfying, it seemed to move quickly from a black and gray suspense novel to a red, white, and blue comic book ending. It was an unexpected finish with a couple of clever twists, but left me wondering \\"Why did he end in such a way?\\"Of course, what can we expect from the master of suspense?Keep 'em comin', Mr. Koontz!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the best Dean Koontz","review":"I usually can't put his books down but this one I kept leaving. The lead characters weren't nearly as compelling as many of his others. For anyone who has never read Dean Koontz - please don't let this be your first! He is a terrific writer but this story just isn't as good as his other stuff. I trudged through this book wondering when would it end. Thankfully it wasn't very long."},{"rating":"1","title":"Most annoying","review":"The problem is this could have been a great story had Koontz's editor cut out about 1400 \\"where's the ice\\" lines and other annoying \\"Shep lines\\" at what could have otherwise been some suspensful moments. If this was not written by Koontz this story would have never been published. This was probably the most annoying story that I have listened to, (used BOT) and stayed with because just when it gets really, really annoying and you want to bail on it you also want to see what happens since you have so much time invested. The only advantage to reading it as opposed to listening to every single word, is that you could skim many, many sections as you read and that might make it tolerable."},{"rating":"1","title":"No Thanks!","review":"Simple review Not even close to one of Koontz's great,good or even readable novels. Love the author but as usual he didnt tie the ending to the book or even give the ending any time to develop. Also that Jilly charachter not only does she have big issues, she carries around a plant for company that she holds conversation with but i hate her apperance everytime shes in the book i had to skip over her dialouge if she wasnt arguing with Dylan she was saying something that just made me dislike her more. Ive never had a charachter in a book where everytime it was their turn with dialouge i cringed. Koontz what the hell is going on?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Koontz's book","review":"I have always enjoyed reading Mr. Koontz's books, they have such a sensitivity. But definitely my favourite one is By the Light of the Moon. I enjoyed this topic about new abilities and the fact that the characters face these new abilities with courage and trying always to do the best they can, they don't even struggle to use them for their own good or for evil...they just become heroes. But the best of this book is that the author shows these characters and the fact of having these new abilites from a funny and witty side."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Koontz yet","review":"As usual, Dean Koontz starts out strong, gets far-out ridiculous, and then ends it with the most dull, sappy ending. The characters in this story are also unremarkable and flat. To sum up, it stinks."},{"rating":"1","title":"A BIG YAWN!","review":"Koontz's typical silly amalgam of anti-government paranoia and right wing propaganda (the good guys are warm and kind to everyone and hate Alec Baldwin, the non-governmental bad guys take drugs and believe in global warming). Simplistic fiction with nothing redeeming nor exciting.A plant crossing over the USA? C'mon guys, there are several better authors than Mr Koontz in all over the USA. Give them a chance instead of praising this rubbish pot."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed...","review":"I am a big Koontz fan having read all of his books. By the Light of the Moon was a big disappointment. The story's well written, and its initial premise was very interesting. However, as it developed it became very cartoon like and seemed to better fit a comic book (X-Men to be specific) than a Koontz novel. It would have been much better had it followed the suspense angle of having been injected by something and trying to determine who, why and what than turn into a fantasy involving people that were really not very interesting. I'll continue to be a Koontz fan because I typically find his stories to be very interesting and well written. By the Light of the Moon is, however, not going to be one of my favorites. I was so looking forward to the next Koontz book too!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Desperately seeking plotline...","review":"Well, it has finally happened. Dean Koontz has actually strangled himself on metaphor, adjective, simile, etc etc etc. I paid full price for this turgid paperback and even with the leisure reading time of a cross-country flight, found myself skimming and flipping over pages to find the storyline. You can practically see him typing away, sighing with delight over every flowery, ornate turn of phrase that further obscures the plot. His lumbering try for humor reminds me of a simliar tragic attempt by Robert Ludlum some years back.I bought this book on the basis of some of Koontz's early works (Watchers, Twilight Eyes) and if this is what he is passing off as literature now, I'm finished.\\"By the Light of the Moon\\" is not even worth a trip to the used bookstore - it went straight into the recycle."},{"rating":"1","title":"Strange Change for Koontz...","review":"Although I was very taken w/characters and plot I was constantly distracted and pulled out of the story by this inexplicable change in Koontz's writing style- embarrassingly over descriptive, with use of entire paragraphs when a few words would have been much better. Awkward, inappropriately archaic or formal adjectives as if Koontz constantly referred to his Thesauraus. Hackneyed cliches and flowery outpourings slathered on everywhere- made what should have been an excellent read a painful one"},{"rating":"2","title":"Koontz's #2 novel with best science fiction plot.","review":"The first book I read by Koontz was 'Cold Fire' some years ago. Koontz was generally found in the horror section then. I found most of his other novels to have less science fiction elements and stopped reading his books for a while. Now he's more often found in the mainline fiction section. 'Light of the Moon' got my attention with its cover and I was not disappointed! This latest book has just as much science fiction appeal as 'Cold Fire' did! Keep it up Dean, I hope to see some further adventures of the Moolight Guild..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Major disappointment","review":"After having read app. 40 books written by Dean Koontz, I am getting more and more critical and apprehensive of his increasingly flowery style. Just 140 pages into By the Light of the Moon I found myself skipping pages and finally putting it aside with disgust. From now on, Koontz is taken from my buy-on-sight list and I'll never again buy one of his books that involves an intelligent canine or autistic brother, where the action takes place in just 24 hours (and thus begging for the disgusting extended prose and flowerly writing style) or is about a couple of people on the run for unknown persons and unknown reasons. Let alone, novels that include all of the above!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Skip this one","review":"The is my first book by Dean Koontz, and I am not rushing to buy another. The plot read like a bad TV movie. The overall concept was interesting, but the way it was carried out was a little hard to swallow. The science should have been researched and explained more. Also, I'm not sure if I'm supposed to take the ending seriously or not. Koontz's depiction of an autistic character, however, was comical and poignant. (As a footnote, I was led to believe that this was a horror novel, but it is not. I am not letting that affect my review, though.)"},{"rating":"1","title":"By the Light of the Moon","review":"I love Koontz! I have read all of his books but this one was just a huge disappointment. It dragged on and on and I was so glad to reach the end.

I love the themes of power, the past, and memories explored in this book. He has some great characters and the book is perfectly set up for a sequel. Please Mr. Koontz write us a sequel to continue the story!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Autisim","review":"I thought that the book was on the boring side which is unusual for Koontz but I really thought that Koontz knows nothing about autism. He made the autistic character act like he knew nothing and had characters say stupid things about the autistic character. People that have autistic children do not even compare the autistic character to their children. I dont even understand why Koontz even made this character autistic.Dorothy Ham"},{"rating":"1","title":"Annoying Characters, unrealistic plot","review":"I am normally a fan of Dean Koontz, but not since his annoying character Christopher Snow, has Koontz come up with a more tiring cast of characters. Literally pages of text are devoted to monosyllabic exchanges between the hero and his autistic brother. Cute the first time, tiring thereafter. The plot of the entire novel is acceptable, but it never builds any depth and actually ends with the heroes discussing themselves as super-heros, capes, tights and all. This is so far from his best work that I almost believe it was written by a ghost writer with his name attached to attract sales. This is one where I would have to say to not just wait for the paperback, but wait for the paperback in the used bookstore."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not very good...","review":"I was really suprised by this book. I am a Koontz fan, but this was a complete let down. The dialogue between the characters was boring. It was very frustrating how the characters seemed to show little reaction to the things that were happening to them. \\"Oh, my car blew up\\" Koontz did a horrible job of making this book believeable. The only reason I am giving it two stars is because it passed the time"},{"rating":"1","title":"Wow, this is bad!","review":"I'm a new reader of Dean Koontz. I made it to chapter 8 and that was it, I couldn't take it any more, the book now sits at the bottom of my trash bin. If this book is a good overall representataion of Mr. Koontz style of writing, then I will avoid all his books. I enjoy interesting and intelligent writing but this was over the top, talk about rambling on, on every nuance these boring characters experience. Then the over descriptive science facts, If I wanted a lesson in science I would have turned on the Discovery channel. What could have been easily 3 chapters took 8...blah, blah, blah. Overall, this is the worst book I've tried to read in years...sorry Mr. Koontz."},{"rating":"1","title":"No More Koontz for Me","review":"While searching for new books to read, I picked up about 5 books, 2 of which were from Koontz. I had never read anything from him but I was willing to give it a try since I had read an excerpt from 'Odd Thomas' and it seemed kind of good. I picked up 'By the Light of the Moon' and 'Tic Toc'. The former starts of pretty good and quite intriguing, but as the story unfolds it turns to crap. I'm not going to say what the book's about 'cause quite frankly, it's not memorable and so, I don't remember much.As for 'Tic Toc', it's far, far worse. Here's the premise: An alien hides in a doll and tries to hunt its master and manages to kill a whole bunch of people in the process, except of course, the master. It's a comedy. I admire the fact that he played with fire trying to mix horror and comedy but I'm sorry, Koontz got toast 'cause it's just not good. I should say though that the main character's mom rocks, but she's barely in it so..."},{"rating":"1","title":"No more Dean Koontz for me","review":"I tolerated Odd Thomas, and I made it through that book.

It wasn't until recently that I started reading this novel. Big mistake on my part. The novel began well enough, but then began a downward spiral. It had one of the oddest plots I've ever seen, and that alone normally wouldn't put me off a book. But in addition to the bizarre story line, it seemed as if Koontz had wrote the book, and then went back and looked up every word he had written in the thesaurus and replaced it with a synonym. Simple sentences were unneccesarily drawn out, and some of his figurative language (especially that which involved Middle Eastern conflict) was flat and boring. Truly one of the worst reads I've ever had the displeasure of enduring."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wow... bad.","review":"I love Dean Koontz, but this book was just beyond ridiculous. Three people are injected with \\"nanobots\\" and are suddenly clairvoyant and able to warp themselves from one place to another with the flick of a wrist? Since when does nanotechnology have ANYTHING to do with ESP/Clairvoyance? The three characters were shallow and unlikeable, the autistic brother got on my nerves since nothing he ever said made sense. Usually, with off-the-wall characters like this, Koontz has their seemingly enigmatic prattle eventually reveal or explain something. Not so with \\"Shep\\". The book never explains why anyone cares about killing the three main characters or why anyone is following them. The ultimate ridiculous conclusion of them holing up with the \\"Twilight Zone\\" radio host is simply... dumb! So in the last 4 pages of the book, they just all live happily ever after with the rich radio host. Um... what? If the \\"bad guys\\" were tailing them, wouldn't they eventually find the radio host?

Years later it's still far better than Side B, but the rest of the cuts have grown respectable with distance, possibly due to nostalgia for the synthesized music of that era. This CD edition towers super-hard over the original LP simply for including \\"We Move (Dance Mix)\\" (Right On...) and \\"Frequency 7 (Dance Mix)\\", the latter being a particularly amazing analog-synth instrumental freak-fest. I always imagine Midge Ure ditching decorum for these five minutes to help invent the future of electronic music.I love \\"Frequency 7\\".

I've gone to sleep, driven long distances, written poetry, cooked meals, cleaned house or simply meditated to this wonderful, pure, liquid joy!This has to be the best relaxation CD on this planet. It has been in my collection since 1999 and I still listen to it often. The softness of it just rolls over you, inserts itself into your being and centers you.I fell feel very lucky and blessed to have purchased this piece of heaven at a CD Warehouse for a very small fee...and it was on a whim. I was looking for something different, something relaxing..and boy did I ever find it!Classic gem this is...the other reviewers speak truth."},{"rating":"2","title":"Douglas Trowbridge, Songs Unspoken review","review":"This album is truly inspired by the Great Creator! Douglas Trowbridge has to be one of the greatest contemporary classical composers of all time. Each song is like a beautiful musical conversation with God! The only thing better would be an actual music book with each of the songs transposed, so that others can learn the songs. Of course, no one could possibly play then as well as Mr. Trowbridge! You truly hear the heart of a man of God with each and every song!"},{"rating":"1","title":"DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT!","review":"I fell victim to the \\"how bad can it really be\\" statement and boy did I get burned. This is by far the worst piece of networking equipment that I have ever touched. I have been in the business 8 years, I am an MCSE in NT and Win2k as well as a CCNA. I say that only to state that I know how to setup networks and this POS box wouldn't even allow a consistent internet connection. Plus, like any good tech, you setup the network then and only then try to add the VPN. Well as soon as you turn on the VPN access in this router the machine completely changes it's local network settings. Do not buy this. Find something else. I'm going to get a firwall/VPN unit then try and add the wireless later. By the way, the tech support was horrible. I actually had to teach them things about networking, which means that they were useless for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"I should have believed all of the other reviews","review":"I couldn't imagine that a linksys product was as bad as everyone was saying.

Because if you are going from one wireless network to another, who wants to force G on their laptop to work at home, and then constantly reconfigure the wirelses card in your laptop to hand the B bands at the airport every single time you leave your home!!!!!!!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"WRV54G is shlock","review":"These reviews are dead-on. Believe me. Bought one of these a couple months ago and have had all the same issues with dns and vpn. I've owned a previous 802.11b linksys router and it was flawlessly for over a year up until a week ago but that's another issue and the reason I won't buy another linksys product. The WRV54G should be recalled. I've been on the phone with tech support, written emails, returned the item to place of purchase for a replacement, returned a 3 router to linksys for another replacement because I couldn't believe I would get a 3rd router that was defective. Sure enough the SAME problems plage this unit. The authoritative dns is defective, vpn is flakey, administering the router is flakey.. freezes or hangs often during reboot. Updating firmware does nothing to fix these issues. Basically i'll eat the loss on this router since I can't sell it on ebay as a previous reviewer stated. I'd get a negative for selling a defective product. You've been warned."},{"rating":"1","title":"Had major issues trying to use this router","review":"I currently have a WRT54G wireless 54G router and wanted to upgrade to the WRV54g for the VPN feature.The minute I plugged in the WRV54G I had problems. I have a WPC54G Wireless PC card, a WET54G Wireless Bridge, and a WMA11B Wireless media adapter (all Linksys products) that all work great with my WRT54G router. The only client I could get to work with the WRV54G was my wireless pc card. I never was able to figure out why. since every client had the exact same configuration when working with my WRT54G.I also had an issue with my FTP server. When an outside machine would connect, the router would lose internet access and then would have to be rebooted.I was never able to get the VPN working either. The directions are very confusing and there are too many variables that can cause an issue and it is very hard to troubleshoot.My recommendation is to stick to the WRT54G wireless router until Linksys gets some updated firmware to fix these problems."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shame on Linksys","review":"Very disappointed with this product. The documentation is poor, making even the slightest config change requires a two minute reboot and their DNS feature is hosed. It acts as authoritative DNS for whatever domain it obtains from the ISP and then fails to resolve addresses for that domain. Example: router becomes router.ispname.com When trying to resolve mail.ispname.com the Router acts as authoritative DNS and does not relay that request so the request fails. I saw in the config where you can change the domain...but it doesn't work. This really hampers the usefulness of the DHCP feature, which again does not allow customization of DNS Servers. Add the poor VPN support, horrible docs and I've experienced occassional wireless outages that I never had with my 3 year old DLink and I have to say Linksys really blew it with this product. Is this what we can expect now that Cisco bought them?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Useless VPN feature","review":"I already have 2 Linksys wireless routers and they work great (a no-brainer, like every electronic should be on its basic funtionality).With this unit I can't make it even FIND the device when trying to configure it for the VPN feature (which is the only reason I bought it for).I suggest Linksys to have JUST ONE of their engineers to post a troubleshooting guide (a serious one) for this product.I don't mind spending on a good product, but I also don't like spending a lot of money for a product that gives you the same as a cheaper one (happens all the time).I hope I find a VPN Router that satisfies my needs. This one goes to the trash!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I hope this isn't a vision of what Linksys has in the future","review":"The WRV56G router & wireless features perform much like every other Linksys product that I have been happy with. However I purchased this item to setup a VPN and it has been nothing but problems. It was much easier to setup a VPN using Windows Server at my office then to do it with this \\"simple\\" router at home. Even using Linksys' QuickVPN is a waste of time since it is such a flaky and featureless program. Sometimes it connects sometimes it doesn't, no rhyme or reason. I will be returning this router. Linksys should pull this item from the market to prevent further damage to their otherwise good reputation. Come on Cisco (Linksys' parent company) you are the worlds leading manufacturer of networking how did you let this product out of QA? I am extremely disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Who designed this??","review":"Linksys has a well-deserved reputation for solid inexpensive equipment, but this router is a breathtakingly inept piece of junk. The person who tried to install it at my office was a certified IT hardware consultant with over 30 years' experience; after nine billable hours he conceded that he couldn't configure the VPN side, even with the help of Linksys technical support. Between his time, and pulling my office network down for a day, this misbegotten experiment cost me over $2,000. Don't go near it, IT DOESN'T WORK."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad Reviews But I Bought It Anyway","review":"I read all the review I could find on this product and most were bad. A few recent ones were better. The first problem I encountered was the power on button did not function correctly. I had to press, press harder, shake the device, and finally turn it upside down while pressing to power it on. I was never able to power it down with the on/off button. The wireless AP worked fine but it would not function with an ethernet cable. I thought it was me (though I've unboxed and setup 25+ wireless, wire only, routers, swithes, etc. without problems. After several hours of trying different approaches I looked at documentation, knowledge base articles and found one that indicated if the device power light blinked continuously the device was defective. That was the end of it and I returned it for credit. I do not recommend this device to anyone.T. Ragan - Cypress, TX"},{"rating":"1","title":"Good if you like to reboot","review":"I have had the wrv54g for about a month, and it worked fine until I needed to web into the router or use the wireless. The box locks out the ability to web in to the management interface, not the external interface (WAN) but the internal interface. And the wireless access dies at the same time.All the wired connections still function, as far as I can tell, and the firewall still functions while the management interface is locked-up. I have the latest code for the router, but I have had to reboot this thing almost once a day. This is a fairly pricey box for a home user, and Linksys has had some good products, but I would recommend staying away from the wrv54g.The reliability, or lack of, has really been disappointing. Save your money, this product is not worth half the current price."},{"rating":"1","title":"Only barely does what you would expect","review":"I have a high opinion of Linksys products, but this is a huge dissapointment. I installed this on a customers site, and we have had only a few weeks of no trouble since November 2003. If you are looking for a good 802.11g wireless router, go with the WRT54G. Seriously, save yourself a lot of headaches and get the WRT54G. You have been warned. If you don't beleive me, look at all the firmware updates Linksys have had to put out since they launched this product. 2.10 was a disaster for the wireless side of things."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stunningly Craptactular","review":"Unable to establish VPN connection with perfectly good IPSEC-compatible remote firewall. Have had to RMA TWO of these units. Linksys Phone support is clueless regarding VPNs or even the product configuration interface. Requires software syslog viewer to view router log. Linksys-provided syslog viewer crashes constantly making it impossible to view the router log. Settings not saved when router is turned off. Unable to use external DNS servers when using DHCP functionality, must use router for DNS (see electronics fan review). A real piece of crap from a company that normally makes reliable rock-solid products. Update as of 04.04.04: this review is with the most recent firmware (2.21 - 02/23/04) A Linksys rep informed me today that they are aware of issues with this unit and expect further firmware revisions to address them."},{"rating":"1","title":"BUYER BEWARE...CISCO JUNK","review":"This MAY be a good product for the occasional user. However, if your small business depends on this, you are dead. This baby will crash, crash, crash on you...even with the latest firmware. Nice idea to build a wireless router that supports VPN tunnels, but in reality, it just does not work. Look at the other reviews and think. Why does everybody say stay away? There must be something wrong if this many people complain. I live in Japan, and the Japanese retailers have already pulled it from the shelves due to the number of complaints. This is the SECOND time mine has locked up today. It WILL be replaced."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unreliable, slow and flaky","review":"I purchased two of these routers - and have had nothing but problems.The second unit was dead on arrival. It's first replacement failed after 3 days. The third unit basically worked - except the VPN functionality. The routers couldn't hold a VPN tunnel for more than 4 minutes.Linksys technical support was unable to assist in resolving this matter and stopped responding to e-mail requests.The setup screens don't work properly with Netscape or Mozilla-based products, whcih makes admin using Linux painful."},{"rating":"1","title":"DO NOT BUY, Horrible product and Support","review":"I have never been so disappointed in a networking product and I do this for a living. I ignored the reviews and give this product a chance. I waited on-hold for support on average 45 mins. Never again will I buy another Linksys product. I went back to my never failed 3com office connect product. VPN never worked, wireless was constantly plagued with disconnects, DHCP requested were slow, even after a firmware upgrade. Just a terrible product all around. I guess Cisco has brought to Linksys it's terrible Quality and lack of testing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Linksys WRV54G Wireless Review","review":"I brought this just recently 2 months ago and had no problem setting this up. I have 3 computers and 1 print server connect to it wirelessly using 802.11B & 802.11G network connections. I have not yet get a drop signal or disconnection. I just want to let you that this network device is not for beginners it takes some knowledge of VPN to set up or you have to do some research. Begginers should try Dlink or Microsofts network routers. Instructions I would say is a little skippy but the product works great."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor excuse for a router","review":"The first one I bought dropped connections to all my PCs at random times. The only way to reconnect was to reboot the router. After I replaced it, I discovered the new one would not allow PCs on the network to ping each other. I called Linksys, made it finally to 2nd tier support, and they said it must have been damaged on the boat in shipping. I asked them if they wanted the serial number to identify a \\"bad batch\\" and they said it was a manufacturing problem, not tech support. Ridiculous. Don't buy it. I did not try the VPN hosting functionality."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a Boingo HotSpot Router","review":"I only bought this because it was advertised as the preferred router for setting up a Boingo HotSpot in a Box.Boingo no longer offers that system to new providers so don't waste your money!There are many other wireless routers that do a better job for a lower price.

Unfortunately it never lived up to the expectations. When compalining to Linksys tech support about the DNS services not working I was told to return the device and purchase another, as the device was obviously defective. The second device had the same problem. The issue is that the so-called DNS server is not opperational on the WRV54g.One wonders if this device ever passed through a QA department - or if the quality assurance staff are as technically challenged as the tech support staff...I would not expect this low quality from any company in the Cisco group.The last contact that Linksys had with me was to use a different device (a device other than the WRV54g)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unreliable, Constant Rebooting Total Nightmare","review":"I've always had good luck with Linksys, however the Wireless WRV54G is one product to stay away from.This is the second one, the first one I returned because it could not maintain a wireless connectivity for more than 1-2 hours. I'm using 3 laptops one with a Cisco 350 card, an Orinoco Gold card and a Proxim A/B card...all these cards work fine with other access points and wireless routers but not with the WRV54G. I am 100% sure it's the WRV54G router.The first one was shipped with 2.01 firmware the second one had 2.21 on it...nevertheless it had no improvements in the wireless connectivity area. The wireless is completely down after a day or so.

The trouble is I am paying for shipments and could have bought something else by now. I have also helped a friend setup and configure a WRT54G with no problem! Linksys is trying my loyalty.

If you are buying this product for the VPN then find something else. It flat doesn't work. Linksys support just wants to push you away, because they know it doesn't work. If you have doubts, go to www.thegreenbow.com and read the faq's about their vpn client software. There is an faq about how their people were never able to establish a tunnel with the wrv54g router. The only advice Linksys had for me was to put my server in the dmz. If I wanted to open my computer up to the whole world I wouldn't need their stupid router.

This is with the latest updates as of July 2004.The VPN support is also weak - it won't work with Windows XP with default VPN settings, meaning every Windows XP computer you use with this router must have special, complicated, settings to get the VPN to work.The worst part about this is that Linksys is aware of both of these problems, and has not resolved them after months and months of frustration.Could have been a great product, too bad the supporting software and company will not let it work properly."},{"rating":"1","title":"WRV54G Not Ready for PrimeTime","review":"This unit is the worst Linksys product that I have ever encountered. The ISP assigned IP does not renew except when rebooted (must do once a day). The VPN quit working after a week. Linksys' support is even worse. They say \\"yeah we know but we can't do squat right now\\". So I say why the hell did you release that to the public. Haven't you heard of testing.... what a concept. I guess that's what happens when you get too big."},{"rating":"1","title":"Please don't buy this product - High priced Junk","review":"I bought this router from Frys store(not Amazon) hoping that it would be better than the Belkin router that I already have. Alas! What an utter disappointment.Pros: Can't really think of any. I'm going to return it anyway, and hoping to get the refund asap :)Cons:1) This router needs constant human supervision to power restart every now and then. Did Cisco/Linksys even bother to do an internal QA on this product?2) Routing functionality doesn't seem to be good either.

You'd be better off watching weeds grow in your backyard or something."},{"rating":"2","title":"Let's go for a ride.","review":"A kid working in his Dad's motel decides to take one of the guests car for a drive with his friends.

Enjoyable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Joyride was a fun ride","review":"I enjoyed this film immensely. It may be contrived, but its still very entertaining. I wonder if Smith is the Smith from the film. If it is, I'd like to tell her that I really enjoyed the film. Everyone should check the film out. I saw it on HBO and really liked it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hard to screw up a tank top","review":"I am a medium... I have been a medium for about 20 years.

Yet you might want to keep looking."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for hot yoga practice","review":"Great breathable tank for yoga. I don't agree that it runs large and wish I had ordered my normal XL size. The L is OK but the top is somewhat fitted. I prefer.looser clothing for exercise. The quality is fine. I did the same thing as another reviewer and cut the tag out so that the top is tagless."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it!","review":"What can I say - if you work out and have muscles...this is the Tank Top you want to have!Great quality, does not get in the way while working out, simply a great product at a fair price.I will buy this one again!"},{"rating":"1","title":"It could have been better","review":"I found this movie very poor. The story was nothing unusual and also the action wasn't too great. The special effects were outdated, even for 1997 and the acting was nothing that the actors should be proud of. I'm sure that the producers could have done a better job since many movies which are much older than this one have better special effects and better action (Aliens 1,2 and 3, terminator,...)This is one of the worst movies i've seen (and i've seen MANY movies) and i don't recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"cheesy special effects really bad attempt","review":"It starts off well enough until they get to the part with the creature. Result of an intentionally bad experiment. You never get to see it until the end and when you do you wish you hadn't. It was such a joke! I laughed at the special effects. You're better off just imagining what it looked like. So stupid. Acting was a bit overdone like they were trying too hard. Not very good casting unlikely duo teamed up so the romantic undertones were silly. No chemistry between the actors out to save the jungle."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sailing Adventure Story, Travel Guide, and Design Tips","review":"It's great to see this adventure book available again after such a long time being out of print. This is David Keiper's own story with photos and sketches; how he designed and built a unique hydrofoil yacht - probably the first - and sailed solo around the Pacific Ocean. It is a riveting adventure story that also includes many hard-earned design, manufacturing, safety, and financial tips. The book is distinguished by vivid, active prose that puts you THERE in the picture; experiencing the unfolding adventure as Dave experiences it, and solving unexpected, disconcerting, and possibly life-threatening problems with Dave as they happen. Will be enjoyed by anyone who likes adventure, and is must reading for anyone who wants to design and build a high performance hydrofoil sailing yacht... or to dream about it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Project Book for Kids","review":"My eight year old son has become very interested in mechanical and electrical projects. We picked this book up at the library, but quickly saw that this is a \\"keeper.\\" It has many projects that will help him learn how things work as he builds a working model cable car / gondola (his first major project from this book), boat locks, several types of bridges, and other fascinating projects. I suspect he'll use at least one of these for future projects in school. The book is rated for 11 years & up, but with a little help, even kids a little younger can have a lot of fun."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book of activities to get your budding engineers on the road to building!","review":"We gave this book to our son for Christmas and plan to use the activities to enrich his homeschool education. But, I would say that homeschooled or not, these activities would be a pleasure to any child. They are hands on, use everyday materials, and are as interactive as you want them to be. They make seemingly difficult concepts easier to understand and are fascinating. The book is well laid out, nicely illustrated, and easy for a child of perhaps 6 or 7 and up to read and apply. Some activities warrant supervision. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Why Isn't More Music This Good?","review":"I brought this ablum on the strength of their tracks on the scooby doo & the witch's ghost soundtrack - and the tracks on this beat those. Last Girl On Earth has brilliant lyrics which hit too close to home for some, not to mention the same great guitar work on all the songs.There's no doubt that this band deserve to be widely known and that this album ROCKS."},{"rating":"2","title":"A POP ROCK CONFECTION WITH A BITING EDGE TO IT","review":"Songs are introspective and moody about life and relationships yet melodious with Beatle-esque harmonies and a rocking beat.

Great debut record for a promising band with a lot of potential."},{"rating":"2","title":"so familiar but felt so new","review":"five songs i could really get into... i think this is only the beginning of a great trip of new music...i can't wait..."},{"rating":"2","title":"My guess at who recorded this...","review":"Great CD. I believe it was recored by the Michigan band SRC although with a different lead vocals instead of Scott Richards. The guitar work is either Quackenbush or a copycat artist. Listen to \\"The Angel Song\\" from SRC Milestones CD and you will see what I mean about being SRC. They recorded for Capitol records about the same time period as this release."},{"rating":"1","title":"A TRIBUTE TO THE DOORS","review":"I picked this up for a couple bucks in a bargain bin somewhere as the titles that One Way choose to reissue are usually of some worth, even if only for the crackpot value. The lead singer sounds like Jim Morrison (anyone remember Orion?) and the sound is not disimilar to the Doors. Klaatu anyone? Absolutely no liner notes. Next."},{"rating":"1","title":"Take a pass on this one.","review":"I bought this book on the strength of fantastic reviews and was sorely disappointed. Although the story was interesting enough to have gotten a 3 stars from me, I am giving it a 1 star because I feel that putting unnecessary sexual innuendos (however slight) in a book for young readers is inappropriate. I would not mind if these comments added to the story, but they were all completely superfluous. I am glad I read this first before giving it to my 12 year old daughter,but I am upset that I wasted my money on a book that I can't have my daughter read. This is too dark a tale for young readers, but is too simple a tale for adults."},{"rating":"1","title":"I just couldn't get into this one","review":"Dreamhunter was recommended to me, but I found myself disappointed. I couldn't get invested in any of the characters and felt that the plot dragged on. I moved on to the next book before finishing, I just got to a point where I didn't want to pick it up anymore."},{"rating":"1","title":"Scam","review":"I loved Elizabeth Knox's books. I got Dreamhunter and read it in a day. I was so excited when I read on Amazon that she had a new book coming out, The Rainbow Opera, and I quickly preordered it. When it arrived in the mail, I sat down and started reading, but as soon as I started I realized it was the same book I just read. I couldn't believe I spent over $20 on overnight shipping just for a book that I already owned!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Can't get into it at all...","review":"I'm very surprised to see so many positive reviews on this book because I've only just hit chapter 4 and I'm ready to return it to the library. I can not get into this book at all. I'm finding it very hard to follow and the writing style has no flow. Its a very slow, choppy read so far and I've grown bored."},{"rating":"1","title":"very slow phase","review":"this is the part of the book.Rose's hand was cold, much cooler than the air, which,even in the shade of the forest, was as marinated in heat as theopen paddocks, the dusty roads, and the beaches of coal bay.Rose's hand was chilly, her palm coated with sweat.If you don't think this part seemed too long for just describing a cold hand,or if you don't think those expressions were bunch of cliche,I won't stop you reading the book. Every sentences are like that.You have to read through 4 lines just to know how the rose's hand was."},{"rating":"2","title":"Even if you don't like to read, you'll like this book","review":"The story itself was so engaging that I didn't want to put the book down. The story is unique, the characters are believable,and I really liked the relationship between Laura and her sandman/protector. I've heard some say the story itself was slow but I didn't find it so. I'm not an avid reader. It takes a lot to make me want to finish a book. If you don't like to read, try this book. You might find yourself reading it to the very end, and then wishing for more."},{"rating":"2","title":"Easy to understand and follow","review":"This is a great book for beginners at feng shui. It's easy to follow and has great tips and advice. The section about letting things go that are held onto because of familial or other obligations is excellent.Whether feng shui \\"works\\" or is not my place to say, but paying attention to corners of your room that correspond to areas of your life that you would like to improve certainly can't hurt."},{"rating":"2","title":"my favorite F.S. book so far","review":"I have read 5 or 6 feng shui books so far and this is probably my favorite. It does not go deeply into numerology, directions, etc, but it is more of a general read. It is very readable and not too dry. About halfway through the book it starts having chapters on each room, with tips and suggestions room by room."},{"rating":"2","title":"very approachable","review":"not too far out. Can incorporate in every day life. i highly reccommend this book to the intermediate feng shui practitioner."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic!","review":"I have just completed this fantastic book and am rereading it again! I have never received so much usable information before from any other feng shui book. The quality of the interior designs and photographs are excellent! This book has been sooo helpful and insightful, and not only does our home feel fabulous, but my husband and I do, too! We are now happier and more grateful for what we have, are completely focused on the careers & lifestyle we have been dreaming about for years, and making it happen on a daily basis. Incredible. It really has changed the way I view everything, and it has been the perfect spring cleaning instrument to help us improve & purify our lives. My family, friends and colleagues have remarked on how I am shining and I attribute it to Feng Shui. In fact, I tell everybody about this book, and a colleague is buying it for herself this weekend, as she wanted to take my book home with her. I won't let this book out of my sight. It's life-changing!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Inspiring","review":"I have to admit it, I purchased this book mainly for the pictures. I find photos of well-laid-out rooms inspiring. HOWEVER, I am recommending this book because of its incredible CONTENT. Jayme Barrett lays the subject matter out so perfectly. It's like a step-by-step manual, only much more beautifully presented. Oh, and the pictures lived up to my expectations as well!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Feng Shui your life","review":"I bought this book because it has a 5 star rating. However this book does not even include the basic knowledge about Feng Shui. The author talks about how to make your life happier, how to help people around you. She also mentioned about painting your front door with red color is always good for everyone. It is not true. I found this book is misleading Feng Shui beginners."},{"rating":"2","title":"Half Feng Shui'd","review":"I bought this for fun and because I was interested in a subject that was clearly popular. I study interior design and had read a little about Feng Shui and realized that I was half Feng Shuing without knowing it. Now, I draw the line at believing stuff like my good luck is going down the toilet if I flush without the lid down, but I do go along with the \\"no clutter\\" theory. The sound of bubbling water, tinkling of wind-chimes, natural plants, neatness, light-catching crystal, are all soothing elements in a room and this I had been doing before I heard the FS word. As for much of the rest, gimme a break! Buy the book for fun because it is full of excellent ideas and do what you will."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Very Good","review":"Very informative, especially for someone who is totally new at Feng Shui concepts.

This is more a lifestyle book and I didn't find the principles of Feng Shui practically explained. I also found much of it superstitious nonsense - this book would have you hang crystals in doorways, hallways and 'a wind chime over your head while you stand at the stove to call in prosperity energy' (P219). On the other hand, maybe I should stop being so harsh, because knowing my two boys implementing many of these ideas would certainly introduce a lot of laughter into the house...."},{"rating":"2","title":"My favorite feng shui book","review":"This book was the first feng shui book I bought, which I picked out based on its excellent reviews. I loved the book. There are lots of inspiring photos, simple things to do right away at the end of each chapter, and it's well organized and seems comprehensive. I enjoyed the book so much that I bought a couple of others that also had good reviews, but I was pretty disappointed in comparison with this one. The others had good information, but they just didn't inspire me to actually do any of it the way this one did. I still go back to it whenever I feel cluttered or \\"stuck\\" in my home. I highly recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Book For Positive and Energetic Living!","review":"This book offers a wealth of insight into shifting your life into a more positive and fulfilling experience. Jayme Barrett gives you a method of not only organizing your environment, but uplifting the energy within it to affect the opportunities you are able to bring in to your everyday living.

I always get the Lasser tax guide when I file, but with all the changes in the tax laws I also wanted a simple, short, easy to understand explanation of everything and this is it--It tells you the new law, explains it in language you can understand, then gives examples of how it is applied, with tips on using it. I am not an accountant, and have always dreaded the thought of wading through tax books to find extra deductions but this was easy to do, and maybe because it was written by the same people, but I found this and the Lasser Your Income Tax complemented each other well--it made for easy reference back and forth."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dificil man!!","review":"This book is alright, but buyers take note...this is NOT a book for beginners.

I picked up this book and it has really brought alot of what I learned back to my rememberance while reviewing concepts. Even when relating basic concepts, this book does not insult the skill level of a more advanced learner. It is very challenging and great for someone who wants to get back into speaking Spanish again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for bright beginners!","review":"This is not an introductory book, but it can be used if you have really bright students. It breaks down the language into usuable parts. If you find it too advanced, just go at a slower pace, and spend more time on each exercise."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good solid textbook.","review":"I have used this text for reference and to check on Spanish examples or rules. It is not a book for beginners. It really is best used in a classroom setting.

Sometimes it was challenging writing on the go - my hand would fall off the edge and my penmanship got scrappy. But such is life. Also, writing on the top half of the fold was a bit challenging when I first got it.

Years ago I had a rechargeable light where the actual flashlight was kept in a cradle that attached to the wall and was easy to enter back into the cradle for recharging. I tried hard to find a similar light when I bought this one but couldn't. This Dorcy light has the plugin prongs mounted on the light itself and are swiveling which makes it very difficult the hit the wall receptacle without folding the prongs back into the unit. So you have to dig them back out of the little recessed area they fold into and try again. It's aggravating to say the least.BUT, the worst thing about this light is that is has a very WIMPY beam of light. It's pretty useless outside, barely illuminating an object 50 feet from you.

Reti died, in 1929 at the age of forty, just before its publication. In it he chronicles the development of chess with sketches of the game's greatest practicioners. In doing so, he analyzes some games played by these masters.The analysis has imperfections by today's computer aided standards, but this is not primarily an instructional book. Rather it is a work of literature wherein a great mind shares his love of chess with beautiful prose.Those seeking instruction of high quality from a contermporary of Reti might consider Grandmaster Aron Nimzovitch's \\"My System\\". It is entertaining and a classic on positional chess. And it is written in a lively and unique style."},{"rating":"1","title":"The ninth wave","review":"Just couldn't get into it.

I used 12ga wire, installed them to direct the sound correctly, and used a good amp/receiver to power them with.I used the 6.5's for the rear and the 8's for the front as I have larger room.

Every parent of a youth/high school athlete should read this book before they even consider complaining to their child's coach. I am only in my mid 20's and I can relate to many of the experiences described in this book. It's a very quick read as well. If I could give it 100 stars I would. For those readers who complained about the length of the book, yes it is a quick read but the book only costs 10 dollars. Anyone who is looking for a lengthy book should know not to purchase a book that is 90 pages long. For those of you who were, and then bought the book, that's your own fault.

Hopefully his superb article on the California recall election in 2003 won't be packaged as a hardcover in the near future. Then again, pictures of Arnold Schwarzenegger will surely move many copies.The profile of Coach Fitz feels rather incomplete, relying almost solely on the author's own memory and its conflict with the current win-at-all-costs mentality of today's parents. If there is a real story to be had here it is the increasing social acceptability of parents as hyper-advocates for their children in school, sports, and pretty much any artistic or creative endeavor. That is a subject that deserves book-length treatment (and not just a hardcover pamphlet, either).Assuming that readers of \\"Moneyball\\" haven't yet done so, they would do well to pick up \\"Liar's Poker\\" instead of this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"An Essay, Not A Book","review":"As has been noted, this \\"book\\" is basically a New York Times Magazine article.

Lewis, the author of several memorable books, has aapparently succummed to the temptation to make a few bucks off his name.

The book may have been a passable magazine article somewhere ( Oh, now I read some of the other Customer Reviews, and I see it was a NY Times Mag article ), but it certainly falls way short in the \\"book\\" category. Interestingly, Lewis writes this rip off book about his coach who constantly preached about not taking the shortcuts, and that the guys would not be rewarded by doing such.

That's all that happens.But again, as in Swann's Way, Proust tells the reader every detail in beautiful prose - what the ocean looked like, why she acted that way, what the narrator is thinking, etc, etc.I found the first third of the book to be a little tiresome, since I was sick of the behavior of certain characters. But once we got a change of scene in the narrators travels to Balbec, I started to really enjoy Proust again.I have to say this once again - if anyone is curious yet intimidated by Proust (as I was), just try the first hundred pages of Swann's Way.

Once again someone close to Paul gets killed, and Kersey responds guns in hand ready to get revenge...... and you know he will! Paul Kersey is an example of how when the law fails, it is time to take it into one's hands. And think about this, when thses guys are killed by Kersey, how can you not cheer?

He has resorted to using deadly soccer balls and poisoned Italian food. What happened to the big guns? The outrageous stunts? And, what's worse, he once again has a gorgeous woman in his life that dies before the opening credits. Haven't these women seen the other films? Besides, who could fall in love with a mute murderer?

Surprisingly, in his volume \\"The Reformation\\" I found myself reading almost the exact phrasing found in Manchester's book, same information, same anecdote's. While Manchester does frequently cite Durand, I don't think the citations cover the extent to which Manchester esentially imported Durand into his work. If this were Manchester's solo work, I'd give it five stars..as it is, I don't know how to rate it."},{"rating":"2","title":"What Borgia Pope?","review":"The history of the mind and cultural evolution is oft passed over, but Manchester tells quite a lucid (and sometimes lurid) tale here. His stories of the Renaissance Vatican are certainly the bits always passed over in Catechism.

I have given this book as a gift on more than one occasion and will continue to do so."},{"rating":"2","title":"Was a gift","review":"This was a gift for a high school student, recommended by her AP teacher.

This leads him to make simplistic and erroneous statements about the \\"Medieval Mind,\\" view the Rennaissance as being detached from the Middle Ages, and claim that the \\"voyages of discovery\\" created the modern world. The book reads more like a bad high school essay than a work by a distinguished historian and author.Indeed, aside from the first thirty pages, the book isn't even about the medieval period. In fact, much of it is not about the Rennaissance, either. The book, which he admits, is mostly about Ferdinand Magellan.So please, stay away from this book. There is nothing to learn from it, and it may give you a bad idea of the kind of historian William Manchester really is."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Fox News of Medieval History","review":"The more you read, the less you know.

The narritive was so interesting, but as I progressed, I found the effectiveness of this book obscured by Manchester's prejudiced view of the Church and the people of the Middle Ages.

I was very optimistic with his strong entrance into the era. But it seemed almost like he turned a strong fan on his notes which scattered across the room into utter disorder, and he got very bored when he wasn't talking about Mr. Magellan. I hear it's quite innacurate, and I noticed a great deal of prejudice towards the pagan religions.His erratic writing in certain areas (it seems only when he's bored that he writes this way), he seems almost to be speaking a foreign language."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cliched Pseudo-history","review":"While, as many other reviewers have noted, Manchester's biography of Magellan at the conclusion of this work is certainly scholarly and insightful, the rest of this text, especially the rather pathetic thirty-page rant against the Church entitled \\"The Medieval Mind,\\" is consistently shallow and cliched. That the author truly believes that 1,000 years of European history can possibly be summarized accurately in so few words should disqualify this book as a serious, scholarly \\"portrait of an age.\\" In short, Manchester's view of the Medieval millenium as a time of unending brutishness, depravity, and intellectual stagnancy is as thoroughly unenlightened and pseudo-intellectual as the false \\"Middle Ages\\" which he describes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor condition","review":"Book was thoroughly marked up, with distracting strike-throughs and underlines.

His intoductory chapter on what it was really like to be a medieval peasant was a real revelation to me (I've seen far too many Hollywood versions of Robin Hood). Life was truly \\"nasty, brutish and short.\\" When I tire of the pain and agony of modern life I only have to read the first 80 pages of this book to realize that we are now living in the best of times (all of our teeth, antibiotics, and hot water). I would recommend the book to any general reader interested in a feel for a far-gone era who isn't interested in becoming an expert."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Most Boring Book I Have Ever Read!","review":"I was forced to read this book for my AP European History class, and if I wasn't this book would have gone in the trash by the time I had gone through 10 pages. I have read and enjoyed several historical non-fiction books in the past, but this was so much like a history text book that reading it was pure pain. The book focuses so much on the sexual encounters of the people during this age that it is enough to make one sick. It solely talks about the Christian religion as opposed to the actions and ideas of the pagan, Jewish or Muslim reigions. It very rarely talks about anything other than religion, such as the inventions and art and literature that defined the age.

Looking over some of the reviews here by the 'scholars' I am reminded of the definition of an expert: An \\"X\\" in mathmatics is an unknown factor and a \\"spurt\\" is a drip under pressure.

And so enjoy this deep yellow river of Popes, renaissance artists, maps, Kings and voyages, culminating in Magellan's glorious, crazy circumnavigation of the globe, the reason Manchester wrote this in the first place.

Wala ... Da Vinci and the humanists arrive and Europe - now unshackled by the church - explodes into a flourishing and modern society. The author manages to fit the entire period into his own tidy little box of prejudices, and in the process ignores all of the past 50 years of scholarship on the period in doing so. I'm no expert of history, but I know that it is never quite that simple - people tend to be complex and you get the good mixed with the bad.

He should have stuck with the article, or written a book just on Magellan.Generally, the book is full of historical views that are outdated, discredited, or just plain without any basis in fact at all. The history of the period has been lumped together into one giant chaotic mass, with little attempt to show change over time. It appears that his main sources for his research were children's history books written before 1950 and Victorian \\"historical\\" porno novels.It was an enjoyable read, in the sense that such novels as \\"Princess Daisy\\" are enjoyable, but it is worthless and misleading as a source of actual historical information.DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS ONE!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Manchester's Medieval Mistake","review":"Possibly one of the worst history books ever written.

Flee from this book as fast as you can."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not an honest book","review":"This book, 'A World Lit Only By Fire', by William Manchester, is an appalling book. Written in a sensationalist, purple prose, and with only a passing swipe at scholarship, Manchester gives such a dystopian vision of medieval and renaissance times that one is forced to approach the book as fiction.

I literally wanted to rip some of the pages out of this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"So inaccurate as to be a staight lie!","review":"Just because it is well written, it doesn't mean it's a good book. Full of misconceptions and inaccuracies this book will mislead anyone who does not know something about the subject already.

This book was required for a freshman honors world history class, which it was not appropiate for. not only because of it's constant perverse content but because of the dragged out boring but complecated way that he writes. not only does he paint a dim picture of the world back then but makes the europe seem extremely currupt, mainly the church, a strong negitive opion shines through. the only part of the book where manchester seems engaged is the perverse sexual interactions between young girls and their fathers. something is not write about the image he plants in readers heads about the time period."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Most Anti- Catholic book I have ever read","review":"I had to read this for a 10th grade honors history class. What a disapointment! I already knew most of the facts from 9th grade history, and knew when there were factual errors. What was worse was the anti-Catholic bias woven throughout the entire narrative. As a Catholic I was very offended. Manchester has some strange obsession with weird sexual proclivities. I wonder how he can possibly document any of the party scenes in the Vatican that he so graphically portrays. A waste of time! Save your money for better things in life!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"I was forced to read this very long and very boring book over the summer for my Ap European History class. Normally I love to read nonfiction history, but this book was an exception. Very unorganized, and hard to understand it was very choppy and there was absolutely no flow whatsoever. Mr.Manchester seemed to be a bit obsessed with the corrupt sexual details of the time period and it seems he could find nothing good about the church at all. I don't know what our teacher was thinking when he made us read this book, I wonder if he actually read it."},{"rating":"1","title":"biased and banal","review":"This author has no real concept of the medieval ages, basing his text on what can only be seen as stereotypes. The author frequently gets his information wrong, and contradicts himself when it is convenient for his exploitative text. As another reader put it, this is \\"tabloid literature\\" at it's finest. He uses the outdated method of progressive history and speaks in dull metaphors of darkness and light. Read this book only if you want trite and cliché nonsense about an extremely interesting period of history. Absolute trash."},{"rating":"1","title":"The worst book on Medieval history I've ever read.","review":"I own upwards of 5000 books. This is the only book I've ever thrown away. The only possible redeaming feature of this book is that it is a catalog of every existing medieval history cliche."},{"rating":"1","title":"Above Average Writing, Below Average (Distorted) History","review":"As an AP World History teacher I had to take a look at this to consider for required reading, and I have to say that I was pretty shocked after reading it that this is used as much as it is in the classroom. Manchester's writing is lively, but his use of sources shows no critical examination. He takes the nobility's appraisal of peasant life at face value, Catholics' characterization of Martin Luther without much balance, and in general overstates the figurative 'darkness' of the Medieval Age.The book is not without legitimate insights, but personally I found it way too much of a mixed bag to endorse, especially for high school readers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderfully entertaining, but is it true?","review":"This book was a wonderful break from the normal textbook history I am used to, but the question has been raised in my mind as to whether or not Manchester is treating the times he covers are nothing more than a glorified soap opera. It is incredibly entertaining, especially for a 15-year old mind (heh), as it deals (an incredible amount) with sex. Aside from that, he provides a goodly amount of commentary about the popes, seeming to take the view that the Church is bad, anything bad is the Church's fault, etc. Far be it from me to dispute this... he knows more than I do. If you want to be entertained, pick this up. As to its historical content, go ask someone who knows. Now lemme get back to the book... the sex is just gettin' good! (Lol, I'm just kiddin, people!)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful","review":"Manchester's interpretation of the period is certainly original. Indeed, I think that Medieval and Renaissance scholars would dispute much of what he says. The work is shallow, superficial, and at times borders on distortion of fact (for example, the statement that Lucrezia Borgia was having incestuous relations with both her father and her brother, a view which is not widely held). For those who are interested in the Middle Ages or the Renaissance, there are many good books on the market. This isn't one of them. Try \\"Daily Living in the Twelfth Century\\" by Urban Tigner Holmes, or \\"The Black Death\\" by Philip Ziegler."},{"rating":"1","title":"Careless History but a Good Yarn","review":"The book is a good yarn, I argue, because it brings human scandal (esp. sex, cruelty, pride) into historical narratives, which can sometimes be dry. However, there no serious treatment of the history, no annotation, which is a terrible disappointment. Usually, when you read a history book, you can say \\"Oh, that's interesting, I'd like to learn more\\" and find further reading in the endnotes or bibliographical essay. None is provided here; so when Manchester says, \\"As one historian writes...\\" there is no way to see who that person was or continue with the thread."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good reading isn't Good Enough","review":"In reading the previous reviews, it is necessary to point out that good, gripping reading just isn't a good enough criterion for a book about history. Accuracy is first, readability comes after that. Manchester's book isn't accurate. That's a very bad thing for a history book. Be smart: Read what's true rather than sensational. Skip this one and go for the heavy weights, or better yet, go to Amiens or Notre Dame in Paris and still believe that the Middle Ages were dark. You might follow that up with a trip to Auschwitz to see how 'light' an era we now live in."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"In his introduction Manchester admits that he is not an expert in the history of the period and goes on to prove it in the rest of the book. He is getting older and it shows with his fascination with the more seedy aspects of 15th century sexuality (some of his sources are less than reliable). He also does not give a balanced picture of the belief system of the common people. His understanding of the Catholoic church of the period is shallow: as in other areas, he only views things from the perspective of an late 20th century American, with all the assumptions and baggage that that entails, rather than understanding his subject from the inside out and in its own time and place. He does try to enliven his subject with well-crafted prose, and seems to have a genuine regard for some of his subjects. If you want a book on this period, you would do better to go elsewhere."},{"rating":"2","title":"Read and test everything","review":"Once I got over the missing end notes and misleading fact-bending throughout, I thoroughly enjoyed this romp through Europe 500 years ago. \\"Tabloid History\\" [as one other reviewer calls it] indeed.Christians be wary of taking offense at Manchester's many jabs. I prefer to think he is scaring us out of our demonizing tendencies. In the end, you will have a better view of the reformation than most college courses in the subject provide AND you may even wonder how the same popes that appreciated Michelangelo could get their politics and economics so badly wrong.Read \\"Pillars of the Earth\\" for a slightly darker view and \\"Van Loon's Lives\\" for an even better take on Erasmus. However, Manchester's Luther is worth the price of the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hardback Binding Review","review":"This is a review of the Hardback binding of this book. Don't waste your money - you may as well get the Paperback! This is not a properly printed and bound hardback version of William Manchester's book. It looks like a \\"Print-on-Demand\\" book i.e. a scanned version of the original that is quickly run off when ordered. Because of the scanning, the illustrations are awful - dark, high-contrast images, lacking detail. The actual binding of the pages is like a paperback ie. individual sheets stuck into a thick wad of glue. They will fall out! Add to that 2 end-boards + an inflexible spine-board and you've got yourself a hardback book (supposedly). For this kind of money, you can get a real (2nd-hand) one from Abe Books."},{"rating":"1","title":"Full of errors and cliches; not a serious history.","review":"Manchester doesn't even bother to distinguish between the \\"Dark Ages\\" and the \\"Middle Ages\\", and it's downhill from there. All the hoary cliches about the benighted filthy peasants and vicious nobles and clergy revived. Some new and interesting stuff about sex in the Middle Ages, however."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hoo, boy.","review":"I suppose the biggest problem I have with this book is that it does all of its entertaining by repeating partial facts, half-truths, and theories as though they were engraved in stone. It is a fun read, to be sure...if you are into juicy sex and salacious gossip...but people who read it come away with \\"facts\\" that are often not true at all. Read it, but don't make it your sole source of information, and try to ignore the author's concept that before the Renaissance, it was ALL BAD with NOTHING GOOD at all. Puh-lease."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bleah","review":"I picked this book up at an airport bookstore, hoping for something interesting and informative to read on my trip to Italy. What I found instead was a historian's version of the National Enquirer - lurid, overly sensational, and thin. I'm just as fond of a good Pope orgy story as the next person, but I object to shoddy research in pursuit of one. My knowledge of the timeperiod covered is slightly better than that of the average person, but I'm no expert, which means that when I start finding factual errors in a history text, something went very wrong."},{"rating":"1","title":"Did only the Catholics light the fire?","review":"Honest to goodness, I have never read a book that tried so hard, literally page after page, to blame everything negative about the middles ages on the Roman Catholic Church. Everything. More exactly, I think the author occassionally went three pages before he blamed something new on the Catholics. But, at least he was balanced. Mr. Manchester pointed out that anything positive was in spite of the Roman Catholics.I can not recommend this book, or any book, written to prove a presupposition rather than to arrive fairly at a conclusion. Terrible. It offended me not only as Catholic but also as a reader of history."},{"rating":"1","title":"An author with an axe to grind","review":"Mr Manchester has made up his mind and is not to be swayed: Everything bad that happened during the Medieval & Renaissance periods happend because of the Church, and everything good that happened was in spite of the Church. When an author's predjudice is this flagrent, and his research is less than thorough (e.g. he claims that the Medieval Church taught that procreation was evil) it makes it very hard to believe a word he writes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Example of a Historian Who Hates His Subject","review":"A World Lit Only By Fire is a good example of how NOT to write a history. Manchester's spin on the medieval world is wholy biased: unhelpful to the casual reader, and downright insulting to medievalists. I read this many years ago, as a senior in high school, and was appalled even then by the haughty demeanour of this author as he looked down on medieval people from the 20th century, making no effort to hide his sensationalist writing and willfull misinterpretation. I shudder to see that it still sits on many bookstore shelves today."},{"rating":"1","title":"All I have to ask him is ....WHAT?!","review":"It was mandatory for our class to read A World Lit Only By Fire. I think if the instructor would have read the book first she'd notice that it is filled with confusing babble and unorganized details that don't make sense. I must say that he does have some interesting sides of the stories, but i can't be quite sure if all the information is totally correct."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible","review":"This is an out of date and dreadful book keeping alive every imaginable stereotype and caricature of the Middle Ages. The 19th century was also \\"a world lit only by fire,\\" what does that tell us? Read this book if you want to feel good about yourself and learn nothing. If you want an enjoyable, but infinitely more reliable, broad overview of the Middle Ages read The Year 1000, anything by Jacques LeGoff, or Cahill, Mystery of the Middle Ages in addition to many others. Consider, Russell, Inventing the Flat Earth, if you want to understand how a book like this, filled with misinformation, remains popular."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of paper.","review":"This book is atrocious. It is almost willfully ignorant about its supposed subject matter, and does little more than repeat long-debunked stereotypes about the \\"dark ages.\\" I have an MA degree in medieval history, and have taught western civ and world history for eight years. Only mentioned to show that I have some actual qualifications for this opinion."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"In the Medieval mind, there was also no awareness of time.\\"","review":"\\"In the Medieval mind, there was also no awareness of time.\\" This breathtakingly ludicrous statement appears on page 22, and it represents everything that is horrifying about this book. (Just for starters, try telling any farmer of any era that he has \\"no awareness of time\\" and you'll end up in the manure pile, literally or figuratively.)Read Regine Pernoud's \\"Those Terrible Middle Ages: Debunking the Myths\\" (published in May 2000) or go to the library and pull out the 38-year-old \\"Horizon book of the Middle Ages\\" instead. Manchester's vituperation of the era borders on hysteria."},{"rating":"2","title":"Flawed,but worth reading","review":"The beauty of this book is that is highly accessible,well written and entertaining,makes reading about history fun, and will probably encourage the reader to do a more detailed research on some historical figures within.And yes, it is sometimes incorrect,it should not be the only book read about the medieval ages,because there is a lot missing, and what is in there is sometimes too kinky,too gossip like to be considered as real information.It is so controversial, some people hate it,others love it,if You don't take it too serious it can be fun,and a good start to get You interested in this part of History."},{"rating":"1","title":"trite","review":"this book is to history what Maxim magazine is to journalism. Cheezy, trite, sensational. Author has zero understanding of the Renaissance mind (or the medieval one)... reads like a 10th-grader's book report."},{"rating":"1","title":"Famously bad","review":"This book is worth reading. Luckily there are some copies available for about ten cents. It's worth reading because, like Michael Bellesisles' \\"Arming America\\", it has become famous for just how bad and shoddy and disreputable it is. Manchester tossed this off during a rest break he took while writing his big multi volume work on Churchill - this long, eloquent insult of the medieval mind. Medieval Europe produced arts, letters, and architecture of breathtaking beauty and sophistication - things that leave us mute with admiration to this day. We could still learn a great deal from the builders of cathedrals and the illuminators of manuscripts."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful Book.","review":"A good friend of mine with generally good judgment sent me this book. In deference to his good opinion of the same I tried my best to slogh through it but stopped on page 77 and could go no further. I love books and love history but this so-called history is simply awful. I looked at the reviews on Amazon to see if a relatively large group hated the book as much as I did. I found that many others felt this book would fail the examination by any rational critical thinker that this was in any way an accurate history of the period.Since I read only the first 77 pages I merely reference the many one star reviews for the more complete picture. I did not find the book well written. And I did not find the book credible. And I did not find the book entertaining even if I wanted to give it full literary license as fiction.Don't waste your time on this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"A book filled only with rubbish","review":"Manchester thinks he is insulting the Middle Ages with his title, but it takes just a second's reflection to remember that the world was lit only by fire until the nineteenth century. And it goes downhill from there. I don't have anything specific to add to others' comments on Manchester's pervasive lack of organization, accuracy, logic, and taste; I'll just say that I virtually never quit reading a book in disgust, but I made an exception in this case. I wish I could give it a negative number of stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fictional Thoughts of a lunatic","review":"The book is poorly written, full of fictional rantings and generally liberal recapping of other historial history books. The author rants like a lunatic and how this book was ever published is a mystery to me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful","review":"This book came highly reccommended, so I was expecting something at least factually accurate - but it was abysmal. His analysis of the just-post-Roman Christian Church in particular was PAINFUL to read. It was quite clear from his writing that he had not bothered to return to the source documents themselves but had simply stuck with others' interpretation of Christianity. He perpetuated several urban myths about the history of Christianity, and his interpretations of medieval life seemed to assume, frequently, that medieval people not just thought about the world differently than we do (a valid assumption) but that they were substantially dumber than we are (invalid).A student who turned in a paper to me citing this book as fact would probably get points off automatically for lack of ability to adequately analyze sources for factual accuracy. I only finished it out of morbid curiosity."},{"rating":"1","title":"ENTERTAINING BUT HARDLY SCHOLARSHIP","review":"I HAVE READ MOST OF MANCHESTER'S WORKS AND FOUND THIS ONE TO ENTERTAINING READING BUT HARDLY SCHOLARLY.

As members of this delegation, Emma's aunt and uncle are very conscious of the need for decorum with their young charge, but Emma yearns for freedom. She impulsively decides to masquerade as a servant to see the fireworks exhibit and is rescued from a scoundrel by \\"Jack\\", who recognizes the lovely Lady Emma. Jack, the Viscount St. Albans, is one of England's finest intelligence officers, and it occurs to him that Lady Emma may, in fact, be a spy and not the delightful innocent she appears. He vows to discover the truth about the LADY IN DISGUISE, and discovers along the way that he loves her dearly. Amanda McCabe spins another engrossing tale for her devoted fans.

The only thing sexy about this record is one song title, but the song isn't even slightly seductive; it's just another quaint bore. 'Can We Talk It Over In My Bed'? Yeah, talking is all you would do before falling asleep if this pabulum was playing. I'm glad that radio programmers as well as the public ignored this album.

I do not doubt that Shania is a very talented performer. In my opinion, this was not one of Shania's best efforts. Furthermore, the sound was not mixed well for this concert. I have rented (and own) several concerts, and this one has below average sound quality. This show comes off as not being \\"the big time\\". We all are aware that by this time in Shania's career (1999) that she had already hit \\"the big time\\". Shania does not do much to make this show very entertaining. The weave she is donning with her hair completely takes away from her looks that everyone knows her for. I do not think that there was any costume changes throughout the entire show. This is NOT a terrible concert, although, if you are expecting something impressive from this concert just because Shania is a superstar and her music is very entertaining, you might feel that this concert is a bit of a letdown."},{"rating":"2","title":"THE BEST","review":"Shania Twain puts on one hell of a show. 2 1/2 hours of non stop entertainment.

For those of you who may have audio problems...When I first received the DVD from Amazon I played it on the DVD drive on my PC with two stereo speakers.

The only good shots were of closeups and sometimes it took the cameraman a few seconds to focus on a number of the shots.

I know the concert was indoors, but I've seen other indoor videos that did not have this problem. Did I get a bad DVD or did anyone else have this problem?"},{"rating":"1","title":"no center channel track","review":"I have played this DVD all weekend. I found that the DVD has no center channel.

Unfortunately, there's no Mr. T saying things like \\"Shut up, fool!\\"Seriously, the plot was paper-thin, the acting was deplorable, the props and special effects were comical. For instance, do you remember the A Team shooting sophisticated automatic weapons at people standing no more than 20 feet away and missing them completely? Do you remember each explosion tossing people 20 feet in the air with no apparent injury?

Jenny Haan was not only an exciting performer to watch (acrobatic almost--a female Mick Jagger), but also a fine vocalist. At times she is every bit as powerful as Janis Joplin. The band was tight and offered an interesting variety of sounds. I recently picked up an old LP copy of this at a garage sale, replacing the one I bought new years ago. The music holds up well after all these years.

It follows the life and growth of a young Indian boy/man, and throughout his journey, he discovers invaluable insights about life, love, and countries.

I taught this text to college sophomores recently and realized too late just how difficult the text is. True, there are marvelous complexities and wonderfully wrought ironies and historical insights. But there are also pages of confusion with relatively little pay off. This text might well be taught in conjunction with a detailed Indian (or Pakistani or Bangladeshi) history. Without it (and without an immense amount of time), this book is better left for graduate study.That said, I will repeat what others have said ad nauseam: there is a large amount of difference between enjoyment and appreciation. Some of Mr. Ghosh's work is indeed remarkably worth appreciating; it is sometimes less than enjoyable. As a result, I'd leave it for more advanced courses than the one I taught."},{"rating":"2","title":"Complex and Compelling!","review":"I read this book for a graduate course in global English literature. It was one of the more enjoyable reads in that class. The novel is set in India and Pakistan both before and after Partition. It deals with the effects that Partition had on the cities of Calcutta and Dhaka. Ghosh's prose is clear and lucid. Told from the perspective of a young child, the novel has a lot to do with the power of story-telling and the connection of story-telling to identity. Ghosh addresses the issues of nationalism and transnationalism and of borders (both real and imagined). He forces the reader to deal with the connections between nationalism and violence."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didnt finish it","review":"I have read several of Ghosh's books but this one was a disappointment. I tried several times to pick it up and continue but finally just let it go. It is the story of a Bengali family during the partition but the book wanders.

The Autopsy is a short interlude, Irena's Theme is a long, slow piece, Night Rabbit is an atmospheric excursion with eerie feel and Leopard Tree Dream is a mid tempo number. The pace picks up for Paul's Theme (Jogging Chase), where Giorgio Moroder's characteristic electrobeat first surfaces on this album. The Myth is slow and evocative with a bit of humming by Bowie, whilst To The Bridge is another slow interlude. Transformation Seduction is a fairly interesting uptempo piece and the album concludes with Bring The Prod, a short moody track leading up to a crescendo. Fans of Giorgio Moroder beware! Cat People is nothing like his amazing disco albums From Here To Eternity or E = MC2. It might work well as a soundtrack but offers little in the way of listening pleasure and is in fact quite forgettable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gentle Giant in Full Sonic Glory!","review":"'Free Hand' has always been my fave GG release, but I've had to live with a rather shoddy sounding One Way CD reissue that has diminished my enjoyment of the music.

True Real McCoy fans will be satisfied with this release but are looking forward to a new album soon. We'll give Real McCoy one more try."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Euro-pop/techno/house CD","review":"I miss the days of house and techno music on the top 40. This album is like a microcosm of those few years. Real McCoy's first album (Another Night) contained all their biggest hits, like \\"Another Night\\", \\"Runaway\\", and \\"Come And Get Your Love\\", but this album is actually better.Great tracks include \\"Take A Look At Your Life\\", \\"One More Time\\", \\"Give A Little Love\\", and \\"Love Is A Stranger\\".The Euro-pop craze was over at this point (1997), techno and house having retreated back to the clubs and the discos. Looking back now, from an almost unbelievable distance in regards to pop music styles, it's possible to appreciate the brilliance of material like this. So slip it into the CD player and turn up the bass."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poo","review":"Alright, let's be honest, what in the heck is this ? It stinks.

True, there are a few comic moments involving some of the human characters, but the whole thing has a very 'stalk-and-slash movie' feel about it. Not that it's recommended to fans of Friday 13th-type films, as the gore isn't even convincing.But what really lets the whole thing down is the poor quality of the dinosaurs. Cheap, rubbery creations which are too ridiculous to be frightening. A rubber Raptor even laughs at one point - anything to stay sane whilst appearing in a film of this poor quality, I suppose.Apparently there are two sequels. Why?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Not Jurassic Park, not impressive puppetry, but still good.","review":"So, I watched this and its sequels when I was kid. I liked it then, and I like it now.

The Dinosaurs do not stay in any kind of scale, jumping from large to medium sizes and back indescriminatley. The acting is very bad. A stage is obviously used for a scene in which a sheriff fights a small man sized Dino (maybe a Raptor - but in this movie it was just as likely T-Rex).The roads in this scene are black with no curbs.But the worst part of the movie occurs when a woman chained to a big construction machine is attacked by one of the Dinos, if you pause the movie and go through the action frame by frame you can see that the woman is being shaken by a human hand, not a Dino at all.I have liked several Roger Corman classics, B movies that are bad, but fun to watch anyway. I can not reccomend Carnosaur to anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well, wasn't that special!","review":"The film isn't that bad. It's kind of interesting. The special effects (if you could call them special), however, aren't up to the standards established by \\"Jurassic Park.\\" I mean what did you expect? But \\"Carnosaur\\" is quite impressive and entertaining. You'll probably like it if you're fond of Godzilla movies.The story of \\"Carnosaur\\" is about a female scientist (Diane Ladd) who wants to put an end to humanity and return the world to the dinosaurs, \\"The Age of Wonders.\\" The dinosaurs are returned to the world at first by injecting DNA into chickens. The dinosaurs then hatch from the chickens' eggs. Later, a virus is formed, infecting people and causing women to give birth to the behemoths.The end to the film is not what one would expect, but if you enjoy some-what low-tech special effects, far fetched storys, and violance that's kind of cheezy, then \\"Carnosaur\\" is the one for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"This film is seriousley screwed up","review":"This film is absolutley horrible.

In return, He would like a little love from us, you & me. I have read books about the passion of Christ before, but this one really brings it home in a very personal way.

Also considering Welles age at the time (25) was impressing.

Boy was I disappointed. The movie, supposedly based on the true-life news tycoon Hearst, is truly boring. While technically it has a lot of merits -- the editing, the cinematography, the make-ups -- the story itself is really difficult to follow. I paused the movie numerous times, because it was painful to go on watching it.After finally finishing the entire movie, I took out a few books on movies and read the relevant chapters on Citizen Kane. Of course they all sang high praises to the film. Then I watched it again, this time looking for the \\"classic\\" moments as described in the books, but once again I found the film disorienting and painful to watch.If you've never seen this movie, you may want to rent it first to see if you can stand it.

Neither work has the greatest story, but both are presented with such style that the reader or watcher is blown away in amazement."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great movie, above question to the name","review":"Great buy, excellent shipping, above all one of the most greatest movies of all time on movies making. Powerful heart and driven story. Worth the buy original quality meets the buyer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Still an amazing film","review":"Citizen Kane although dated is still one of the best films ever and the blue ray release demands that it be part of your personal collection."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not very impressed with it","review":"After all the hype surrounding this film I decided that I had better watch what was supposed to be the best film of the century. Maybe I expected to much from it but I was not impressed at all. It wasn't at all engaging and wasn't a very interesting story. Pity! I expected more"},{"rating":"2","title":"how does the greatest movie ever get 4 out of 5 stars????","review":"people are stupid-----------how could anyone rate this movie anything other than 5 stars. this movie is brillant; it is by far the most infleuntal film of all timewatch this one-- everone should watch this film many times"},{"rating":"2","title":"A True Classic!","review":"What more needs to be said about a true Hollywood classic. However, this two-disc edition has some great additional features that make you appreciate the movie even more."},{"rating":"2","title":"Citizen Kane -- two disc edition","review":"This is a terrific combo -- the classic movie itself on one disc, and the other disc that documents the battle over the movie, led by William Randolph Hearst. I used both discs in my Mass Comm class to show graphically the power of the press and films. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great film","review":"I viewed this film this past weekend and i'm ashamed to say that i had never seen it before. The acting was the best, story telling, music, design of the movie was all wonderful. I realize that this film is rated the \\"Best of Hollywood\\" and i can understand why. My only fault that i see with this film, and it might just be me, but i don't think it's a film you could watch over and over again. But don't let that stop you from really enjoying and great piece of work and i'm so glad i finally know who \\"Rosebud\\" was. Great work of Americana!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Citizen Kane","review":"I'm a 16 year old self proclaimed film buff, and I can't see how people can call this film boring and overrated. True, it was made in 1941, and it's in black and white, but it's a masterpiece nevertheless. This film is noteworthy for several reasons. This work is consistently at the top of film lists. It has a special place in film history for the innovative approach employed at the time it was released in 1941. From my perspective, this film should be on the summer viewing lists for every high school student. The Rosebud symbol is still recognized even though more than a half century has passed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic film, excellent commentary","review":"I had never seen Citizen Kane when I bought this DVD. When I got it, I watched it twice; once for the film, and the second time for Roger Ebert's excellent commentary.Ebert has an obvious enthusiasm for good cinema in general and Citizen Kane in particular. With nearly every shot he provides anecdotes, trivia, and valuable insight. His explanations of the various photographic tricks (deep focus, back projecting, sets that literally split apart to allow for freer camera movement) allow you to appreciate the film on a very technical level."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Buy this Version","review":"Don't buy this version of Citizen Kane. 1.) Two of the DVDs come stacked on top of each other, something Warner Brothers (the makers of the regular and collector's version) highly do not recommend. 2.) Hairline cracks: my first copy came with hairline cracks in the feature disc and with severe cracks in one of the supplemental discs; my second copy came with hairline cracks in one of the supplemental discs; again Warner Brothers themselves warned me not to play a disc with hairline cracks. 3.) Within 5 minutes of buying this version the glue on the box failed and it started to fall apart.I thought the problem was with Warner Brothers, but they disowned any connection to the gold version. Save yourself the headache and just get the special edition version and not the Gold."},{"rating":"2","title":"Welles the Creator","review":"Apparently the film was originally going to be based on the life of Howard Hughes, with Joseph Cotten in the lead role.

And then he had to spend the rest of his life trying to live up to having made the most intelligently designed film ever at age 24..."},{"rating":"1","title":"why is this movie praised?","review":"That is a good question for a psychologist to study. Also, why those modern paintings that are just some smears are praised. All the people I know (including me) who said they tried to watch this movie didn't watch much of it because it's so boring. I don't like Wells's acting either, not in this movie or in any other movie. He's pretentious and bombastic, and when he tries to convey tender emotion he's completely fake."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awsome","review":"It was a very interesting film that would still be a competitor in today's film era and I would defiantly watch this over and over"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Movie","review":"At times this movie can be a little hard to follow, but given it's status as being one of the best movies of all time it's definitely worth a watch."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than I expected","review":"I can definitely see why this movie is hailed as one of the greatest films of the 19th century - amazing cinematography, great acting (which is somewhat unusual for the time period) and the story is beautiful, a timeless classic."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worn out filmprint, no extras, no thanks","review":"Recently bought Citizen Kane on DVD (see Amazon UK, it's the yellow sleeve with Kane looking up) but what a disappointment! Except for one theatrical trailer and a booklet, there are no extras on this disc, yet many a good documentary about this film has been made. To add injury to insult a worn out filmprint has been used: cables, dots, et cetera. Shame on the schmuck that made the decision to release what many people call the best film ever made this way!! Do not waste your money on this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overrated","review":"Citizen Kane is most likely the most overrated movie in history. Now the directing and acting are great, but it takes a whole crew to make a good movie, and Citizen Kane suffered from one thing screenplay. The bad scripts and editing make this one of the most surprising movies to me."},{"rating":"1","title":"This Movie is Dead!!!","review":"I don't even know where to begin here. I just wonder if I watched the same movie as did the rest of those people that gave all these brilliant five star reviews. This film is one of the dreariest pieces of celluloid that Hollywood ever put on. It should be enbalmed because it never comes to life! Its dead! I will never understand how this came to be voted as the number one film of all time."},{"rating":"1","title":"I TRIED....I REALLY TRIED","review":"Try as I may, I just can't seem to enjoy this movie.I got together with some friends who had all seen just \\"parts\\" of the movie before. We decided that we would watch it from start to finish, to see just why it was considered to be \\"the greatest film of all time\\".Every one of us is still wondering why.It's slow.It's boring.It'll put you to sleep faster than counting sheep.Maybe it WAS great for it's time, but can you honestly say there has NEVER been another movie made that is better?I can't even include this movie anywhere in my top 100 movie list.But I can easily include it in my worst 100 list.This has nothing to do with my not liking \\"old\\" movies. My all time favorite is It's A Wonderful Life. And I enjoy the 1933 edition of King Kong as another example. But then again, these two movies are ENTERTAINING.Which is more than I can say for this \\"classic\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Best? It's not even a good movie!","review":"Every time I see this boring film, I feel I really wanna get out of it. It's dark, long, and tedious. I think they try hard to make people think it's a masterpiece but it is not actually! If you wanna see this film because you are convinced by those critics voting it for the best film ever, you will find yourself deceived later I warn you."},{"rating":"1","title":"THE MOST BORING MOVIE I'VE EVER SEEN IN MY LIFE","review":"I consider myself an analytical individual. If this film is for the intellectuals and analytically minded, then this analytical personality must be nine cents short of a dime in the cerebral department because I found this to be the most boring piece of schlock I have ever sat through in my entire life. So for those \\"intellectuals\\" who think they are better than everyone else just because they happen to like \\"Citizen Kane\\", I'm proud to be an idiot who likes movies for escapism and not for analytical purposes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rosebud...give me a break","review":"I have heard for years that this movie is innovative, a bechmark of quality, amazing, etc. I really don't see it. Does anyone actually care at all about any of these characters? Quite honestly, by the time the end came, I was thrilled that this clown bought it - what a piece of self serving nothing. This is the kind of writing I would have done in college for a class titled Pretense 101. Give me Captain Ron or Army of Darkness anyday."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"For all the talk about how painstakingly this was reproduced, I can't for the life of me understand why it isn't available in the original widescreen format. This is visually a very nice reproduction of the film in TV format, but we will not see Welles' vision until it is produced for DVD in its original format.The soundtrack on this is horrible. The sound is reproduced at a very low volume, forcing you to turn your TV volume way up. Then the few musical moments come blaring out at top volume. A little bit of compression and attention to detail would have taken care of this."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a blunder!!","review":"It sounds so great. Just what I've been waiting for, Citizen Kane on DVD with lots of stuff as a bonus. THEN YOU READ \\"Aspect ratio, full screen standard\\". This is not the original theatrical frame, you know, with the black bands above and below. The left and right sides have been cut off so the TV screen is filled. What a stupid decision to present what is still considered the greatest american film ever made in this way. I'll wait till the real thing comes out on DVD to buy. RG"},{"rating":"1","title":"Sorry, couldnt feel or care for C.F. Kane at all.","review":"If this movies underlying theme was Kanes loss of his youth and innocence symbolized by his sled, and that it affected his later behavior, then they did a terrible job conveying that on screen.Kane didnt seem all that distraught by having his wealth and power. He didnt seem regretfull that he had allowed his life to lean this way. The people he interated with gave more clues to the man then Orson Welles wooden performance. All I saw was a man who wanted to do good and burned out early and yet I didnt feel none of the passion of someone of his position and abilities should have radiated on the screen."},{"rating":"1","title":"I expected a lot more than this from the greatest film ever.","review":"This film is nothing but pure hype. If the film is not good enough to claim the title of the greatest film ever made, it should not be claimed that title. It's ridiculous to choose this film over many other great films to hold the title of the best American film. Citizen Kane is not for those who truly love great movies. It's very disappointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Even reading all positive reviews can't save this film.","review":"what Citizen Kane has been trying to do for several years is to convince people that it's a good movie. But it fails miserably. They need to realize that it's really hard to perfume poop. Citizen Kane never fails to stink."},{"rating":"1","title":"This a boring movie, but a great documentry,","review":"I know this is supposed to be the greatest movie of all time but I just could not get intreasted in it even though I spent twenty five dollars on the dvd. THe movie is very slow although for a movie made 60 years ago it looks good on dvd. It is just very slow I watched it for a hour and ten minutes and finally took it out. The dvd set was not a complete waste of money though beecause I enjoyed the 2nd disc documentry a lot and found a new formed respect for orson welles. I was looking foward to the War Of The Worlds radio broadcast but can not found it on either of the discs, Does anybody know where its at or if its not on my disc for some reason."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cinematic disaster!","review":"Citizen Kane is a hymn to all filmmakers who have ever tried to create something artistic and meaningful and failed miserably every step of the way."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't live up to the hype!","review":"I watched some part of it but couldn't get all the way through. No doubt that Citizen Kane is not a great movie, it's a boring film. I usually recycle movies I don't like, but this one was tossed into the dumpster. I am just afraid someone else waste their time watching this crap!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Why?","review":"Why is this movie on everyone's best movies of all time list? I saw it when it was rereleased in a theatre by my house last year and let me say, it was so boring I couldn't wait to get out of the there, it's too long and pointless, note to everyone who hasn't seen this movie and wants to know what Rosebud is it's the name that was on a sled he had as a child, and the movie takes what seems like a zillion hours to finally tell you that. AH what a boring waste!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Pure Hype!","review":"I couldn't wait to get this movie, really thought I'd been missing something for years.

Orson Welles really out did himself."},{"rating":"2","title":"Revolutionary","review":"I first saw this movie several years back, when I was just in seventh grade.

Maybe that is what it takes to appreciate this film."},{"rating":"2","title":"best of the best","review":"It's a dark vision but an honest one. A shattered, volatile alcoholic, once almost an opera star and the ex-wife of a deceased magnate, says to a cynical reporter at dawn, \\"Come around and tell me the story of your life sometime.\\" Moments like that touch a deep core of humanity, and that's why the film endures."},{"rating":"2","title":"Greatest Movie Ever for a Reason","review":"Orson Welles at his finest. Any time he won artistic control of his movies, he made greatness. I could hardly imagine how difficult it would be to make the greatest movie ever and do it as your first movie before your 26th birthday. When you look at movies, there is before \\"Citizen Kane\\" and after. There were so many innovations in that movie that have become standard now, some people fail to realize how great this movie is. It has everything."},{"rating":"1","title":"A perfect candidate for MST3K??","review":"whew what a stinker. I don't really care if Welles was the first to use a certain camera angle, that doesn't create excellence in my book. Somebody should re-release this with some sort of on-screen drinking game, it might make it a little more tolerable - of course it may just depress you into a suicidal alcoholic stupor and you'll end up bitterly bemoaning the loss of your childhood crap you gave up for wealth and power. It isn't even that I dislike Welles, I enjoyed him in the Third Man and The Muppet Movie (<---joke). Good movies tell stories capable of engaging the audience, this didn't it presented an obituary with a lot of bitching. Look up something by Lang, Jodorowsky, anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't forget to bring a pillow if you decide to see it!","review":"Absolutely boring! I didn't care what \\"rosebud\\" is but just painfully waited until it ended. You will not find this film satisfying as you expect. I've found the good reviews here about this film are exaggerated. I strongly believe that the majority of the people who ever see it will consider it as a BAD film. Actually I gave it only 1.5 stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a Rip Off","review":"This is the first time I've ever ordered anything from Amazon that I was not pleased with. I ordered this movie as a Christmas gift for someone who had always wanted to see it. When she plugged it into her player, it wouldn't play, but displayed a pop-up message with something like, \\"This movie is for a region other than the one that you're in.\\" I was thoroughly embarrassed, but had no idea what to do since neither of us had ever heard of such a thing.Very disappointed. I've seen the movie and it's a wonderful classic, but this \\"region\\" thing was a rip-off."},{"rating":"1","title":"dvd that won't work","review":"Put dvd in player and \\"check reginal code\\" popped up.Never got to watch it. Asked cable people what that meant and they saidIt was a bad recording."},{"rating":"1","title":"not as good as welcome to spring break","review":"this film is of decent quality, but falls far short of such classics as welcome to spring break. welcome to spring break has a fat man who screams \\"gators\\" for no apparent reason. citizen kane does not. also, it fails to feature wwf wrestler kane, an inexplicable omission given the title."},{"rating":"1","title":"A waste of time!","review":"I honestly think if noone can make a film more entertaining than Citizen Kane, we should never waste our time watching any films.

Oh my god!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Grossly overrated","review":"In its day ( Note: IN ITS DAY ), this was ground breakingstuff. A young punk lashing into the newspaper industrywith such gusto and giving people a glipse of somethingthey may only have suspected. But that does not make it aclassic and I don't think it stands the test of time at allwell. Welles should be more correctly remembered for theimpact of \\"The War Of The Worlds\\" broadcasts - that trulyshowing his impact within the wider reference of the cultureof his day.Citizen Kane is at best a chapter in a life - and probably justa footnote if the truth be told.Could such a movie be made now with Mr Murdoch owning Fox?Of course not."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'M NOT PRETENDING TO BE SMART!!","review":"I love what one of the reviews below said about people not having to pretend to be smart to like Citizen Kane.

This is not one of those."},{"rating":"1","title":"It was a confusing movie that had me bored!!!!!!","review":"What does rosebaud mean? Citizen Kane starts out with Charles Foster Kanb dieing at the bigining. Then is goes on with newsreels all about his life, like what he did. This movie is very confusing and hard to follow and understand.Charles Foster Kane does not know how to love, infact he gets married twice and does not love his wife he just wants somebody to love him. All he cares about is his newspaper buisness and nothing else. Kane dies a lonly and unmissed man. If i were to rate this movie it would be a 2! It is a very weird and confusing film!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"AS A CLASSIC MOVIE LOVER....","review":"I just want to say that NOTHING, absolutely nothing in the world could make me sit through this travesty ever, ever again. It is mystifying to me, with all the great films out there that this piece of ponderous intellectualism would be voted as the number one film of all time. Obviously, there are many who agree with me. This is one of the worst films I have ever sat through and believe me ...it took a lot. I dozed several times during the viewing and when I woke up had to back up to the places where I dozed off just to see if I had missed anything.....(I hadn't). This is the most overrated picture I have ever seen and certainly not worthy to hold the title of \\"Best film ever made\\". That is a laugh!! Needless to say, I sold mine for 12 bucks at used CD store."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring and aged","review":"This is supposed to be one of the greatest, if not the greatest, film ever created. I found it to be incredibly boring. Kane himself is an interesting character, but the story takes too long to develop. It drags out and leaves you wanting much more, much quicker. I'm no film buff, so I'm sure I missed all kinds of symbolism etc, but this movies just didn't do it for me. If your looking for an entertaining classic, I'd try Ben Hur or Cool Hand Luke."},{"rating":"1","title":"I SAW IT FOR MYSELF AND I CONCUR WITH THE ONE STAR REVIEWS","review":"Of course everyone has a right to their opinion. If you love this film and revere it as many have done, wonderful. If you don't like it, like me, then respect that opinion. Not everyone is \\"intellectually minded\\". There are those of us who feel with their heart and not with their head. I am one of those people. That's why I cannot get into Citizen Kane. I tried to view it objectively and I just cannot get into the \\"art\\" aspect of this film. I'm not going to say it is overrated or underrated. For me, this film is not one I would ever want to see again or ever buy. It took me 3 days to watch it as I could only watch it during 15 minute intervals. That is all I could take. Again, this is my opinion and I respect those that hold this film dear and love it. I'm sorry that I'm not one of those."},{"rating":"1","title":"The best film ever made!?

I can't believe this list price."},{"rating":"1","title":"Most Overrated","review":"I've heard all the explanations as to why this is supposed to be the greatest film of all-time, but the bottom line is: it was boring. Why should the audience care about a guy who has everything and insists on being miserable? The only thing Kane seemed to enjoy was his \\"tortured loneliness\\" shtick, and so he died alone.

It was given to me as a Xmas Present, I sold it back to the Trade In Stores for about 2.50... Save your money .

When I tried to return the tape to the company, they refused to replace it, citing a 30 day return policy. I don't want my money back; just a working video. But no luck.

When the movie started, I already knew this one was a mistake. I sat through the whole thing patiently and in the end I felt very cheated out of a buck and a couple hours of my life I could of spent doing something else. The acting, characters, script, and plot were pathetic. The ending that people keep mentioning wasn't a big deal at all. This movie was not artistic as some claim. It wasn't entertaining.

When movielovers can speak out their minds, the result is \\"the truth about it.\\" I'm not surprised why this film got so many negative comments. I hate this film since the first time I saw it on Video tape 10 years ago. It is so pointless and boring. The character is not what we care for. You can't make a good film with a poor script. Citizen Kane is a good example of how a film fails to entertain people by its storytelling. No doubt it's not the best. It is not even a good film. I give 2 stars due to the effort that they tried hard to make it good. Sorry, \\"it doesn't work.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Not very good...","review":"It starts like a horror movie, exemplified by dying Kane's melodramatic uttering of \\"Rosebud\\". It tells the story of Hearst-like character in flashbacks. His early successes ( the fact is that he was already rich to start with), marriage to a boring woman, his failure to win an election because of his devotion to his mistress and then I stopped watching, reminded me of those boring Lenin documentaries' that I watched as a kid in Soviet Russia - given that I had no choice and one Channel to reckon on with. Again you are fooled by stupid people who for reasons best known to them call a tabby cat ( Citizen Kane) a Lion ( any Satyajit Ray movie). Hearst was right to oppose this garbage, I would too, since it is so boring.

For its time indeed, and even now, arguably. The question is whether you think it is. For some, it is a movie thats disconnected with the public. Movies like Schindler's List and Saving Private Ryan, or Gone with the Wind, have this \\"connection\\" to the audience that almost forces them to feel the essense of the movie. I prefer movies that appeal an audience, not a bunch of critics who don't eat a Mc.Donalds and drive Hondas. Those critics have their opinions, the public has theirs. It is a good, movie, yes it is a great movie. And to some it may even be the greatest ever made. But of course thats just an opinion. I think there are movies that do things better. If you want to see a good movie, see Red Violin, Shine, Forrest Gump, Saving Private Ryan, Schindler's List, or Starwars or something. But Citizen Kane is one of those movies that you must see, not just hear about, to believe. See the movie, THEN make an opinion, not vice-versa."},{"rating":"2","title":"Often.....Weird?","review":"This film was revolutionary....at the time. Today we see it as a masterpiece.

How someone could convey so many tacit aspects of a larger than life character and keep him real without making him a cartoonish buffoon is an amazing feat when you think of the life experience you need to live for the kind of perspective necessary to avoid a very easy pitfall such as that.This DVD should be a staple to any self-respecting DVD collector...it can't possible disappoint you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply the best","review":"At the age of 25, Orson Welles burst onto the Hollywood scene with this masterpiece. The fact that this film is in black and white and is considered the best ever made unfortunately scares away many from my generation; little do they realize that this was perhaps the most modern film of the period. From its revolutionary (and still awe-inspiring) visual style to its memorable performances, Citizen Kane is a genius accomplishment. Welles, like a sponge, soaked in the qualities of world cinema (primarily European cinema) and used these tools to create a film that is unlike anything before or since. The heartbreaking story of Charles Foster Kane is the embodiment of the American Dream in all its glory and folly, providing a mature and modern outlook on the fallability of man. Surprisingly entertaining (it's actually quite funny), this film says more than the first two Godfather films, and in a third of the time, no less. It is necessary viewing for any film-lover."},{"rating":"2","title":"The greatest film ever!","review":"You can love this or hate it I don't care but for me it is PERFECT!

Orson Welles is the best director for me anyways. The way the film upset people is good if a film is contrversial it will be the greatest thing ever. Critics focus to much on the Deep Focus this film is much more than that. As ritual I watch this film every month! This is clearly the greatest film of all time"},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic Film","review":"The movie is one of the best cinematographic works ever.

What I can say, is that a film consists of many aspects from the story, the screenplay, the actors/actresses, visual, art, ...etc. Orson Welles, had simply push the boundaries of many if not all of these aspects, either from an artistic or/ innovative point of view. Simply buy the film and watch it how many times you want and then you will realize that you have something special in your hand. This is my review after I watched the film 2 times only, I'm looking forward to watch it again and again, because there is so much to watch."},{"rating":"2","title":"Behind-the-Scenes Story is Almost as Intriguing as the 1941 Classic","review":"This lengthy examination on the large-scale, take-no-prisoners lives of both William Randolph Hearst and Orson Welles examines just how much the two personalities had in common, how their winding roads intersected, and why a high-stakes showdown was almost inevitable once the Welles parade stormed Hollywood. It's a thorough, unbiased glimpse into both men's lifestyles, triumphs, mistakes and defining moments. The documentary is a bit on the long side, but in retrospect I can't imagine which slab of material could've been sliced away. It's all integral to the big picture. Considering all that led up to it and everything that worked against it, it's something of a miracle this film ever saw the light of day.

What a letdown. There were a few good individual scenes and shots, but as a whole, the film wasn't that great. The cinematography wasn't very good either. If you want to see a good example of black and white cinematography, buy or rent Satyajit Ray's \\"Pather Panchali\\", \\"Jalsaghar\\", or \\"Charulata\\". Also, Vittorio de Sica's \\"Bicycle Thief\\" and any Akira Kurosawa film. I am a fan of the classics, but CK didn't appeal to me at all. There has been much, much better black and white photography, not to mention more entertaining."},{"rating":"1","title":"why do people like this movie?","review":"I have never understood why this movie is consistently rated as the best American film ever made. The cinematography is too dark almost the whole time, making the viewer strain to see faces clearly enough to tell the characters apart. The plot is too psychological to follow without effort, and Kane himself is not a good enough character to justify such effort. I never felt strongly enough about him (either way) to care about anything he does or experiences. Basically I would rate this movie as a pretentious waste of two perfectly good hours."},{"rating":"1","title":"Citizen Kane: Spoon Feeding \\"Brilliance\\" to Americans.","review":"Yes, how bourgeiosie to love this film! \\"BAAAH,\\" says a gullible American public. It is probably otiose to recommend, in reviews or in conversation, a film that is a classic, especially one so waywardly eccentric as this one. It is true that a taste for Citizen Kane must be acquired and that a comparative few will find it worth acquiring.The American Film Institute made this film the #1 film of all time. Why? An incestuous and sychophantic group of directors, screenwriters, actors, actresses, and producers, a largely insulated and undereducated lot, have perpetuated a myth of \\"brilliance\\" around this film. Given the high expectations around the film, it necessarily must attain a higher status than would otherwise be expected."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't try to perfume poop!","review":"Some people are trying to praise Citizen Kane.

He dies and drops the ball, it shatters. A nurse enters the room and is viewed through the leftover shards and contents of the glass ball on the floor. Nothing in any film up to that point had ever thought of such a cinematic touch. Genius.2) A woman is screaming at Kane as he desends a staircase, he opens the front door and a car horn sound mingles with and replaces the screaming. Blue my mind!3) Camera is placed underneath the floor, we look up at Kane, from shoes to head. Exciting extreme angle.4) In Kanes' pleasure dome, a new scene begins with a cockatoo screaching in close-up, flying away. The body of the bird did not seem solid, I thought I could see though it. Shocking sensation.5)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth my time..........","review":"I recently had a review for this film deleted. So what, if I don't care for it, freedom of speech Amazon.

No widescreen, Dolby 5.1 Surround, and it's in black and white. In the scene in which Kane goes after political boss Jim W. Geddes, he just stops on the stair landing -- it would have been a lot cooler if he pushed him down the stairs.There's very little action in this movie, just a lot of talk, talk, talk about Kane. There's sort of a plot, which is about finding out what \\"Rosebud\\" means. Then, at the end of the movie, you only find out it's his sled. Huh?

I even tried rewinding it but nothing happened. I thought maybe it was just the music from the movie, but I don't have a CD player so I can't find out.

And yet, I find it almost unwatchable.Sure, if I point to individual elements of the film (the structure, camera work, script, symbolism, theme, etc.) then I'm impressed. But no matter how many times I watch the film, I remain emotionally unaffected. I don't care about the characters, I don't care what happens, I just don't care.I honestly envy the reviewers who find it emotionally compelling. But I've given it several chances, and it gives me less humanity than Kane gave the people in his life. A case can be made that Welles employed the imitative fallacy, and the emotional distance I experience mimics Kane's emotional inabilities.

If I could notice it, well anybody could.On top of that it seems cloudy throughout the picture.As I understand it Lowry (Now owned by Dolby Digital) did the transfer.For what many belive the greatest picture of the 20th century I'm greatly dissapointed.Citizen Kane is a GREAT film.

Universal, no.","review":"Approaching Welles' work from a literary perspective, _Citizen Kane_ is most stunning not so much for its actual script as for the utter uniqueness of its genre. Welles' great genius lay, I believe, not so much in crafting a subtle a striking exposition of human ignorance so much as in doing so entirely outside the bounds of conventional storytelling.In this way, I think Welles truly was Coleridge's twentieth-century successor. His originality cannot be understated.And for that reason, _Citizen Kane_ is not nearly as accessible as most other movies. By artistically (and I think successfully) refusing the restrictions of commonality, Welles dangerously risked alienating viewers. I find the opinion that _Citizen Kane_ is virtually inscruptable to be perfectly fair, and would go so far as to say that I don't think anyone can know it entirely.Like a good book, _Citizen Kane_ has as many meanings as it has viewers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Review of Blu Ray version","review":"Citizen Kane is quite rightly praised as one of the best American movies of all time. That's not the problem; the problem is this Blu Ray print which I find to be overly contrast-y. So much so that there is little detail in the blacks. This is not the way I remember seeing it previously, and I don't believe that the brilliant cinematographer Gregg Toland would approve of this transfer. I also A-B compared it to a previous DVD special edition, and I don't find the resolution of the film much improved in the Blu Ray version. Indeed, I think I prefer the contrast ratio of the DVD version, which in itself I find also is problematic as far as contrast ratio and overall view-ability.

I haven't seen part 2 yet, but this is not even close to being as good as part 1. The directing job is not bad and the cheesiness is at a bare minumum, but the movie just isn't that interesting. There is 1 very funny clown fight scene, but the rest of the fights are just average. The finale is pretty intense with some good vehicle stunts and a bunch of shootouts.

ASCAP had never heard of it when I called - and this was a few years back so something may have changed by now. But I doubt it.

Wyman's strong suite has always been his lack of pretense, which here only surfaces on three classic tracks Rio, Suzanne, and the immortal Lolita anthem, Je Suis en Rock Star, which alone is worth the price ofthe album. The rest is disposable. Fans looking for quality music would be better directed to Bill's more recent Rhythm Kings collection."},{"rating":"1","title":"You'd think he'd learned something","review":"This third solo album by Bill recovers somewhat from the disappointment of Stone Alone. Je Suis Un Rock Star is a fun track and almost worth the price of admission. The rest is barely competent disco masquerading as tuneless art rock. And Bill *still* hadn't realized that he can't sing! A fourth solo release followed this disc, but it was, thankfully, never allowed to leave the shores of Japan. Bill's Rhythm Kings discs are far superior to this or any previous disc because, 1. Bill doesn't write all the songs, and 2. Bill doesn't sing all the songs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible Editing makes this unreadable","review":"One is so completely distracted, confused, and frustrated by the poor editing of this B Jain Pub Pvt Ltd (April 19, 2002) edition of Hahnemann's Organon that it renders the text unreadable.

The side characters are a joy to identify with. The author does such a great job in his description of New York gay and drag queen life that it is convincing, a joy to read yet touching and sad. The only critism I have is the love story of Danial and Blaine is a trifle short. But then it may be because I wished the book could have been thicker. I will definitely buy the second book, \\"He is the One\\" by Mr Beck..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not as good as the rest","review":"Ok after much thinking and soul searching I had to drop a star from the rest of the books. This being the team of Timothy James Beck's first book (team of 4 writers) the flow did not match book 2 or 3. That being said this was not a bad book. It is a good book to read but read it FIRST. I read book 2 first without knowing it was a series and LOVE #2 but going back and reading book 1 was kind of strange as I was peering into the past.All of the bad being said I just LOVE the characters and how developed the writers make them. They are not just characters in a book but they become like your friends. You just know how they are feeling as they discover themselves and finally admit to their own being and sexuality. If you read this book then be sure to pick up the rest. You will love where the stories take you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun reading...highly recommended!!","review":"I've been wanting to read this book for a while now and finally got to it.

These drawers are a little on the small size, but that just means a couple more than you would have in a dresser.The finish is super-durable, and looks spectacular.

Clearly he had loads of fun with this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Strangest Book Ever","review":"This is one of the most bizarre novels I've ever read. The novel starts off very well--witty, light, very British, and poised to be a good historical mystery/thriller. However, almost exactly halfway through, the author introduces mysterious purple gasses, a race of half robot, half zombie people, and an Austin Powers type plan to destroy all of Italy (remember Dr. Evil's Preparation H, with the chain-reaction volcanic eruptions? Yeah, that one). I'm still wondering how the setting switched from turn of the (19th) century England to sci-fi Italy, as well as how the fantastically technical doomsday plan was supposed to be carried out without the aid of modern machinery and computers. I just don't understand how a book can end so very far away from where it began.I would only recommend this book as a joke gift or as an example to use when studying plot trends or shifting genres and things like that."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Vesuvius Club","review":"I had pretty high hopes for this book because the synopsis makes it sound like everything you could ever ask for in a novel...espionage, intrigue, secret societies bent on world domination, a roguish anti-hero. Unfortunately, I couldn't even make it all the way through. It just got too ridiculous, and the plot was so simplistic it was like watching a cartoon. Another peeve of mine is that it was written in the first person with the main character Lucifer narrating, and he got on my nerves SO MUCH. He's thoroughly obnoxious, and was constantly making these little asides to the reader about how naughty and/or fabulous he feels himself to be. Plus, you can tell the author is trying SO hard to be witty and funny and he goes so over-the-top that it's like nails on a chalkboard."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'm sorry I bought it","review":"I haven't made it past the fifth chapter in the book and I honestly dread picking it up again. Reading the the reviews and description before buying, I did not realize this book is a pastiche, not a genre I typically choose. Maybe I just don't \\"get\\" it. I think Austin Powers is funny, but film makes it easier to pick up the tone. I feel like The Vesuvius Club misses, it just seems like bad writing, not deliberate humor."},{"rating":"2","title":"Clear and Concise","review":"I am always looking for plans and \\"how to\\" information when it comes to BDSM equipment and technique this is one of the most thurough books I have seen out there.

There are books and videos on the market that delv into those areas and I sincerely do not think the intent of the book is to teach the finer points of construction but rather a simplistic guide to building what you need.

Classic 1980-1990's scriptwriting bogs this film down big-time. Hard to believe, especially the guys girlfriend who is alright with him sleeping with Pam. Trust me, NO woman would just let this go so easily. Let's face it, the film's a bore EXCEPT for the nudity of Ms. Pam Anderson. Yes, she IS able to save the day her less (clothes) is more act. A very rare feat indeed, but Ms. Pam is able to pull it off (and her clothes!). You'll never see this film on T.V. in it's full form, so if like Ms. Pam (o.k. I admit I do) then buy the DVD. The beauty from Vancouver Island will NOT disappoint you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Movie Ever?","review":"Yes, yes it is. The plot was horrible Pamela Anderson is the best thing about the movie but she is only in it like half the time and the other actors are boring as hell. What stinks even worse is she only shows her breasts throughout the whole movie for like 2 or 3 minutes at best. This movie could have been pretty good but with horrible co stars a bad script and an extreme lack of nudity somebody really dropped the ball. Do not buy this movie if you want stuff with Pamela Anderson buy the sex tape she made with MOTLEY CRUE drummer Tommy Lee or get the Playboy DVD she has or the movies BARB WIRE & BLONDE AND BLONDER.

With Sterling I gave it the entire book and what a waste of good ink. I enjoy reading junk mail more than this dribble. I typically enjoy Sterling and think he has done well for the craft - but this is a stinker. The Kid is uni-dimensional, Moses-Moses never reaches his potential to impact the story and Twice-borne rounds out a crew that never really endears the reader to struggle to the next page. The plot wanders around from one disjointed event to another without interest or credibility. I secretly hoped for a flock of flying talking dogs to carry them away from the floating island - anything to add some reality and substance to the plot.

While his second novel isn't nearly as polished as his later classic \\"Schisimatrix\\", it does explore in embroyonic form, some of the same issues of identity and what it means to be human, that he did quite remarkably well in his mid 1980s work. I couldn't help but laugh as I worked my way through the pages of Sterling's early novel, observing that it's nearly as funny as some of Harlan Ellison's best satirical short fiction. For anyone who wishes to understand Sterling's development as a leading member of the cyberpunk literary movement, then this early novel of his is required reading."},{"rating":"2","title":"fun and clever","review":"This is such a strange, imaginative, interesting novel -- it's sad that it was out of print for ages, and then Wired Books brought it back, only to let it fall back out of print!

The ideas behind the story are good. His descriptions are visibly good, but it reads neither like a good story, nor like a tech manual.The problem isn't isolated to this book either. \\"Difference Engine\\" also reads slowly.

The story is really cool with great support characters and plenty of options for how to develop your character's fighting style. There are a variety of hand-to-hand, support, weapons, transformation, and magic styles to choose from and to build up. Switching between styles is not difficult at all and can be even more fun if you really get creative with which set of styles you use in each battle. There are tons of side quests and the romance options are a trip. My only complaint is that you cannot build your own character's look and you have to choose from a set of pre-made characters with their pre-determined starter packages. So if you want to start with a specific fighting style then you have to choose a specific looking character. Hopefully JE2 will be different in that respect.

You do get to customize your character, and I will say that with the sheer amount of fighting styles on top of the good/evil/neutral paths, it has replay value.The fights are fast and fun, but the main reason to play the game is the story. Bioware creates a world that is just plain cool to travel through. You walk through the cities and talk to everyone just to find out more. I would stop and admire views, the graphics are wonderful.

A little information about their reign, the highs and lows, a general overview.Unfortunately Ms Erickson seems to feel that history can be judgmental. She's also extrapolated from the record to slip in her own views of what's going on. I bought a history book that turned out to be part history and part fiction. Sorry, but I prefer my history straight.For those who enjoy history lite, this may be the book for you. For the rest, keep searching. Royal Panoply doesn't hold a candle to the record prepared by Sir Winston Churchill, and while I would like a briefer version of his History, focussed specifically on the monarchy, this particular title just isn't up to that task.In future I'll look at what else the author has published, and stay away from those who've strayed into historical fiction."},{"rating":"2","title":"A nice book for the whole of the British Rule","review":"This book is a great way to learn about the not as popular monarchs from the line of British rulers.

I enjoyed giacco and his bean!:)what's so great about it is that the stories come from different genres so whatever the mood there is always something for you and they aren't too long. the book is also written as if it were a novel. by now, it'd be great if your child could read small fonts without losing interest. i brought the book for storytelling in the first grade and everyone was surprised that the writing was so small. haha! the major plus: there aren't that many pictures so it will influence your child to explore on their own and use creativity rather than relying on the pictures.BTW, if you're wondering why I didn't get a 5 out of 5-I don't give anyting a perfect score.

Your character was creepy, the tone of that movie was unsettling in a bad way, and the lion cloth should never be cut that short on Ah-nold.Back to this movie, this is one my favorites because of the character development and storylines each charcter has throughout the movie. The Best of the Best has a dynamic cast, the late Chris Penn and a young Eric Roberts. This can stand as one of my favorite sports movies, like MIRACLE starring Kurt Russell about the US Olympic hockey them from the 70's that beat Russia.The story can be predictable and cheesy but there are heartfelt moments at the end of this long journey to the top."},{"rating":"2","title":"pop it tommy, pop it.","review":"If you want to watch a fun movie, this is it.

The revenge element, by now repeated so often by so many movies of this genre, has no useful effect any more. After \\"Enter the Dragon\\", the revenge plots & sub-plots should have been abandoned. That revenge is still a key element in most martial arts movies testifies to the lack of imagination of the moviemakers.

One of the evil Korean karate masters has one eye! Does anybody know how hard it is to fight with one eye?!Not a single casting decision in this movie makes any sense, the acting is laughable in every scene, and the plot is completely formulaic.

Yes, it's very formulaic, but the characters are fun, and something about James Earl Jones as a taekwondo coach never ceases to make me smile. The story does well to keep you interested throughout.

This album symbolizes that split personality perfectly - with the first half containing lame pop songs, and the second half getting a little more progressive. By this time ('78), The Strawbs had been cranking out albums at an incredible pace and sounded musically and creatively exhausted. Time And Life, Deadly Nightshade and Words Of Wisdom are about the only cuts worth listening to on this, their final major-label outing (they would be dropped by Arista after this album.) What is amazing, though, is that their two masterpieces - Hero & Heroine and Ghosts - still aren't available on CD in the U.S."},{"rating":"1","title":"One great song, one good song, seven fillers","review":"I had been looking for the Strawbs' song \\"Deadly Nightshade\\" for almost twenty years. You can't imagine how excited I was when I found this album on CD. Once I got it, I can't tell you how disappointing it was. Made in 1978, when disco and pompous prog rock were king, this album lives up to that standard. The song that I was searching for is still excellent, haunting keyboards (harpsichord and organ), great bass line, eerie vocals, everything that I loved about that song. The rest of the album is very much like the worst aspects of Genesis and E.L.P. albums of that time period: cheesy riffs, pompous structures, and bad song writing. If you have ever heard this song, you will still probably want this disc, it's almost worth the $10 for that song alone, however, the rest of the disc leaves much to be desired."},{"rating":"2","title":"Elastic core pull-on","review":"I am using the pull-on and it really helps helps my ankle.

Both he and another professor at my school raved about how good it was, although both myself and more thank 12 other students (in a class of about 20) were disappointed.First, the book contained too many grammatical errors--I found this to be quite shocking, especially considering that the author's partner is an english prof. I also purchased the study guide from the publisher, and it too contained a few too many typographical errors. Further, I found some of the examples in the practice problems to be inappropriate, given the weak explanation in the preceding chapter section's lesson.One positive comment I do have is that the approach or theme that the author uses from the very start of the book (using the \\"simple society\\") definitely indicates that the author made a sincere effort to reach his less-experienced undergrad audience.

I saw these guys in Tokyo two weeks ago and they turned these songs on their ear with loud drums and guitar. One question, what happned to Susan Thorpe. There was no flute player present at the gig."},{"rating":"2","title":"Somehow makes you think of Christmas","review":"Its just beautiful. Don't listen to it expecting to see God or anything, but just lie back and turn the lights out and relax to it and you'll understand. It grows on you too. I hadn't listened to the rev much since the Harmony Rockets CD came out and I was very surprised with the direction they took. Has a weird wintery feel to it. Its the kind of thing you listen to while sitting by the fire with snow falling outside the windows. Take it in a few times and it will keep revealing itself to you. Then listen to almost anything else and see how grating it feels. This thing is just really really good."},{"rating":"2","title":"Album of the Year?","review":"Album of the year? Probably not, but its the best album I've purchased this year and their strongest since their first. I've been listening to Mercury Rev since Yerself Is Steam and this album doesn't stray away from the formula that made Mercury Rev the most original band in the past 10 years."},{"rating":"1","title":"The icing on the cake, without the cake","review":"I too was lured into buying this grand bit of nothing by the lock-step critical acclaim. While I agree that there are nice sonic touches here and there, and some of the instrumental bits are just this side of interesting, the rest of it sounds like Al \\"Year of the Cat\\" Stewart's big comeback record. Ugh. I mean, honestly, has it come to this?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Overrated, but still a small gem","review":"Mercury Rev's breakthrough Deserter's Songs is a fragile, beguiling album. Overrated by UK critics on its release, it still warms the heart like very few albums can. The perfect soundtrack to a wintery night, or to The Wizard of Oz for that matter, it sounds like nothing and everything you've ever heard before at the same time. Holes and Tonite It Shows grate after a while, but Goddess On A Hiway and Opus are truly lovely no matter how many times you play them. Recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Run-away success","review":"The American Dream - battered, bruised and more than a little threadbare, but still living on in Jonathan Donahue's mind. An almost tangible sense of melancholy and optimism imbues tracks like \\"Holes\\" and \\"Goddess On A Hiway\\", while \\"Endlessly\\" segues seamlessly into the chorus of \\"Silent Night\\". Rarely do musicianship and vision meet so well, and the results are frequently beautiful. In the words of the man himself, \\"it almost makes me laugh, and always makes me cry.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Frozen","review":"Aye, this is an album that strains with agonised beauty. His voice, as those vocal chords stretch around those lyrics, instill frozen images into your mind. Images of pine woods in winter, thick with drifts of snow. Though the lyrics are a bit troublesome. \\"Holes, dug by little moles.\\" The forced rhyming continues throughout and tends to negate from the sheer precision and haunting instruments (obscure ones, by the way). But, it's a good album and entirely different to anything else I've heard. Maybe I'm just not an educated man, as far as music is concerned. But this, to me, seems very unique."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must have for the enthusiast of F1 racing!","review":"I buy one of these every year (finances permitting..they aren't cheap!)

This book, about her travels to the Far East in the 1950's, is a gem! Move over Paul Theroux, Peter Mayle, Frances Mayes and Bill Bryson.

This book is one of the most enjoyable reads I've had in a long time.

So much fun to read - impossible to put down."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointed","review":"I'm on page 58 and I'm not sure I'll get much farther. The book is full of physical descriptions, but the author, herself, seems distant. Traveling with a six year old should seem significant, but Kippy's impact on the traveling experience has gotten little attention. I'm not convinced of her feelings about the places she visits, either. Too dull for me.To compare: I really enjoyed KITE STRINGS OF THE SOUTHERN CROSS and TALES OF A FEMALE NOMAD. I finished Without Reservations, but liked it less than the first two books."},{"rating":"2","title":"A nice little movie","review":"Kind of interesting, though Julia seems to be just picking up a check in this one.

Can watch over and over again and be exited a new. Loved it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Notting Hill","review":"You know, after reading some of the reviews on this movie, I'm wondering what kind of people wrote them, this movie was the best movie of the year! Julia Roberts and Hugh Grant were wonderful together!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Hated It","review":"I absolutely could not stand this movie!!! The only reason I watched it all the way through was due to the false hope that it might get better - it only got more and more lame as the movie dragged on. Mediocre acting, boringly predictable plot, and no believable chemistry between Julia Roberts & Hugh Grant. Absolute waste of time, complete rubbish. -_-"},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointed","review":"I had heard so many good things about this movie, but I didn't like it. The filming and scenery were lovely, but overall I thought the story was just not a great story - mainly because the character Julia Roberts played was so self-centered and rude, according to her mood. I had real trouble believing in any real basis for the attraction of the two main characters, especially after Julia Roberts' character had an extremely unjust and childish tantrum that rendered her character almost revolting. At the end of the movie, I wished Hugh Grant's character had hooked up with the \\"nice\\" blind date, who seemed a far better person and fit."},{"rating":"2","title":"One Of My Favorite Movies!","review":"What is better than Julia Roberts? She is my favorite actress. Plus Hugh Grant isn't too bad, because English accents are hot. I have seen this movie a dozen times, and never tire of the romantic comedy. The famous line is \\"I'm just a girl standing in front of a boy, asking him to love her.\\" It's kind of an interesting chick flick, because it's told from a guys perspective."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not Julia's finest","review":"A thoroughly enjoyable movie and I highly recommend it in spite of Julia Robert's less than stellar performance. I have been a long-time fan of Julia so maybe it was the writing, maybe it was the directing, maybe it was the casting - but it is almost as if she would have preferred to have been somewhere else. Other cast members are spot-on for their characters and make the movie worth while."},{"rating":"2","title":"nice understated romance.","review":"It has the most intimate of british humour (notice the spelling) with Hugh Grant's friends and family. The romance is great though the story is a little roller-coaster-like. Definitely a recommendation by me."},{"rating":"2","title":"a very enjoyable movie!","review":"There is so many videos around which cry out \\"Hillarios! Two thumbs up!\\" - you believe it, you watch it, and you end up severely disappointed. Lets face it - most new movies are dull and boring, and the plot is predictable from the very beginning. This one is different. It does not promise much on the box, but delievers an evening of enjoyment. A combination of Hollywood-style film making with a british cast of actors resulted in a love story with excellent (much wittier than you would usually get from a standard Hollywood-made \\"comedy\\") humor. Honestly speaking, this film was a pleasant surprise for me, and I don't remember when my family and I laughed that much. It is witty, it is very well done, it has excellent actors - everything you want from a movie to relax after a busy day."},{"rating":"2","title":"what a quiet achiever","review":"When \\"Nottinghill\\" was shown in my local cinema, I opted not to watch it. I thought it would be one of those Hollywood movies with those too good to be true story line. My friends who went to watch it told me that it's a wonderful movie & still, I stood my ground. Lately, with the release of DVD, I decided to watch it one evening when I've nothing better to do. My intuition about the storyline being too good to be true was right. Despite so, the movie's honesty & its believeable cast made this movie very watchable. All and all, it's a feel good & heart-warming movie & reminding Joe Blogg like us out there that it's ok for us to ponder for good things that might happen to us when we are the least expected."},{"rating":"2","title":"What a sweet, heartwarming movie","review":"I have to say, though, that Honey, William's sister, is the highlight of this film, but I love the story of a famous film star and a regular bookseller. I also love the British actors showcased here, and especially, Welsh actor Ifans, whom you shouldn't watch if you have food or drink in your mouth."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Acting, Poor sound","review":"I was actually upset with the sound quality, and the music soundtrack on this DVD. The soundtrack just didn't come through very well for some reason, and the movie itself is poor. The acting is sub-par and the directing is sub-par. I just think everyone is getting used to such bad movies that stuff like this gets a great review. Oh well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nodding Off...","review":"I'm a guy that loves a good chick movie, and enjoys a good romantic comedy of even average quality, but this is neither. The unbelievable thing about this romance is not that a famous star would fall in love with a middle class bookstore owner, but that it should be with the most incredibly boring bookstore owner she could possibly have found. Hugh Grant's bumbling shtick was already getting old, but in this role he seems to degenerate into self-parody. I couldn't stand spending an hour and a half with him. Surely she could do better for a life partner. I wonder if this movie appeals to other really boring people's fantasies--no offense intended. I thought movies were supposed to be populated with interesting characters. Or is that just me?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring,very very boring","review":"If you want to waste your money, go rent this flick first. It will certainly be worth the rental fee if you have insomnia. Probably will put you to sleep in the first hour. That is if you do not turn it off before you fall asleep. Nothing interesting in this movie except watching Julia pretend there is some chemistry with a bookstore owner who said 5 words to her. It just gets worse after that. Grants family and roommate are completely dull."},{"rating":"2","title":"romantic","review":"I like the scentence Anna said to William\\"Don't forget I am just a girl standing in front a boy asking him to love her\\" Also, I am so crazy about Hugh Grant:He is such a getleman,soattractive.Anyway I love this movies."},{"rating":"1","title":"Predictable......","review":"I am generally not into chick flicks and THIS movie is one of the big reasons why! The characters were so phony, the plot was tired and the ending was exactly what I expected. Famous girl meets regular boy, they fall in love, the end. I don't even have to write a spoiler because every little girl (and grown woman) knows how a fairy tale ends...If this is your thing you will love this movie. On the positive side it's a very \\"pretty\\" movie with a beautiful setting etc, etc. Once in a while a romantic comedy or chick flick will get me going, this was not once nor a while, unfortunately."},{"rating":"1","title":"ZZZzzzzzzzzzzzz","review":"Wow! I never wanted a film to end as much as this one. I know now why it didn't get rave reviews in theatres. It takes forever to go anywhere and once it \\"arrives\\" it's leaves you saying, SO WHAT. The ONLY bright bit of acting in this movie was Hugh Grant ~ great in his stammering and perfectly-timed line deliveries and wonderful in the role of the well meaning, cheerful and simple fellow who falls for the unattainable lass, Ms. Roberts. Julia could have done much more with this role, but her performance left me wondering why she chose to play it like an actress asleep in front of the camera lens.Supporting roles were good, i.e., Grant's kooky sister and his roommie, Spike. The soundtrack is nice, and fits the mood of the story, but if you're looking for a Julia Roberts love story to end all love stories, I'd pass this one up and rent Pretty Woman instead. Sorry folks, just my humble opinion! She's a good actress and wasted her talent in Notting Hill."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pure Cheese!","review":"Don't forget the crackers for this cheese fest of a movie with your typical predictable story line and over-used Julia Roberts and Hugh.

This is for brains with limited bandwidth. Do your self a favor and skip this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"spacey","review":"My brother Jesse turned me onto this film.

There was no chemistry between Julia Roberts and Hugh Grant, and the plot moved excruciatingly slowly through most of the film. I thought the movie was a discredit to both its stars. Skip it."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT a flick for THIS chick...","review":"I would like to strongly disagree with the review written by a customer who called this movie a \\"Chick Flick.\\" I would consider \\"Notting Hill\\" a flick only for chicks (and, what would the male equivalent be: dudes? guys? jocks?) with a high threshold for nauseatingly treacly sweet trash. I also disagree with the reviewer's insistance that the acting \\"wasn't bad,\\" since it was, in fact, absolutely dreadful. But worst of all was the trite dialogue, which suffered an execution that was more painful to watch than having one's tongue impaled with a dozen rusty knitting needles. My friends and I actually shrieked in agony as we watched Julia and Hugh limply deliver some of their insipid lines. Please save yourself the trouble and do Not, I repeat DO NOT, buy this video."},{"rating":"1","title":"FALSE ADVERTISING!","review":"There are NO Spanish subtitles on this DVD, even though the technical information and the cover claim there are.

It does have its funny moments, but most of them aren't when Julia Roberts and Hugh Grant are talking. I'd reccomend looking into another DVD to buy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing Hill","review":"This was by far one of the worst romantic comedies that I can remember, and believe me I wish I could forget it. Although the movie has two talented actors in Julia Roberts and Hugh Grant, the story if flat and uninvolving. I never forged a bond with Julia's character and thought that Hugh should have dumped her very early in the movie so he would be better off and the movie could have ended. Please avoid this movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"movie revue for Notting Hill","review":"I watched this movie, but was bored and didn't care for a few of the characters.

Booooring!! And so shallow....just because she (Anna Scott) is a movie star, Hugh Grant's character puts up with all sorts of nasty behavior...I bet he wouldn't have if she was just your average girl next door. And what ever happens to the one decent woman that his friends set him up with, and he seems interested in pursuing?!! They just blew that part off. Never mind the fact that Anna Scott is a cheating two-timer. But that's okay, all is forgiven if you're rich and famous! Puuuleeez! I would have told her to go jump off a bridge! I was so mad w/ the ending...but that is life, and life certainly isn't always fair."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretty Boring Woman","review":"This movie was painful to watch and even painful to remember. Everything Julia Roberts and Hugh Grant did was either telegraphed two films in advance or as believable as Julia Roberts voting for Pat Buchanan. Never let it be said, though, that it was ever interesting or funny. Julia Roberts can be very funny and engaging, but here she just sleepwalks through her role (with occasional hystrionics thrown in for contrast). Hugh Grant is at his funniest only when trying to explain his personal life on a late night talk show. Julia Roberts fans: save yourself the trouble and throw Pretty Woman back in the VCR one more time. I'd write more but I'm getting so sleepy just thinking about it..."},{"rating":"2","title":"If you've missed this, you've missed out...","review":"This is one of about 5 films that I could watch over and over and never grow tired of seeing.All of the actors/actresses, even those with bit parts, are briliiant. The writing is great - it doesn't really 'drag' anywhere.There are parts that will make you laugh out loud, no matter how many times you've seen it.I recently upgraded to the HD DVD version - the transfer is amazing, and really brings everything out - titles of books on the bookshelves, food in the kitchen scenes, etc. - and all of the outdoor street scenes are simply beautiful.There's a 'change of season' walk (it'll make sense when you watch it) that I'd never really caught onto until I saw this film in Hi-Def.It's a winner."},{"rating":"1","title":"A predictable \\"chick\\" movie.","review":"I only watched this movie because I was a prisoner on a very long and boring transatlantic flight. Otherwise I would never have bothered. The acting wasn't bad, but it was very predictable and both Julia Roberts and Hugh Grant played their typical typecast parts to the hilt. I'm getting a bit tired of Hugh Grant's fumbling, ain't-I-a-kinda-cute airs. But apparently his affected charm is working. Julia Roberts stars as Anna, the beautiful, rich actress looking for the audience's sympathy for her terribly \\"difficult\\" life. I have a feeling that most women will love this sappy movie and will be running for the kleenex box big time! I would not consider buying this soap opera, but fans of Grant/Roberts might appreciate it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent movie!","review":"I have to admit that i have seen this movie about ten times, i can't get enough of the chemistry between Julia Roberts and Hugh Grant. They really light up the screen."},{"rating":"2","title":"Surreal","review":"That's how Grant describes his relationship with the actress portrayed by Julia Roberts in Notting Hill.The film uses Grant's formulaic hemming and hawing acting style that fans have come to expect, and rather enjoy. It's an unrealistic film, but that is what makes it so enjoyable. We're caught up in the unreality of it all.There are a few surprises along the way. Grant's character acts in ways that we don't expect a character to act. It all ends happily, but not quite in the way that we might expect it to."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best love stories...","review":"This movie shows very clearly that love is something that knows nothing of the peoples position in the world but breaks through all barriers.

This is one movie I would recommend to everyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Clearly a copy of the movie","review":"I love this movie, but hate this copy i purchased from Amazon. The picture is grainy.

I am a die hard Julia Roberts fan and loved her part as Anna Scott. I don't know, but it looked like love at first sight on anna and william's part. It was so sad to see how stars have so much trouble with relationships. William almost let anna slip throuth his fingers. Thank God the script brought them back together and finnally like the salt and pepper shaker when glued together, they would not part (got that from the movie \\"Fireproof\\")I was so glad it was a happy ever after for the both of them, true love won out."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sometimes love comes unexpectedly.","review":"I saw this movie at the cinema when it first came out and loved it right away. I don't think you can go wrong with Hugh Grant; I saw it primarily because he was one of the stars. Julia Roberts isn't half bad in it either.Even if you don't like the movie very much, the songs used in it are real gems. I also bought the soundtrack. The younger generation may not appreciate (or recognize) most of the songs, but watch the movie and see how the songs are carefully chosen for the scenes. It's a good movie to watch alone or with company. Hugh Grant will charm all the females who watch his elfish grin and self-deprecating style."},{"rating":"1","title":"Should be called \\"Nothing Here\\"","review":"It is quite possible for this film to wash over you and leave absolutely no trace of passing.There are about three or four lines in this effort which are funny however the tedium in-between does not make them worth the wait.Part of the problem with this film was that I felt that I had seen it all before. Which, of course, I had in Four Weddings. Slightly pathetic, floppy-haired middle-class Englishman falls for glamorous American who rejects him them gets back together with him and has a group of friends suffering from various disabilities.Not since \\"Intersection\\" have I spent a movie looking at my watch to see when it ended. I honestly don't know who was worse, Julia Roberts or Hugh Grant. They both became so grating on the nerves that I couldn't wait for the movie to end. The most enjoyable part of the film (aside from it being over) were the trailers they showed before it.Not worth seeing or renting. Save the money for something better... it shouldn't be that hard."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ho Hum","review":"Another movie that proves what a horrible actress Julia Roberts is (and to think here she even plays a version of herself--what a role stretch!).The lines are good, especially the scenes between Hugh Grant and his neighbor, but then they had to bring in Roberts to spoil it.

The music, however, has to be the worst part of this really, really, really bad movie. I wouldn't wish this movie on my worst enemy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Romantic but weird","review":"I think this movie is so romantic at the same time it does not make a good sense at all. She sometimes acted as if she loved him. However, she already had a boyfriend which did not make sense in a way because if she still loved her boyfriend, I thought it was so odd when she ( Julia Roberts) slept with him( Hugh Grant)while she still loved her boyfriend. So, I guess both of them have done really good acting, but the plot itself is odd. Anyway, if you would like to find romance in your life from a boring life, this movie is very good for that."},{"rating":"1","title":"Must be fun if you are a great fun of Julia Roberts","review":"Maybe I expected too much, but I could not help feeling disappointed.

The London locations are great."},{"rating":"2","title":"My new favorite movie","review":"I loved this movie for many reasons. I loved Hugh Grant's friends and how supportive and real they were. The dinner scene with the music is the best in the whole movie but when Spike (after being a fool the entire movie and unintentionally ruining Hugh and Julia's relationship) gets out of the car and stops traffic still makes me smile. I loved this movie because it is the woman (not the man) who messes up in the relationship and that is nice to see for a change. I loved the music and the soundtrack is even better.

I've seen it a couple of times, and I am planning to see it MANY more times! So should you! PS: Even the Marc Chagal painting Julia gets for Hugh is worth getting...it's cute!

She's as lovely as ever, but the rest of the movie just fit the 10 movies I have disliked the most. Hugh Grant is portrayed as a dumb guy with no self esteem whatsoever.

This movie is full of phatetic characters."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nodding Off","review":"I have yet to watch this movie, because when I think about watching it, I nod off.

Roberts and Grant played themselves and that is about it. Its a wacky British drama that is totally unrealistic and not very believable. I was glad when it was over. No movie star is going to pick up a book seller in England and then marry them. I agreed with the film's portrayal of the media but that was done better in films like Network and SFW."},{"rating":"2","title":"An updated old fashioned love story","review":"Notting Hill reminds me of some of the best 1940's movie comedies with just the right amount of drama included. Hugh Grant is just right in his role and the supporting actors are universally good. I like the separate sound track with the comments of the Director, Producer, and Writer. Of course, Julia Roberts is easy to watch."},{"rating":"2","title":"A thoroughly charming movie...Roberts and Grant's best","review":"What a thoroughly charming and engaging movie. A movie that is bound to be a classic. Julia Roberts does a fantastic job as the weary superstar finally finding love with an ordinary \\"Joe\\" travelbook shop owner played by Hugh Grant. The supporting actors and actresses in this movie are pure joy to see and develop the plot nicely. A movie that the whole family can enjoy. Hollywood has captured the magic and beauty again in this \\"old fashioned\\" romance. Highly recommended to all. Get it today!"},{"rating":"1","title":"4 weddings warmed over","review":"I just sat down and watched Notting Hill again to try and see what I missed the first time. Result: Nothing. It is a warmed over (well slightly overdone) Four Weddings and a Funeral. However the latter film had better writing and casting. I am not a huge fan of Julia Roberts anyway, but the sister in Notting Hill was a feable attemt as was the \\"Bernard\\" Character. The only asset Notting has over 4 weddings is the soundtrack. That was a greatly missed opportunity."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well-written, well-acted romantic comedy","review":"I love everything about this movie. Hugh Grant's bumbling William and Julia Robert's publicity-scarred Anna made the whole thing seem believable rather than a fairy tale. Presumably stars are real people with real lives who really do fall in love, as people do. If I were Anna, I'd be eating up William. He's just so cute. As a newspaper reporter, I was hooting through the scene where William is forced to masquerade as a reporter from Horse and Hound and interview Anna and her castmates when he knows nothing about the actors or the movie. But it's the supporting players that really make the movie. William's outrageous roommate Spike and his eccentric sister Honey will surprise you at the end of the film. Blink and you'll miss sadsack friend Bernie's crush on Honey. It's all in his expressions. William's old flame Bella, who is confined to a wheelchair, and her husband Max have real problems but also a deep, mature love. Every actor adds to this movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Right Combinations-Characters, Setting and Music","review":"A beautiful movie that is confirmed by my wife who would much rather classify it as the stereotypical \\"Woman's Romance.\\" However, I beg to differ with her, this is one to be shared between both. The chemistry between Julia Roberts and Hugh Grant is much more than magical and even while Scott's character is weaker than Julia Roberts' previous roles, she easily manages to pull out a superb performance. The supporting cast equally deserves mention for providing support to what is truly a \\"surreal\\" romantic comedy. Bonuses: Don't miss the collector's edition's deleted scenes (including an alternative final ending) and the music highlights."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Movie!","review":"This is a great movie. It's definitely not as funny as FWAAF (Four Weddings And A Funeral), but FWAAF seemed more liked an extended sitcom, whereas this feels just like a romantic comedy movie should. Okay, there are a few question marks hanging over elements of the movie and perhaps even the plot, but hey, it's a comedy, what do you expect! Buy this now and go and snuggle up with your partner."},{"rating":"1","title":"I just don't get it....","review":"I thought it was boring and predictable -- about asentertaining as skim milk -- with absolutely no chemistry between HughGrant and Julia Roberts.

This filled the bill on the first count but not on the second."},{"rating":"1","title":"Are You Sure It's Not NODDING Hill?","review":"This movie was B-O-R-I-N-G! Sure the movie was sweet(I guess) and it gets you thinking (kind of), but it was a million paces too slow and I would generalize it as weird in an \\"oh, come on...\\" kind of way. But hey, if your into semi-romantic, unrealistic movies and enjoy looking forward to the end...go for it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"The only reason this movie gets a two instead of a movie is because Julia Roberts is in it. Too bad she didn't have a good story line to work with. Waste of film. Save your money. This is one of movies that you watch on tv and say to yourself, \\"boy am I glad I didn't pay to see this movie\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Somewhat romantic but very unhumurous.","review":"Julia Roberts character to me was so unsympathetic that I didn't feel that she deserved to be with such a nice guy as Hugh's character is in this film and I was personally hoping that Hugh would stick to his guns and not go crawling back to her because the way she treated him was not very nice.My girlfriend thought that Hugh's flatmate was funny. I found him to be ignorant and boorish in the extreme.If you want to see a romance check out 'Somewhere in Time' with Jane Seymour and Christopher Reeves. Or for romantic comedy I recommend 'Doc Hollywood' starring Michael J Fox and Julie Warner."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ending rips off 'Roman Holiday'. Second hand stuff.","review":"None of this rings true, a sentiment apparently endorsed by Roberts who did not believe in a lot of her character's actions, especially over the old photographs. This may explain the lack of chemistry between the two stars and Robert's curiously stiff and un-attractive performance. I didn't believe in the press scrum outside Grant's front door, either. For a start, the police wouldn't accept an obstruction in a narrow street like that, but I won't carp on. There's the odd laugh."},{"rating":"1","title":"So-so movie","review":"Hugh Grant is, well, Hugh Grant. I never saw him as the character he was portraying. Don't get me wrong, I like Hugh. This was just not his movie role. Not Julia's best movie by any means. This is not due to any lack of talent on her part. It was just a flimsy script with some wierd roommate (Hugh's) who had no real purpose in the storyline. Not a movie I would recommend spending any money on. If you're really interested, borrow it free from your local library."},{"rating":"2","title":"Top of the Hill","review":"I have seen this film for about 10 times since it apear in cinema.

Trust me, I can assure you that you will not feel betrayed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of TIme,","review":"I was thorougly dissapointed with this sad excuse for a film. Iam a huge fan of the very talented Hugh Grant and Julia Roberts, whythey choose to do this sickeningly sweet and eerily UNFUNNY picture mystifies me. The plot is thorougly farmiliar. The main flaw is that the Julia Roberts character is THOROUGLY unlikeable! The film drags and drags. There is even a chase scene which rips off Nine Months. Go for classic Hugh instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"UGH - Romance, I think not","review":"I thought I was going to love this movie, but the only redeeming thing about it is the supporting players. It stars Hugh Grant as, well, the same bumbling fool he always plays, but we love that about him. He is the owner of a small bookstore and has a quirky bunch of friends and his life if good - lacking in love, but good.Along comes Julia Roberts as a movie star and I have to say that I hated her in this. I am not a huge fan of hers to begin with, but she is awful in this. Her character is self absorbed and downright mean at times.Why did the writers make Hugh such a pansy in this film? The fact that they end up together really bothered me. She did not deserve him after the poor way she treated him. I think in the hands of another actress this might have been better. I cannot recommend this film to anybody, even those die hard Hugh fans...sorry gals."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of my favorite movies!!!","review":"Hugh Grant at his sweetest.

I read the web site and a girl had a different oppinion about Julia Roberts. She believes Julia Roberts is not a good actor. To me Julia Roberts is a natural. She is different from other actors. She dosen't need make up, or other things on her to look nice. I've seen all Julia's movie's and she acts good in all of them. The best films were Pretty Woman, Notting Hill, and My Bes Friend's Wedding. I would like to add that I admire Julia Roberts because she plays many different rolls..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Romantic Comedy at its Best","review":"Whether or not you're a Julia Roberts fan, you'll have to appreciate her ability, in this film to portray a superstar close to her real-life situation. She is charming and funny in this movie, but has a mean streak that probably is not too far off from reality. Hugh Grant plays the perfect low-self-esteemed Englishman who doesn't look for love with a moviestar yet is unable to detatch himself from her once he's there. The supporting cast members, especially Grant's roommate Spike, keep you laughing throughout and keep the quiet and even-keeled Grant interesting. It's the kind of movie that depicts something we all, in some small way, would like to have happen to us with our favorite actor."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Romantic Comedy of Ever","review":"Excellent..Hillarious..Not just a romantic comedy but an excellent love story that is growing from ordinary life..Things that happened to William (Hugh Grant) may be hapenned to anyone-anywhere-anytime..Also excellent soundtrack."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing Here","review":"A film in which a highly-paid and quite famous female actor plays herself without irony.

Actually, I can't tell you much about his movie because I fell asleep. Yep, I did! I watched it but it just got soo boring.; You people out there LOVE Julia Roberts but just because she's in a movie doesn't make it good. This was a lame excuse for a movie that would hopefully sell a lot of tickets by getting Julia ROberts in it. It was not very good at all. And there was no earthly way to understand it. Who cares if you don't understand my review, I don't understant Notting Hill!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Notting Hill","review":"Unbelievably, Hugh Grant turns down Julia Roberts and the next moment he's announcing this to a roomfull of friends. They, without too much effort, convince Grant that he's made a terrible mistake. Then, they all immediately pile into a car (including his friend's wife in a wheelchair) and race to Roberts's hotel, breaking every traffic rule along the way. Couldn't Grant have quietly come to a realization without involving his odd circle of friends? And couldn't he have gone to try to see Roberts without dragging them all with him? I think that's what an American leading man would have done. This was an obvious effort to \\"build up\\" the ending, using all of the supporting characters. It was needless and you can see right through the scriptwriter's intentions. Also, my apology to Rhys Ifans, but I think he actually hurt the film and should have been left on the cutting room floor. He made the film hard to take seriously, which I really wanted to do."},{"rating":"1","title":"I hated it!","review":"If you took all of the dirty jokes out of this stupid movie it would be ten minutes long. This is a disgusting, and lame movie. Who would run into a mega-movie star and spill orange juice all over her and then say \\"it was surreal\\". There was probably four funny parts that I remember and the rest was sick (underline the word \\"sick\\" please). Hugh Grant is a drip, and Julia Roberts has a lot of talent which was completely wasted.

The story should have centered on the two of them together than William's family, could have been less boring and put in more comedy with them together. For example have the two of them go to some type of special show with alot of other famous people and media there and have William interact with Anne in that situation.Could have been better, too long, needs a better script."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring, wooden acting","review":"When the disc froze 1/2 way through, I popped it out. Way too much hemming and hawing from Hugh Grant (who can be very funny and even act sometimes).

She doesn't act, just has her wide smile fill her role."},{"rating":"1","title":"boring","review":"I really like hugh grant. I'm not julia's biggest fan, but still i thought this might be one of the most boring and lame yet critically acclaimed movie i've ever seen, right up there with a beautiful mind.

This film is the epitome of talky. I kept listening to their conversations and asking, \\"Okay, when is something actually going to happen?\\" I got an hour into it before I couldn't stand it anymore. It's limp, stagnant, and boring, one of the worst films I've seen in a long time. I didn't find their talking of their sexual escapades interesting. I didn't find the characters interesting. The film offers nothing but sheer boredom. The only value this film had at all for me was the fact that it's in French, which is a language I'm learning. However, that's not enough. I could only take so much tedious babble before I had to just shut it off.

I love the Post-Punk inspired guitar styling (ala Gene Loves Jezebel) and the pounding bass lines (ala Shriekback). Obvious comparisons will be made to the Cure because of the vocals, but VOB share other sonic and structure similarities with the Cure as well. They have updated this post-punk revival sound with the sound of techno-disco (ala Blue Six) and House music (ala Underworld). 4 of the 10 songs are instrumentals (ala Dif Juz), which takes courage in this vocally dominated market. VOB are fresh, energetic, and danceable, and they let their guitars sing. If they maintain their musical and creative integrity, they can become post-punk legends.Compare to:The Cure, Gene Loves Jezebel, Shriekback, The Bolshoi, Dif Juz, O'Rang, Underworld, Wire, Chameleons UK, Interpol, Franz Ferdinand"},{"rating":"2","title":"Almost famous","review":"VHS or Beta are one of those bands that could be really great, but just can't seem to get it all together to make a solid album. 4 of the tracks are wonderfully 80s inspired dance rock songs, while 3 of the 10 tracks are purely instrumental and \`Forever' just sounds like a bad disco remix.Once they get their direction straight and learn how to write some catchy lyrics, they are going to be unstoppable. The Cure/ Daft Punk comparison is unavoidable, Zeke Buck does sound a lot like Robert Smith.

Because the wires appear attached with screws, I'm hoping when the wires DO loosen or break, I'll be able to tighten or replace them.Bottom line, seems solid, and slices well, but it doesn't cut wedges.

We're also trying to get her used to waking to an alarm, so that feature is great for us as well. Every watch I've bought her has been a Timex Indiglo. They're pretty durable and the Indiglo feature is cool for parents and kids alike. Plus the price is usually pretty decent.Great watch for the money, but I was surprised at Amazon's price.

She was very happy with its looks and found it easy to understand and operate. I thought it felt a little flimsy and cheap...but hoped for the best. When I set the time for her, I found that the buttons felt weak- like they would break if pushed too hard. Its light feature died by day 2 :( Timex used to be a lower costing, but solid watch. I expected more from Timex. This is one poor quality little watch. I have seen better watches in happy meal boxes. Very sad product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Don't press the buttons in water","review":"I bought this for my 5 year-old so that she would be reminded to stop playing and go to the bathroom. The hour chime was a bit quiet so if she was playing hard she wouldn't hear it. The strap was a wee bit long and the excess got caught on things. I worked on it and got it to lay flat while still fitting her wrist. The most important thing to know about this watch is that, although water resistant, DO NOT PRESS BUTTONS WHILE SUBMERGED IN WATER. This will allow water in and stop the watch from working. My daughter loved the watch so I'm going to get it replaced."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fix the Strap and Durability","review":"This watch has been pretty good for my 8-year-old daughter, but it just broke. I bought this 6 months ago and am back searching again. The pink part of the face cracked only weeks after we got it. Ok, we can deal with that. Then when the watch got stuck in the net of a trampoline, the watch separated from the band- pins bent, holes that the pins go into were torn open, and the rest of the pink face came off. The strap was always way too big, so I'm back looking for a different model. It really is frustrating that Timex can't just make a scaled down model of the adult version. The kids ones just aren't durable and don't fit well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very functional and good features for the price","review":"Though my 4 year old doesn't use it as often as I would like, this is one good watch.Lots of features for the price and pretty solid too."},{"rating":"2","title":"BEST G.A.

In case you didn't know, Brad Nowell had one of the best voices ever recorded and this performance is evidence. Only thing is this: the way the guys placed these songs is so good, there's no reason at all to put your player on random--just let it play straight through.

If you like this check out the Police live from Boston-show from 25 plus years ago --Yes I know... but believe it or not there are a lot of similarities (three piece rock band,jammy, reggae influenced ) There are two of these Police live CD's- think they are both from Boston-the older one is nice and raw and the later one is much too polished."},{"rating":"2","title":"DAMN GOOD","review":"GOOD STUFF HERE.

Stand by Your Van typifies these differences - sometimes for worse, but more often for better. Gone are the samples, the overdubs, the loops - many of the hip-hop elements that make 40 Oz. to Freedom and Sublime so unique and great.On this live record, in place of technology is (synthetic) raw emotion. The band never toured to support its eponymous third album, which is only represented by a very raw \\"Caress Me Down\\" on this disc. Nonetheless, Sublime had more than enough material on 40 Oz. and Robbin the Hood to make this a must-have for any Sublime fan or novice.P.S.: Second Hand Smoke still blows."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the greatest punk C.D.s in a while","review":"Very good CD.

How man reacts to environmental changes(even those that are partially his own doing)can be violent and brutal. We watch as the Anastazi people are torn apart and begin to prey on one and other as they seek to appease Gods they believe to be dissatisfied.

CP"},{"rating":"2","title":"Cast Pins Story","review":"Here's an example of an assortment of fine actors, and a dedicated and imaginative director, overcoming a sloppy script. Once the Hemingway material was used up the screenwriters emptied the sack of film-noir spare parts in an effort to keep this vehicle running: the fight game, the big heist, the prison cell buddies, the nightclub shootup, the chanteuse, the double-cross. But just watching the actors delivering their lines and director Robert Siodmak's lighting and camera work make it worthwhile. And you'll never see better black and white cinematography than here. Burt Lancaster is pretty awkward in his first film, but he gives a glimpse of the power and screen magnetism he later devleoped."},{"rating":"1","title":"Enjoyable, but Highly Repetitive","review":"P. G. Wodehouse definitely can tell a funny story. The interaction between Bertie Wooster and his gentleman's gentleman, Jeeves, always bring the smile to one's face. The problem is, once one has read a handful of the over thirty stories in this collection alone, everything else is simply repetition.Wodehouse's characters are two dimensional at best. These stories are definitely intended as very light reading, as a glance through the \\"other books written by\\" page in this volume suggests: There are 93 books by this author. 93! That doesn't include the omnibuses.Wodehouse's writing is complete fluff, yet charming fluff at that. I certainly couldn't read more than two or three of these short stories at a sitting.

The focus is really on the relationship between reporter Irene Kelly and detective Frank Harriman. Solving the mystery is almost incidental. And Irene doesn't do much investigating. Things happen to her and she overlooks obvious clues (e. g., the cable truck sitting outside her house for several days). She finds herself in far more physical danger than any one person would face in a lifetime, and yet the solution to the crime pops up when she isn't even looking for it. Burke has an annoying habit of trying to misdirect the reader -- which a mystery writer is supposed to do -- but in such a heavy-handed way that no reasonably intelligent reader is going to be fooled."},{"rating":"2","title":"eye-opening","review":"This enlightening documentary explores a relatively new subject -- all-female professional football -- with humor and grace.

Epstein's strength and weakness here are one: this is a personal book. He ruminates on his experience as an editor and how it reflects the business as a whole. The anecdotes he collects are filtered through his impassioned eye, and his predictions are heavily based on what he has seen and known, not on the advice of other experts.The book's relatively loose structure is reminiscent of an intimate conversation. Is this bad? It depends on what you want. I found it refreshing and enjoyable, especially given the book's brevity. BOOK BUSINESS is a warm appraisal of a business close to the author's heart, and you won't find a more loving tribute to the art of book publishing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lots of digging required.","review":"Although Epstein gets his points across about the changing face of publishing, they are buried beneath personal tales which are interesting but distract from the pertinent information."},{"rating":"2","title":"Part Insight, Part Lament","review":"This book is by Jason Epstein who also did a series of lectures on this topic (this is from the introduction). It is part autobiography, part history of publishing, part lament, and part prediction. At times, it provides a romantic view of editors and what they wish to accomplish. It then shows where the publishers of today are not keeping with this view.For the most part, however, it provides an analysis of why things don't work they way they should. Although it seems as if Epstein is crying about it, he couches this in language that shows how the whole publishing industry remains in a state of flux and that this is just another view of this flux.The book has good flow, and it is a quick read. If you read New Grub Street and felt emboldened rather than defeated, then this is the book for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Book Business: Publishing: Past, Present, and Future","review":"Jason Epstein has had a wonderful 50 years in the publishing industry. Good for him. I respect all that he's done. But upon reading this book, which was touted as \\"the book they'll be talking about for decades,\\" I am terribly disappointed. I bought the book hoping to find some insight into the publishing world of today. The first chapter or so, and a bit at the end of the book, gave me information and his opinions, which I value. The article \\"Mistah Perkins, He Dead,\\" written years ago, however, says much more succinctly what this 175-page book for $25 ever did. And believe me, I kept hoping."},{"rating":"1","title":"What on earth did reviewers find humorous?","review":"This book is so pretentious, so show-offy, so geared to highly educated Oxbridge people, it clearly excludes the well-educated non academic reader.If you find drunkenness funny and the long descriptions of how drunkenness affects the body, I guess you will like this.I had to read it for my book club but hated every page -- no favorite characters or episodes.I hate to think the entire British public lives to get drunk but this and other literature and movies forces me to believe that no event in Britain, celebratory or shocking, takes place without a glass in hand."},{"rating":"2","title":"perfect book for existentialist beer-lovers","review":"This is my favourite novel as strange as it is.

The heroine, played by Maggie Smith, is older, has been sexually abused throughout her life, and is now the author of trashy books.

Three survivors, including a little girl, come to live in the Italian villa owned by the heroine. Then the girl's uncle comes to take away the psychologically damaged waif to America. The story then grows intensely dark and unappealing, as the heroine drowns herself in alcohol and the American turns out to be an utterly repulsive and insensitive jerk.

The survivors of the accident are invited to stay in another of the survivor's homes... a house in Umbria, surprisingly enough. The owner of the house is a older British woman (Maggie Smith) who's a bodice-ripper writer and she's always writing a story in her head. When someone speaks to her, she thinks of it as dialogue and acts out her life the way someone in one of her novels would act.I especially enjoyed, quite nostalgically, the bit where the group travelled to Siena and sat for a while on the steps in front of the Duomo.I wouldn't buy it, because I'm not sure it would stand up to many viewings, but it's surely worth seeing once or twice."},{"rating":"2","title":"My House in Umbria","review":"I purchased this dvd for a friend.

Her uncle comes to pick her up to take her back to America.I found this a charming movie and Maggie Smith a delight to watch. I loved the flowing outfits that she wore and couldn't help but think I would like her fashion style as an old woman. Emily is a bit of a lush, but kind and likable. Her character had a rough life when she was young yet she found a way to create her own life that is quite pleasant. The scenery is beautiful (according to credits, England and Italy). Maggie's acting makes this simple story interesting. I think it's worth watching. I'm sure women over 40 will especially like it."},{"rating":"2","title":"My House in Umbria","review":"A truly wonderful movie about making the best of what Life deals you.

The surviving travelers become the guests of Ms. Smith at her lavish home in Umbria. Giving more detail would only spoil viewing this film.If you are a Maggie Smith fan, you'll love this movie. If you aren't particularly a fan, you may become one.Don't look for gore, blood or wild races around the winding roads. Look for a glamorous Ms. Smith in a sensational home with cocktails at 9 A.M.

The only complaint I have is that within 2 weeks, one of the rubber covers on the feet split, followed by another about a month later. The others either split apart or fell off in less than a year, so now we use towels to prevent scratching the sink and counter. I figure why buy a whole new one when the rubber is the only part that has failed in 3-4 years?"},{"rating":"1","title":"not teacher friendly","review":"I find that the Kindle is not very teacher friendly as The Readers Theater can not be printed out to use with the class.

Oddly, the whole tale is outlined in the excerpt printed on the back cover! Johnny Reb was pretty much on his own, while the Northern troops had the advantages of the railways, and other means of transportation at their disposal. That is pretty much it! Granted, the late Fr. Holberton offers many \\"eye-witness\\" accounts of the trials and travails of the wanderings of both Federal and Confederate soldiers, yet even these become repetitive in their sameness.On a more structural note, the format offers relatively big print, and only 150 pages of readable text."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice Music","review":"Bonnie Tyler has a pretty different kind of voice that makes her music unique.

That was perfect timing for me - because by the time I'd really popped, the stretches and workouts were just enough to keep me motivated without being discouraging, and the muscles and ligaments that get worked in this DVD are exactly what need to be stretched during the Third Trimester. I've had more than a few babies, and this series has made my current pregnancy the easiest so far, hands down. (Doing the Boot Camps pre-pregnancy probably helped, too)."},{"rating":"1","title":"not impressed","review":"I was hoping this would be a challenging pregnancy workout since many i have seen are lame...pre pregnancy i had been doing the p90x program for over a year and maybe the intensity of those workouts had my expectations of Lindsay Brins to high. She is annoying and the workout is just so so. i broke a sweat only because i intesified the cardio sections. with the counsel of my doctor, i just started back with the p90x (with several modified moves, of course). i like to sweat and feel like i have worked out and this video did not do that for me. if you are not used to really intense workouts, i suppose this would be good for you. for reference, i started this at 14 weeks...17 now and still enjoying my p90x."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice workout","review":"I really enjoyed having Lindsay Brin's workout during my second and third trimester.

I liked this DVD because it kept me off of my butt and moving while knowing that what I was doing was safe. I bought this with Niece Pacenka's Pilates DVD and do that once a week as well (she will kick your butt). I also just started her third trimester DVD - either working out is getting a lot harder or this DVD is just more challenging.

What I love about this record is how slickly produced it is. Its a borderline dance album but it has plenty of Jazz, string, and flute arrangments. If your expecting something for the dancefloor look elsewhere, Beautiful is something to relax too. The only downfall with the album is that some songs are just not that good to begin with. \\"God Save the Mona Lisa,\\" Take Me to The Disco\\" are nothing special, the lyrics on those two tracks are just awful.

Sure enough, the very next selection verified my suspicions. The Ink Spots, or however many were still alive by the time these records were cut, are clearly in their dodderage on these sessions. The sparkle of their early-30s sides has long ago faded. Backing musicians aren't very inspiring either (and that's being kind!).Check out \\"You Always Hurt the One You Love\\" and you'll hear all you'll need to know to make an informed NON-buying decision.

Where is Timbaland to come save the day!? Missy needs to stop making songs w/ Fantasia and make more songs w/ Ciara bc everytime she does it's amazing! The rapping is good. On second thought-there is barely any rapping. Most of the CD is R&B;! this CD is nothing like any other missy CD. But the songs I listed above are good and u should download those.

Sadly her music is that same wackiness she's always put out. I remember her debut \\"I can't stand the rain\\" I hated it. I hated everything from her since. WAIT-A-MINUTE .... I liked that song she did with Tweet & Genuwine ... but thats a diamond in the rough. I may hate her as an artist, but I respect her as a producer/ song writer for others.

This album is simply another notch in the belt of a woman who has defied all traditional notions in the entertainment industry. This album is also a feast of tantalizing songs,is an all-natural collection of musical recipes guaranteed to feed the mind and energize the body. This is a work of pure artistic innovation. A fusion of inventive instrumentals,dynamic and diverse deliveries,and creatively constructed musical movements, as opposed to mere songs. Missy takes her boldest steps on this album,getting more intimate with her fans by providing insight into her personal life. The album is an organically healthy and appetizing full-course musical meal. This album will be successful and promoted like her other albums."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's about time!!!","review":"Now this is the true follow-up to Grammy Award winning \\"Under Construction\\". I don't know what was wrong with Missy on \\"This Is Not A Test\\" but she brought her A-game on this here. For one thing, she got rid of alot of unneccesary skits on here; there are only like three skits which is hella good for a rap album. Even though Timbaland is missed on this cd, the many different producers on this gives the album a good feel to it. It doesn't get repetiticve quickly. \\"Mommy\\" and \\"On & On\\" are the hottest tracks. Slick Rick brought his sh*t to this album too. This is one of Missy's better albums. This should go at least 3x platinum."},{"rating":"1","title":"COPY-PROTECTED DISK WILL NOT PLAY IN COMPUTER","review":"This disk has some kind of cockamamie copy-protection scheme that prevents it from playing in any computer I've tried it in. If you want to load the songs in your IPod, forget it. When you insert it, it directs you to a Missy Elliott website which tries to install an ActiveX control on your machine, probably spyware. Even if you allow this, the disk won't play. None of this is disclosed on the package. It will play on a regular CD player. I listened to it once, then threw it in the trash.

I personally love every song on the album, and her flow has never been better. This is definitely a classic for Missy. I love the old school feel that she brings at times, cause if it wasn't for the old school we wouldn't be where we are in the new school, which really isn't too much. This album is hot, one of the best I have heard in awhile, it just don't get no better than Missy.

This is just a great album and I foresee Missy having another fabulous year from this album."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Musical Recipe","review":"Missy outdoes herself on her 6th album aptly titled, The Cookbook. The album starts off unusually in the form of an untitled interlude that goes into the first banger, Joy featuring Mike Jones. Missy keeps this album afloat with hot beats and hot producers. This time around she ditches Timbaland (who only did a few tracks) in favor of producers such as Rich Harrison (Crazy In Love), Nisan Stewart (Tweet), and The Neptunes, who did the funky old school track, On & On, one of the album's many highlights. The sexy and sassy retro, Meltdown works as well as somewhat of a sequel to Missy's Pussycat which appeared on her 2002 Under Construction album. I'm really happy with this album and this is a much needed improvement of over Missy's last 3 albums. I can definitely say this a thorougly enjoyable album fresh with intoxicating beats, wise production, and Missy's wicked flow. Highly recommended****"},{"rating":"1","title":"Please Try Again","review":"How many popular songs can you sample in one album and still be considered original?? \\"Lose control\\" is basically Afrika Bambaata's \\"Planet Rock\\" instrumental with Missey hollering dance moves like a 69Boyz song. \\"We run this\\" is Sugar Hill's \\"Apache\\" just cut up and rehashed with Missey shouting \\"we run this\\". There are countless others that I do not feel like typing out. If missey runs \\"this\\" I don't want to have anything to do with it.

Runes is then separated into Frey's Aett, Hagal's Aett, and Tyr's Aett, with detailed info and an illustration for each rune. The next section of the book deals with Runic divination and Runic Magick. Casting the Runes is described, along with these rune casts: Three-Rune, Six-Rune, Seven-Rune, Cross, Celtic Cross, Sigel, and Peorth.

I've followed battletech books since I was a kid, and have basically bought and read every battletech novel since the Sword and the Dagger.Heretic's Faith was convoluted, lacking direction, and left one very unsatisfied with the rather unclimatic end. While there was the nice touch of Minoru Kurita, I think Bills over-reached in this attempt, which resulted in a pretty un-battletech-like book. No good combat sequences, glimpses but no decent overview of the political and strategic objectives and success of the involved powers, and a disappearance from the clean-cut technological warfare that raises battletech above the other sci-fi and fantasy books out there.All of Bills' published battletech work prior to this has been pretty good and hopefully we can return to that in his next novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"The slow decay of a once great franchise continues.","review":"At one time I looked forward to the release of a new Battletech novel.

But each one got progressively worse. The plots, such as they were, became more banal and dull.Heretic's Faith tries very hard to break the pattern. But, it fails on almost every attempt. By the midpoint of the book, you'll have figured out the ending. By the ending you'll be wishing that you ordered something else.

It was a compilation of their songs from the first four albums. The rest of these songs are good as well. I actually prefer their 80's material because it was more straitforward reggae.

I am serving the Lord in China currently, and the lyrics make think me a great deal of the woman over here that I have fallen in love with.

The vocabulary also is very much \\"regional\\" (mainly based on the dialect spoken in Tuscany) and so some of the words won't be understood outside that area.

I love it for the memories, I suppose, but to look at it objectively I would say this: it was the man's very first recording for crying out loud, be understanding. It dates back to 1972, so if it sounds a bit funky, it probably should. I like to listen to this as a basis to see how far he has come, how he has matured over his 30 year career (quite a bit.) Really, if you're a fan and you have everything else Manilow, this is worth having as well. It is a part of his history - and sounds it. It is his beginning. It is NOT, however, a great work, nor who he is today.

However, as I gave this record 2 stars, there must be some redeeming factor going on here, eh?Absolutely. Although the songs he takes writing credit for on this release are without exception fairly terrible (painful, even) Manilow's rendition of \\"Cloudburst\\" on side A (a tune he did not write) is beautiful. There's really not enough I can say about this song. Witty, silly lyrics, brilliantly interesting arrangement, and Manilow's vocals actually work well within the song.For the love of god, please do not buy this CD. It's still horrible.

It is in the New Testament, where Christians become to know God as a name because of their personal relationship with his son, Jesus.I found this book to be insightful to help a person to fully understand his or her Christian journey.

It offers a lot for new photographers, all the manual settings, the auto-focus motor in the camera makes it great for lenses that don't have it built in.

Someone likened it to a Barney-Coma, and I agree. It's like my son is in a trance when he watches this video, and the songs are so catchy my husband and I find ourselves singing them at work. The only problem is he cries for the remote saying \\"Barney\\" if it's not playing. We'll have to get Barney therapy!!!

Great addition to our video collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Barney video I've seen!","review":"With a creative plot and fun pace, this video gives a warm, happy atmosphere of Christmas. It's set at Hannah's house, so it's nice to see these kids as \\"real\\" with a real American house and parents. Then the kids travel to see Santa at his house and fill his stocking--Santa is beautiful and ideal, as is his workshop. Two original songs are well written and fun to sing well after the video's over. Cameo appearances of other Barney cast members give a feeling of togetherness, peace, and goodwill when everyone comes caroling at Hannah's house.This is a video we'd like to watch year-round."},{"rating":"2","title":"Barney's Night Before Christmas","review":"Super DVD. My two year old granddaughter wants this DVD playing every time she visits. We probably will wear it out. When it finishes she will say \\"AGAIN, PLEASE\\".

The editing might have been better, but I can't even really complain. Having previously purchased this team's \\"Water Life\\" trio of disks, I had a fairly good idea of what to expect, since their camera-work there was also comparable to BBC's, and you'd be hard-pressed to find anything better. There are added graphics to \\"Wild Life\\" I could do without, but all in all, I feel it is a fine addition to my collection of nature Blu-rays, and I'm fairly pleased with it. The parallels they explore with ecosystems of Central America and the Iberian Penninsula as bridges joining distinctly differing evolutionary environments is intriguing, interresting, and exceptionally beautiful."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent clips and good variety","review":"My usual complaint about nature programs is that they show the same animals again and again (aka apes, polar bears, sea turtles, elephants) and leave out the other99% of wildlife that is just as amazing and in many cases more interesting (what DON'T we know about Apes for instance). And the new age/choir music you can leave that out of my nature shows please.Like the \\"Water Life\\" series this one I will watch many times over, has a home movie feel to it sometimes but that is okay by me, just bring on the other 99 per cent of these interesting animals and leave the other overexposed animals alone!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great!","review":"I have the 3rd edition of this book and I have to say, it takes a while to get through this book, but it is really went written!

The deep dive in the replication is very valuable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible Book","review":"I bought this book expecting it to be a book on development, best practices, deployment etc. This is a poor excuse for a T-SQL book. I am on page 180 so far and only the first 20 pages or so actually discuss anything halfway interesting. The author spends roughly 2-3 pages discusing the sql syntax of a select statement, then insert statement, then update statement etc on and on and on and on. I didnt buy this book to learn SQL. What about database synchonization between the PDA and a remote sql server via remoting or web services or best practices for resolving sychronization conflicts. How about something interesting and not so junior programmer. I have looked at the end of the book and it doesnt look like it will get better. If it does I will retract this review. Regardless I have just wasted 160 pages SO FAR on learning T-SQL over again. If you want to learn T-SQL I recommend O'Reilly's Transact-SQL Programming.

It could have been reduced to about 20% of its volume to provide a little more bang for the buck.

If you are a Jet Li fan like me, you will enjoy the action sequences, though they are sparse. Creative stances and good moves from Jet save them. I recommend this film to die-hard Jet fans ONLY - kung fu purists will be very disappointed. Jet Li picks up his role as the orphan raised by Shaolin, his sifu from the previous two films returns as well. If you like Jet, and like the series, go for it. Not Jet's best, not his worst, either.

Johnson parcels out clues and new information in a way that slowly sheds light on both a previous crime and a complex current situation. Johnson provides implicit commentary on land development scams, Indian-racketeer colusion, loyalty and friendship between the lines. It's also a first rate, non-sentimental love story.

It seems like a big step backward for Cathedral. Like, all the way back to Forest of Equilibrium. I didn't like it then, I don't like it now. I LIKED the oddball doom-boogie thing Cathedral had going the last few CDs. I guess they got tired of it. So it's back to leaden riffs, no grooves, and annoying singing. I can see moving their style backwards, but it seems like they got worse as musicians, too - nothing terribly impressive on the whole record. Lee Dorrian's vocals are as...unique...as ever. Hard to take doom seriously when it sounds like that. I dunno, with a goofy voice like that, seems like you'd WANT to sing about Planet of the Apes and Captain Cook. But I guess that's just me.

I enjoy putting a drop of milk into my non-herbal teas, and basically with or without the tinsy drop of milk this tea tasted like blandly flavored water; a very vague essence of chocolate. Very disappointing.

However, the big attraction for many readers will be visual-- the striking photographs, some in color, and especially the 90 pages of drawings by John McKay. While some of the tables and descriptions of the ship's restoration might cause a casual Patrick O'Brian fan's eyes to glaze over, this book is invaluable for those who always wanted to know which rider knees were made of which wood and how they were fastened together in 1759--and in 1959.

I normally do not have a problem swallowing any pills so believe me when I say that these are tough to swallow."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mixed opinions about this product","review":"I have mixed opinions about this product. Although I felt really well in the first weeks, in the 6th and 7th weeks of my pregnancy I felt super bad after taking these vitamins. During those weeks when I was more susceptible to nausea and vomiting, I felt even worse after taking these vitamins. The smell, the taste of pills made me feel really sick in my stomach. Actually when I was vomiting I tasted the bad flavor of this product in my mouth. Today I would not recommend these vitamins. Furthermore, be careful if you are taking these vitamins associated with Rainbow 1 DHA. Please watch your vitamins intake because the excess of some vitamins may be dangerous for you and your baby."},{"rating":"1","title":"Gag a thon","review":"Although these appear to have wonderful ingredients and are just once a day, I dread taking them because I throw them back up every time, even since I cut them in half. They are so huge, so dry and so wide that it makes me cry to take them. So, for what is worth, go with the organic in the veggie capsules. They are worth taking four per day!"},{"rating":"2","title":"awesome product","review":"i was taking some other pre-natl vitamins before i found this one. The other stuff was sort of making me gag after i would take them. So i decided to look for something with a good review and decided to try this and i have love it since. Its true the pill is huge but you only need to take it once a day unlike the other stuff which requires that you take it up to 3 times a day... what hassel.....this one also has a good amount of calcium in it. Just ask my chunky and healthy 1 year old nursing daughter...she would recommend this product too..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Women's one?","review":"I received the bottle thinking it would be prenatal vitamins since that's what everything says this is.

I tried it every other day and it still was not helpful. I would not recommend this prenatal vitamin solely for the major discomfort it caused."},{"rating":"1","title":"Be careful, contains controversial ingredient","review":"I did not realize until after I ordered them and had just started using them that this formula contains raspberry leaf. I am not a medical professional but from what I've read and been advised, raspberry leaf must be avoided during most of your pregnancy because it can cause uterine contractions or some other uterine problems. In the very end of the pregnancy around your due date it's ok because it helps tone the uterus. But before that, you don't want raspberry leaf's effects on your uterus until you are getting ready to deliver. By the way, same issue applies to Mom To Be Tea by a different company that makes herbal teas (edit: thanks to Rebecca's comment, I've edited this to say controversial instead of dangerous)."},{"rating":"2","title":"One pill.....NICE!!!","review":"Well, my 3rd pregnancy with these prenatals & I just have to say they are awesome!

I take it at night, right before bed and have no adverse reactions in doing so. Other vitamins, you'd be amped up for hours taking it right before bed. Ive used these vitamins for both of my pregnancies, last one was twins, and everything was perfect. I felt very confident I was giving my babies the best and continue to do so, as I am nursing 4 month old twins. The only potential con is that these vitamins are larger than most. Trust me though, get over the first few uncomfortable days and the payoff is worth it! You'll feel amazing...you'll feel the difference. I will continue to take these even after I'm done nursing!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful!","review":"I started taking these when I was pregnant with twins.

To put it simply, these are amazing. Other than being really nutritionally impressive, there were two \\"MUST HAVES\\" on my list --First, I HAAATE when I have to take pills three times a day... I always forget/give up after about the first one (which makes it pointless). This is ONE PER DAY. It's very, very nice and easy to remember.and even MORE IMPORTANTLY, they don't make me sick! I simply do not need the extra misery of being sick from my vitamins in my first trimester. I have had ZERO stomach aches or nausea from these. A HUGE deal to me (and frankly, the only time in my life a vitamin hasn't made me sick... it's a miracle).Anyway, I hope this helps!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good prenatal vitamin that is gentle on your stomach","review":"Read the reviews and decided to purchase this prenatal vitamin.

It so much easier to take the pill and I'll be using it for at least 1 yr."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Prenatal","review":"Let me first say that I am not pregnant. I am taking these as a multi replacement and for nail and hair health. The results are amazing. My nails grow extremely fast and are hard and healthy. My hair, which I color blond, so it is damaged, is finally able to grow (rather than before which would break before it added any length). I feel great while taking these. They are not too big to swallow and have no scent.Also - an interesting note for men...my husband took one of these when his multi ran out and said he had so much energy and felt great! It has all the necessary vitamins and minerals and more. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great","review":"Did a lot of research for pre conception and these are the best, big but they have all the vitamins u need"},{"rating":"2","title":"My favorite; And I have tried 'em all!","review":"I like that they are all natural.

I don't know if its directly related to this vitamin, but every body type is different. I did some research on the vitamins... That's a lot of b12 and vitamin a. Seems like some of the other ingredients are excess as well. Be careful before purcHasing this product. Make sure you get a prenatal vitamins according to your lifestyle and diet.

But this stuff made me gag the first time I opened the bottle. I took it every day for about 9 weeks, but one day I took it and about an hour later, I felt sick to my stomach. I vomited the stuff up and felt so much better. These pills are large, a weird greenish color and smell bad. Don't get these. Again, this is coming from a pregnant woman who doesn't even get morning sickness! Imagine what it could do to someone who does."},{"rating":"1","title":"Seal Broken Upon Arrival","review":"My obstetrician recommended these vitamins, so I was excited to try them out. Unfortunately, the seal under the cap was broken upon arrival. In addition, the cotton layer looked like it was pushed out of the way. It was positioned such that it looked obvious that someone had placed their finger inside the bottle. The distributor, All Star Health, said that the seals sometimes get broken during the shipping process by extreme changes in temperature from hot to cold. I feel that if this is the case, the manufacturer should change their sealing technology so that the seals don't break. The distributor offered a refund, which I am taking them up on. However, the refund does not cover the shipping that I paid to get the item, or the shipping I'll pay to send the item back, so there's a $10 shipping loss on a $20-something dollar purchase."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nightmares","review":"I started taking these vitamins when I first found out I was pregnant (at 5 weeks). I had to discontinue use when I started to get morning sick because it only exacerbated my nausea. In the throes of morning sickness, I started taking a multivitamin suggested by my OB. When I ran out of my OB recommended prenatal vitamin I was 8 months pregnant so I started to take the Rainbow Light vitamin again. Well, the nausea was gone, but I have had the worst nightmares and the most vivid dreams ever since. I can't directly blame the vitamin, but I do not have the vivid nightmares if I forget to take my vitamin. I haven't read about anyone else having this problem and my OB thinks that it is unrelated, but I wanted to share my story. I hope you have better luck with this vitamin than I did."},{"rating":"1","title":"I would never take these again, nor would I recommend them","review":"I took these vitamins for 1 year before my first pregnancy, 9 months of pregnancy, and then two years after my pregnancy. They did not make me feel nauseous. They are large and can be difficult to take for that reason, but other than that no issues. However, the FDA confirmed in 2009 that these vitamins contain lead, which you can read more about on their website. For that reason I would never take (nor recommend) these vitamins again."},{"rating":"1","title":"No Good","review":"I don't know what it is in this vitamin, but I started getting hives that come and go all over my arms and legs a few days after starting them. Once I stopped the hives went away. The pills are large but I did not have any difficultly swallowing them. No other side effects at all other than the hives, which were bad enough that I had to completely stop taking them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wrong Supplement Facts Posted - Also, Migraines","review":"Purchased these multivitamins for a friend via Amazon Prime (sold by Electronica Direct) last week. The supplement facts posted in an image here on Amazon are NOT what is posted on the Rainbow Light web site nor does it match what is on the bottle. THE DIFFERENCE IS SIGNIFICANT. As of this posting, the correct information can be found here: [...]Also, my friend has had one or two severe migraine headaches per year for several years. She took these two days in a row and within 8 hours had absolutely debilitating migraines...to the point that she would have been rushed to the ER if they didn't ease up within an hour or two. Yes, she took them with a meal (breakfast) and with plenty of water. No, she is not taking and has not taken any other prenatal vitamins. She did not take one today and so far so good. She will be visiting her healthcare provider in the next few days to see if they can figure it out. She's 6 weeks LMP so about 3 weeks gestation."},{"rating":"1","title":"I would not recommend these vitamins.","review":"I went for these vitamins because they had a lot of good ingredients and were relatively cheap compared to other vitamins in the market. As noted by other reviewers, the vitamin is very difficult to swallow. I thought I would overcome that problem; however, I dreaded the moment of taking it every morning. On the worst side, it does give constant constipation (I apologize for being graphic), as other reviewers also noticed.I still finished the whole bottle of Rainbow Prenatal so that I would not waste the money spent; however, I went back to the more expensive Oculair 120 VegiCaps (also called Biosyntrx-oculair on Amazon) vitamin that I have been taking for several years prior to trying Rainbow Prenatal. Even though Oculair is more expensive, it's so much easier to swallow having a soft cover of each individual tablet, and I have no side effects from it as I had with Rainbow Prenatal.I hope this helps. Best wishes!"},{"rating":"2","title":"definitely recommend","review":"I was using Rainbow Light before getting pregnant and it was an easy decision to use it for my prenatal needs. Vitamins that are food based work better for me. My body absorbs them better and best of all I don't get sick after taking them. I typically get nauseous with chemical based vitamins. I like the fact that I only have to take it once a day and the only reason I don't give 5 stars is because of the smell, which I have gotten use to but might be a problem for some people."},{"rating":"1","title":"Concerns with this vitamin","review":"I've been taking this for 2 years while my hubby and I tried to conceive. I didn't have any problems in all that time. It is a HUGE, non-coated pill, but I didn't have too much trouble swallowing it.Then I got pregnant.At about 5 weeks, it became impossible to swallow without gagging and forcing it down my throat. I almost vomited trying to swallow the darn thing. It's just too big!!I only just learned that in 2008, the FDA identified this vitamin as being number 5 in the list of prenatal vitamins containing the most lead! You can read more about it by doing a search for \\"prenatal vitamins lead\\" and then clicking on the link to the FDA's site.Definitely scary stuff!"},{"rating":"1","title":"nausea!!","review":"I started taking these because I am low on Vitamin D and they have added D2 so I thought it would eliminate having to take that pill too. I am currently trying to conceive and started getting heavy nausea in the afternoons after I would take it (I had to eat something first because my stomach tends to be sensitive when empty). I thought \\"Yeah! I'm pregnant, I have nausea!\\" But no. Turns out it was a side effect of the vitamins because it would happen almost every day about an hour after consumption. Boo.

I would have liked to see Li's wushu pitted against conventional boxing and kick boxing but the scenes are so dark that the images become blurs.

Tommy Lee Jones is ridiculous as the master bomber, and the scene with him dancing along like the middle-aged man he is to U2's \\"With or Without You\\" must count as the most ludicrous image ever trapped on celuloid.Lloyd Bridges also appears to be labouring under the delusion that he is actually in an \\"Airplane\\" film, and turns in an admittadely excellant, although unintentional comedy performance as an ex-IRA man, who for some unexplained reason looks like a cross between the wizard Gandalf and a tramp. His son Jeff, to be fair puts in a decent performance, but even he cant save this depressingly familiar example of a potentially good cinematic idea destroyed by overblown Hollywood corporate mentality."},{"rating":"2","title":"EXPLOSIVE","review":"The highlight of this pyrotechnically superb thriller is midway in the film when the audience and hero Jeff Bridges thinks a bomb has been placed in his home, to kill his new wife and daughter. The camera pans in on several normal things, with such intensity and ferocity, you're sure the house is gonna blow: a gas stove has never seemed so menacing.While BLOWN AWAY doesn't have the most original of plots, it has a sincerity and intensity that buoy the movie along, with several expertly filmed sequences. Bridges rushing to save his two friends from an exploding truck; Bridges watching as his uncle (played by Lloyd Bridges) is wired to blow; the climactic explosion on the Dolphin--these are outstanding set pieces, expertly helmed by Stephen Hopkins.Jeff Bridges is marvelous in his role, ably supported by his aformentioned father; Suzy Amis, Forest Whitaker and the devilishly profane Tommy Lee Jones.Hold on to your seats and ignore the critics on this one---it delivers explosively!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A great favorite","review":"What can you say about a film with Jeff Bridges and Tommy Lee Jones????

The only reason why I like them is because I love cheesy movies. If you don't like Anna or cheesy flicks, then don't bother with these. Let's see, now that we got that out of the way, what about the DVD itself? It has the feeling of a fly-by-night company. The DVD packaging is flimsy. There's no booklet or cover sheet inside. It's only one DVD, with one movie on each side, but the DVD itself isn't marked so that you can't even figure out which movie you're going to watch until you put it in. Extra features? Absolutely none. The only options available is 'play' and scene selection (8 chapters to choose from). The only good deal out of this is that you get two movies relatively cheap. Unfortunately, if you're not a fan of Anna, you're going to be very disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Every Samaria book gets better!

The original trilogy was fantastic. From there it became a little repetitive. This latest addition was a welcomed change. One of my problems with previous novels was the extreme description of music. Shinn could spend an entire chapter describing the rise and fall of angel voices in song. Almost all her novels were concerned about the archangel. In this case, she concentrates on two women (not angels at all) and their perspectives. A Jansai woman and an angel-seeker. In both women she shows the trials and tribulations of misunderstood and persecuted women doing what they have to do to survive, truely live, and love. Shinn twines these two women's lives together in an unexpected and touching way.It's a long novel, but you will find it hard to put down.

A high percentage of these individuals served in combat units (i.e. Special Forces, 173rd, 101st, 1st Aviation Brigade). NO ONE EVER HEARD of a North Vietnamese parachute regiment. I was curious, so I contacted the author (Black) via telephone on Saturday (30 May, 2004). Black stated that he obtained the information from the military archives at Carlisle Barracks. When I checked the archives, no hits were obtained on this subject from their site, however they are now closed for the summer due to an ongoing physical location move.

Bockris and Bayley do here for Patti what Kitty Kelley did for Sinatra. Just about every occurence is Smith's life and work is judged by these two as careerist and manipulative, so unfortunately, this book is in no way the fair or balanced account that Smith fans had hoped for.These two are even shameless enough to admit that the bulk of information provided by the book comes from interviews that Patti did with other people throughout her career. My guess is that one would come away much more informed by searching out the originals and seeing what Patti had to say in the proper context."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stunning front cover photo.","review":"Great subject for a bio.

The writing is questionable and the design is terrible.Its mainly compiled from articles and interviews-- which you could easily find for yourself on the web.In an effort to try to make the book dramatic or interesting they portray Debbie Harry as P.Smith's most hated enemy and threat? Give me a break.If you're really interested in Patti Smith then you'd be better off buying her books."},{"rating":"1","title":"Patti Smith Had Nothing To Do With This Book","review":"The fact that Patti Smith's name follows Victor Bockris' and Roberta Baily's on the book catalog listing is misleading and irresponsible. Patti Smith had nothing to do with this book and neither did anybody who really knew or knows her. As said in the above reviews, it is a poor pastiche of periodical articles and conconcted stories by embittered has-beens and hangers on who themselves never created anything of worth. It is obvious that it's 'authors' did little if any real research on Patti Smith the individual or the artist and, sadly, they do not seriously focus on her work. It's as if they cut and pasted huge portions of the book from the internet while sitting at home on laptops doing google searches.

After therapy wraps up, they want to stay friends, and so when Cat's adoptive Mother/sister/not-real-sister, decides to die, the girls get together and bury her in Cat's back yard. Anything to keep Cat out of a foster home and get a clubhouse for themselves.No one knows the woman is dead until the girls confess it, to save Cat from danger. And here's the funny part. That backyard/graveyard was in Beverly Hills. 90210.Now, here is why you should not read this book. You should not read this book, because it is bad.

It was filled with alot of dialect between the characters, which had no purpose for the reader or the plot. The ending left something to be desired. It seemed that the author wanted to hurry up and finish and didn't give much thought to the readers feelings. I felt as if I was left hanging. It's a good book for a teen, yet, I'm in my early 20's and it didn't satisfy me at all. This book is nothing like the original V.C. Andrews books. It's a shame."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good reading for a rainy day","review":"Into the Garden by V.C. Andrews was a great book, up until the ending. The plot was good and the friends reminded me so much of my group of friends. The ending, though, sort of happened so fast that I felt the author was trying to hurry and finish the book so she could get another out. The Epilogue filled me in, but that last chapter needed a little more work, I think. Otherwise, it was a fantastic book. I couldn't put it down!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Some kind of screwed up dark Beverly Hills soap opera","review":"This book was really bizarre. Sure people make mistakes and do stupid things but those girls were evil. They must have been smoking crack or something or really hated their families. This book is good for kids because it teaches them about peer pressure. Then they tried to make Cathy's evil father out to be the bad guy after those girls all but turned Cathy's house into Babylon.

It started off as good, but immediately went downhill as soon as they buried the mother in the backyard (can't they get into serious trouble for that?). In fact, it was so bad I couldn't even finish it, and usually, I'm the type to finish what I start. It's totally unrealistic, vapid, and the characters aren't even people you can care about.This book makes me cringe just thinking about it.Don't buy, if you know what's good for you, but if you'll read any trash, go ahead and waste your money. Don't say I didn't warn you."},{"rating":"1","title":"HORRIBLE!","review":"I think only about 3 chapters in the book were worth reading. The story started out ok, but then it was just page after page of irrelevant nonsense! There was too much going on--half the book could've been edited out without losing the story. I was never able to get a hold of where this book was going. I could see how the writer ATTEMPTED to have readers feel sympathy for the characters...but it just didn't happen.The storyline was ridiculous & towards the last few chapters, I found myself RUSHING through the sentences just to get the book over with!FINALLY, when the ending came, it confirmed my thoughts that this book was a waste of my time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rip Off!","review":"Another rip off from the Andrews Family.

I read the whole series and every page of every book was great. Misty, Jade, Star and Cat were about 4 teen girls that are in therapy and each book is each one telling their story. Each book brings them closer. the final book Into the Garden brings them all together outside of their therapy. Where they learn to become friends. They form a club called the OWP's. They all have a surpise packed in this book but the biggest one of all is one of them looses a parent and ask the others for help. What do they do? Who do they turn to?

I have had this phone for a little over six months and have already had to have a replacement phone sent to me. This phone has horrible reception and will drop calls in the middle of a conversation. The color on this phone is nothing to brag about and the camera does not take clear pictures at all. For anyone thinking of buying this phone don't waste your money.

The ring tones are not optimal, my old samsung N200 was much louder and clear with regards to ringing, but right now, my only big complaint. Other little things, you can't put multiple phone numbers under one name in the phone book. The voicemail was a little confusing.

I quite like the camera attachment. It doesn't work well in doors (it has a low light setting which gives passable results). it's easy to position the camera len just right after using it a couple times. Of couse picture quality isn't top notch, but I never wanted to use it to take professional-looking photos. The results I got worked for me. All other features are pretty standard, and as good as any of my friends' phones that I had used. The color screen is big and clear, easy to read under strong light or in the dark.

If u are not outside, u probably will not see anything o the screen. It is also an attachment which means that u cant take a picture of someone without them noticing.

However.. iside for apearances.. the motorola has twice as manny accessories and features (including the desktop speakerphone.. and mp3 player addons) so if you are into little gadgets like those, its a great phone.

It feels poorly constructed, the menus are difficult to navigate, and the buttons are so recessed that it is difficult to push them.

I've missed countless calls because I couldn't hear it ringing. Navigating the user interface is unnecessarily complicated and slow. Switching ring modes requires you to navigate to the ring styles portion of the menu system, in my opinion, you should be able to change this without opening the phone.

But I am disappointed with this phone. Some of the features are not working properly. There is display delay of 2 seconds. Some button presses do not respond all the time. The display quality is not good as Samsung or Sony phones. The sound quality is replaced by a cheap DSP... It is larger than same priced Samsung phone, and a small drop will kill the phone. I had Samsung, Nokia, Sony, and Motorola phones for past 10 years or so. By far this is the most fragile phone. I like the flip phones.

For those thirsty for some reading on the life of the Lord, I would certainly still point them first (and always) to the Scripture; however, I must admit that, regarding Oursler's narrative, there is some value to be gained from the stirring of the heart this story produces.

THe film does not disappoint. It's a good condensation of the story; and although no film version could ever hope to plum the depth's of Grunuiu's psyche so well as the book, the imagery and musical backdrop adequately convey the character's oddities and social deficiencies(to put it mildly).

This is not the movie of one murder, it's the story of a psychopath on a murder spree of young, beautiful women. This is a man with a bad case of OCD and only one aspect to his personality -- smell. That's it. He feels nothing for anyone and is a hollow person. He believes he can capture the scent of a woman, which is in his view, the most perfect, wonderful, fulfilling smell there is. But at the end of the day, this is just a killer and you're watching a movie of a psycopath. You hope and hope he does not kill the lovely, sweet, perfect Laura, but then he does. Ugh, and then the end is possibly the strangest, stupidest end to a movie I've ever seen. It didn't even follow the \\"scent\\", so to speak, of the movie. There's nothing likable about this movie. In the end, I hoped Alan Rickman's character would kill him, but then he doesn't. Ugh.

The video looks great but the audio and video are not synced together properly. The words do not line up with their mouth movements. The audio is a second off on the original English audio track.

I assume the book (which I will never read) is equally elaborate prose with the same effect, of trying to elevate murder to an art form. Of all the ways to explore sexuality, love,and the senses, as a species we are becoming more and more decadent, and less evolved. I bailed after the second murder.

The dirty man who needs to clean his nails is out seeking the arousal of a woman's deadly scent. Serial killer returning home to be devoured. It is unlike any movie I have ever seen.

I was watching the movie and just wondering what was going on, because really, the last 30 minutes are total non-sense. Let me just say, everyone ends up naked (a huge crowd, probably thousands of people) while he murderer is standing, waiting for his execution. And that's not even the worst part of the movie...That movie is awful. The last 30 minutes ruin it all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bizarre and awful","review":"Perhaps the most misbegotten film in recent memory, \\"Perfume\\" veers from period melodrama to \\"Silence of the Lambs\\" slasher to bad acid trip, with a final detour into a road production of \\"Oh Calcutta.\\" The director seems not to know what kind of film he wants to make, so he allows some usually good actors to flounder around and make fools of themselves. Dustin Hoffman thinks he's remaking \\"Hook,\\" Alan Rickman thinks he's in a BBC production of \\"Emma\\" and the women think they're doing a Chanel perfume ad. The lead actor is pretty to look at and has perfected a constipated expression that's supposed to be a dark secret, but every time he opens his mouth he sounds like he's auditioning for \\"Oliver\\" with a broad Cockney accent that's completely out of place. Nothing in most of the film prepares you for the ending, which is out-and-out laughable.

All the noted, high caliber actors (Alan Rickman, Dustin Hoffman) couldn't save this stinker.The acting was wonderful, but other than that, this movie was almost a complete waste of time.

Why should you glorify a character that murdered several women? And what happens to those women...I don't want to put any spoilers in my review, but this seems like a film specifically for misogynists.

It has a distinct style that is hard to describe, but very visually interesting and beautiful.The writing is very good. It is obviously based on the book. It's pretty hard to bone up a classic like The Count of Monte Cristo.I prefer anime with english dubbing because the original creators intended their work to be watched, not read. This series has a good english voice cast that doesn't detract from the overall quality of the series.This anime is very adult and somewhat slow paced. I enjoyed the characters and side stories, as well as the main plot and style.

Actually, I'll probably never use it as a cooler. Moderately filled, it can heat things up to 150F (measured) in a few short hours.The only thing keeping me from giving it a full five stars are a few design and manufacturing issues. I don't really care for the pigtail power receptacle dangling from the unit. A built-in port would've been nicer, but I can live with it. Overall plastic forming and construction is good, but there was excessive adhesive that had oozed out from the heatsink area. These issues don't mean this thing won't do its job. But it's possibly something the QC person should take a look at to bring this product to the next level.Regardless, I'm happy with it. So far it's holding up to a fair amount of abuse (including being checked in with with luggage for cross country flights). Would I order another if I needed one? Definitely yes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor quality and materials from 1970th","review":"Very soft plastics on the cooling unit which is so fragile you do not want to touch it with any food/beverage inside. The outside plastic wall is made of very thin PVC which bends under your hand when you try to slide the coller in the trunk. When pushed, the wall bends and touches the fins of the fan stopping it. There is no switch for the cool/warm modes! You would have to change the polarity on the plug! - Really cheaply made. I would describe it as if someone in canada making it in his/her own garage using retired plastic meting tools:)It does cool OK though which means the cooling element is working as expected but I would not buy this cooler again.Hope this review will help to improve the quality of this unit."},{"rating":"2","title":"Keeps it cool!","review":"Not too complicated.

The two times we used it, it was great and kept everything inside cool. The third time we went to use it, it was completely dead. We bought all the recommended adaptors and followed the instructions that came with it. Though it worked great two times, it's definately too expensive to only use twice then have to trash.

In the car I noticed no real cooling, so I decided to try it in the house using the A/C adapter, which I also had ordered. The house temperature was 70 degrees. I used a refrigerator thermometer which I placed in the bottom of the cooler. After 21 hours of \\"cooling\\" the temperature inside the cooler was 63 degrees, nowhere near the advertised 40 degrees below ambient temperature. I didn't expect it to cool to 30 degrees--it is not a refrigerator--but I did expect better than 63. I have returned the cooler for a refund."},{"rating":"1","title":"AC Adaptor","review":"I bought this cooler-heater together with an AC Adapter through Amazon.Subsequently I read where their AC Adapter caused fires.I wrote to Koolatron to see if they had modified the Adapter to prevent these fires and they refused to answer me.I am not sure why Amazon still carries the product under these circumstances."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cool product","review":"The Koolatron works very well. It cools drinks as expected and works quietly. My only complaint, thus far, is that I wish the product had an on/off switch. As it stands, it's either plugged in and working...or not. In order to change from cooling to heating, the plug must be reversed. Its a bit inconvenient to have to reach to the back seat to unplug it or change it from cool to heat or vice versa. A relatively simple addition of a switch would make the product nearly perfect."},{"rating":"2","title":"It works!","review":"Yes it does work as it says! Used it for 48 hours and kept it all cold!Perfect for behind a seat of car. Seems worth the price."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not happy","review":"Overall, just not happy with this cooler. It's fits very perfectly behind the driver's seat of my SUV. The unit is smaller than the picture presents it. The picture shows 1/2 gallons of milk/juice in the cooler but neglects to tell you that you can't have anything in front of the fan. Therefore, 2 - 1/2 gallons don't fit. The unit is also really loud. I bought this cooler, and car adapter, to transport perishable items for a baby. Only I don't trust that it keeps milk and milk products cold enough. Nothing is ever cold. The temperature feels similar to something sitting in front of a fan. A regular cooler with ice would be better. If you're just storing soda, fine. But I wouldn't use it for longer periods of time with perishable items. Buy an Igloo cooler and lots of ice."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Product","review":"The only downside to this cooler, that is perfect for travel, is the exorbitant price increase recently.

Shame on you."},{"rating":"2","title":"excellent, warm liner","review":"Ordered this liner to complete my Joe Rocket Recon Military Spec jacket.

These lectures are lucid and insightful if a little repetitive. Luther reads Genesis as a true history and often is using his imagination to fill in gaps for his students. Noah and Abraham are presented as preachers who were despised by their neighbors but beloved by God for their adherence to the true faith. Luther's exegetical method is to read the Biblical stories as guides and view the characters as examples. Luther imaginitively reads his own personal experience very deeply in the Biblical texts. But despite this, and Luther's propensity to make claims which can be disturbing, Luther remains an indispensible teacher of how to distinguish what is useful from what is frivolous in the Bible. His reading of Scripture should inspire the modern Christian to treat the Bible as the living, breathing, word of God."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great transaction.","review":"Great fragrance....very satisfactory transaction.I always prefer ordering from Amazon.com because more than likely they will have what I need.Thank you!"},{"rating":"2","title":"BVLGARI Omnia is Awesome!","review":"This is the best fragrance I've ever used and the price is unbelievable!

Don't waste your money on this. Pick up bullhead, gluey porch treatments, or stoner witch, anything but this."},{"rating":"1","title":"They can't all be gems.","review":"The Melvins have been so prolific over the last few years that they were bound to release something bad. COLOSSUS OF DESTINY goes beyond the b-word -- this is absolutely terrible, and that verdict is coming from a diehard fan. Recorded live in 1998 with Tool guitarist Adam Jones joining the band, COLOSSUS is nothing but a solid hour of ear-splitting noise. I can't fathom of anybody listening to this for fun. Frankly, I can't fathom of anybody listening to anything in the \\"noise\\" genre for fun, but this... this is just atrocious. Long, painful, and occasionally even boring, the only reason to purchase this CD is so you can freak out other people -- and there's far better material out there to achieve such a goal."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best reference for TSRs","review":"This book contains everything you'll ever need to know for developing your own TSRs for DOS.

The jury is still out on it's durability."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Biography of Bruce Lee outside Linda Lee's works","review":"I am inclined to agree with the other reviewers on the site about the merit of this book. It is very good, rivalling if not surpassing Linda Lee's account of her husband's life. As another reviewer has indicated the reason for this is that Thomas hasn't just recounted the tale of Bruce Lee's life per se but examined in quite some depth the spiritual and psychological motivations which led him to live the way he did. The biography has a special dimension which moves the reader into the actual reality Bruce experienced. I was affected greatly by the empathy Thomas has for Lee, which at times is so compelling, especially in the narration of the events leading up to Lee's death, that I was pressed to tears. There are few books which have such impact."},{"rating":"2","title":"Solid","review":"Nice overview of his life. Also some decent martial arts info, but mostly from the mental side. Decent concepts to apply to life/coaching."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well-done biography","review":"A good biography that tells the story of Bruce Lee and the development of his martial art Jeet Kune Do. I give it 4 stars instead of 5 due to the excessive number of grammatical errors in the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best","review":"Of all the many books I have read on Bruce Lee I think this biography is far and away the best. The previous reviewer reflected my thought exactly, that the author, Bruce Thomas, is \\"respectful but not caught up in hero worship\\". I would add that this is the only Bruce Lee book I have read that manages to walk that line. Bruce Thomas clearly has a personality and spirituality that is mature enough to have captured and integrated the essence of Bruce Lee. The biography is well-researched and detailed but this is more than a biography...it is a great book."},{"rating":"1","title":"dont buy these!","review":"well you ever hear \\"you get what you paid for\\" well this is worse then that i ordered too of these for $100 and when i got them i opened them they looked okay so i hooked them up and they are the worste subwoofers i have ever had i have two 8\\" 80 watt roadmaster's that hit 5X harder then these. theres no thump what so ever and they both make a terrible rattling noise. so save your money and get somthing worth it. learn from my mistake."},{"rating":"2","title":"Consistency...A word that rarely applies in music","review":"At midnight, I was in a line at a CD store? Why? For Aquemini. I still listen to Southern. and ATLiens with regularity, and I must say that Aquemini is even better than their first two albums. If you thought that it wasn't possible for Dre and Big Boi to get any deeper or lyrically better, you are wrong. If this tape doesn't have enormous sales, it would be a travesty of hip hop justice. If the source is going to review it, anything less than 4 1/2 mics would be outrageous. Tracks 2,3,4,5,6,7,8...Okay. I will make it easy for you. Every song is good.

One of the best rap cd's I've ever heard","review":"This CD is tight on all levels. Beats, production, and lyrics. Outkast is called outkast because they are different than any artists out.

This is one of my favorites and i've got around 400 rap cd's."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliant!","review":"Outkast has always been one of my favorite hip-hop groups and even I was impressed by this new CD.

Outkast are my main product im tryin to move out to the public but every1 wit all that gangsta lies and s**t. Outkast is the truth they are by far the best duo and group out there i've heard all of their albums and i think this one is the best. it talks about real things and real issues going on in the ghetto and still stays true to who they are, still jazzy, still old school, still new school and still no rules for OUTKAST"},{"rating":"2","title":"this album will tighten your wig","review":"I was turned on to this album about 6 years ago and it still sounds fresh every time I listen to it. I simply cannot get enough of this album. Lyrically, Andre Benjamin will break things down for you. The music is all over the place, listen to it on headphones for about 6 months, every day (preferably while in motion). I like what Outkast has done since (esp. The Love Below), but nothing holds a candle to Aquemini.\\"Lets talk about time travelin, ryhme javelin, somethin mind-unravelin\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Original","review":"I like their style. Big Boi's fast-paced rhymes is excellent and its got a groove to it. The beats are original and bumping. Good tracks: Da Art of Storytelling part 2. Return of The G. Chonkyfire.

It doesn't matter if you like Southern rap or rap music at all, Outkast is the group for you. I remember this album came out my freshman year in college. I copped it bootleg at the time for $5 (couldn't afford it for $18), but the album was so good, I went and bought the real thing anyway. I won't bother going through the highlights of this album because the whole album is the highlight, but I will say this. If you've been down with Outkast since day 1, you know that this is their third best CD (Still Top 25 of all-time). If you just got on the Outkast bandwagon, be it this album, Stankonia, or the double disk, welcome aboard."},{"rating":"2","title":"If you want real outkast, get this!","review":"Ok, all I have to say is that this is one of my favorite cd's ever. And I own many many cd's..But only a few can compare to aquemini. Every song is good on this cd period. Dre and Big Boi Rip it up left and right on every track. this is some great dungeon family work right here. Pick it up before you pick up Stankonia. I feel that this cd blows Stankonia away by far!

OutKast does a fine job with \\"Aquemini\\" and is probably thier most popular album to date. Although, not my favorite of their four albums, it still easily deserves five stars. \\"Aquemini\\" features top-notch production, a sound performance lyrically by both rappers, and some creativeness. Cuts such as \\"Da Art of Stroytellin' Parts 1 and 2\\", \\"Return of the G\\" and the electrified \\"Chonkyfire\\" show OutKast in great form. Raekwon and George Clinton perform up to par on their featured tracks. And heaven forbid we forget to mention \\"Rosa Parks\\". I still hear people singing that song to this day. Aquemini is a great album. I can listen from songs two to ten without a pause. I recommend picking it up.

I have been a 'kast fan for over a decade and have listened to almost everything they have ever done, so believe me when I say it, this is their best work. Aquemini is an absolute masterpiece. Every album since has been a dissapointment to me. I wish they would have retired after Aquemini and let it be their legacy to the hip hop world. I hate how commercialized they've become."},{"rating":"2","title":"a perfect album","review":"Without a doubt the best hip hop album i have yet to hear.

True, the hit single rosa parks has that smooth almost in your face beat but it still can't live up to all the hype that surounds it. so aquemini is simply a disappointing attempt to be different.

The other tracks were all pure bull except for the beautiful jazzy beginning of \\"Liberation\\", but as soon as Dre's voice came on, it was ruined. A rap of any kind would ruin the song completely. \\"Da Art Of Storytellin'\\"(Part 2) was waste of time. \\"Return Of The 'G'\\", was terrible. These guys can rap, but what are those things that make their voices sound funny on \\"Liberation\\"?? I don't like this album, it is very overrated. I'm the first person to give it less than three stars. Outkast is going on tour with Lauryn Hill. They should call it \\"the tour of the most overrated cats\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"TEARIN' IT UP ONCE MO'","review":"Outkast has definitely come out bangin on these cuts .

And big shouts to anyone from ATL who helped them make this (Goodie MOb, Witchdoctor...)"},{"rating":"2","title":"The best CD I've bought in awile","review":"The new OutKast CD is as ground breaking as their first two albums. The git up and dance mood to \\"Rosa Parks\\" is topped by no other song on the lp. The mellow funk of the title track \\"Aquemini\\" is great to chill to, while \\"skew it on the bar-b just lets everything go. A must buy, even for people who don't like rap that much. A revolutonary CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's rare releases like this which truly elevate the genre","review":"Aquemini is still the rap album that managed to salvage the art form of hip-hop inside my soul. Until then, and pretty much continuously afterwards, most rap releases have been universally devoid of that diverse creative mark that is streaked all over this classic disc. Yes, there are plenty of gangster anthems and typical references to the social norms we hear in most rap, but with Outkast's third release ghetto life has never been presented as intelligently- musically or otherwise."},{"rating":"2","title":"well, really more like 4.5 stars...","review":"This is a really great album and my favorite from Outkast. The title track is one of my all time favorite songs. It has a remarkably mellow, organic feel and simply amazing poetry from Andre 3000. Other key songs are \\"Skew It On The Barbie\\" with Raekwon turning in a great guest appearance over one of Outkast's most aggressive (at this point in their career) beats, \\"The Art Of Storytellin Part 1\\" with it's dreamy production and great lyrics, \\"West Savannah\\" with it's nice blaxploitation bass/horn beat, and the guitar laced closer, \\"Chonkyfire.\\" There's other great songs on here too but I'm not going to bore you. The reason why this gets 4 stars instead of 5 is that there are a few weak songs later in the album like \\"Mamacita\\" and \\"Yall Scared.\\" Still, this is a great album from an always unpredictable and enjoyable group. Check it out."},{"rating":"2","title":"ALL TIME TOP 10!!","review":"This cd is what rap is all about its got hip-hop and gangsta mixed to make a hella tight beat. OUTKAST 4 LIFE!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A CLASSIC","review":"Hot! OUTKAST in my mind is one of the all time premier groups. Big Boi and Dre are tight. Although Dre is the most talented of the two, he needs Big Boi as much as Big Boi needs him. They come with somethng brand new each and every time they come out. My hat comes off to you guys. you can list this along side of greats such as: 3 feet high and rising, criminal minded, the chronic, and illmatic."},{"rating":"2","title":"VERY POWERFUL","review":"I bought this album when it came out, and I'm still listening to it. The first track \\"Return of the G\\" is one of the hardest songs I've ever heard, and it sounds incredible. The track \\"The Art of Storytelling Part 1\\" just grows on you and you want to listen to it over and over. Many good songs. Every album I bought after this one can't come near it. A breath of fresh air in the now-stagnant world of hip-hop."},{"rating":"2","title":"Arguably the greatest rap album ever!","review":"No doubt, Dre and Big Boi have created one of the greatest rap/hip-hop albums ever. This album blends together slow funk with faster-paced club beats, and it's all done with Outkast's own original southern style. Lyrically stronger than any other group around, Outkast's rhymes are closer to peotry than rap, and they pull it all off while still keeping it real to their roots. This album is an instant classic, if you don't have it, you're not a real rap/hip-hop fan!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Only fools couldn't like this.","review":"This is great music.

Outkast are reason number one why artists such as Puffy Combs and Will Smith should be ashamed that they make music and dare call it hip hop."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hip Hop Culmination: A Masterpiece","review":"Never has hip-hop seen such un-recognized prominence. OutKast broke onto the mainstream scene with this third album, probably their best. The duo from Georgia is light years ahead of the game. While Jay Z and DMX and Puff Daddy spit the same lyrics and hooks just to please the masses, Dre and Big Boi use their imaginations to the fullest and surpass their coharts. They have a vast musical knowledge and apply it well on tracks like \\"Synthesizer,\\" \\"Chonkyfire,\\" and the epic \\"Liberation.\\" They combine mind-opening lyrics with some good down home funkin'. You don't just hear OutKast, you feel them. Peace, kids. Keep up the good work."},{"rating":"2","title":"THE NEW OUTKAST JOINT IS TIGHT","review":"The new Outkast CD Aquemini is off the hook. I picked it up today and already listened to it four times threw. I can't stop moving. The beats and rhymes are tight. If you liked the first and second joints you got to pick Aquemini up.

This cd probably finds its way into my cd player more than anything else that I own. Dre and Big Boi are both very tallented. What impressed me the most was the use of real instruments instead of just samples and a beat box. The lyrics are meaningfull to, these boys have a positive outlook on life. The best track is Rosa Parks, but the whole album is tight. This is one of the best hip-hop albums in a long time, and I highly suggest it.

Opposites attract on this album. Dre Benjamin brings spiritual lyrics while Big Boi brings the playerlistic rhyme to the duo.

Both all three are great and available through amazon.com."},{"rating":"2","title":"the best guide to commercial aviation!!!!","review":"the most comprhensive little guide to commercial aviation!!! a must for any fan of aviation!!! over 200 airlines with fleet guide annual passengers and profit!!!! its pictures feature the current livery of all the major airlines in the world!!! airlines from adria airways to virgin atlantic airways. quite comprehensive, i highly recommend it!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not good","review":"I got this book for an online class in Cross-sectional anatomy. Maybe this review is partly my frustration with taking this material online, so take it for what it's worth.The book is nothing but a dry recital of facts. If you are trying to learn the material forget it. If you already know it, then you might find it nice. I don't.The text refers to images that are spread throught several pages (and not the page with the text on it). This is very frustrating. Images are labeled in code, this also frustrating. It would take more space, but I think you could concentrate on an image and explain it, then move onto another image."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Much To Tackle","review":"The problem is that the sections are way too big to ever really nail anything down. For example \\"Upper extremeties\\" (489-566) is 77 pages of reading covering: shoulder, humerus, elbow, forearm, wrist, and hand could have been broken down into smaller chapters. Weekly assignments would have been much better than monthly assignments. It's like shoving a whole 72 ounce Porterhouse steak in your mouth at once and trying to chew it up and swallow it all in one gulp!"},{"rating":"2","title":"just what i need for my board exams","review":"Great book! It has some of the best CT images for teaching material. Most are better than the ones my teacher provides. It'll be a big help for my board exams. It is very thorough and describes all you need to know about CT."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not happy buying this book","review":"In my opinion this book is too basic and may be suitable for a newly appointed technologists. For a professional radiologist who would be looking for a dependable book with good crossectional anatomy, it will not be ideal book to buy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Finding our place...","review":"A friend of mine said she no longer reads adult ficition because it's depressing. I want to pass her a copy of A Place of Acceptance. The novel, like the cover, is full of light. While there are plenty of problems - old secrets, new ones, accidents, illness and the simple friction of life - every character in the novel does some growing. One leaves with the sense that with love, persistence and grace, all things will be well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poorly Made!","review":"The zipper on the bottom compartment broke within weeks of purchase and could not be fixed! Poor quality and not worth the $. Personally don't like the 2 compartment lunch box. Would rather have just one compartment."},{"rating":"2","title":"Priva Premium Hospital Bed In A Bag","review":"I bought 2 of these sets from Amazon over 8 months ago when my 96 year old mother went into hospice care. The sheets are soft and fit the hospital bed mattress beautifully, even with the pressure pump pad on the bed. They stay put, the corners don't pop off and the design of the top sheet leaves plenty of toe room.They have been washed and dried at least 3 times a week and have really held up well...still look like new and have kept their shape. I am buying another set just so that I won't have to be washing bedding every day.I like the fact that the bottom sheet is trimmed in blue and the top sheet is trimmed in green. Makes it very easy to grab the right sheet when you are changing the bed. All of the CNA's who have come in to care for my mom have commented on how nice these sheets are and have asked where I got them. Definitely a 5 star product!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice Holiday Music ( Make sure you like Big Band)","review":"Happy HolidaysI tend to like more Perry Como, Burl Ives, and of course Bing Crosby. I have been listen to Big band for just about a year and this was my first Christmas CD. As I listen to it I enjoy it more every time.

It's well recorded but nothing like anything he did when he was alive. Call it \\"Glenn Miller lite\\", or swing without syncopation. Similar to a Lawrence Welk approach to \\"swing music\\" albeit more lively. Either way, a misrepresentation of swing music. Pretty dreadful if you are a true swing fan, but lots of folks seem to enjoy this watered down pablum."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent CD!!","review":"Great CD, probably one of the best from the glory days of thrash.

I highly recommend it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Enough!","review":"Will this awfully mellow coloratura chirper ever stop shrieking? Sills couldn't fit the role of Anna less! Maria Callas, La Divina, has always been, and will always remain the role's owner.Incidentally, how can some people blatantly dare show their absolute ignorance? How can somebody call -and get away with it- Callas' soloists Nicola Rossi-Lemeni, Giulietta Simionato, and Gianni Raimondi \\"second rate\\"??? I guess you've neither listened to any of them nor heard of their superb and much acclaimed qualities as musicians!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Never Takes Off","review":"After listening to a few recordings of the opera, this recording is at the bottom of the heap. Rudel's limp tempi and an apathetic chorus help weigh down the drama. I don't remember if Sills made this recording before singing the role on stage, the performance here reminded me of what I heard live. She's way over her head in the role and there's nothing she can do to make the adjustment in darkness or heft needed to put it across. Plishka and Burrows sound like they are sight reading. Verrett is the only soloist who gets under the skin of the character with her usual bravura approach and gorgeous voice."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't like this translation","review":"Genie in every other translation becomes Genius in this one.

Presented here are a handful of edited stories, a mere sampling of the complete whole, which, admittedly, is near-impossible to find. Instead of downloading and reading this digital sadness, find a more complete edition and enjoy that. The One Thousand and One Nights are worth reading, but you need to read a version that actually includes Scheherezhade at least, also The Three Princes, and The Prince and the Fairy, and many, many more. This has none of them. Find a good version, do not waste your time here."},{"rating":"1","title":"Abridged Sanitized Version","review":"This version is missing key events in the main story line, as well as \\"less\\" important pieces of the story. This version is also toned down for less mature readers as most of the adult pieces of this book are left out. I would recommend reading the full version of the book, which I found for free in the kindle store although it comes in two parts."},{"rating":"2","title":"Charmed","review":"I had the idea it would blissful to ride to work with Toby Stephens reading stories to me. I was right. These are charming and sometimes hair-raising tales told with all the variety he can bring to his voice to mesmerize and enthrall. I have heard other books on tape where the reader falters at the woman's lines or sounds too much the same to distinguish between characters. Toby can go from growl to light-as-air with the greatest of ease. These stories have far too much violence for the smallest of children but, otherwise, offer a delicious trip to fantasy land courtesy of a master storyteller."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good, but missing the last half.","review":"This was a very good book. However, it is missing some of the stories. I do not know which, but I do know that it is missing at least a few."},{"rating":"2","title":"So Far the Best Arabian Stories I've Read","review":"I loved the stories in this book, but sometimes I felt the stories strayed too far from the main charactors and plot the book began with. Nevertheless, I found them entertaining and enchanting."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Arabian Nights","review":"This version is somewhat expurgated to make it suitable for non-adult readers. The original version has some explicit descriptions of the wife of Sultan Schahriar cavorting with one of her black slaves (which, when the Sultan witnessed it, caused him to execute her and begin his custom of executing a new wife each morning). This edition glosses over the reason for the Sultan's rage. Otherwise, fine."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Arabian Nights Entertainments","review":"The Arabian Nights Entertainments (mobi)This book has historical and cultural value. Besides that, you will encounter a mesmerizing set of tales which will be entertaining to any audience. By examining these legends, one can gain a basic understanding of how Arabic culture functions."},{"rating":"1","title":"editing","review":"I wanted to reread this, as I had enjoyed it so much as a child. Unfortunately, I found a problem that I am seeing more and more these days. That is the editing. I can't help but wonder if a real, literate person ever reads any of the books published anymore, or if they are just run them through a computer. The word \\"genious \\" is used instead of the word \\"genie\\" throughout the book. This is by no means the only such error, but surely for a book titled\\"The Arabian Nights \\" it is the most egregious one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Stories for my granddaughters","review":"I purchased this to share with my granddaughters. Always loved the stories of the Arabian Nights as a child. Also, like English Actor Toby Stephens who I think did a great job on these audio tapes. Very animated and descriptive. Thank you for having these tapes available."},{"rating":"1","title":"Definitely NOT low carb","review":"Although the author makes references to Dr. Robert Atkins in the introduction, she has certainly put her own spin on what constitutes low carb. I suspect Dr. Atkins would turn over in his grave. Her free use of white flour, sugar, non-dairy topping, and fruit juices makes me wonder what made her think these recipes qualify as low carb. She calls for using fat free foods, but if one is truly eating low carb, one doesn't need to eat low-fat. Indeed, it's contrary to true low carb eating. I am diabetic and I wouldn't dream of using these recipes. I'm glad I borrowed this book instead of wasting money on a purchase. There are much better low carb dessert books available."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not really low carb","review":"My problem with this book is the amount of flour is in the recipes. True low-carb should be staying away from flour. Then add her use of no/low fat food is just sickening. There are some good ideas and that is what saved it from getting a 1 star. I would recomend getting The Low-Carb Gourmet: 250 Delicious and Satisfying Recipes by Karen Barnaby (not here on amazon that only has the Hardcover one)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very portable and usable but freezes up easily","review":"I got this as a sort of \\"extra\\" frig for drinks in the summer. However, it freezes up easily and can't be adjusted for temperature. It is lightweight and portable, working well for a drink chest for parties.Also, the plug in that comes with it was missing. It only plugs into a car outlet--I had to buy the adapter to use it in the house.Given the choice, I'd probably go with a small refrig that adjusts temperature. However, again, I like the portability of this product."},{"rating":"2","title":"WORKS GREAT","review":"WE GOT INTO THE TRANSPORTATION BUSINESS AND NEEDED A SMALL FRIDGE TO KEEP DOWN THE COST OF FOOD.. WE HAVE USED THIS KOOLATRON ALMOST STEADY FOR A MONTH NOW. IT KEEPS ON GOING. THE ONLY THING BETTER WOULD BE IF IT WAS VERSITLE TO PLUG INTO CAR AND HOME. WE BOUGHT AN ADAPTER TO TAKE IT INTO MOTELS AND SUCH TO BE ABLE TO TURN OFF THE VEHICLE.. WE JUST LOVE IT THOUGH. WE RECOMMEND IT HIGHLY."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Car Cooler & Warmer","review":"Used this on my road trip, it did great keeping all my food and drinks cold. Even when driving through the hot desert of 90 degree weather, it did cool down below 40 degrees from outside temperature, so it was 50 degrees inside cooler for our food. Warmer does great, can use up to 4 hrs maximum. Either cooler or warmer, plug into 12v lighter when car is running or will drain your car battery. It stays cool when at picnic and cannot plug cooler in.Only concern is when fans running, its loud inside the car. When driving the road noise blends it out. After awhile you don't even think about it. Not too bulky in the backseat. Easily used seat belts to help hold it down when driving, such as around corners. Greatly recommend this cooler/warmer. My friend had a different brand and didn't work well. This one is a great portable fridge. Plus bought adapter from Amazon.com to use at hotel rooms, plug right in to wall outlet."},{"rating":"1","title":"CHEAP","review":"This refrigerator arrived with the door broken off of the hinge.

It seems like the double door concept with the heavy cooler mechanism on the door put a lot of stress on the plastic hinge. Good concept, but poor execution. I had to return it before we could even turn it on...."},{"rating":"2","title":"On Top of My List","review":"I was very impressed with this little refrigerator, my sister put one in her guest room and I found it so Comforting, A LUXURY for me, because I did not have to disturb anyone for a cool glass of juice or late night snack.I decided then that I would get one for my Guest room too. I like to entertain and I think having this is definitely a courtesy to guests.Highly recommended for this purpose."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Handy; should have come with 110V charger","review":"...would have been a '5' with either lower price or noted 'option' that is really important. my second one and very handy for my trips. great delivery"},{"rating":"1","title":"?","review":"I didn't even get a chance to try this cooler. It didn't have a plug to plug in the adaptor. I did ask the company about it and they said they would send it to me no charge, but I didn't want the hassle of dealing with it perhaps being the wrong plug. I needed it in a hurry. It was also bigger than I really wanted."},{"rating":"1","title":"An early death","review":"I bought one of these in April and it died in August--just about four months, which is the shortest I've ever had for one of these coolers. I can usually get a year or more from them. Additionally, the door (which works like a Dutch door, split in top and bottom) is not particularly convenient. The latch slides up and down, and because the box itself is too large to fit on a desk comfortably (at least for my desk), it has to sit on the floor, and that makes it harder to open and close the door. It did cool adequately while it worked, though, and it's large inside. I found I had to defrost it more often than I'm used to. The ice on the cooling unit gets very thick very quickly."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best, and most refined, album from DJ Krush.","review":"I've been a fan of Krush for years, and own most of his albums. If you are a lover of dark and atmospheric trip hop, then this album is for you. It is strong from start to finish, and incorporates beautiful japanese instruments, brooding beats, and smart lyrics. This is one of those albums that reaffirms your faith in good music.I think that this album is Krush's most complete work. It surpasses \\"Zen,\\" and takes the listener on a contemplative journey through towering soundscapes and dark valleys. I don't review many albums, but I believe that \\"Jaku\\" is a trip hop masterpiece.Hope this helps."},{"rating":"2","title":"DJ Krush - Jaku","review":"DJ Krush has been laying down his cold krush grooves for 10 years by the time JAKU came out, and you can hear his progression as an artist. The beats are still there, but, as on the skittering \\"Still Island\\" or the electro-clap of \\"Univearth,\\" there's more variation. As well, a cinematic quality lays over the tracks, like on the background strings of \\"Road To Nowhere\\" or the aching shakuhachi on \\"The Beginning.\\" But lest you think he's abandoned his hip-hop roots, Mr. Lif send in lyrical delivery to \\"Nosferatu\\" and \\"Kill Switch,\\" respectively, and \\"Decks-athron\\" is all about the scratching madness. But he also explores other genres: \\"Stormy Cloud\\" goes into piano-based jazz with Ken Shima at the keys; \\"Slit of Cloud\\" has what sounds like a yukara joined together with a jazz saxophone; and \\"Distant Voices\\" develops a low-toned growl. Another Krushing blow."},{"rating":"2","title":"krush is one kool kat","review":"I think this cd completely stands on it's own and would be perfect for first time listeners of Krush. Of course nothing will replace the moment I first heard Code 4109 and I do think it should be required listening for any Krush fan. Yet Jaku blows my mind with each repeated listening. He layers his tracks thick with beats and bass and is not afraid to trip us out with time changes and musical codas. \\"Decks-athron\\" with Dj Tatsuki is stuck in my mp3 player on Repeat. I love that Krush expands our notions of hip hop and rap. He makes me think while he's making me move."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hella Tight","review":"I think Dj Krush is a ghost, I saw him live at the 930 club in DC and after the last song he simply disapeared. It was cool cuz he slowly vanished. The music of Jaku is the type of music a ghost would make. Song number six is amazing, maybe the best krush song ever? The first song takes advantage of wind instruments and the result is inspiring, If your a fan of Krush you should get this cd. Song 6 makes the purchase worth it alone. Go Wayland Track and Field!!?"},{"rating":"1","title":"yawn...","review":"I am an avid birder, but I could not finish this book. Perhaps if I were a Brit, it would have more relevance since all the descriptions are of English birds. The descriptions of bird songs through the year are very dry and not particularly interesting. The woodcuts are nice, but hardly a reason to buy this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pleasantly Surprised","review":"I originally bought this CD just to get one song. I heard Miss Collins' version of \\"The Rose\\" on the radio and I thought it was awesome (Yes, I think it's even better than the famous version by Bette). Though never really being a fan of Collins, I thought this song alone was worthy to get this CD. I thought that I wouldn't be impressed with the other songs. I was wrong.Some of the songs were recorded live, but you really wouldn't know it. The sound quality and the musicianship is first-class. This is one of those albums that I find very uplifting. It makes me feel good to be alive.\\"Trust Your Heart\\" is also a \\"must have\\" and is an absolute gorgeous masterpiece and Collins' voice is just tremendous.If you're just a little bit of a fan of Judy Collins like I was, this disc might make you a BIG fan."},{"rating":"1","title":"Judy Misses With This One","review":"Not one of her best; over-orchestrated (especially the Jungle Jam bridge befor the last verse in \\"Pretty Polly\\"); songs too similar; too few songs for the money.

It was a quick scene but it was still disturbing.The end fight scene is the only reason I give this film two stars. And the end fight scene is definitely above average."},{"rating":"1","title":"In my opinion Not That Great","review":"Movie uses splice and cutting to make actors seem like they are doing moves they are not.Terrible kung fu is displayed.Watch it once to see what a bad kung fi movie is.I would have given it 0 stars ecpect the lead actor (Beardy) is a good actor."},{"rating":"2","title":"what?","review":"Obviously some of the reviewers here has lost their minds, or simply do not understand the genre. The last fight scenes of this film put it at the TOP of my list of Old school kung fu movies. The last time I saw this film was working as a projectionist at the theater in 1984. Have never forgotten this classic. I have no ideas why the dub may be \\"unacceptable\\" to some people, but this film is SIMPLY INCREDIBLE. If you do not understand the genre, and realize there will be bad dubbing and bad dialog, FIND another film genre to occupy your time. This film can only be appreciated by those who understand what a kung fu movie is all about! HIGHLY RECOMMENDED. P.S. I wrote my master's thesis on martial arts films, so I might know what I am talking about..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I expected...","review":"I commonly look at the \\"listmania\\" lists of Amazon users for suggestions on Old School Kung Fu movies that I haven't seen. \\"The Thundering Mantis\\" showed up on two separate user's lists so I thought it would be worth buying. While it is defintely \\"Old School\\" with no wire-fu, it is weak on substance. I think they also tried too hard to make it humerous. The main protagonist does not seem nearly talented enough to carry this role. The fight choreography is slow like they are only going half speed. It does not compare to classics like Invincible Pole Fighter, Shaolin vs. Lama, Shaolin and Wu Tang, or The Prodigal Son."},{"rating":"1","title":"Decisions","review":"I've been a fan of Corey's sine the 1980's and it's sad that the last movie he did before he passed away isn't very good.It's not that he's a bad actor it's just he's given lousy scripts to work with.He looks pretty rough in this movie.something in his eyes that maybe indicated his drug use present or past.His character is not very likeable either.It has a twist ending and I appreciate the message it was trying to send but it still couldn't save this movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"a good read, but not an instruction manuel","review":"Raykeil is a fabulous writer and I enjoyed reading most of the book - right up to the part that she decides to \\"find\\" her lost libido. I could have told here where it was hiding...right under her baby that she decided to take to bed with her every night. She may not realize it, but the \\"cure\\" for her libido was her baby getting older than 2 and becoming more independent. No baby in bed, no baby at the breast (ok, any breastfeeding after 1 year old is just asking for issues from both mom and kid), no kidding you can start feeling like a separate person again. As a mom of two who really has been searching for her libido - not just myself - all I have to say to Raykeil about her discovery of her \\"lost\\" naughty self is...duh. I wish the millions of moms out there who feel sexy, love their husbands, want to desire to have sex and DONT sleep with their kids, but still can't muster a sexual feeling found it as easy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Grab a babysitter and run after your former sex life","review":"I loved this book! A person really can relate to the character in the book. Many of us just get so overwhelmed with the demands of parenthood that it is impressive how many families actually go on to have more than one child! The book does not offer a clear solution, but it is rather a diary of one woman's journey to revive her sexy self. It ends a bit unresolved, but leaves plenty of possibilities for one's own resolutions."},{"rating":"2","title":"Confessions of a Naughty Mommy","review":"It was honest, blunt and to the point. It shed light on alot of things that \\"housewives\\" feel. I like that in this modern day \\"sex\\" book, it focused on how honest we should be with our feelings. And it also showed that even if we are not \\"feeling\\" sexy or great about ourselves, it's still important to try to see our partners point of view. Be honest, but not selfish. Be true to yourself, understanding that your partners feelings are important in that relationship. Also I liked that she spoke of the phases that we have in our lives, that the \\"mommy - prudish\\" stage, is only that.... a stage and that after the children get older, we can get the romance back into our relationship."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just what I needed","review":"This book is an easy read and was exactly what I needed.

I can appreciate good acting but the acting has to have a story attached to it. This movie is nothing more then a bunch of stupid scenes with Miss Day at the centre. The story line is so thin it's barely visible. The acting while good really doesn't jell together and one is left wondering just what they are talking about. I guess it's a favorite for fans of old films like my partner is but oh God I had to fight to stay awake to get through it. A flimsy forgettable pile of fluff which sends social progress back to the dark ages. Just plain stupid in my opinion. I can't believe it was that successful when it first was released."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wonderful Movie/Bad DVD","review":"How could Universal release a favorite beloved DD film of such bad technical quality. It's a shame this movie was not remastered. Take a look at Warner Home Video of the Pajama Game if you want to see superior resolution.

She is an interior decorator, he is a playboy/song writer. Tony Randall is the silly sidekick. Naturally they have many misunderstandings on the rocky road to romance. Doris is stunning in her designer outfits and Rock is one hunk of man. He is a good actor here. The film is good, clean fun with two eternally youthful and beautiful people who look perfect together."},{"rating":"2","title":"An all time favorite!","review":"I have to admit - I love this movie. It is very, very funny and so clever that even though it is a very dated product of it's era - it still always feels fresh and lively to me. Doris Day is adorable here and Rock Hudson is hysterical. (Shades of truths to come!) Tony Randall was a great comic foil and Thelma Ritter still makes me alugh out loud even after 100+ viewings.

This misframing is unacceptable. I was resigned to the fact that the dirt and scratches weren't cleaned up for this new edition, but the mis-framing really put this over-the-top into being a botched release. Universal should really pull this edition. We all work way too hard for our money to to be given this poor a product. A much lesser, non-Academy Award winning film, Don Knott's \\"The Ghost And Mr. Chicken\\" looks great on DVD: sharp, clear, blemish-free, and nicely framed, so Universal CAN take care on their budget line DVDs, they just chose not to in \\"Pillow Talk\\"'s case. Shame on Universal!I should point out though that the sound and colors on this version are a big improvement over the prior DVD, but don't waste your money if you have that version. The mis-framing really makes this the inferior of the two versions.

They are razor sharp, and hold an edge well despite the tough use I put them through.

The whole joint was inspired by the Dope Game in Detroit from a 16 yr old perspective growing up in the days of Pony Down! Besides, his brother James Smith was already well known in the streets when \\"Boomin'\\" dropped making this album truly authentic! Esham even went as far as recording & dropping the 1st double-cd ever in Rap/Hip-Hop titled \\"Judgement Day, Vol. 1 & 2.\\" I feel that my dogg should be in the Hip-Hop Hall of Fame simply because to this day, his lyrics & storytelling abilities are 2nd to none! \\"Boomin' Words From Hell\\" is a classic that you must have!"},{"rating":"2","title":"He Was A Kid!","review":"This CD comes highly recommended as one of the most original of all time.Even if you hate it, give Esham a lot of credit for inventing a genre and being so original at such a young age.

Maybe I've been spoiled by the incredible audio and video quality of YesSymphonic DVD, but I was expecting more from this.If you are a fan of \\"Classic\\" Genesis and Steve Hackett, it's a worthwhile purchase, but the DVD seems to have been simply transfered from video tape without taking advantage of the capabilities offered in the DVD format."},{"rating":"2","title":"See what Genesis lost...","review":"Steve Hackett doing some great variations of classic Genesis stuff (plus Crimson pieces). He is the best thing that happened to the prog rock guitar. If only the classic Genesis line-up had stuck together (even some more GTR would have been good). Nice to see Chester Thompson showing off his extraordinary skills behind the drums. Listen to the end section of 'Firth of Fifth' as it should be played (only misses the unique Collins' drum feel). Watcher of the Skies lacks the morse-code drum rhythm that Collins provided, but it is still excellent. John Wetton doing some good singing considering Gabriel is a hard act to follow - Court of the Crimson King is great. Could do without the sax (but then I personally can't stand the saxophone on anything). A collection of highly skilled prog rock musicians on the same stage, playing some great music.

But the more I read, the more I disliked it. There is little supportive content and advocating BDSM for healing is dangerous. The author is not a professional psychologist or councellor and it shows.This book is for people well along the healing journey, don't start with this text.

What rape victim would find the thought of being bound sexually arousing? Doesn't she know childhood sexual assault brings about great struggles with trust? She wants the rape survivor to trust a spouse or partner to \\"tie them up\\" for sex, when the survivor can't bring herself to feel intimate compassionate love? I was looking for help to restore a loving relationship, instead I read sections on the unthinkable. The use of the \\"F\\" word was disgusting and her terminology for sexual acts were enough to make me want to throw up and forget sex completely.

I'm sorry Chieftans and Bothy Band, neither of you have recorded an album of this caliber. Absolutely the best violin/flute interplays of any Celtic music I have ever heard. There is one bummer on the CD however, and that is the only vocal, a sea chanty called \\"The Maid from Amsterdam\\". Perhaps my aversion to this song on this album is personal. When I was a child, my Dad had an LP of sea chanties sung by renown baritone, Leonard Wilson, and Maid from Amsterdam was one of the songs. My advice to King's Galliard is let a master like Leonard Warren sing songs, and you guys stick to your instrumentals, as good or better than anybody in Irish music."},{"rating":"2","title":"Silken sound, polished playing","review":"The Tokyo quartet, now restaffed since its original cycle of the Beethoven quartets, gives a silky, elegant performance of the Razoumovsky quartets on this 2-CD set. I really wallow in the sound, especially in the opening of Op. 59, no. 1, where the cello solo gratifyingly reaches into the deep dark colors of the cello and resonates. Bravo! No one can touch this except the Quartetto Italiano. Otherwise, there is a little more restraint, emotionally, than I like with these very romantic pieces. The Razoumovsky quartets are unrivalled for sheer beauty and richness of conception and sound. This recording is more memorable for its clean, elegant qualities than for any new realization of the pieces or distinctive emotional insight. Still, if you relish the sound of super audio CDs (and these are hybrid discs you can play on any CD player - I tried it), you will find these polished renditions are well worth the extremely reasonable price."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome!","review":"Aside from the occaisional acting issue, i thought the movie was great. and the little kid was a bad@$$!the effects, acting and storyline were great and aside from the sister's annoying pouts, it was great. never seen a movie quite like it and i was honestly impressed.5 stars well earned. and i decided not to give it 4 stars because the sister's annoying pouts actually received a last-minute pass from the movie council in my head."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stars lie.","review":"I have a lot of B films....

The person who wrote that is an idiot. They paid attention to nothing but the vocal style, and maybe the guitar tone a little bit. Soilwork's riff structures are nothing like In Flames, and if the vocals are a ripoff (and its worth noting that all other Soilwork albums have mixed vocals), then In Flames by that logic, In Flames are just a Death ripoff anyway. Soilwork is doing a latter day Swedish version of thrash, In Flames does psuedo-classical riffs. Saying this album is an In Flames ripoff is like saying Testament ripped off Metallica or that Metallica ripped off Diamondhead. So Soilwork didn't invent a new sub-genre. Sorry!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Clearing Things Up...","review":"NOTE: I thought I would write this review to counter 2 really bad reviews from someone below who will not go mentioned because the point of reviews is to get opinions across and not turn into a \\"mud-slinging\\" contest. Well, Soilwork is a GREAT band, I've heard people say its not original, well if you think that then WAKE UP practically all Swedish death metal has the same kind of sound to it. Soilwork is different from In Flames because it incorporates moments of actual singing, and great slightly high-pitched distorted wraith-like sections to the lyrics. The bass is very audible, drumbs are fast-paced and done with skill, riffs are great. Like just about every Swedish Death/Thrash metal band.

But alas there is no reference to Larry Fast anywhere on the album. On closer inspection, it seems that the word \\"Synergy\\" here is merely part of the title of the album, and there is no mention of the artist name anywhere on the disc.Regardless of whether it was Larry Fast or not (which it's evidently not), the covers on this disc are not very good quality; the cover of \\"Chariots of Fire\\" and \\"Tubular Bells\\" are particularly disappointing.

Aspiring scientists should read it once, I think.The only serious shortcoming is when he says: \\"Science rests on faith\\", p. 152, because of the bad influence of Thomas Reid.

Charmed may be a better word to describe their marriage. What I liked most about the book was the message: life is what you make it. I found myself rethinking about a lot of times when I have complained about little things; not appreciated people I loved, and have been afraid to take risks. As we all know, love and marriage are risky, but it was such a pleasure to read about a couple who willingly dived right in and showed me just what a marriage could and should be."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works as Advertised","review":"These labels work just as advertised.

This is a great book.","review":"From the dustjacket of the book:There are today a number of aristocratic families in England who still suffer from losses sustained by their ancestors at the hands of William Crockford, father of modern bookmaking. Crockford, born in squalor near Temple Bar in 1775, was endowed with an amazing ability to calculate odds more accurately and shrewdly than his fellows. In fact, he soon amassed enough money to open gambling halls all over London.In 1828, he opened Crockford's Club, in the heart of Mayfair. Its members were the cream of Society; its cuisine the best in Europe. And behind this facade of respectability, Crockford accumulated a huge personal fortune and beggared half the aristocracy of England.This is the complete and sordid story of one of the first men to understand what has become basic to most successful forms of vice: that to succeed, vice must be engaged in luxury."},{"rating":"2","title":"A fresh romance!","review":"I enjoyed this book for exactly some of the same reasons other reviewers disliked it. It had a very fresh premise and it kept me turning the pages because I honestly didn't know what was going to happen next. Helene starts out as a very sympathetic character and I felt that Rees was going to end up that way. Eloisa James never disappoints. Her lovely prose has such a ring of authenticity that you almost feel as if her characters and their situations could have really existed in Regency England. A fabulous read!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Unpleasant man bullys unlikable woman","review":"In this Regancy Romance, a husband & wife get along so badly that they have lived literally separate lives for years--in different houses. The wife approaches her husband saying she wants a divorce and a child. The husband says no way, he doesn't like her enough to go through the expense of divorcing her and encourages her to find a lover/potential husband with the guts to front the divorce costs & political maneuvering for her.When the wife calls his bluf and starts to do just that, the husband's personality totally changes. His new policy is \\"move in with me or I'll ruin your life\\" plus a healthy dose of \\"have sex with me to get pregnant\\" and \\"you'll play 2nd fiddle to my mistress, who will be living with us\\". Blech.On top of the repulsive and inconsistent plot, both husband and wife are 100% unlikable. Avoid this turkey."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sexy and fun!","review":"I don't usually write reviews, but I was checking to see if Eloisa James had written any other books -- I adored this book!

Rees is just awful and his character didn't get any better. Helene gave in to him at every point. For a woman who lived apart from her husband for 10 years, you would think she would have developed some backbone and maybe a brain to go in her head. The entire premise was faulty and not in the least romantic. The idea of having a mistress esconced in the house with his wife as romantic would require me to suspend my brain from functioning. Although well written, the plotline and characters leaves much to be desired! I truly hoped and expected a better book from Ms. James!"},{"rating":"1","title":"i tore it up in frustration!","review":"I wish i could give it no stars. This book made me cry in frustration. I literally threw it against the wall and tore it up. It does indeed start well with a promising premise, but the moment the heroine starts to come into her own (and meet a great new guy) the jerk of a husband returns. Make no mistake, he is a jerk. Self -centered, inconsiderate, mean, and downright cruel at times to Helene. I couldn't fathom why she would want to be with him. I don't want to give the plot away for anyone who wants to read it but he treats her in a way that no woman should be treated and she takes it! She just goes along with every stupid demand he makes on her. It was surprising that a woman who could stand to be away from him for 10 years would give in so easily.All of the secondary characters are fascinating. And although I tore the book up in frustration, I would like to read other books by this author. But don't read this one if you have any self respect."},{"rating":"1","title":"How Degrading!!!!","review":"When I read a romance novel I prefer the hero to have honor and integrity. The qualities that Rees did not possess. Considering that he cheated on his wife and put her into degrading positions such as forcing her to live with his mistress. What really disgusted me was how accepting Helene was of Rees's behaviour and even took the blame for it. If she have had any self-respect she would have stood up to him. All in all the story was shallow and meaningless. I was not convinced that the Rees loved Helence or even knows the meaning of love."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a good read","review":"I am so sorry I bought this book, The heroine has no back bone and let's her horrible husband walk all over her, He made his wife live in the same house as his mistress and had the nerve to make his wife sleep in the nursery while his mistress slept in the master bedroom! When I read this I knew the book could not be redeemed, no woman would ever put up with this no matter how much she wanted a child. If you want to read about a dumb heroine with no personality and a stupid hero with no decency who when combined have no passion between them, then this book is for you, But if you enjoy reading good romance novels, please skip this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beyond bad","review":"I wish I could give a no-star rating. This is one of the absolute worst male lead characters I've ever read. Rees is abusive, vicious, selfish and cruel. The heroine is weak and rather pathetic. Even keeping in mind the time period, this relationship is deeply unhealthy and abusive.I've enjoyed other books by this author but this was a complete failure."},{"rating":"1","title":"Let's examine this in perspective...","review":"Eloisa James is one of those authors (for me, at least) who is either hit or miss -- most often miss. Bored one evening, I decided to give this novel a shot (hey, why not?). It was a mistake. I won't bother summarizing the story since so many previous reviewers have already done that. Instead, I'll *try* to justify one \\"good point\\" that the novel might have had.True, the heroine was insufferably weak-willed, and the \\"hero\\" more of a bastard-boor than a dashing lord. However, the ménage à trois between the earl, the countess, and the mistress was surprisingly...evocative of the Duke and Duchess of Devonshire's marriage at the turn of the 18th century. So if that was what James alluded to (albeit comically), then props for her. If not, well, there's not much saving grace left to say for this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not waste your time reading this","review":"Eloisa - what were you thinking???? The hero was so revolting, but I kept reading thinking that something was going to be revealed that explained that it was all a pretense and that he had some positive qualities.....hmmm no such luck! He bumbled through having sex, accidentally discovering a \\"nipple\\" and surprised that touching it could produce pleasure ..... pleeeaaaseeeee!

How this piece of [...] got past the editors, I will never know, but take my advice and pass on this one. I am especially appalled at the way the writer has the heroine still \\"love\\" this creep in spite of everything he does to her. It buys into that horrible mind set that women should be abused emotionally and call it \\"love.\\" Sick, sick, sick!

A true \\"hypochondriac\\" in the best way I've ever seen. I just loved the scene when Rock (her husband in the movie) was purchasing the cemetary plots and Paul Lynde was excellent as the salesman. You could tell he was really into his work! I've seen the doctor in several Disney movies too and he plays the part well. And the medicine cabinet......oh my! That was something to see.

Some nice turns in the supporting cast, too."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Ultimate Acting Trio!!","review":"I originally watched this movie to see Paul Lynde, and while his performance cracks me up, I came to enjoy this movie for far more than his appearance. Hudson plays the ultimate hypochondriac who learns his lesson after overhearing his doctor talking about another patient's grim prognosis and mistaking it for his own. What follows is what makes this one of my favorite movies. One of my favorite lines is when Tony Randall(in his continuing inebriation throughtout the movie) asks the bartender at the party \\"Did you ever REALLY feel a table? Wake up! Wake up! Live your life!\\" Well, it's just hilarious. I also loved Lynde as the bubbly plot salesman who \\"likes people\\". If you enjoy romance comedies without the profanities and sexual situations a lot of today's movies have, this is one to see if not buy. I never get tired of watching Send Me No Flowers.

Spacey is way tooo ooold! to be playing Darrin. This film is part musical, comedy, Drama with a whole-lot-of cheesy. Im very disappointed, Spacey practically did the whole thing, wrote, directed, sang, produced....too much,way too much...Spacey should have hired a younger actor and focused himself on directing or producing, and not tried to do everything himself.Kate Bosworth is great as Sandra Dee, but she has ZERO chemistry when she's with Spacey, instead of lovers it looks like father and daughter ,totally grossed me out.Id recommend a rental if that....hopefully someone will try to make a Bobby Darin movie as good as \\"Ray\\" a movie about Ray Charles .Lets hope."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too old to pay Darin","review":"I have always liked Kevin Spacey but he should have cast a younger man to play Bobby Darin. At 45 years old, Kevin Spacey was too old to play the lead role and could not watch the entire movie because of this reason. Keep in mind that Bobby Darin was only 37 when he died. Not only did Kevin Spacey try playing him at 37, he tried playing him at 20... at the age of 45! No, I couldn't get past the huge age difference."},{"rating":"2","title":"Spacey does Darin....a class act","review":"This is one production where I would suggest viewing the film with commentary first. For no other reason then to more fully appreciate the magnificent way in which Kevin Stacey developed his theme and brought it to the screen.Mr. Stacey gives us an impeccable performance in the starring role and as director opens up new horizons in the biopic genre.Top casting all around.Don't miss this gem.Stacey is Darin.You'll spend the next few days humming La Mer."},{"rating":"1","title":"In a word, \\"Dreadful\\"!","review":"Yes, Kevin Spacey was too old to play the up-and-coming Bobby Darin -- when Darin was Spacey's age, he'd already been dead eight years. Yes, the script is awful, the story-within-a-story framework strained and messy. The dancing's grotesque -- probably designed to cover for the fact that Spacey can't dance. And yes, most of the acting is cringe-inducing: Bob Hoskins and John Goodman giving tired retreads of every other performance they've ever given; Kate Bosworth -- forgeddaboutit! But the biggest problem with \\"Beyond the Sea\\" is that it shows up Darin's determination to out-croon and out-star Frank Sinatra for what it was: a succession of embarrassingly tacky recordings and live performances (with maybe one or two exceptions) supplemented by B-movie attempts at acting. In that sense, it's a homage tha backfires."},{"rating":"1","title":"Darin Deserves Better","review":"I grew up with Darin watching him on Bandstand in the fifties and as he developed into quite a wonderful \\"crooner,\\" an adult singer. I have loved his \\"That's All\\" album through the years, through thick and thin.I'm glad Spacey brought this man more recognition. But Spacey was way too old for the film; Darin died at 37. Kate Bosworth as Sandra Dee is not in Spacey's league as an actor and it was painful to watch her on the screen. It brushed off his early rock and roll years which had great stuff like Artificial Flowers and Clementine (already showing Darin's turning to jazz and more \\"pop\\" tunes, like Sinatra).The story was scattered all over the place. But Spacey's singing was terrific, if not exactly like Darin's. (Sissy Spacek really nailed Loretta Lynn in Coal Miner's Daughter.)This picture was a \\"what might have been\\" rather than a good biopic.Yes, Bobby deserved much better than this. But I give Spacey an e for effort."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great movie for Darin fans","review":"I loved it, but judging by all the gray hair in the theatre, only fans are going. I wish more people would try it out. It really is an interesting movie, and Kevin Spacey sings Darin almost as well as Darin did."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't","review":"watch this movie!! This movie was soooooo boring. Too much swearing for a PG-13. I would have given it an R rating."},{"rating":"2","title":"good movie about the life of bobby darin","review":"This was a good movie. Not great, pretty stylized. I loved the sound track of Bobby Darin songs and it seemed pretty accurate. I like that Kevin Spacey didn't try to change what he was really like. Though Kevin Spacey did a great job, but I like his acting."},{"rating":"1","title":"Uneven","review":"While Kevin Spacey's performance is impressive, the storytelling devices jump around uncomfortably. I enjoyed the musical portions and learned a little about Bobby Darin, so it was not a total waste of time, but almost."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointment all around","review":"I love Kevin Spacey, I love Bobby Darin's music, I love John Goodman and I couldn't wait to see the film. I was really impressed by Kevin Spacey's performance and his fantastic voice but I struggled to stay awake after about the first 20 minutes. I don't know what I expected - a serious biopic about an interesting life, snuffed out all too early probably. What did I get? A 50's type \\"am I a musical?\\" \\"am I a romance?\\" \\"am I a comedy\\" series of OTT (over the top) images punctuated by Darin songs.Sorry, this DVD is being recycled as soon as I can find a taker.P.S. but Kevin Spacey is still one of my favourite actors.... just not in this awful film!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Beyond Boring","review":"This movie was unbelievably boring. Thank God I only paid for it on pay per view and thereby spent $3.99 versus spending $8 at the theatre. I had to fast forward through most of the music just to (hopefully) get to the point. I'm not sure if I dislike Bobby Darin's music, or Kevin Spacey's rendition of it. This movie left me with the same disgusted \\"Ugh\\" feeling as De-Lovely. Has Kevin Spacey lost his mind, or just his talent?"},{"rating":"1","title":"godawful!","review":"This movie is so godawful on every possible level my boyfriend and I had to undergo exorcisms in order to ever watch a Kevin Spacey movie again without having random godawful scenes from it seep, unbidden, into our conscious state. Unfortunately, it has forever altered the way we see him, like discovering something creepy and embarrassing about someone you always thought was so cool. Bobby Darin must be whirling where he's planted."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is Kevin Spacey's best film to date .....","review":"This film was really great. I mean, I wasn't that familiar with Bobby Darin. But, when I saw this movie. I was blown away by Spacey's performance as Darin. He did a great job!!! This is an execllent film."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bobby Darin's Silent Movie","review":"Kevin Spacey's movie is interesting, but I say - he's a cheater. The story is all about the pop singer, Bobby Darin, but you never get to hear Darin sing a single note of music. It's Bobby's story, but Kevin does ALL the singing himself. So you gotta listen to Kevin's second-rate voice - King Kevin\\" the narrator rules. And I find that Kevin Spacey is a second-rate, one-note actor (overrated) in the movies of his I've seen. So go ahead and watch stupid Spacey's shameful sham."},{"rating":"1","title":"average","review":"Kevin Spacey wanted to Pull off doing the Bobby Darin story&He did alright in spots,but in others he was out of his element.Spacey just seemed like a Actor trying tocapture a Role He didn't have his blood in.take what Jamie Foxx did with Ray Charles&then get back to this film&you'll see How One Actor was able to truyl transform himself into a Role while another was there,but was missing the soul&Warmth to pull it off.also using the Kid as a Alter Ego to go back reminded me of Richard Pryor's \\"Jo-Jo Dancer\\" with trying to put all the pieces together.a watachable film,but makes you want to hear&See Bobby Darin that even much more so,Spacey did aight at singing&handling the film,but He just lacked a Certain vibe.Spacey is a really Good Actor,but this film was overlooked for a reason."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not Bad","review":"Not sure how factual the movie was in portraying the life of Bobby Darin, but I did enjoy the movie. I always loved Bobby's music, and I thought that Kevin Spacey did a good job on the majority of his songs."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Movie","review":"Kevin Spacey is one of my favorite actors and he did a great job in this movie. Very touching. Will definitely watch it again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Should have been done long ago.","review":"Kevin Spacey was amazing, and obviously a Bobby Darin fan like myself. The critics may not have liked it, but we the people do. Bob Hoskins was his terrific self as was the rest of the cast...love ya' Kate."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"I wanted to learn more about the life of Bobby Darin. Yes, those of us who weren't born back in the 30's, 40's, and 50's, still know of him.I could have done without the fantasy song and dance sequences - I felt those detracted and distracted from the storyline."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bobby Darin deserved better than this!","review":"Story of one of the greatest entertainers who ever lived not dying from Rhumatic Fever, but dying on screen from a self absorbed, ego maniac, writer, director, and star who looks like he couldn't wait to \\"show the world\\" he could sing and dance. In the process he sabotages a brilliant artist to further his own career (or in this case possibly ending it) for self gain. It's easily the worst movie of this decade and possibly even the last decade. Shame of you Kevin for robbing Bobby Darin of a fitting memorial to his talent. This movie sucks!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Movie","review":"Exquisite movie. My dad had a memory lapse at blockbuster's a few months ago and spend about an hour mulling through the videos hoping he'd run into this movie. He was so excited about it, he wouldn't give us info to help him find it, as he wanted it to be a surprise. To give him credit, he was searching for the title \\"The Bobby Darin Story\\". So I found the movie on amazon and he held onto it for everyone to watch together by a lit fire, with a full stomach on Christmas night. \\"Beyond the Sea\\" was the perfect movie for such a night."},{"rating":"2","title":"From Beyond the Sea","review":"After making the mistake of ordering a DVD in the wrong format - I managed to watch this great movie on my computer! Kevin Spacey is wonderful in this role, and his voice is superb. Long live Bobby Darin's music and long live the fine actors who made this movie so special."},{"rating":"2","title":"Kevin Spacey nails it!","review":"Beyond the Sea was a labor of love for actor Kevin Spacey, he wrote, directed, and stars as singer Bobby Darin and boy he does a wonderful job. Spacey is good in every movie but in this particular role, he shows how colorful of an actor he really is. Kate Bosworth also stars as Sandra Dee, she does an ok job but watch this film if you are a die-hard fan of Bobby Darin's classic music. This movie comes off a tad bit self-indulgent but entertaining. Give this biopic a try. Enjoy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Beyond the Sea","review":"GREAT show. The only portions I didn't care for were the two \\"fantasy\\" scenes. They were over done and out of place in the movie. Spacey has a great voice and the movie is a lot of fun."},{"rating":"2","title":"john reid australia","review":"Being a Bobby Darin fan from way back I was pleased to learn of Kevin Spacey's plans to film his life story. The very talented Spacey has brought Bobby Darin's singing and night club perfomances to remarkable life on the big screen with wonderful memories re-kindled with Darin's hits including Mac the Knife , Beyond the Sea , Dream Lover and many more. Spacey's performance matches Joaquin Phoenix brilliant Johnny Cash renditions. However with all this praise Kevin Spacey as younger Bobby and relationship with Sandra Dee ( Caroline Aaron ) does not feel real as the age difference does not work despite the very obvious black wig.The very professional supporting cast of John Goodman , Bob Hoskins , Brenda Blethyn and Greta Scachi are a highlight. DVD extras are a bonus.Dissapointed Spanish sub-tiles visual throughout movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"QUITE BAD","review":"I grew up with Bobby Darin and this movie didn't do him any justice. Spacy tries but he dosen't make it as Bobby. He shows his age which even the makeup can't hide. Although Spacey has a nice voice I would have preferred having Darin's actual voiceover for Spacey. And all that dancing is not what Bobby was all about. The scence's with the kid takes away from the story and they missed a lot of Bobby's life because of all the screen time wasted with the kid."},{"rating":"2","title":"Kevin Spacey--THE GREATEST TALENT!","review":"I have watched this movie over and over again. Kevin Spacey is remarkable in his role as Bobby Darrin. I think he truly outdid himself in the acting, singing and dancing department. My six year old and I memorized the CD and we so enjoy singing all the songs as loudly as we can. It'll have you dancing and singing too!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Spacey's Yentl","review":"Like Streisand, Kevin Spacey is a big enough star to get away with indulging in ONE musical bomb. His singing, dancing and acting are superb in this film. In fact, they're the only reason to sit through this movie.You know a script is bad when the actors have to break into song and dance for no reason. I don't know much about Bobby Darin, but I hope his life wasn't really as boring as this film makes it seem."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beyond Belief","review":"Kevin Spacey is totally wrong for this role. He is too old, too stiff, too popular, and too ugly to play a boyishly cute teen idol and crooner like Bobby Darin. There are so many unknown talented young actors who could have done a better job...with a better script."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a snoozefest","review":"Bad acting, bad casting, bad writing, bad singing. Just skip it. Made me want to get out my All That Jazz DVD and watch a well done musical biopic."},{"rating":"1","title":"DVD - Beyond the Sea","review":"I am very dissapointed as this DVD isn't compatabile with Australian DVD's which you should have been aware of. Hence we cannot play it. It was for my daughter's birthday which she cannot use?I would appreciate a reply on what to do please."},{"rating":"1","title":"Kevin Spacey's ego","review":"I have great respect for Kevin Spacey as an Actor but as a singer not so much. I love Bobby Darin and I grew up with him so when I saw the movie at the video store I was really excited to take it home and watch it. Much to my dismay I didn't have my glasses on so I only assummed that Bobby Darin would be singing. Big Shock......What was Kevin thinking and who said he could sing? He was much too old to play Bobby and though he tried to move like him his timing wasn't there. If Kevin loved Bobby as much as he said he did he should have found somebody who could play the part and he could just direct it. I wouldn't recommend this movie to Bobby Darin fans because they will only be disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Really painfully embarrassing to watch","review":"The main message this film conveyed is that Kevin must now have an ego large enough to apply for statehood. It's sad that such a talented actor would do something so unintentionally comical. He needs to take a long vacation and maybe do a bit of woodworking or hang gliding."},{"rating":"1","title":"UNBELIEVABLE!!!!","review":"If there was such a rating as 0, would definitely enter it. Having known Bobby, since 1959, until 1972, this is the most BLASPHEMOUS bio of him. Bobby, was, definitely, not an \\"A*****E. Can't believe that Dodd, or Steve Blauner, allowed this film to be produced. Now, let's get to Spacey's performance: DEFINITELY, NOT \\"Oscar\\" material. He can't sing, and worst of all, unable to dance. His overall performance, was a \\"THUD\\"!!!! The sequences in the film, didn't even \\"jive\\" with the truth. Example: \\"Beyond The Sea,\\" was recorded many years prior to Bobby's relationship with Sandra Dee. Never heard Steve Blaumer, referred to, as \\"Boom Boom.\\" As great as Kevin Spacey is as an actor, he should have never have attempted to sing, or, dance. Almost, not an ounce of truth, in this film."},{"rating":"2","title":"Couldn't believe it!","review":"When I first found out that Kevin Spacey sang all the Darin numbers, I did a double take. I didn't believe it, so I watched the film again, and closed my eyes for the numbers...you'd never know it wasn't Darin except for the digital clarity of the recordings! Anyway, the film is superb, very different from a linear biographical film, which is a nice twist, and the performances are out of this world!! I would recommend this film for Kevin Spacey fans, Bobby Darin fans, and for Caroline Aaron's perfomance with Bob Hoskins - amazing! - just about anyone who wants a rollicking good time watching a film. But beware - the tunes won't leave your head for days, if not weeks! Thumbs up all the way!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved it!","review":"I couldn't wait for this movie to come out on DVD, it never played in the movies here and so I had to be patient. It was worth the wait, I loved every minute of it. Kevin Spacey did a wonderful job playing Bobby Darren and the movie was not what I expected....it was even better. If you were a Bobby Darren fan and loved his music then you will enjoy this movie. It brings you back thats for sure. I am anxious for my son to watch this film, I loved it because it was my era, I want to see what he thinks. I highly recommend this movie, it gave me such a good feeling. Enjoy!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Mack is not Back","review":"Bobby Darin was my favorite singer when I was growing up in the 50's and 60's. Kevin Spacey never fully captures Darin's brashness (he should have given the role to somebody much younger). The script was second rate as was a lot of the acting. I was very disappointed with the film."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pure joyand fascination!!","review":"My husband and I just spent a wonderful afternoon watching and thoroughly enjoing Kevin Spacey in \\"Beyond the Sea.\\" I'm so amazed that this movie wasn't a huge hit at the box office - probably because no one was mutilated or blown up! We grew up in the Bobby Darin era and loved his music then and still do. It was fascinating to see the man behind the music. The way the story was told with Bobby reliving his life with the help of himself as a young boy was brilliant! I wish I could tell Kevin Spacey in person what a fantastic job he did with this movie. If I had my way, he would've won best movie, best actor, best director. It was obvious that the man poured his heart and soul into this endeavor. He's a fabulous singer and dancer and he nailed Bobby in every way. This is a movie I want to see again and again!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great music and performances","review":"I saw this movie in theatres and ever since I've thought about it quite often. Certainly will pick up this DVD - definitely a gem that was missed by many. If you are a Darin or Spacey fan for sure pick this up. If you like music-bios or enjoy the nostalgia of the 50's and 60's, this brings it all together."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beyond the Sea","review":"One of the best movies that I've ever seen! What a wonderful way to honor one of the best entertainers who ever lived by one of the best actors in Hollywood. Kevin Spacey outdid his acting with his singing. If that's at all possible! Academy Award performance!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Darin's music illustrates the story of his life","review":"I enjoyed this movie very much and I recommend it highly. The soundtrack is simply delicious, a meticulous recreation of the arrangements used by Darin, given to Spacey for use in the movie. As soon as I heard the soundtrack, I knew that Darin was in safe hands with Spacey. I loved the music and the dancing and the fantasy elements here, I feel they helped to frame the story. Darin's story is a tough one, and the ending is surprisingly upbeat. I urge you to see this movie and experience what Spacey has to offer which is a loving tribute to a fantastic entertainer, Bobby Darin."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ego trip","review":"This could have been an interesting film. Somehow, due to Kevin Spacey's over-identification with Darin, he had no objectivity and the result is a mess. I watched it for about 45 minutes, really trying to like it, but finally exited it. As many others have pointed out, Spacey is way too old to play the young Darin. He sings allright but his moves are way too cool, too snappy, too everything icky...It was embarassing to watch this very talented actor descend into this terrible role. He should have spent the money on good pyschotherapy to discover what motivated this obsession."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the type of programming I care for.","review":"Thios was a dissapointment. I expected a lovely musical and life story. It contains language etc. that spoiled the story and music."},{"rating":"1","title":"So so aweful","review":"This movie was dry and boring. It had very little story line and I had even less interest. That's sad because I enjoy Kevin Spacey's work and I enjoyed the music of the man as well. I shut the movie off after about 45 minutes of boredom."},{"rating":"2","title":"Spacey touches many generations!!","review":"I know that Mr. Spacey had some difficulty in making this film. I believe it is important that we understand that the value of a film does not always fall in its ability to fatten a wallet but in its ability to motivate the human spirit and celebrate a life worth noticing. I must admit I knew nothing about Mr. Darin prior to seeing this film. After viewing \\"Beyond the Sea\\" I have a new respect for the man called Bobby Darin. His life was inspiring and after seeing the film I wanted to jump into my own life and make things happen. His motivation and determination flowed from the screen. Mr. Darin was able to accompish so much despite great difficulties and a short life. The film is filled with the finger snapping, foot tapping music of Mr. Darin (sung well by Mr. Spacey--surprise surprise) and you just want to get up and dance with enjoyment. I would definately ignore any negative comments on this one and splish splash your way to see it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bobby Would've Been Pleased","review":"The movie is a musical done in the style of Bobby Darin's era. As a lifelong fan of Bobby Darin, I was hoping for a straight bio with music ala \\"Ray\\" as Bobby had a fascinating life. It's always risky to make something that isn't necessary commercial but true art. It's a movie about a cool and classy guy made by a cool and classy guy. It's also nice to do without the usual lip synching. Kevin sings and sings so incredibly well that some of his vocals outshine Bobby's. For that alone, rent the DVD when it's released. For that matter, purchase the soundtrack. You won't be disappointed...it's incredible."},{"rating":"1","title":"Spacey just too old.","review":"Okay movie, very good music, very good singing by Spacey. The big question for the viewer, though, is the obvious one: Can you accept the middle-aged Spacey playing the young Darin? I could not. The age problem was particularly jarring in scenes between Spacey and Kate Bosworth."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible waste of time","review":"I was so looking forward to this movie. Within minutes I knew it was a stinker, as Kevin Spacey from the very start did not look or sound like A great entertainer. After seeing this movie....was Bobby Darins whole life about his hair???. How did he get a recording contract? Why no mention of his divorce or 2nd wife??? Why not call this what it was..The Kevin I want to sing and dance story."},{"rating":"1","title":"A German Review","review":"Diese filmische Erfahrung ist erschienen, nach älteren Menschen und Mädchentypen eingestellt zu werden!

This is pretty much how this movie comes across.Kevin Spacey appears to capture him well, as a vain and ultimately a lonely young man who, in the end, faded away from relevance. But this does not make for a good movie. The movie seemed to be very selective in what it presented, and created no sympathy for the man or for those around him. I was glad when it was over and I can not recommend it as worthwhile viewing. There are much better movies out there based on the life of a musician, and with more interesting characters, such as De-Lovely or Ray, and this one just does not belong in that category."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fistful of Alice - with a new name/cover","review":"If you are a fan, you already own this.

The more I listen to it the more I not only understand it but gain insight into the complexity of her world. It is a challenging piece that makes you think, a rare thing in our cookie-cutter universe.

It is just her and bunch of sounds and other peoples voices echoing and repeating over and over and over......I'm listening to it now, trying to find something I like. No luck.

I am a Bjork fan since the Sugarcubes and have always been so impressed with her vocal talents and her vision. But I must say this album is just not what I expected.

One side is a compact disc, and the other side is a DVD with the music in 5.1.The sound quality of the CD is excellent. It is one of the best sounding CDs I have heard. The sound quality of the DVD is amazing and the 5.1 system is used to its fullest. It is the best 5.1 mix I have heard.Unfortunately, the music is a bunch of crap. Think Yoko Ono gone Icelandic. There is lots of screaming, heavy panting and other wierd noises coming from Bjork and her backup singers.I like Bjork pushing the boundaries, but this time I think she went over the edge."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mind blowing!!","review":"If you like your music all sugary and fluff with no substance, this isn't for you.Another amazing collection from Björk, unlike anything else you'll hear this year. I have every single CD by Björk, but this is also totally unlike any of those, her most daring release to date! It comprises layered vocals with hardly any instruments and very tight production, giving a stark, haunting atmospheric sound.Standouts include the ambient flowing 'Oceania' (which she stunningly performed at the 2004 Olympics opening ceremony), the stomping 'Triumph of a heart' (which is like techno with no instruments), the haunting 'Pleasure is all mine', 'Desired constellation', and 'Mouth's cradle'.This CD does take some playing to get into the music but when you do, wow!And I absolutely adore the cover photography. Björk's CD covers, like her music, have become a thing to look forward to.Brilliant!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Definitely not her best work.","review":"What was she thinking? It seems like every band/artist has this period where they let the art get in their way of making great music. I definitely think that it's necessary for an artist to evolve and change with the times in order to have a prolonged career, but Bjork's dive into the artistic doesn't do her justice. There are a few great tracks on this album, but fot the most part it's disappointing. I eagerly anticipated this album, as I am, without a doubt, a fan of Bjork's music. However, I cannot help but feel like it was a waste of my $15."},{"rating":"2","title":"ornaments of genius","review":"An unparalleled work of art that defies commercial expectations; and boldly explores adventurous territories of sound. It is at times frolicsome and upbeat. At others it is deep, dark and mysterious. The work is surreal and mind expanding, exploring both the recesses of the unconscious mind and the further reaches of space and time. Yes, it is all of that and much, much more. Mike Patton and Bjork become a match made in a realm beyond any others. Spectacular and profoundly satisfying work!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Experimental","review":"The word 'Experimental' summs up this album. Interesting maybe, but lack of melody, distracts from the Bjork known and followed by many. I was dissappointed with the album - 'big time'. If it was not for the fact that Bjork was doing something original I would have given 1 or zero stars - because pushing the boundaries is what makes for interesting stuff. Its just this is so appallingly bad that I can never get through a single track without thinking - 'oh my goodness my dog sings better than this'. Hmmmmmmmmmmmm"},{"rating":"1","title":"The Decline and Fall of Bjork","review":"I used to love Bjork when she was in the Sugar Cubes, and I became a faithful fan, purchasing her first three solo works punctually, like a true devotee. However, each one left me prgressively more disappointed. I started to suspect that Bjork was playing an immense practical joke on the music world, to see how much crap she could dish out and still rake in the bucks. Alas, with this work, I have no doubt whatsoever that my early suspicions are now confirmed. Anyone who hears the \\"music\\" samples provided here on Amazon, and still buys this album, well, what can I say? You clearly are not in on the joke. Either that or you just have some fetish for giving your money to Bjork for no good reason.

If you like the weirder parts of Vespertine (which I liked overall) then you'll probably enjoy it."},{"rating":"1","title":"all over the place&no place at all","review":"Bjork is the kind of Artist you either feel most of the way or you just have that look on your face like what in the World is this? this Album has some interestign ideas that sudenly get losed just as they are springing outward. Vocally she is stil challenging to digest in spots.She is Creative but also seems sorta stuck in a rut lately&can't find that balance of Groove&Getting to a Point where things all come together."},{"rating":"1","title":"Jane Siberry did this years ago","review":"and she did it much MUCH better.

But this . . . this is a mess."},{"rating":"2","title":"3D experience","review":"Not an easy album at all. So far, I own all of Bjork's CDs and Vespertine is my favourite. I liked it from the first time.Medulla, instead, needs much more reflection. I am not sure I will like it in the end.What I strogly advise is, if you consider buying it, absolutely get the SACD (or DVD audio) version. Of course you must have a decent surround system.The layers of Bjork's voice come from the different corners, and dialogue with each other and with the sounds and noises in the space. The 3D experience is really unique and cannot compare to the flat CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bjork's best album yet","review":"When I first listened to clips of songs from this album, I wasn't too interested... probably because it is so unlike anything that has been done before. Now I consider it Bjork's best album. I love that she took such a risk with this album and it's fascinating that she created so much music from human sounds (throat-singing, percussive sounds, even breathing). There is a raw, human element that makes this album profound, and there is a lot of variety among the songs. It's less pop and more genre-defying -- a step in the right direction, I think."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bold and Beautiful","review":"As I listen to this album and read others reviews I'm see one disturbing common. There are alot of narrow-minded music fans out there. This album is a thing of beauty, it's simple yet complex, none of the pre-packaged MTV music clones would do an album where all the music came from their mouths. Bjork isn't afraid to try something from the heart, something she wants, not something some suit wants.

Loved her in the Sugarcubes and I've followed her solo career buying every album or remix I could get my hands on. When I heard that she was making an 'experimental vocal' album I was a little thrown off but had faith in her 100%. Upon finally hearing the long awaited Medulla I was met with total disappointment. 2 good songs 'Oceania' and 'who is it' then you're stuck with a bunch of filler. Does experimental have to be this painfully boring and uninspired?? King Crimson, Squarepusher, Anodyne, Doves, have all 'experimented'.The only difference is that they don't put you to sleep like Medulla manages to do. I'm a lover of art but this is a self serving album.

I'm not sure there is a word to describe \\"Medulla\\". I'm speechless! To others it may be difficult to listen to but to Bjork fans it's a delicious cake with layers upon layers of icing.

But I think they will be wrong. I mean from the beginning of the cd to the last note you are in touch with the soul of bjork. The emotions that it gave to me were so beautiful and I can't tell you how much I felt happy. It's not really only vocal cd, there are many electronic effects and percussions and choirs. If you love \\" An echo a stain \\" You will Love this record. It is the natural step after Vespertine, is hard but so deep, so human, so different each time you listen it.

It's not revlotuionary, it's just annoying."},{"rating":"1","title":"O_O","review":"....Bjork scares me. She's such a freak. Why do people like her? She's the Tom Green of music, liked for her utter weirdness. This sounds like music from a greasy, quirky demon from the bowls of Hell. Her voice is really annoying, she's like whining and screaming and crying. The fact that there is NO background music makes this worse. If you're ever in the mood for Bjork, scratch your nails across a chalk board, it's the same thing, it will likely satisfy the disturbing urge that won't last long anyway."},{"rating":"1","title":"narcissistic car alarm","review":"how people keep falling for this worthless load of self-hype is beyond me. she does nothing that isn't an advertisement for how \\"uniquely talented\\" she is, every gesture points back at herself: what a worthless basis for creativity. sure, she surrounds herself with talented people: the only good parts of this record are when somebody else is on. look at her eyes in photos sometime: fierce psycho narcissism. how long before she falls off the map? or maybe she'll be the Cher of the alterna-set someday, flogging her dumb showoff costumes to megamalls. she and that crap factory Matthew Barney make such a perfect couple."},{"rating":"1","title":"the worst CD I've ever heard from a normally good artist","review":"What a mistake this album was! Where are the beats? Bjork got famous for her beats, the sampled cool drums and stuff like from \\"Human Behaviour\\" and \\"Army of Me\\", I love those tracks. Her album \\"Post\\" is her best in my opinion, because mainly of its great beats. THis album has no beats! Talented singers need instruments backing'em up, otherwise the melodies are just boring! The whole album reminds me of the song \\"Tom's Diner\\" from Suzanne Vega, I wanted the remix and bought the album only to find that the whole song had no instruments backing it up. Songs suck like that! Don't you dare buy this CD. If you want Bjork's best, look no further than \\"Post\\" and \\"Debut\\", they are the most creative. This CD is probably the worst I've ever heard, the only song with a real beat is the last track, and it's rather strange too."},{"rating":"1","title":"Halloween never sounded spookier","review":"Ok, when I first heard that Bijork was coming out with another album I was excited. So I ran to the nearest store and purchased it for $17.99 CDN. I put the disk in to my CD player and after listening to the first 5 tracks I sampled the rest of the CD by playing the first 30 seconds, of each track, and then skipping to the middle of the track. I listened the whole thing and found after the second time through, I still did not like it. (If you like spooky noises, barely audible vocals, and tracks that have nothing but silence to fill the gaps between the next track, its a must buy! Great for Halloween!

This review is purely for the purpose of talking about the Limited Edition. I wasn't too impressed with it, because the lyrics are printed on the same paper as the poster (which is only the same photo as the cover), so if you want to read the lyrics, you'd have to take down the poster to do it. I know you can look online or whatever, but I just think it's not practical.The case was like her greates hits one, just a two-sided digipak. The sleeve for the CD probably doesn't protect it that much, I liked the case of the Homogenic limited edition."},{"rating":"2","title":"Layers and threads","review":"Carole King wove a \\"tapestry\\" in the '70s... now Bjork totally reinvents what the word means. I'd say this CD is deliciously disturbing... I had it on and a friend who knows music pretty well couldn't get over it... every time I listen to it I hear something new. Sometimes I know I am hearing the same sounds I heard last time, but the total experience is completely different. Maybe Joni Mitchell's \\"Mingus\\" is the only other CD I can think of with the sort of diversity on \\" Medulla\\".This is a very intriguing look into one of the most creative and sometimes downright weird minds in any sort of art today."},{"rating":"1","title":"noise","review":"I love Bjork (especially Debut Bjork), and I was so happy to hear Bjork's out with a new album, but it's just sounds like a whining tori amos in an Icelandic accent.buy it for the collection, not really for listening."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's Björk after all","review":"Get ready to meet a new side of Bjork. In a recent interview (posted on her website) she admits that some people will hate this album, while others will love it. She said she doesn't care either way.This album has an excellent pace. There are short accapella songs interweaved between other, more dancy, songs. Starting from where Vespertine left off, this album's sound is totally different from the ground up. Human voice replaces the strings and electronic beats that Bjork fans are used to. The album was also composed using Eastern musical scales, giving it a fresh feel. It is an audio experience to say the least. Mouth's Cradle is one of the BEST tracks on here.... I can not sit still when I hear it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bjork's Fan Base Will Shrink With This CD","review":"I liked the direction of Bjork's previous work, \\"Vespertine\\", so I expected to like \\"Medulla\\", however I found this very difficult to listen to.Headphones help, because there's a lot going on in the background, but musically this CD comes up short. Bjork really must have had to get something out of her system.There's lots of \\"noodling\\" going on, and many of the songs seem incomplete and not well thought out.Bjork will definitely not gain any new fans with this CD, and long-time fans (of which I count myself) will listen first before buying the next one.This CD is bad. There. I said it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cool","review":"This album is cool. Its inconsistent, not completey successful, and definitely not very refined, though I don't think that's Bjork's thing, exactly.However, it does have a handful of tracks which are just too high on the cool meter for me to give a lesser rating. Their coolness is kinda associated with novelty though, which fades, and admittedly I haven't listened to the album in a few months, but its totally worth checking out, especially if you have a bit of an open mind."},{"rating":"1","title":"Huge disappointment","review":"I'm going to be brief. I love Bjork's earlier music, even Vespertine. I welcome her experimentation, but here, I find her experiment to have failed. This album is not enjoyable to me in the least. I was so excited for this new album from one of my favorite artists that I didn't mind getting ripped off by an expensive CD store just so I could have it immediately. Boy do I feel ripped off now. Listen to this one before you consider buying it."},{"rating":"1","title":"If I could give this zero stars, I would!","review":"This is the first time I have felt compelled to leave a review of an album. The absolute worst excuse for an album that I have heard. I am usually quite open-minded, and all for an artist who explores different approaches to their talent, but this CD defies all reason. Not only do I not like a single track on it, I could not even play it as background noise without feeling like I was about to go insane. The tracks are annoying and weird, pure and simple. And that's all I'm going to say. Listen at your own risk, but I highly recommend saving your money this time around. Hopefully Bjork will get back on track after this apparent mid-life crisis passes....."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great sounding crap","review":"IF YOU BUY THIS ALBUM, THIS \\"DUAL DISC\\" IS DEFINETLY THE ONE TO BUY.One side is a compact disc, and the other side is a DVD with the music in 5.1.The sound quality of the CD is excellent. It is one of the best sounding CDs I have heard. The sound quality of the DVD is amazing and the 5.1 system is used to its fullest. It is the best 5.1 mix I have heard.Unfortunately, the music is a bunch of crap. Think Yoko Ono gone Icelandic. There is lots of screaming, heavy panting and other wierd noises coming from Bjork and her backup singers.I like Bjork pushing the boundaries, but this time I think she went over the edge."},{"rating":"2","title":"Her voice carries the album.","review":"When I first heard Bjork was releasing this album I expected pure vocals with minimal instruments, very acapella. Well this record is almost that except for the fact that she has created a wall of sound entirely consisting of vocals, sonic manipulations and simple beats. A logical and utterly thrilling next step after Vespertine Bjork is creating a catalogue of albums that will be looked back upon and seen as groundbreaking and important as artists such as the Beatles, Velvet Underground, Underworld, Nirvana, U2 and others. A truly unique and evolving artist."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I expected from Bjork :(","review":"I figured as long as I'm a big fan of Bjork, have been since she was in SugarCubes, by now her albums would sound better and better. I was wrong. I was excited to find her new album out. I just got it today and listened to it with a grimace face. It was that sour. Too many up and down voices from the \\"Extra\\" choir that she has in the background of many of the songs, like in the song \\"Oceania\\". It made it sound way too cheesy, almost like she was trying too hard to make the music sound unique. Very disappointed with \\"Medulla\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Headphones Required","review":"I too was unsure of how I'd feel about such an experimental album. But Bjrk has always been experimental, and I kept this in mind when I purchased the album. If you like Bjrk, you will enjoy this album. If you only like a small sampling of her work, you probably won't enjoy it. Simple as that.There are numerous standout tracks, which include \\"Who Is It,\\" \\"Where Is The Line\\" and \\"Desired Constellation.\\" Because there are no sample sound files here, I recommend going to the iTunes music store to sample these tracks infact, it allows you to sample ALL tracks."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ahh.... Bjork","review":"I love Bjork! What else can one say about it? The triumph of the heart remains one of my favorite songs ever!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good but could sound better","review":"Bjork has a beatiful voice, and this album doesn't reflect that so much... but it's still interesting. Just listen to it before buying it, because only bjork lovers will like this album. I do."},{"rating":"1","title":"I can make those noises with my mouth too!","review":"An album with no instuments, just noise from people's mouths gets annoying after a while. Nothing on this album stands out. I wanted to shoot my CD player after a couple of songs, but that would be violent, so I didn't do it. Don't buy this, get something older from Bjork or her best of. She's fallen off her rocker and nobody is helping her up."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Dud","review":"Rarely would I ever rate a musician so low, that I normally would enjoy SO MUCH.Bjork, you have disappointed this fan. When It became news that \\"Medulla\\" were to be made strictly by human utterance (completely vocal) I was hoping for a strikingly different release.Well, I was right about one thing: this release IS striking. Strikingly BAD. I have never heard anything so over-produced and lifeless being released by Bjork, or any number of other artists of similar taste, for that matter.The beats are overdone, the harmonies overdone or lacking. I feel if this album was stripped down of the noisy and ANNOYING voice-overlays, you might just have a Gem.Desired Constellation is the only good track- so 1 star for this album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Listen to it before you judge it","review":"This is one of the harder albums to review. You can read all these posts here, but I highly suggest listening to Björk's new album before judging it. Here, you're only going to read reviews based on personal opinions and it's definitely more along the lines of contemporary classical in nature. For those looking for pop music, go elsewhere. For those interested in music as an artform and her soundscapes as somewhere to sit back and immerse yourself in, then give it a go.Check Medúlla out if you are open to new styles of music - if you like stuff like Radiohead, experimental, electronic, industrial, or ambient - but if you're looking for more \\"Army of Me,\\" look elsewhere. This is intelligent music."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sad Face","review":"I love Bjork, but there is something seriously wrong with this album. Perhaps Bjork is too tired/bored of making the electronic harmonic/pop music she used to. I have an extreme open mind and ear for all sorts of experimental music; but at the same time I know not to mistake lack of talent for genius. Clearly Bjork is a very talented singer; however her songwriting in this album is terrible as is her selection of background \\"instruments\\". Unfortunately it looks as if Bjork is running into the same problem many other great artists have; they begin to run out of ideas as they age, yet they continue to try. This album is doubly depressing for me because for some reason Bjork enjoys having this album consume a significant portion of her live shows."},{"rating":"2","title":"FANFREAKINTASTIC","review":"I recommend this seller to any and everyone! My package arrived much before I expected And Bjork is just Phenomenal.!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Now this is a brave album!","review":"Medulla is probably bjork's bravest album. Made mostly of voices, sometimes electronically manipulated, this is a Bjork all her own. Her powerful intelect never rests and this is indeed music of blood and guts as she has stated in an interview somewhere. This is very human music from it's most human core. I always applaude courage in a world where everyone seems to be always after money or validation through stardom or whatever and she's living her very own musical evolution that's totally unique and fascinating. This is also a very icelandic album and you can feel all the freedom and magic that comes with it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"True inspiration","review":"I've never reviewed an album before but with all the mixed reviews this disc has been getting I felt the need to put in my two cents. Although the normal electronic vibe is not very prominent on this disc, it's there. It comes in the form of some light programming and Razhel from the Roots. He is truly the most talented vocal percussionist I have ever had the pleasure of hearing. If nothing else, get this cd for the raw passion he throws into it. But Bjork reaches to a higher level on her latest effort in my opinion. She leaves you haunted, sending chills down your spine with every note she graces with her touch. If you have any true appreciation for real vocal talent, this cd is for you. It is a truly inspired piece of artwork that gives much praise to the human voice as an instrument. I am overjoyed with this release and hoping that Bjork keeps pushing the boundaries on people's perception of art in song."},{"rating":"2","title":"makes amnesiac sound like travis","review":"this is for me the greatest album since radiohead's kid a. Although bjork's back catalogue has some great material and vespertine was a fantastic album this is the first Bjork album which I feel like I can really call great.

I LOVE IT!! It is experimental, I've never , ever heard anything like it. There are absolutely no musical instruments on this recording, except for voices. These voices are like ocean waves, with ebb and flow. It reminds me of a time in history, it reminds me of dreams I've had, but I cannot put my finger on. Bjork's Medulla is a keeper. Those who feel Tori Amos, PJ Harvey, Portihead, Corinna Fugate, will be feeling Bjork's Medulla."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hardly unique, but still interesting","review":"Bjork doesn't score points here for a unique idea. Todd Rundgren did an entirely a capella project about 20 years ago that also had human voices doing \\"instrumental\\" parts. That aside, this is a more successful and interesting application of the idea. Basically, the music still sounds like Bjork, which isn't surprising given her unusual sense of melody and composition. Of primary interest here are the unusual textures she gets in the vocal arrangements from a variety of vocalists. That is the real triumph of the record, since this would also have been a very good Bjork album had it been scored for her usual mix of electronic and acoustic instrumentation."},{"rating":"1","title":"start cringing","review":"before i say the unpositive things i am about to say about this album, let me say that i really like most of bjork's music. she has been tickling my ears with the most unusual yet listenable pop since her first albums with the sugarcubes, and while i have come to expect something different from each subsequent effort, i could always count on being seduced each time. which is why i was so disappointed with \\"medulla\\". i know. she's being an artist. she's pushing the envelope. she's broadening my tastes. no, she was just trying my patience. track after track of waiting for the song to get good, but having to skip forward out of shear aural irritation. i'm sure there are people for whom this album will be just the sort of thing they've been longing for, but for me it will probably be the last bjork album i buy without listening first."},{"rating":"2","title":"a truely innovative body of work","review":"maybe not a CD i would play on an everyday basis, but the mere story behind this album is so fascinating. the majority of tracks were created only with the human voice and being a rahzel fan as well, i am completely astounded by every track."},{"rating":"2","title":"No Instruments Except Voices","review":"This CD is my alarm clock every morning, I really enjoy the idea of only using voices, vocalists, sounding like drums, really sharp rhythmic vocals.

Bjork is an Artist like no other, \\"The Pleasure Is Mine\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"after all, she remains a pop artist...","review":"Bjork last LP, Medulla, has been presented by someone as it was a contemporary classical music work. Well, if we have to judge Medulla from a classical point of view it should be rated less than zero. Bjork is not stupid, and clearly knows she is doing (high quality) pop music... maybe sometimes she forgets it. Let a boys' choir listen to Stockhausen and ask them to imitate his style: probably you'll get something like Anchestors.\\"Experimental\\" doesn't mean \\"clever\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best I have Heard","review":"One internet messageboard I attend describes this album as \\"swans doing it\\" and I tend to agree. The album is elegant, but also has it's heavy, sensual moments. I think one day in the thesaurus \\"sex\\" and \\"bjork\\" will become identical terms.While the sound is instantly recognizable as Bjork, it definately throws a new twist into the machine. I won't go into the details (there are hundreds of reviews for this album that go into that), just know that this is one of Bjork's most awe-inspiring ideas."},{"rating":"1","title":"Over the Edge","review":"Bjork, having achieved momentary diva pop stardom, is doing everything in her power to erode her fan base. This self-indulgent waste of time will be available soon for $1.35 as merchants attempt to recover their investment. A classic example of the \\"Emporer's New Clothes\\" story in real life. As the kid finally blurted as the naked Emporer strode through town, \\"HE HAS NO CLOTHES ON!!\\"... Bjork has released an album where \\"THERE'S NO MUSIC!!\\" Sure, the intelligentsia may gush... but don't be fooled.There is nothing but empty vocals. And I mean nothing. It sounds like she's recording ad lib moments. THAT'S IT. Song after song. It makes you long for the days when she used more conventional instrumentation, like the xylophone made from car exhaust pipes or the Innuit Choir and music box...A collosal waste of time, money, and talent.Re-unite with the Sugarcubes already and forget this lame solo career."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not my kind of music","review":"Bjork has been playing with her computers again. She is doing science experiments on her vocal samples. And I do like science. But the one thing Bjork hasn't done for this album is make music.Bjork tricked me into becoming a fan with a few songs she made a long time ago: Bachelorette, Isobel, Hunter, and All Is Love. All I'm saying is, if that's the Bjork you like, skip this album.The old Bjork had melodies, the new Bjork has sound effects."},{"rating":"1","title":"painful to listen to","review":"I loved every Björk release up until this one, Vespertine most of all. It seemed she had taken her considerable talent and refined it and done something very magical with it.And then came this. A love-it-or-hate-it album, and I hate it, sad to say. It's as if she cast aside all her skills and talents beyond her voice, and didn't give her voice the right environment in which to shine.I'm all for experimentation, but in my ears, this one failed. I sincerely hope her next release returns to former glory."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just awesome!","review":"I think that this album is great. It's so interesting. It took a few listens before I really got sucked in by it. Now, I find myself singing some of the lines and sounds of these songs in my head when I least expect it. I've had it since it came out and after getting into it, I found it hard to listen to much else for at least a month (probably more). I also found it hard at first to listen to other Bjork albums which I've always loved, after listening to this one.I've read some reviews from people that didn't like the album. I guess I can understand and appreciate that. All I can say is that it's too bad that they don't get from it what I do. I imagine that they get it somewhere else though.So buy it :) I also recommend listening to the \\"inner or deep part\\" (making of) documentary first. I think that it helps you realize what you're really listening to. It gives a visual understanding of the talent that you are hearing."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Voices Are Here","review":"Indeed, this album does require its listeners to be open minded, and to put forth a certain effort to understand its complexity, but if you do those things you'll be rewarded with a breath-takingly rich album. First off, this record is freaking odd. That I will not lie about, but it also provides an escape from the typical forms of music, and it sort of brings you into another world, and provides a deeper understanding of what the human vocals are capable of. The fist single \\"Oceania\\" is literally a sea of voices that swim around Bjork's main vocals. This album essentially focuses on the human voice, with everything from choirs to beat-boxers. This is a innovative album, even for Bjork who is known for her out of the ordinary tunes, but its also creative and I recommend a listen."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretty Disappointing","review":"I have been a fan of Bjork for a long time. Each of her other albums were innovative, interesting and somewhat fun. This one sucks pretty bad. It is very boring, I feel like Bjork is focused so much on being \\"artistic\\" that her music, especially on this CD is becoming unlistenable."},{"rating":"1","title":"way too inaccessible","review":"I am a huge Bjork fan. I've liked everything to date, but this latest album I must say is a huge disappointment. I give her props for not concerning herself with critical success and being experimental, but I just can't get into this latest release, \\"Medulla\\". I think \\"self-indulgent\\" is a good way to describe this one. Instead of presenting listeners with a concept or an idea in many songs, she either presents us with acapella musings in Icelandic, or a collection of moans, gasps, and other random sounds (Ancestors). I found the overwhelming theme of the songs that arent acapella to be dark and sinister. Certainly not the Bjork I fell in love with with the glorious \\"Post\\" and \\"Homogenic\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Don't Miss Björk's Medúlla","review":"Ok, let me put this into context for you. I'm a major Björk fan. I've always been drawn to her amazing voice mixed with beat-driven electronica. When I heard that she was going to make an all-vocal album, I was a little hesitant. So, when the Amazon packaged arrived yesterday, I wasn't sure what to expect. Last night, I took Medúlla and my headphones along for a walk in the neighborhood.My first impression was, \\"Sweet mother of mercy, this is incredible!\\" I still feel that way. How in the heck can a human make sounds like this? It's not corny or fake-sounding either. It's beautiful. \\"Where Is the Line\\" and \\"Who Is It\\" sunk their teeth into me. Great songs.This album is probably not for a Björk novice. I'd start with Post or something like that. All told, Medúlla is a natural progression from Vespertine. Highly recommended for those a bit familiar with her earlier work."},{"rating":"2","title":"TAPESTRY OF VOICES","review":"Bjork has really pushed the boundaries on this remarkable album. Assisted by the Icelandic Choir, London Choir and other musicians like Rahzel (of The Roots), Björk delivers a spooky and gripping album where vocal chords take the place of instruments. At times it sounds inaccessible, like a tuneless vocal growl, while at other times the listener is enraptured by the sweeping harmonies. Some of the lyrics are in Icelandic and others are based on English poetry but it's all very organic and authentic. It reminds me of Meredith Monk's Dolmen Music and the experimental stuff of Scott Walker. Here you'll hear the human voice in all its glory and stunning variety. And its many moods too. Medulla might not appeal to all her fans, but I found it to be a bold musical statement with plenty of charms. Repeated plays should reward the more adventurous listener."},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic tracks","review":"This is the best Perez Prado album available. It has all the originals which were the best. Great sound considering the original hits (Mambo No.5, Mambo No.8, Que rico el mambo) were recorded in 1950. Ignore the first review that was written by someone who knows little about Perez Prado."},{"rating":"2","title":"childhood memories","review":"My mom and her sister just loved listening and dancing to most of these lively power packed arrangements on this album. It really brings back so many memories. I admire Perez Prado's music and his band. Professional music, that really started it all, thats what I like."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poorly mastered, amateur mix","review":"Only die hard fans of Prado or folks with no appreciation for a good sounding CD will dig this album. Each track has a different volume and quality level ranging from transistor radio to hifi. BUT, if you want to hear him at his best but can do without Cherry Blossom Pink, check out the CD 'PREZ' The Mambo King, Vol. 1 [Original recording remastered]. It's fantastico and sounds so good it's hard to believe it was recorded in '57.

These are actually large balls of litter so you can't scoop out the poo without taking the litter with it. When they urinate on them, they turn to a white mush, get on their paws and are tracked all over the cage, like a wet cement. I used to scoop and spot clean each day but now am having to do the full washing of their cage everyday. They also insist on peeing elsewhere now, when they were potty trained before this litter. I'm thinking that they don't like tracking this wet cement like product on their paws. Will not be purchasing this product again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ferret plays in it","review":"My ferret loves this but for the wrong reason--he thinks its a toy! he plays in it, scattering it everywhere.

After only a few days of use the litter turned into a mushy smelly grey clay like substance. It's like the litter completely melted, and it was a real pain to clean out the litter box. I do not recommend."},{"rating":"2","title":"It works!","review":"All I did was pour this critter litter inside a litter pan and put it in one corner of my guinea pig's cage, and that's all it took. I didn't have to train her or anything and she started hopping right in to do her business. Of course she does leave stray poops and some pee around her cage, but having the litter seriously cuts down on the amount of time in between cage cleanings."},{"rating":"2","title":"Easy to clean","review":"I have diabetic hamsters so it's a hassle cleaning up their huge urine spots constantly.

Unfortunately, it doesn't seem to do a whole lot about the smell."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is the best","review":"I have used cat litter, Yesterday's News for Ferrets, and this is better than either of them. I don't scoop the litter; it's easier to pick up the waste with a poop bag. Eventually (depending on how many litter boxes I have going and how big they are) the urine makes a clayish paste on the bottom and when that happens I dump the litter, wash the pan and refill it. I just use enough litter to cover the bottom, so an 8-lb bag lasts a couple of months (for two ferrets). The ferrets aren't tempted to fling the litter all over the place, it doesn't stick to their paws or fur,and it's very easy to sweep or vacuum up. Ferrets that are used to cat litter take a little time to get used to this, but it is worth it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hamster loves it!!","review":"My hamster is so good.

This CD sounds like it was recorded off of an old radio broadcast - and I don't mean at the station! The sound is awful and the quality makes me wonder if this might not be a bootlegged copy of the songs. It sure isn't a studio quality recording. I cannot believe anyone connected with any of the recording artists would have approved this release. A junior high student with a cheap cassette recorder and an equally cheap radio could make a recording this good.Even if you are a fan of the 40's-type music, DON'T BUY this one!

I also live in a place with a lot of Spanish around me. Therefore I didn't need to crawl through the basics. For my modest skills, this series of lessons moved at a suitable pace. After 10 or 12 lessons -- about an hour's worth -- I could string a few original sentences together in a pinch and I was starting to think in Spanish a little. I'm not doing it in a car so it is very noticable that the lessons build on a highway driving theme but you gotta start somewhere and highways are as good as any place. The pronunciations are academic, not like Spanish speakers really talk but isn't that always the way?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor","review":"If you already know some Spanish, this will unfortunately be a waste of your money. I study Spanish a lot, but don't speak it, so I like to keep on trucking along getting a little Spanish in my ears each day. I purchased this because many reviews said this wasn't for beginners, but let me tell you, I am bored to tears listening to them explain that there are masculine and feminine words, that the word \\"the\\" is \\"el and la\\", and how to say the time. Even if you are a beginner, this would not be comprehensive enough on it's own, and you'd need classes or Rosetta Stone. Disappointingly, I am still on the search for more well-made audio programs. I would recommend Learn In Your Car Spanish, not too much beginner material there and it acts as a good refresher."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not bad for Intermediates trying to remember and brush up on their Spanish from an absence.","review":"I found this is a good starter to restart your spanish practicing. It's not for beginners. They touch the very basics very quickly and well if you don't know how to play with the inflections and all the good differences between the languages, I could see someone getting lost easily. It's not a bad product. Only thing is the pauses to repeat or to think about what you have to say is too short and usually you're saying it as they repeat the answer you just said. Other than that, I am very happy with the purchase and I like how it's easy to use in the car. Beginners in the language beware!"},{"rating":"2","title":"slow and easy good beginners lessons","review":"perhaps not advanced enough for someone who has some spanish but for the raw beginner this is a good one - drive listen and learn!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Starts good, couldn't keep up","review":"I am starting spanish from ground zero. I knew how to count to ten, but that was all.I was very pleased as I worked my way through the 1st CD -- I really felt like I was learning. Feeling pretty stoked, I went on to the 2nd disc. Whoa! I was totally lost. The 1st disk is called the \\"on-ramp\\" before the lessons on discs 2 - 4.It really seemed to me that discs 2 - 4 might have been the concept for the package and somebody said, \\"this is too hard, let's add an introductory disk\\". The english-speaking narrator and the spanish speakers are different from from disk 1 to disk 2 as well, lending support to my theory. The main problem (after disk 1) is that they just start speaking spanish with very little repeating and I haven't a clue what they are saying.I haven't even listened to disks 3 & 4. I'm going to try another program."},{"rating":"1","title":"Drive Time Spanish (CD): Learn Spanish While You Drive","review":"Not very good sound quality and very difficult to understand. The gentleman who narrated did not enunciate well. The format of the questions and conversation did not flow easily like other language CDs I have purchased."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better for non beginners","review":"I bought this before I had read reviews on it because it was the cheapest cd's you could get.............more bang for the buck. After I read the reviews, I thought woe is me. Sounds like a waste of money to me! Much to my surprise, I really am using it. It's in my car of course, and I run the cd's over and over again. They seem a bit past me, but they are extremely helpful and well worth the little money that it is. My only complaint is that they don't give you much time to repeat occasionally. Plus sometimes they don't translate some of the conversations, expect you to know it I suppose. Still despite these complaints which may loom large to some, I find myself really getting a lot out of these cd's and recommend them to anyone from advanced beginners, intermediate to advanced. And the price is right!UPDATE I have since learned that it is necessary to use more than one program so now I have several programs and I use them all while driving around and going places."},{"rating":"1","title":"Impossible to follow","review":"CD 1 starts off great! The speaker reviews words over and over, and they're used in sentences repeatedly. It moves nice and slow, which is valuable when you're trying to drive (Drive Time...)By CD2 they quit the repetition, and they speak the words so quickly, there's absolutely no hope of keeping up.I gave up"},{"rating":"2","title":"spanish cd's","review":"i think this is worth the money. there was a lot to learn for this reasonable price. the first cd is very good, excellent for beginners. the next 3 are much more difficult. i understood all of the material, and it was a great review of what i already knew. however, i still do not feel like it helped practice speaking in conversations, and this is what i was hoping to learn from this product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved this blanket","review":"This blanket is great.

Completely linear. No chapters, no menus, no special features, but a decent transfer of FULL FRAME Version. Hit the menu button or chapter advance and you start the whole movie over.

Too bad because this is a fun film."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the better books out there on the U.S. occupation of Iraq","review":"Though not a gigantic read, this brief book clearly details what is being done with our tax dollars to the impoverished people of Iraq. Along with some really strong photo documentation, this book includes an excellent collection of essays by some very important writers on the left like Amy Goodman, Howard Zinn, Christian Parenti, and Mike Davis. My favorite essay however was the one written by Naomi Klein, author of \\"No Logo\\", another crucial book. In this essay, Klein talks about the need to bridge the anti-war movement with the global justice movement. This is a discussion very much needed in the peace movement, because until we build a fair and truly democratic economy, we cannot possibly end the tragedy of war. Not only is this a good (though depressing) read, it's an excellent tool for public education. Buy it and then share it with friends! Why not donate a copy to a school or a public library?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Blather","review":"I was actually looking forward to reading this, but invariably it degenerated into the knee-jerk anti-war rhetoric which while emotionally satisfying, is less than useful from a rational assessment of the war's consequences.More specifically the musings of such international relations luminaries such as Viggo Mortensen and Ambassador Joe Wilson give this book a decidedly ideological rather than critical/academic analysis. If that's what you want, then you'll love the book.If however you want something a bit more intellectually satisfying, try \\"Cobra II\\" or \\"Fiasco.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"This recording falls flat","review":"After seeing the production of Cabaret at Studio 54, I eagerly purchased the revival recording. I was disappointed when I listened to it, however. The voices I heard live were much stronger and more expressive than those on the recording. I was particularly disappointed by Natasha Richardson's tracks - after seeing Joely Fisher give a moving performance with great expression (not to mention vocal ability), Richardson's Sally doesn't measure up."},{"rating":"2","title":"If you want the best Cabaret, this ain't it!","review":"Unfortunately, I read some of the previous customer reviews giving this a 5 star rating and bought this CD. It's not bad but it can't compare to the movie soundtrack with Liza Minnelli and Joel Grey which rates a \\"10\\". This might be 8 1/2. The lyrics to one song was changed in a key area to make it politically correct and resulted in a completely watered down song."},{"rating":"1","title":"I didn't see the show","review":"But I am a big fan of the music. While I get the fact that Sally Bowles is supposed to be second-rate and I'm all for doing Cabaret as realistically as possible, I still find it extremely difficult to listen to Natasha's Richardson's singing. I just can't figure out why one would voluntarily subject oneself to something so terrible and painful to listen to. The patrons of the \\"real\\" Kit Kat Club were obviously really drunk and depressed while listening to Sally Bowles, but I'm not prepared to get wasted every time I want to listen to the music of Cabaret. I don't doubt that Natasha Richardson was great in the role, but maybe it was necessary to see her in the the show to derive pleasure from her songs here.Everyone else is fine."},{"rating":"2","title":"Leave your troubles outside!","review":"\\"Cabaret\\" has done it again! The new Broadway cast recording of John Kander and Fred Ebb's extraordinary score is fresh, clever, and exciting! Natasha Richardson is sensational as Sally Bowles; Alan Cumming's performance as the emcee is utterly mesmerizing and provocative; and Ron Rifkin and Mary Louise Wilson are incredible together! You are actually transported to that seedy cit cat club of 1930s Berlin, thanks to the amazing score, bold orchestrations, and intense performances by this cast! This is the type of CD you'll want to listen to over and over and over again, yet never get tired of it! So get the new Broadway cast recording of \\"Cabaret\\"! It's \\"perfectly marvelous\\"!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Good, but no comparison to the original cast","review":"Although this reveals alot more of the grit within the story, I found it to be a little harsh, and not very romantic. Although Sally Bowles was no great singer, Natasha Richardson is close to awful. Mary Louise Wilson, however, is just wonderful."},{"rating":"2","title":"Easily the best cast recording of the past two years!","review":"I've seen the Broadway production of this absolutely amazing show several times and this CD does an excellent job of capturing the sirit of Kander and Ebb's most impressive piece to date. It is, however, certainly not a substitue for the show itself, which by the way, if you live anywhere near the Boston area, I highly reccomend seeing the current tour over the New York version. The talent is simply so much better...or at least it will be in a few weeks when Alan Cumming leaves. Norbert Leo Butz (from Rent) is incredible as the Emcee, as is Barbara Andreas as Fraulein Schneider. Teri Hatcher was an amazing surprise as Sally Bowles. She's not quite as good an actress as Natasha Richardson, but a MUCH better singer and overall better performer, in my opinion. I heard her sing \\"Cabaret\\" for the second time last night and can honestly say that she sounded almost exactly like Liza Minnelli. See the show and buy this CD!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Classic! Go see it for yourself!!","review":"\\"Cabaret\\" is one of my all time fav musicals. The music is fun, sad, catchy, meaningful and the choreography and vocals are also amazing! I'm so glad they decided to tape this recording DURING the show. You can hear the audience getting excited and having fun at the show. It makes it a lot more fun if you havent had the privlege of seeing this anazing show on stage. I saw the tour with Leah Thompson (\\"Caroline In The City\\") and she was phenominal, as is Natasha Richardson in this recording. I'm glad they added \\"Maybe This Time\\" which wasn't on the original score. If you love the movie Cabaret check out the Broadway revival version. I really hope they make another recording soon! All of my \\"Cabaret\\" Cd's (original, movie, this one) are being played out!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Come get the Cabaret (CD) ol' Chum","review":"I think that this CD could not be better.

Go get it and enjoy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"best ever","review":"This musical is the best thing I have ever heard. Allan Cumming was born to play the part of Emcee. Cosidering the fact the fact that Natasha Richardson has never sang before in her life she is brilliant. I suggest that if you want to hear talent, funny lyrics,and just great music buy this musical right now.

That aside, every single performer and musician on this CD strives to create an environment that, if you close your eyes, you can almost imagine you are in the Kit Kat Klub watching the show. There is not one track that I would skip; each should be listened to over and over again, allowing yourself to savor the genius that is Cabaret. Buy this CD. Buy it now. Treasure it always. And never let it stop playing!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Come hear the music play!!!!","review":"This recording is soooooo fabulous. Alan Cumming and Natasha Richardson make the movie version seem boring. I don't think I am the only one who feels that Alan Cumming brings a hot hot hot sexuality to the role that Joel Grey could barely muster. Whereas Joel was more concerned with acting devilish, Alan Cumming literally scares and utterly delights you at the same time with his rendition. The tony award was richly deserved. Yes even the emcee is beautiful!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely wonderful-Duke has real talent","review":"Duke is a true artist.

I wish there were more Defender's songs and Sreaming for Vengeance title track.

Its one game the entire family can play since it does not require reading which is usually the frustrating part of board games for my youngest neice who is 5. She loves this game since she feels like she is on a level playing field with her brother and sister. One suggestion if you choose to play with candy instead of the chips - make sure you have extra candy on hand not just for multiple games but it keeps the players from eating the playing pieces!"},{"rating":"2","title":"LCR is a great game for everyone.","review":"This is a fun game.

I mean don't get me wrong, the graphics, the voice-over and the weapons were awesome. But, the ending? Come on now, I saved up big time to get this and had pre-ordered months in advance to receive the \\"Game of the Year\\" please! The original, Halo, beats this one in to. Also, I didn't like playing between the Convenant and as Master Chief. Pick one side and stick with it. They should make it like this: First play as Master Chief then after beating the game as a human give the option to play as the convenant or maybe...The Flood.

I had it beat on hard after playing it for a weekend. The ending is terrible and there is no real gameplay innovation that seperates it from Halo. Essentally it is Halo with new guns and vechicles. Also, a new playable covenant character is thrown in there but I hate the covenant. They are trying to whipe out the human race after all. My advice is rent before you buy, I'm glad I did."},{"rating":"2","title":"Halo 2...a gaming benchmark","review":"Halo 2 is the sequel to the blockbuster Xbox game, Halo: Combat Evolved. Halo 2 is the much anticipated sequel, and is arguably one of the best ever First-Person Shooters. Firstly, the graphics are much improved over the original game. There's also a great deal of realism added, such as lighting effects and even the sound becomes muffled when you're in a vacuum (space). The game's music is very good, suits the situations and the theme song is back. The gameplay is more than your average FPS. Compared to Halo:CE, Halo 2 is much faster. New vehicles,weapons and characters make an appearance, and one of Halo 2's strongest features is its superb storyline. Overall, this game has a great package, including fantastic, virtually never-ending multiplayer, and will leave you drooling, wanting for more."},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT EVEN WHEN HALO 3 IS A FEW DAYS AWAY","review":"i had a ps2 and was thinking of getting the ps3. instead i got a 360 and im happy. i got halo 2 i beat single player and then got live. this game is great i love this game. the one part i hate about this game is there is no assault rifle. i recently got halo 1 and even though i was really late in getting it still amazed me. halo 2 does have more weapons which is cool. halo 1 didnt have a br which pissed me off but the pistol is beast. also in halo 3 my two weapons in single player are br and assault rifle possibly two of the best guns(besides the chainsaw gun in gears but nothing beats the chainsaw gun) if you have a xbox or xbox 360 and dont have halo your missing out."},{"rating":"2","title":"Halo - Sequel?

It shows you how great this game is, the AI, etc.Don't listen to the m$ haters, try it out. Don't play it on easy unless this is your first fps. This game has great atmosphere, and is a great experience. the story, cut-scenes pulling it all together.The music !

AND THE COVENANT WAS ATTACKING EARTH RIGHT? THAT IS SO MUCH FUN TO DEFEND THE EARTH AND URBAN WARFARE AND ALL THAT BUT YOU HAD LIKE 2 OR 3 LEVELS ON EARTH THAT WAS TRUELY ANNOYING. IT WAS GREAT GAMEPLAY VERY INTENSE, TRUELY IS JUST MISSING THAT LITTLE SOMETHING THAT WAS IN HALO 1. THE ONLY OTHER THING THAT ANNOYED ME WAS I GOT A MAGAZINE A FEW MONTHS AGO WITH A NON PLAYABLE DEMO. IN THAT DEMO IT HAD SOME REALLY COOL LOOKING STUFF THAT WAS NOT IN HALO 2. LIKE THE BRUTES BEING ON EARTH AND DIFFERENT VEHICLES, AND MISSIONS I NEVER SAW AND MOVIES.

Surely the company that brought us Halo (the best FPS and best multi-player game ever) couldn't do any less than to make Halo 2 BLOW AWAY the original. Well, it's a great game. But the only thing that truly BLOWS AWAY the original is all the features added to online multiplayer gaming -- teams, stats, customization, etc. Sitting in a room with 8 guys blasting each other was always fun on Halo. It's about the same level of enjoyment with Halo 2 but with new maps and weapons. Don't get me wrong: I'm having great fun with Halo 2! But it isn't the massive leap forward that we were hoping for."},{"rating":"2","title":"Halo2 in general","review":"HaloII is a very fun game. I have a few disapoints with it. No infinite granades in multi-player, no life bar, just sheild, and the game is similar to the first halo. Comparing this to the first is a hard thing to do but the first is better because of originality and it didn't copy many of similar FPS like red faction. My favorite thing about this game is the multi-player and highjacking vehicles.P.S. Killzone is VERY dissapointing, seeing is how it was supposed to beat halo 1 and be realistic( you can grab people through walls and kill them)"},{"rating":"2","title":"excellent, but not perfect!!!","review":"I got this game on the first day.

Let's move on ahead to the \\"not so good\\" part. There are a lot of glitches in the FMV sequence of the game. Some objects popping in & out. And , \\"why would i wanna play as an arbiter?\\".

You can go to \\"Set\\" mode and turn on subtitle on just like DVD movie. That part impressive me mostly and make me enjoyed Halo 2 more than Halo (I play Halo once and cannot find to turn subtitle on but Halo 2 has).Thank for reading"},{"rating":"1","title":"Endless","review":"After drowning in hype, I finally gave in and played Halo 2. If you are a Halo fanatic then you will of course like this game. However, if you are like me and were sceptical that it can be as good as all the hype, you will probably find the game repetitive and a bit frustrating. I did enjoy some of the game's new features such as your personal energy shield that helped you stay alive longer, and the frequent save points that kept me from having to re-play levels for endless hours was also great. Unfortunately, the various levels were often repetitive, the story line is not well defined and the ending is one of the worst I have ever seen (but I guess we can all look forward to Halo 3). If you are looking for a single player first person adventure game I would not recommend Halo 2. If you love the look and feel of Halo and want to go online to destroy your friends and enemies, then Halo 2 is the game for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best FPS ever but way too short","review":"Halo & Half Life are the 2 best FPS's period. The Original Halo set all new standards. This one is even better with greatly improved graphics, excellent sound, perfect controls and it is very well polished.The plot is great except for the ending which pretty much leaves everything hanging, like they ran out of space before they finished the story.Also in standard mode I completed it in under 12 hours. I'm 59 years old, I'm not that fast. You younger players are really going to be dissappointed with the length of single play campaign.The original Halo in standard mode took me a lot longer the first time and Hero mode on 2nd play through still took over 20 hours. It would easily have gotten 5 stars and best ever rating if it was about twice as long and had a little better sense of completion at the ending.I Havent done multiplayer yet, but have heard its great and still wouldnt upgrade 4 star rating due to pitiful shortness of single player."},{"rating":"2","title":"awsome","review":"this was the best game i ever played.

Go back into a few video game magazine archives and look at what these guys promised us, but didn't even come close to delivering on.The game is so terribly flawed and mundane, that it makes the first one look even better than ever.And to make matters worse, they went all Hideo Kojima (Metal Gear) on us, and made us play as one of the Covenant. This is the second dumbest idea in video game history---next to of course, Kojima making us play as \\"Not Solid Snake\\".The multiplayer is cool for about ten hours, but after awhile you'll be longing for the comfort-zone provided by the original \\"Halo\\", and if you're like me, you may weep at the thought of what this game could and should have been.A painfully average game at-best...but definately not \\"Halo\\".2.5 Overall. 3 for fun ONLY because of the multiplayer modes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not even game of the year","review":"For all the hype this game has attained, it really doesn't stand up.

Each material you shoot with your gun makes a different sound. I have gone through the campaign about three times - it never gets boring. In the campaign you are Master Chief and an Elite who is trying to find the true purpose of Halo. You wield many new weapons and have the option of dual wielding. The energy sword pwns.

After aquiring this game earlier today, I have been playing non-stop. This game puts Halo (1) to shame - it's that good. Its amazing how Bungie went from a game like Marathon to this game.In my opinion, it is flawless - with extensive single player campaigns, not repetitive like the first one. The detail level has increased at least 5 fold, with a lot more FMVs to explain whats going on. Multiplayer is also awesome, although I didn't get a chance to play on Live.I am a fan of first person shooters, and this, by far, is the best game made to date.

As another review mentioned, much of the levels are \\"corridor-style\\", involving fighting in tight quarters which gets old fast. I kept playing expecting something better, but the only thing that came was the credits and the end of the game. Though I haven't played on it, I think this may be an attempt to push Live, because the story mode seems premature."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not What I Expected","review":"this game was good and all, but the plot was horrible and the last levels are all almost the same thing over and over"},{"rating":"1","title":"a repeat of the last","review":"Halo 2 isn't bad if you haven't already beaten Halo 1.

I dont care what kind of games you like you must get it. One of my friends hated it until we played the multiplayer. The multiplayer is my favorite part of the game. If you have four players ou can play team and that is really awesome. Or if you and your friend has an xbox you can by a link cable and hook them up and you can have eight players. To do this you will need a link cable, two xboxs, two halo 2 disks, and two tvs. This game is my favorite game."},{"rating":"2","title":"Take it slowly","review":"This is a hard game even at times on easy. Instead of Easy, Normal and Diificult. It should be Normal, Difficult and Damn. I love this game a lot but getting dumped in a room by the flower from Little Shop of Horrors with basicly a pop gun is a bit of a jolt. I still do something I should never do as a shooter fan and take death personally. I always feel like I let Master Chief down when I get him killed and tend to get a loud about it which bugs the bejeezes out of the wife. I kinda got my own personal Cortona. I have always played it on the Xbox but being a multi platformer I'm debating whether or not to purchase the PC version. You folks have any ideas on that one. The aiming accuracy of the mouse would be nice at times."},{"rating":"2","title":"Halo 2 review","review":"This game is so much fun. The many different game modes/maps, make this game a must buy for both xbox and xbox 360 owners. Even when just playing with 3 friends, this game is still incredibly fun. The single player story mode is also long and satisfying, and really fills you in on many aspects of the halo plot. The graphics are very nice looking, and the sound is great too. I would definitely either buy the map pack, or if you have xbox live, download the map pack/patch. The patch is especially important as it fixes many glitches like the rocket/sword lunge, and many others."},{"rating":"2","title":"all hail halo 2!","review":"Halo 2 has got to be the best video game ever hands down.

Whomever mentioned the star wars syndrome of dozens of useless weapons was right on target. Duel weilding is amusing, but it's nothing uniquie. The graphics are substandard, and this defintally shows that the hardware of the xbox is offically outdated and too limited for a game of this type. Maps all feel rushed, weapon placement is very very poor, and i'm just very happy I dind't buy a copy for myself personally.It's just like Halo.

The developers took a different approach in the presentation.

Not a bad thing..just different. I do think the game was short..it wouldn't have bothered me so badly if it had a more proper ending. I won't give anything away, but I think I vocally said \\"That's It?\\" after the last level...which in no way felt like a final level.

It's SP, compared with its predecessor, is complete garbage. You get about two levels in, and you start to wonder why you are still holding the controller. If you want to keep up with the story, then play the SP game, and pay close attention, as it is rather complex. If you don't plan to get H3 and finish out the story line, then you probably won't have the patience to finish the game.As for the MP, it is better than the first one. Which is not to say it is good, as the balance factor is terrible (battle rifle, plasma pistol, rocket launcher, and sniper rifle - thats it, the only worthwhile guns in the game, roughly in order of importance). The only more unbalanced online shooter I have played in recent memory was . . . well . . . Halo 1.Overall, it is only valuable as a segue between Halos 1&3. Otherwise, avoid it, its not worth the time."},{"rating":"2","title":"If anyone gives this 1 star, theyre on crack!!","review":"This game is basically Halo v2.0 its just an upgrade from the last.The only thing that kinda sucks about this is if you enjoyed the pistol in Halo 1, you may be dissapointed because its not as powerfull and you cant zoom in and shoot.

The same with the gauss warthog . the ghost is an alien vehicle that has two plasma beams as the main weapons. same with the banshee except that it can fly. the spectre has a turret on the back and people caride on the side.the wepons again are great. the best ones are the energy sword, shotgun rocket launcher, needler,and the plasma grenades(they STICK on to people,THEN they explode)kinda funny when you watch it happen to someone else, but not you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Halo 2","review":"Liked the game, however...had to return because of shadowy images in several areas which covered up part of the picture.

Ive never gone in depth with the story line so I basically just ran through levels and beat them skipping the cut scenes. I went back later though and watched them all and pieced the story together. Its a good story, a very good plot for the game. The multiplayer is better than the 1st, especially with 16 people. Only snipers ruin the fun. And the tanks seem a bit unfair, once I or anyone else got in one, your unstoppable and can get massive kills. I thought the graphics were just average, escept the cutscenes.

Bottom line, this game kick butt. If you enjoyed Halo, you will love Halo 2. The basic concept is the same, kill or be killed. The Plot takes twists and turns and keeps you playing until the end. Multi-player is great and the levels are a bit more inovative than the last Halo addition. There seems to be alot more cover in the new multiplayer enviroments than the previous edition. The new weapons are outstanding and vehicles are some new twists on some old favorites. You can read into some of what the haters out there are saying, but let me tell you as an old Halo vet, this game was worth the long.......LONG wait and will probably keep players like me occupied for a long time to come.

Halo is an \\"UNREAL rip off\\" it stole every concept it has from unreal tournament. SO put that in you pipes and smoke it.I gave it an extra star for the graphics....if you MUST have this type of game, Id wait for doom III.

Games like Kill Zone, Red faction, and even the James Bond videogames are more fun than Halo. In games like 007 Nightfire, people could do crazy things like drive mini helicopters in multiplayer mode and shoot bazooka's and control where the missile ends up. Halo 2 doesn't have anything extroadinary. For real good 1st person shooters, buy a PS2, a multitap, and some extra controllers. Then go to your local Target and purchase either Medal of Honor, SWAT, Red Faction 1 or 2, any Bond game, or Killzone. Then enjoy real fun 1st person shooter action in split screen mode with your friends because playing all these game like Halo online will ruin your social life and thats no good. Playing games all the time instead of goin out over peoples houses is bad enough so at least have some people over to play with you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Has got to be the most overrated game of all time","review":"Halo 2 has got to be the most overrated game of all time.

Just a few good things about the game take the world by storm, and it's annoying.The multiplayer component, the graphics, the vehicles, and that's all. The game requires barely any skill either, you can beat Legendary mode real easy, unless you're that bad at the game.

If the book is used as a reference book for people already understanding the principles of solvent extraction and they only want to have some detailed question answered, this book is very good.

Of course, contracts is not the lightest course to assimilate, but I frequently wondered why so many cases and few explanations, instead of the opposite? I'm sure it's possible to learn contract law from this, but if it weren't for the Law School Legends Contracts on tape I probably would not have remembered the dozens and dozens of cases about the same principle.

As a first-year student deciphering dense material, the last thing you need is to second guess the accuracy of the information you receive from your textbooks.

The script was excremental, the plot merely a vehicle for a collection of assorted action scenes, the acting laughable - it's as if the whole thing were written for young children who shouldn't see it in the first place because of all the intense violence. Vast portions of this story make little or no sense.To me, the thing it most resembles is that \\"Jackie Chan Adventures\\" cartoon show, complete with magical medallion. We might have been better off if they made a movie based on that - at least THOSE characters are interesting, and make sense.Honestly, this movie was so bad, it's Mystery Science Theatre 3000 fodder.

I know, one would wonder if a little boy is all-powerful how could he get caught up in a mess in the first place). As far as special effects go - my favorite scene was near the end where the bad guy gets smacked. The movie has an alternative ending, though it looked more as an attempt to make an alternative ending because it didn't make much sense, or rather it didn't logically connect to the previous segment of the movie.Nevertheless, I did enjoy the theme of this movie as well as the effects of \\"supernatural\\" powers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Forgettable","review":"Jackie Chan has really cranked out a lot of movies and I have found some of them quite entertaining with action packed fight scenes, good stories, great stunts, and Chan's self deprecating sense of humor.

The medallion gives people special powers. Snakehead kidnaps the kid and Chan is in the hunt to save the kid and keep the medallion out of Snakehead's hands.Unfortunately, the plot is awful and makes little sense. The fight scenes are not very good. The movie essentially breaks down into a not very interesting series of vignettes that I could never decide whether they were supposed to be funny, scary, thrilling - they were just plan dumb.Chan would be better served to make fewer, higher quality movies than to churn out forgettable fare like The Medallion."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not one of Jackie's Best","review":"Jackie Chans latest offering in a kind of Indiana Jones in a Tuxedo sort of movie.

A \\"B\\" movie at best, I still can't stop myself from watching it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice for Office","review":"Use it every day keeps liquids warm all day and that is the point of having this type of Warmer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Toastmaster Mug warmer","review":"I love having my coffee or tea always perfectly hot to drink. I bought three, one on my desk, one by my chair in front of the TV, one to give as a gift. I have one mug that is too big around, so it doesn't fit on the warmer, so I can't use that. Would be better if the place for the mug was a little larger so more types of mugs could fit."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible","review":"This product came to me right out of the box used and dirty. It looked as if someone had drunk coffee out of the cup. I contacted Amazon and got no help or remedy.[[ASIN:B000EGYRXQ Toastmaster Personal Coffee Mug and Warmer (TMMGW)]"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disapointed","review":"After much research I thought this product would live up to its claims....wrong!I wanted a coffee mug warmer to keep the mug warm, this just doesn't cut it.Barely warm is a better description. I sent it back. Still using my old one that I thought was not working properly. It is better than this one was."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT WORTH $ I PAID","review":"This product does not work well. I was hoping I could work at my desk and have HOT coffee 30 minutes after I got it. I now have luke warm cofee NOT HOT so it didn't help me at all. If I would have bought it at Walmart or Target I would have returned it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Simply Doesn't Work","review":"I like my coffee HOT. From the first sip to the last. I bought this cuz I get up to microwave my coffee 2 to 3 times per cup and that was getting annoying. Simply put this doesn't keep coffee hot and barely keeps it warm. Unless you just want to keep your lukewarm cup lukewarm then I can't recommend this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Like every other cofffee \\"warmer\\" keeps coffee luke warm.","review":"I did my research on coffee warmers and this one according to the reviews was supposed to keep coffee hot!

She alway's has to have hot coffee and the is the frist one that's done it's job without having to make a trip to the microwave"},{"rating":"1","title":"Seller makes empty promises","review":"I ordered this product, to be delivered to my friend's P. O. Box, in August 2011. It did not arrive, so I checked order tracking and learned that the shipper claimed to have left it AT THE FRONT DOOR(!). Front door of what, the post office? I posted a comment stating the above.I contacted the seller. They were quite apologetic, and said if I would remove the negative comment they would reship the product. I removed the negative comment. That was 8 months ago. Guess what? No replacement product.This seller is unfamiliar with the success formula: underpromise and overdeliver. They don't even deliver what they promise, and then they seduce you into removing negative comments with more promises, also empty.Before you buy from them, ask them to explain this transaction."},{"rating":"1","title":"Salton Desktop Cafe Mugwarmer","review":"The mug was nice, but I am disappointed in the mugwarmer. It does notkeep my coffee hot. If my cup of coffee sits on the warmer 30 minutesbefore I drink it, the coffee is lukewarm when I get around to drinking it. I have to take it to a microwave and reheat the contents before Ican drink the coffee."},{"rating":"1","title":"It works but!","review":"I bought the warmer 3 months ago, I use it a lot. Over the first two month the plastic rim has cracked twice on the top, now a third crack is developing. This warmer only barely does it's job, \\"I like my tea a little hotter\\" Now, it's becoming unsightly and it might let spilled liquid leak into the electronics. I don't think it will last a year before it needs to be replaced."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it.","review":"A friend had gifted me this model before,so I knew it was good, but I had nothing to compare it to. I did my dutiful research on line of all the possible options, and in the end just ordered the same one again. I am not disappointed. Keeps my beverage piping hot, just the way I like it."},{"rating":"2","title":"AN EXCELLENT PRODUCT!","review":"I have one of these myself, so was already familiar with this great mug warmer.I bought two and gave them to my brother and his wife for Christmas.

This one actually does! It keeps my coffee warm for literally hours (since I'm one to get busy at work and forget my morning coffee sitting on the desk, it will still be hot at lunch time). I would never purchase any other brand, and would tell others the same who ask me. This product is the only one to try.
