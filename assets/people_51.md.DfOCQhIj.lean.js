First off is the cover art, of cake toppers and doll figures as personality icons. Inside are stories by authors made famous mainly by their novels, condensing their thoughts into short narrative prose.Helen Fielding of Bridget Jones' Diary fame is short and sweet in the story Luckybitch. Actor Colin Firth proves a worthy writer in The Depth of Nothing. My personal favorites are Last Requests by Giles Smith, and The Wonder Spot by Melissa Bank, which manage to encompass the most depth in the least amount of space.I recommended this book for those who are both fans of the writers featured, or not familiar with their work, since this is a fabulous introduction."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mancini Greatest Hits","review":"Purchased this album used through Amazon.

I paid around $20 including shipping, but saw the same set in my neighborhood Wal-Mart for $9. If your daughter loves princess anything as much as mine, it might be worth overpaying. If you are looking for a durable tea set that is constructed of quality materials, I would look at the Fisher Price Musical Tea Set which is also one of Amazon's Editor's Choice. At the time of review the Fisher Price Musical Tea Set was only $4 more than the Disney Princess Tea Set.

It's a sturdy design with rubber feet and a nice carrying handle. The inside has a soft felt-like material so it's decent padding for your valuables. It's a very good fit for CDs. I can keep about 25 in a box (with cases). The box itself is pretty light so unless you put something really heavy in it it can easily go on a shelf.

(1) Every person in the book falls into one of two camps: either they are on the side of Kearns and his crew, or against them. The former are described positively, lovingly, romantically; the latter are ridiculed and made fun of, with no attempt to be objective or balanced. (2) The book is extremely sexist. Few of the women in the book are described without reference to their sexual attractiveness (or UNattractiveness). To sum up: THIS IS NOT A HISTORY BOOK, and it's NOT JOURNALISM. It's a memoir, and should be read as such: one man's HIGHLY SUBJECTIVE account of an ultimately sad chapter in American history."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"EROTIC, IMPULSIVE AND INSPIRED...\\"","review":"Kearns writes his account of the rise and fall of Tabloid TV with passion and guts.

But I think that's because Zakk wasn't allowed to write any of the material, and just played on it.Since Zakk co-wrote the material on \\"Black Rain\\" the edge is back in Ozzy's stuff! The beefy riffs, the grit, and even the ballads work well much like \\"Ozzmosis\\". However, my favorite is \\"Countdown's Begun\\" This track is off the scale!!Of course let's not forget Michael Bordin's chops, and Blasko's great bottom-end! Nicely done! Welcome back, Ozzy!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Hey Ozzy, beg for Bob Daisley's forgiveness!!!","review":"I knew this album would stink after I heard the first single, \\"I Don't Want to Stop.\\" The chorus is so generic and the song is completely forgettable. I have no idea how anyone could give this 5 stars. Diary - 5 stars. Blizzard - 5 stars. Tribute - 5 stars. Ozzy needs to get Bob Daisley on the phone, beg on his hands & knees for his forgiveness, then plead with him to write music AND lyrics for his next album. Take any song off the first two Ozzy records and compare them to any song off of this garbage; there is no comparison. Diary & Blizzard had brilliant song writing (courtesy of Randy Rhoads, Bob, Lee Keerslake & Ozzy) phenomenal playing, and chemistry. Nothing Ozzy has done since has measured up to those classics."},{"rating":"2","title":"I love it!","review":"After being disappointed with Ozzmosis and Perry Mason I was reluctant to purchase Black Rain, so when I found it on Amazon used for a few bucks I figure what do I have to lose?Well, I'm happy to write that Black Rain is REALLY good. The drumming is TIGHT, Ozzy's voice is the best it's been in years, and Zakk...well, we already know how good he is.I would say Countdown's Begun is my favorite...I love the guitar tone in the beginning.The songs also seem to have better writing that some of his past albums.

This is the best ozzy album since No More Tears. It sounds very overproduced, and heavy. The Almighty Dollar is a funky kinda sounding song that unleashes Mr. Wild's heavy riffs throughout. I Don't Wanna Stop is probably the most catchy song on the album and it's quit an athem. Also, Not Going Away kicks ***. It is also quit catchy. There are only really two ballads on the album, Lay Your World on me, but its a pretty good ballad, and Here For You, which is good as well. The rest of the 8 songs are rock'n and catchy. Some of the riffs kind of even remind me a little of Jake E Lee days. So some of it has the intensity of the Ultimate Sin, but with the production of No More Tears. This cd rocks! It's good to know the ozzman is back!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Total Bust","review":"I have enjoyed most of Ozzy's solo work - until now. This album displayed a complete lack of innovation or imagination. The only thing that saves it is Zakk's guitar playing. The lyrics appear to have been written by a teenage girl who's recently discovered that the world isn't always fair. Ozzy would be better served just letting Zakk write the next album for him."},{"rating":"1","title":"save your money","review":"not worth the 14.99 you have two songs worth listening tothe cd package is a pissed off some cheap thin cardboard sleeveand the music industry wonders why we download music illegal."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst packaging EVER!","review":"Instead of discussing the music to death, because it's something you should decide for yourself on whether it's good or bad, I'm here to discuss packaging of the disc.In today's age of trying to lure and entice the customer into purchasing an actual physical product over downloading it, one would think the record label/management team would at least house the disc in a respectable albeit standard jewel case or digipak. There's no booklet, no liner notes anywhere, no effort. It's barely a slipcase, which is just enraging, I almost feel like I have a promo.Ok, I'll include a short note about the music...it's the usual fare, nothing outstanding, and honestly, the thumb harmonic/vibrato Zakk Wylde pulls off every 3 seconds is incessantly annoying at this point in 2007...jeez, doesn't this guy progress?Thanks for reading."},{"rating":"1","title":"uninspired effort","review":"I don't blame ozzy as much as i do zakk wylde. the songs sound like leftover b-side BLS songs, throwaway tracks with patheticly boring guitar riffs and zakk's weakest solo efforts of his career. not only are the riffs as stock and generic as the lyrics / vocals, but the songwriting is so weak that even a diehard ozzy fan will skip each track in hope that the next is worth it. ozzy's voice sounds so computerized and proves that if your not going to write a decent cd, than why taint your legacy? they complain that down to earth (2001) was weak but at least it had some good songs and ozzy sounded like himself, it was original and zakk's drunk out of shape guitar playing ruined this album, as it plaguaed his leads on the last one. he's washed up and forgot what it means to be a guitar hero. they said this album would be the one to blow away no more tears (1991), yet is by leagues ozzy's weakest album of his career, solo or with sabbath."},{"rating":"1","title":"St. Anger","review":"I was really excited when i thought ozzy was coming back strong. After the last cd I hoped he'd go back to the ozzmosis sound or possibly farther back. Ofcourse not. The only good thing about this cd is that I got two free seats to ozzfest that would have been 80-100 dollars otherwise. This is almost as big of a dissapointment as when Metallica released St. Anger minus a few good moments on the cd. The difference is that Ozzy isn't going around saying its the best thing he has ever done because he's done so many great things and knows it is no match. I just have a hard time believing it's zakk wylde on the album. It does sound like him, however I can't believe he would do this to ozzy. I just hope he keeps on trucking until he croaks."},{"rating":"2","title":"A GREAT ALBUM!!","review":"I have been an Ozzy fan since Ozzmosis, and have since then purchased all of his albums.

Definitely an album starter for a new fan."},{"rating":"1","title":"Time to hang it up?","review":"There is only 3 good songs on here and the rest is Filler, I'm hoping Ozzy reunion with Black Sabbath later this year is better then this.

It's a piece of cardboard that folded in half with a slit on one half that contains the disc. If you open the cover you'll find the album's title inside. No pictures, no lyrics, no band credits. Nothing except the title of the CD so that left me a bit disappointed.That was nothing compared to the disappointment of listening to this CD itself. The songs aren't terrible. But not one song stands out. I saw a review that mentioned the \\"No More Tears\\" CD. On that disc every song is distinguishable. \\"Mr. Tinkertrain\\" \\"Mama, I'm Coming Home\\", the title track, ect all stand on their own. All the songs on this disc sound pretty much alike, and the sound like songs Ozzy had recorded in this past.For years fans have been promised a new Black Sabbath CD with Ozzy on vocals. It sounds as if he tried to make a Sabbath CD with Zack Wylde and another bassist and drummer. Too bad this CD misses the mark."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stick to your TV show OZ","review":"Typical Ozzy CD, first 2 songs are good, the rest go straight downhill from that.

Now don't attack me folk, Zakk is the best thing since Dime (Someone PLEASE, dispute me). I hate to say this, but, I think SOME groups need to revisit their early beginnings when they were Inebriated and they made GREAT music. Like Ozzy and Metallica. Megadeth, Exodus, Overkill, Anthrax and a ton of other 80's thrash bands are doing it. Over the Mountain is the PERFECT title of reveiw for the majority of Ozzy music in between Randy Rhoads and Zakk. Those other cats were ok until Ozzy started wearing Sequence.

I just don't get how artists go from making completely amazing music to suddenly always making subpar records. Zakk is an amazing guitarist but everything sounds the same for me. I think he's being wasted. Now, to my last point. Please, for the love of GOD above.

On top of that, Ozzy still sounds great (to my surprise after seeing his reality show) and the lyrics are as acidic as ever. I, for one was extremely excited to hear about a new release but had low expectations. Boy was I wrong. The lyrics are surprisingly catchy, as I find myself singing them all day, especially \\"Countdown's Begun\\", \\"Not Going away\\", and \\"I don't wanna Stop\\".

There is really nothing to recommend about the album. I don't wanna stop is easily the highlight of the album, and I doubt it's going to become an Ozzy classic. The cd itself is okay while it's playing, but it's one of those albums that when it's over nothing really leaves a lasting impression. Every previous Ozzy album has at least had about a handful tunes, that are still in my head once the album is finished playing. If you didn't like Ozzmosis or Down to Earth, you might as well avoid Black Rain, cause both albums are much better than this. The packaging of the album is very poor too. For the what the album cost, I think you should get a jewel case, and a booklet. Instead you get some cheap cardboard case that will probably scratch up your cd, if you ever play after the first listen."},{"rating":"2","title":"The lost liner notes","review":"Ozzy's back with a new CD, and it's not bad. It sounds very raw compared to Down to Earth, but I'd have to compare the feel (not the sound) to Ultimate Sin. The album drags on at the end, like most of Ozzy's albums post-Diary. The big surprise is the packaging of the \\"limited edition\\"...there really isn't any. You get a cardboard sleeve with the Ozzy logo on the front and Black Rain on the back. Then you open it...and on the inside is the words \\"Black Rain\\" upside down, and a ticket code. That's it.

It just continues the generic riffing of the previous album. Zakk Wylde is so full of it when he says this album is pure and raw but yet going back to the integrity of Blizzard, Diary and Sabbath. Either though his solos are great on this album, the riffs are generic and some of these songs just sound like black label society leftovers (yeah, not the good BLS stuff)The first signle \\"I don't wanna stop\\" really rocks. I'm not going away is a black label sounding tune but easily the worst album opener ozzy osbourne ever used. The third track Black Rain is so so but nothing that'll knock your socks off.Unfortunately the rest of the album falls into the category of the first track off Black Label's Sonic Brew album and thats \\"bored to tears\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Amazon Inc.","review":"I ordered this CD and paid for overnight delivery.

A 2 fold piece of cardboard with no liner notes, not even an envelope to protect the CD from the course cardboard.

I had hoped this would be a real rocker but it is not. Just a tired Ozzie. Zakk Wylde can barely be heard.Who wants to hear ballads from a rock and roll band anyway? Rock was MADE LOUD TO BE PLAYED LOUD!! And who cares what Ozzie thinks of politics?And what idiot thought up the cardboard CD holder? It stinks.Spend your hard earned money on something else."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just too political...","review":"Ozzy's \\"No More Tears\\" has always been one of my favorite albums. After hearing \\"I Don't Wanna Stop\\" I was really looking forward to this album. As soon as I bought it, I ripped it to my Oakley Thumps and went running. The first two songs were great. Then it turned into an annoying diatribe against the war and the military. Hey Ozzy, thanks for calling our soldiers \\"slaves.\\" We really appreciate the support!If you are a koolaid drinking liberal who thinks the bad guys will all just go away if we leave them alone, you'll love this album. Ozzy's been neutered.This album is no longer on my Thumps. I replaced him with Within Temptation's \\"The Heart of Everything\\" They rock!"},{"rating":"1","title":"CD skips when played on a Sony PS2 !!!","review":"Sure wish I could listen to the CD, this CD (and only this CD) skips when played on my PS2. All other CD's, DVD's and games have absolutely no problem!! I even tore apart the PS2 and cleaned it, same problem!

I wouldn't go to ozzfest now if you paid me. Ha!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Gore- Osbourne '08","review":"I'll try to keep it brief. The recycled cardboard case is your first clue. Zakk? Underused. First 2 songs meet expectations. The rest? i just cannot get by the 4th grade content. The lyrics are embarrassing at best. it is hard to swallow a multi millionaire telling me that my country and I are greedy. (the very country that made him what he is) It is also clear that Ozzy now has a new god. ALGORE! Just pathetic. I have been a fan since 83', and can play every riff and most leads to this day. I just cannot not stomach this one! ozzy clearly has been spending too much time in Commywood. I think Sharon , who is clearly enamored with hollywood, has brainwashed him with all the typical left wing Barbara Streisand. Ozzy is done. But hey, there is still Zakk and BLS. (thank god, the real god. )"},{"rating":"1","title":"bleh","review":"More radio rock from Ozzy, woo yeah Prince of Lameness. Literally this all sounds like stuff Zakk couldn't use on his latest half hearted release. We'd all be a little better off if both of these guys just stopped putting out new stuff, and go tour with the rest of the classic rock guys. This album is hardly metal. Metal has evolved WAY past this sad attempt. sounds like more of the same old *chug chug chug chug, solo chug chug chug* style, gets boring REAL fast. an old man singing more about being old and crazy and \\"evil\\" and then the reverse of all of those things is boring, and they are starting to run his voice through studio effects so it's not even impressive anymore. Save your money and go get some Mastodon or something else contemporary."},{"rating":"2","title":"not my favorite but....","review":"Ozzy again surrounded himself with some serious talent. He's got the best guitarist, a heavy hitting drummer and another driving bass player. If i were to rate this against other Ozzy material, it wouldnt be as good, but among all else available? Ozzy defines what hard rock / metal is and therefore this cant be overlooked. much of this sounds like ozzmosis, a heavily black label society influence album. I really wish ozzy would limit his \\"ballad\\" type songs becuase they arent his stregnth. \\"Not Going Away\\" and \\"I dont wanna stop\\" are among the best here. Zakk is amazing, but that goes without saying. is this ozzy's best work? no, but its not as bad as The Ultimate Sin!they way i look at it, no reason to NOT get another album from the greatest there ever was."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hey Ozzy, beg for Bob Daisley's forgiveness!!!","review":"This album stinks on a major scale. The second I heard the single I knew this album would never measure up to Ozzy's earlier work. Hey Ozzy, get Bob Daisley on the phone, beg for his forgiveness, and plead with him to write music & lyrics for your next album. Then, after you make ammends, re-release Diary & Blizzard with Bob & Lee playing their respective parts."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good CD but buy the better version.","review":"I spent a LOT on this special edition of the CD to get 2 extra songs. Little did I know a newer version would come out with 4 extra songs. I feel duped! Please buy the version with more songs for less."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good album, very consistent.","review":"At first, I was not blown away by this. But after a few more spins, I really started to like it. It is not as heavy as some of his earlier stuff, but it is better than most of his later work. I like most of the songs. There are no big standouts, but not any really low points either. The album is pretty even and if you like any other work from Ozzy, you probably will enjoy this.My favorite track is \\"Lay Your World On Me\\" and my least favorite is \\"Trap Door\\".My favorite Ozzy album is \\"No More Tears\\" followed by \\"No Rest For The Wicked\\" which were the first 2 albums Ozzy used Zakk Wylde. I do also really like \\"Diary Of A Madman\\", but only for the few standouts it has. I did not care much for \\"Down To Earth\\" which was the last album Zakk was on.Along with this album, I am currently listening to Megadeth-United Abominations, Dream Theater-Systematic Chaos, and Kamalot-Ghost Opera."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Modern Day Ozzy.","review":"Black Rain is a good return for Ozzy after 5 years and his best since No More Tears. The album throughout is a lot similar to his 2 previous albums \\"Ozzmosis\\" and \\"Down To Earth\\", leans towards industrial metal but it's also heavier than his previous album. Lots of computerized vocals and goes heavier on the keyboards but the guitar riffs/solos from Zakk Wylde are still very consistent throughout. Lyrics aren't too bad, not the best he's ever written but decent. Sure it's not his crowning achievement and how could it be after having classic like \\"Blizard Of Ozz\\", \\"Diary Of A Madman\\" and \\"No More Tears\\" but it's a solid album throughout and worth having if you're a fan. \\"I Don't Wanna Stop\\" is already a classic, in my opinion. Along with some other great tracks throughout like \\"The Almighty Dollar\\", \\"11 Silver\\", \\"Black Rain\\" and \\"Not Going Away\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good but not amazing","review":"Ok this is definitely not one of his very best albums, but that doesnt mean that is no t good. I like most of his albums. This album is alittle better than Down to Eart. Basiaclly i like 5 songs in this albums - in the point that i simply like htem (do not expect so good material as in his first albums). The first 3 songs are really very good. Then i like 2 songs in hte middle of the album , and the rest are simply ok. I can say that i like this album. but i believe it only for hige fans of ozzy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Surprised","review":"All I can say is this album is waaaaaaay better than Ozzy's previous cd. In fact it's better than his previous couple of cd's. I loved the Ultimate Sin and I loved Ozzmosis. Down to Earth wasn't very good and I didn't care for the No More Tears cd that so many people liked. That cd was too soft. This cd ROCKS however and here's why I believe that is: Zakk Wylde's influence is all over this cd. Every song sounds Zakke Wylde-influenced. And unlike most of Ozzy's previous cd's, EVERY song on this album rocks. The songs are great on this one, even the slow ones. Believe me, I was skeptical but I'll always give Ozzy the chance being the legend that he is. And surprisingly, believe me, this cd rocks and is great from beginning to end. It's awesome to hear Ozzy sounding so good and making such great songs. This is one of Ozzy's best. I know, I never would have thunk it either."},{"rating":"2","title":"BEST ALBUM","review":"I don't know what those people who are doubting this album are saying. This is the best ozzy album since No More Tears. It sounds very overproduced, and heavy. The Almighty Dollar is a funky kinda sounding song that unleashes Mr. Wild's heavy riffs throughout. I Don't Wanna Stop is probably the most catchy song on the album and it's quit an athem. Also, Not Going Away kicks ***. It is also quit catchy. There are only really two ballads on the album, Lay Your World on me, but its a pretty good ballad, and Here For You, which is good as well. The rest of the 8 songs are rock'n and catchy. Some of the riffs kind of even remind me a little of Jake E Lee days. So some of it has the intensity of the Ultimate Sin, but with the production of No More Tears. This cd rocks! It's good to know the ozzman is back"},{"rating":"2","title":"Video makes immediate impact","review":"This video is an exceptional step-by-step instructional aide.

The multimeter itself is very cheaply made and the probes are very flimsy and of low quality. As one of the other reviewers stated the batteries are a pain to replace. It takes (6) LR44 button cell lithium batteries enclosed in a seperate plastic housing. The meter itself is ok for anything that doesn't require precision or fine tolerances. You are better off buying a cheap Craftsman (Sears) multimeter for around the same price."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's a toy","review":"I do not trust this meter it feels like a toy. It is only a class 2 meter which means it is not safe for anything bigger than residential circuits. I will only trust mine for testing batteries. For those reviews that say they're using it at work, they are trusting their life with a $15 dollar meter. The best feature is the lack of a power saver function. If you leave it on or the unit gets turned on because it has no case, it drains its battery. The lack of storage for the leads also makes it harder to carry and store without damaging them. I am not even going to waste the money on replacing the 6 LR44 batteries. All in all it is a waste of money, DO NOT buy this meter."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very delicate..","review":"The unit does its job alright.. but its just too delicate.

The photos document the vanishing art of stone carvers and highlights themes of folk art and spiritual belief. The photos also provide a timeless record of Jewish tradition in the Ukraine and Moldova. Intricately carved motifs include crowns of the Torah, signs of the Kohanim (split fingers), birds, fallen fruit, a single candle, a broken tree and three small chicks (for the mother who dies leaving three young children), fish, deer, unicorns, bear, lions, and fighting lions.

My 4 year old called it his \\"teddy bear beeper\\" and loved wearing it. Most importantly, he also understood what it was for, meaning if it beeps he knew that Mom and Dad were looking for him. So during our trip to Asia, we actually did lose him in a very crowded store. I activated the transmitter and was able to hear the beep. He was 2 aisles down from where we were and he ran out looking for us. The teddy bear receiver uses 2 CR2032 (flat discs) batteries; the transmitter uses one A23 12 volt battery. These batteries are not cheap. The 12 volt battery in the transmitter was dead when it arrived. During the trip, it lasted only about 3 days without even being used. I'm giving it a pretty good rating only because it worked well in a real life situation."},{"rating":"2","title":"Use it in reverse","review":"Hello.

I could hear the beeps above the wind and waves, but it wasn't over-loud to scare the kids. Improvements: I would make them waterproof, or make a waterproof model available. I had to keep taking them off and put them back on as the kids went swimming. the bear is water-resistant, and it did get a little wet without problems. also I wish there was a clip instead of a belt holder.

Assembly was a breeze--it was up in less than 15 minutes. We selected this stand based on the reviews on Amazon and they were accurate. The stand is tall and hangs at a perfect length for the chair we purchased. If we had purchased a spring, the hammock chair (which we ordered separately), would have been too low. Also, the chair only comes in white and because of its color, is a bit of an albatross in our family room. The finish is professional and appears to be durable.

His supposed transcipts of Soviet air defense pilots and controllers doesn't agree with the actual recordings, his facts can't be double checked, and none of it agrees with the declassified records that have been made available in the wake of the collapse of the USSR.So why do people continue to defend Brun, and claim that he alone is correct, and all others are somehow corrupt?Conspiracy theorists are motivated by a great many things. Some are simply looking for verification of their existing predjudices. Many revel in the ideal that they alone are privy to secret information not available to others. And some find solace in conspiracy theories that mirror their own paranoid delusions.Whatever the case, Brun's work has long been discredited- see, for example, the tremendous amount of research that Soviet aerospace expert James Oberg has put in on this at his own web pages (www.jamesoberg.com).

I debated Brun in Seattle in 1992 and fgound his arguments silly, superficial, and insincere -- and his alleged 'Russian transcripts' fictitious. Analysis, and new data, over following years showed the airliner's course deviation was accidental and the Soviet attempts to identify it incompetent, leading to an inexcusable decision to apply deadly force AFTER the flight had departed Soviet airspace, while it was over international waters.A lot of the controversies and investigations are summarized at my site[...]"},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice Album","review":"Not as good as the first but these boys have some definite chemistry.

It's always great to find an author who incorporates so much about the setting, its culture and people while telling an intriguing tale. The combination of detail about Ireland's history, culture, landscape, customs and the well-plotted mystery make both of her books well worth the time to read them. Due to all the detail, it may take a little longer to read than other thrillers but the payoff is a great story. \\"Lake of Sorrows\\" did not disappoint as we continue to follow the relationship of Nora and Cormac that started in \\"Haunted Ground\\". The in-depth description of them and the other main characters makes you feel like you know them and want to know more about them. I hope there will be more books in this series."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun Mystery!","review":"Lake of Sorrows, is Hart's 2nd novel with American pathologist Nora Gavin and Irish archaelogist Cormac Maguire.

Dr. Gavin heads out to the bog to study the discovered body, and upon her arrival another body is found, this one from the 21st century. Thus the mystery begins....Hart writes a great character driven mystery that is an easy read when you're looking for something light to read fast! It was a page turner that had me second guessing my own thoughts as to who the murderer might have been and what their motive was. I have enjoyed both of Hart's books. If you can I would begin with Haunted Ground just so that you can get the background on Nora and Cormac.

Honestly, anyone who wears a pink track suit with a pink hat would get clowned in the street. But let's get back to what makes this album worthy of the trash heap. Cam'ron's lyrics make no sense. It's all just random words that happen to rhyme. Most mainstream rappers fit this mold. But Cam'ron takes it to another level. It's ridiculous. I'll grudgingly admit that there are some pretty nice beats on this CD. Seems wasted considering the lack of Cam'ron's talent. My record for most wasted beats for 2003 was 50 cent. But I'm changing that to this album. I bet there's 100 underground MC's who could make a classic with any one of these tracks. To Sum it up?

He has no flow whatsoever and does not rhyme a word he says and when he does rhyme it is completely wack. I'm with reviewer Mistermaxx in that CamRon has no vibe, no funkiness. It's just boring music that is used only for torture. The beats on this album are above decent but CamRon ruins it. Harlem should be ashamed...and what is his fascination with the color pink!?!?

Back in the early 90's Cam, Big l and Mase flowed together. I believe the group was called Children of the Corn. Mase went on to glory with Puffy and then with the Lord. Big L was killed before reaching his potential. Years later Camron signed to The ROC and drops his first mega single \\"Oh Boy\\"...the radio and clubs couldn't get enough. This album has great production though at times the lyrics can be somewhat simple. On \\"Welcome to NY\\"...Jay-Z stops by for a hot verse. \\"Hey Ma\\" was a dope follow-up single as well.

The first single, \\"Oh Boy,\\" in my opinion, is a very annoying song. But after hearing the second single \\"Hey Ma,\\" I figured that this may not be as bad as an album as I thought. In fact, maybe it would be pretty decent. It was just recently that I purchased the album and I was hoping for at least a few listenable songs. I couldn't even get that from Cam.Besides the great beats to almost every song, this album has nothing to offer. Every song on this album is garbage with the exceptions of \\"Hey Ma\\" and \\"Welcome to New York City.\\" The song \\"Tomorrow\\" I kind of like because of the positve message it portrays. So, I either program my CD player to only these three songs, or I don't listen to this ... at all.

There are no suprises on this cd, in fact, you can choose a number of available rap cds and get the same content. This cd was given to me, free of charge, and I still felt compelled to throw it out of my truck at the stop light,(partly because I was ashamed to let anyone see me listening to something like this).

Anyway, this album was dope, and the production was really good. Welcome to New York City feat. Young Hov is crack, and I think it's great for Jay-Z to do a track with Cam, because rather you all know it or not, The Roc really doesn't like Cam since he's been signed. Reason being...Cam came to the ROC and took over. Then immediately started Dipset, and put his homeys on. ( Freaky Zeeky, Santana, Jim Jones ).

My friends got theirs in Switzerland, but I could not find it here. This one looked very similar so I tried it. I am very satisfied. We made the fondue on the stove and then transferred to the table (I did not use the fuel source provided but a regular tea candle, and it kept the caquelon at the right temperature, without burning the cheese). I cleaned beautifully!My kids don't like cheese fondue, so I obliged with repeat performances of chocolate fondue. Also perfect, and what a success! The only issue is that the forks, even though quite beautiful, don't have the color identification that other sets have. No big deal for me, but a disappointment for my children. I completely recommend this set."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best","review":"From beginning to end, Wings is a great book: It is real, it translates inner human feelings and experiences into words and everybody in the family can enjoy and relate to it. I strongly recommend it. Congratulations and Best wishes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the price of the book","review":"While the diet is a good one, there is really no reason to buy this book and get all the filler. The workout is geared for beginners. If you want something more advanced, you have to buy the edition available only from the publisher or send them an extra fee for a more advanced workout. If you can find the Men's Health article that came out before the book, you have essentially all the useful information contained in the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed, but persevering","review":"I just finished the 9-week program, which the authors wisely emphasize is just meant to get you started. I complied with the diet about 80 percent of the time, and the workouts about the same. I have gained a small but noticeable amount of muscle definition in my shoulders and arms, but I lost only about six or seven pounds ... roughly half of what I had expected based on the testimonials in the book. I'm pulling my belt in one more notch, but still wearing the same size pants, so I didn't lose the four or five inches their test subjects claim to have.The diet is easy enough to follow, and includes enough recipes to not be too monotonous, especially if you use the principles to find additional meals. But at this rate, it will take me a year to reach my goal weight, and I know I won't follow it that long unless I get some significant success much sooner than that."},{"rating":"2","title":"So far, so good...","review":"I haven't read it all yet, but so far, I like what I'm reading and it makes me want to jump on the bandwagon as soon as possible!"},{"rating":"1","title":"where's the data?","review":"Interesting topic centering around the new theory of eating more protein and less carbs to lose...when mated with workouts.What's a tad troubling is that the entire \\"study\\" was based on 30 people, with results published for SIX!(??) No result metric is consistent from participant to participant except pullups?? is the number of pullups a person can do a true measure of fitness?Also, this book CLAIMS that following the plan raises testosterone levels...but testosterone levels were not measured in the participants? Seems if you NAME a book \\"the testosterone advantage plan\\" and BASE this theory on the elevation of testosterone levels, that you might want to actually MEASURE them?no physician collaborated on this book, nor a nutritionist. so you're taking the word of fitness experts/journalists.

Whilereading I found myself constantly asking how much the meat and dairy industry paid to have this written. I have to believe that Lou Schuler sold out. I will not waste time with a full review. If you are truly looking for help in the testosterone arena I will recommend a couple of other books that I found very helpful.\\"Maximize Your Vitality & Potency\\" by Jonathan V. Wright MD and Lane Lenard Ph.D. Also \\"The Testosterone Syndrome\\" by Eugene Shippen M.D. & William Fryer. These were well written and very helpful with science to back them up. I am 50 years old and have significantly raised my testosterone levels following the information provided in these books.

Unfortunatly it reminded me of why i stopped reading Men's Health magazine. That is, it works way to hard at capturing masculinity through looks and physical strength. Its pretty shallow stuff.The work out is a good one. But the diet is fairly hard to deal with. Its not the food choices. Those are fine. ITS THE FACT THAT THE WEEKLY MENU COSTS AN ARM AND A LEG! This is a diet for rich guys or yuppie editor/writers who can write it off as a work expense.Blue collar joes with low incomes need not attempt this diet. You'd end up spending a fortune on it in the nine weeks they give you and then what happens when you come to the end of the nine weeks and have to maintain it for life? who the heck can buy the amounts of food they require and the brand names they require! not me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Still left with question","review":"The author states that no trick photography was used to produce the before and after photographs. I am not convinced. I am not saying the photographs were altered in any way, but I am saying that the photographs are not apples to apples comparisons. The before photographs are small frontal view pictures. The after photographs are almost twice the size and show each man from a different angle. The first photograph shows a man with his arms over his head, another man is wearing all black clothing, and yet another is holding a wieght in his hand. I am not impressed with these photographs. I also noticed that sixteen men took the challenge but fewer than half of the men are photographed. I also do not understand how you can inlude testosterone in the title and not test for the hormone in these individuals.

My one complaint is that sometimes it feels like the author is desperately trying to prove his points to you. He'll start spouting off all this research that back his claims, but most of the time the research hardly seems conclusive at all. I started skipping those paragraphs to save myself time and aggravation. I'm already in pretty decent shape so I bought this book to learn more about diet and how to mix up my workout routines. It has been very good for that.I also bought Men's Health: Book of Muscle. I haven't had time to read that one yet. But from thumbing through it, it looks to be a little more comprehensive than The Testosterone Advantage Plan."},{"rating":"2","title":"This book is not for vegetarians!","review":"Packs a lot of new (to me anyway!) information.Plus points: Categorises fats into good, bad and ugly. Gives the Glycemic index for common carbs. As for the workout routines itself, I found it very easy to follow Phase 1. Havent gotten into phase 2 yet.Minuses: Having been a life long vegetarian, I found it really challenging to eat right to gain lean muscle. Of course the premise of the book precludes any advise on eating muscle building vegetarian food. In the exercise routines, I wish they had highlighted under each type which muscle groups are targeted.Overall a very interesting read. I am following their routines and diet (sans the meat) as much as possible. Results: I can see some changes in my body, though it may be too early to tell."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too much hype, not enough science","review":"OK, so its not all bad ... its got some good information. HOWEVER, the book *itself* says in an early sidebar that they \\"did not measure testosterone levels\\" when they did their own studies (yes! it says it in the book!), but are relying on other studies to back up their claim that this combination diet/fitness regimen will actually alter your testosterone levels and therefore improve your life. Maybe. How can they credibly claim to be a program for \\"Testosterone Advantage\\" if testosterone was NEVER MEASURED?If you want real science and real studies to back up his claims, read the Zone books by Barry Sears."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good book","review":"I have tried many diets with very little sucess, but this book really hit the mark.

After it arrived, all concerns went out the window. I will be buying more for all of my instruments.The leather is soft and thick. No stiff ends to wrestle onto the strap pegs of my acoustics.The color was slightly lighter than I expected from the image, but still very nice.The strap is smooth on the dark side and suede on the light side. You can actually wear either side out for a completely different look.The suede on the inside can be a plus OR a minus, depending on your preference. I like the suede, because it offers some added 'grip' to the strap so that the guitar doesn't slide around on my shoulder. However, this added 'grip' will tug at your shirt when you attempt to make an adjustment in position.

The hype makes it sound like an interesting read, but in reality Ben Harris has the writing talent of a 4 year old. Seriously, I wrote better quality short stories when I was in grade school. Full of typos, bad grammar and massive quantities of incorrect use of the English language, and loads of cliches. This book is a disgrace because it's not even up to the standard of high school English. Seriously, you could watch a TV movie and get more intellectual stimulation than this book provides.

The kicker was that by the time I finished taking about 10 pictures, the batteries ran out!!

The camera is ok for this use, but I found the OEM Sony batteries to be unreliable and expensive. We got the error warning mentioned by others and the same cold reception from Sony. I warn others considering this or any digital camera to make sure it does not use a proprietary battery. For the cost of the Sony battery we were able to buy a charger and 4 NiMH 2200 mAh batteries. The camera cycles faster with the flash and it appears that we get more photos per charge, plus we have a back up set. I don't see a down side with the non-sony battery. On the otherhand it takes pretty good pictures and its easy to cheat the shutter for special effects. We get very good close ups, but I always use a tripod for these and I bracket shoot at a few distances. After all there is no film, why not take several shots and pick the best one?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great starter camera","review":"If using regular AA batteries you're camera will run out of life before your disk runs out of space, try getting rechargables. I did have a problem with Sony's product warranty and the extended warranty my husband purchased as well though. Apparently I will need to get myself another camera because neither policy will cover condensation (or liquid damage as they put it). The repair for this exceeds the purchase price of the camera and I won't pay it. Be careful using this and all digital cameras if you are going to use it in different temparatures.

But I must agree with other reviewers that there is a woeful lack of true biographical material about the Medicis themselves. Why were they hated? What were the feuds about? Why did they have to leave Florence? How do they compare to the Borgias? The explanations are vague or absent. I suspect that what we have is a chamber of commerce history, with sumptuous sets and costumes and heavily accented narration, designed to make you want to visit Florence, but with very little elucidation and no insight.

These lullabies and other quiet songs are beautifully done. Her voice is so loving and soothing - the perfect combination for calming a restless child, or a stressed out adult. Forget Valium, or sleeping pills! Just sit back, play this CD and you will relax. As with her choice of jazz standards on her other 2 CDs, her choice of lullabies and other quiet songs is perfect. We even get to hear \\"Danny Boy\\" again! (She sang it on her first CD \\"If You Never Come to Me\\") A double treat! \\"Baby Fine\\" by Rosemary DuVall & Dwight Mikkelsen is so sweet.

Anton Brucjkner and Carl Orff.The very fact to dare to record and accept the overall challenge of undertaking an artistic crusade in order to make Orff a composer of major label is by itself worthy to acknowledge. But as we know the special attention and devotion of Jochum literally surpassed all the praises.That's why you can not outdo this remarkable trilogy, because of the fact Jochum knew to establish not only a very hard to overcome level of performance, but established a personal landmark and a conceptual unity around the egregious figure of this peculiar composer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Jabra BT800","review":"It works great, the charge lasts a couple of days.

I have a motorola v710 phone and the headset just did not work very well. Although it was nice to have the caller id on the unit, it did not make up for the other issue it had.1) Too Heavy and swings from the ear as you move your head.2) It would not automatically connect to my Motorola phone. I had manually reconnect up all the time. My new Motorola BTHS10will allow me to shut off from the headset and it disconnects from the phone. When I open the boom on the headset it will just auto connect to the phone without doing anything.3) Many times I never could get the voice response to work.

The warranty turn-around time was 2 weeks. Jabra replaced the headset with a new one in March of 2006. The new headset seemed to lose the blue tooth signal every 10 or 15 calls, even with the cellphone right next to the headset. In July the display stopped working. I asked Jabra to replace the headset under warranty because I received the replacement only 4 months prior. They refused. 1 Week later, the headset stopped working completely.

He is an only child that helps his parents with chores and the residents. He is obsessed with death and dying and his thoughts have begun to govern his quality of life.

Soon a retired Magician named Clarence (Michael Caine) moves in and after a rough start, they develop a friendship based on magic and debating what happens after death.Soon Clarence's influence helps everyone look at the sunny side of life.Although the plot sounds interesting, the script does not move well, and the inability to understand some of the words does not help."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very dry","review":"This movie was very dry, boring and really didn't make it's point - to be part of the living before it was too late.

The Great Learning is a riveting piece and is indeed an aural fossil of what must have been a Brontotherium of a live event. (It's inspired me to host my own event based on the Chinese \\"Lo-Shu.\\") The other pieces are by the gentleman who brought us the \\"Tubular Bells\\" of The Exorcist, and who does a rather muffled rendition of Kenneth Patchen.Of the two composers, Cardew's piece is the most compelling.

The point of any review is to give your opinions and thoughts about what a movie/CD/book IS and then, perhaps, what you would have liked it to be. But to give anything a single star, especialy without having read/watched/heard it, simply because it wasn't EXACTLY what you wanted is ridiculously self-centered and unfair.At the time of this post, the rating is 3.5 stars based on 51 reviews (52 counting mine). After reading all the reviews, at least half of the reviewers have not even listened to the CD. Even if you've seen the movie, and you're rating it based on that, it's misleading: as has been pointed out ad infinitum, the CD score and the movie soundtrack are not the same.So.

They must have been pasteurized or something. Instead of the firm, almost crunchy texture of a good picholine, they were mushy to the point where many of the olives were already crushed in the bag, despite the excellent shipping job.I wish I had heeded the other feedback and passed on these.

If I could give this product negative stars, I would."},{"rating":"2","title":"boom'n in ya house or car or worplace or...","review":"Nice-up the dance is a collection on soul jazz records. The album is 13 tune mixture of dancehall and hip-hop. It comes with extensive liner notes about each tune which provides a really good understanding of the context for the music. There are some killer tunes on this album. For me three highlights are1- Cutty Ranks \\"who say me done\\". Laying down the gauntlet to a bunch of MC's who might just get shocked to death.2- Ms Thing shouting out instructions to the guys telling them what they've got to do to keep a girl hot. This will cost money!3- Sean Paul, before he got all famous, letting everyone know how big he is and where he wants to go on the dirty tune \\"Infiltrate\\".If you're a fan of either hip-hop or dancehall you will love this album.

Sure, there are the obligatory throwaways that each title always has (in this case Ray Parker Jr's annoying \\"Ghostbusters\\" and Bananarama's fluffy \\"Cruel Summer\\") but this is more than offset but some real pop nuggets including Culture Club's catchy \\"Karma Chameleon,\\" The Cars lovely \\"Drive,\\" Hall and Oates blue-eyed soul gem \\"Out of Touch\\" and two absolutely gorgeous songs in Eurythmics' \\"Here Comes the Rain Again,\\" and Cyndi Lauper's \\"Time After Time\\" (the later of which has richly earned its status as a pop standard). All in all a good and concise, if somewhat flawed, time capsule of 1984."},{"rating":"2","title":"Is there life on other planets?","review":"The opener, \\"She's So Liquid\\" showcases the Bill Mallonee sound. Dreamy , distorted guitars and warm organ sounds encase Mallonee's earnest vocals.Mallonee had shown signs of pursuing a college radio friendly sound, with songs like \\"It's Not Bothering Me\\" on his band's last album. But there are no percussive anthems here. Mallonee is clearly recalling his childhood favorites from the British invasion.\\"Extraordinary Girl\\" is a beautiful two-and-a-half minute pop song, ranking with \\"Extreme North of the Compass\\" and \\"Tempest\\" in that aspect in Mallonee's catalog.The biggest complaint many diehard VoL fans will have: They've heard most of these songs already. Many were featured on Mallonee's first true solo album Fetal Position. Now, Paste Magazine has started its own label, and they've culled songs from Fetal Position along with several new tracks."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best album of the year","review":"Perfumed Letter is another excelent album from Bill Mallonee. I have been listenning to it for several weeks now and can't find any flaws. Bills vocals perfectly convey the emotions expressed in the lyrics, from sorrow and desperation to joy and love.

The writing is terrible. the main character dull and self absorbed. I especially take issue with Miss Bloom's dialogue which is horribly written. SO MUCH telling and not showing. And just not distinct voice. HOW DID THIS GET PUBLISHED?Incidentally, I was gifted this by a friend for my birthday and when she read it afterwards, she apologized.

Sadly, I was quickly turned off. While Rebecca Bloom appears to have a sense of humor and an occasional flair with words, for the most part this book was a collection of whines and incoherent flashbacks and inner dialogues/monologues.Additionally, it is hard to take seriously the desperation of a 20-something to be married when women in our society are holdilng off on getting married. Let's leave the bemoaning our single status until we are in our 30's. The 20's ought to be about being out there and having fun and figuring out who we are. Maybe in her next book, Ms. Bloom can use her budding talent to focus on those issues."},{"rating":"1","title":"Summer Song","review":"\\"I Think I'm in Love With You\\" is one of those songs you're bound to hear blaring from the radios of teens in the summer. It's a fun and catchy tune, but Simpson keeps it from being a pop classic with her endless need to prove she can hit those high notes eardrums be darned. She tends to screech and scream to show off her range to the discomfort of ears around her. The song was bound to be a hit for someone, but maybe someone a little easier on the eardrums."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not his best, but a must-read for any fan of Marius Gabriel","review":"Rebecca is recuperating in Nepal after a mountain climbing accident when she learns that Therese, the daughter she gave up for adoption thirteen years ago, is suspected of setting the fire that killed her adoptive mother. She concludes that her best chance of helping Therese is to reappear in her life as a nanny, telling no one her real identity. Rebecca soon realizes that something is not quite right with the entire family. Unfortunately, Marius Gabriel is not at his finest in this book. The first three quarters were excellent, with a fantastic buildup of suspense and intrigue. The ending was a bit of a let-down, and it felt incongruous with respect to the rest of the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"A decent super-cheap recorder!","review":"You certainly can't beat it for the price! As a musical instrument, the sound is slightly whistle-y and thinner than some more costly recorders, but frankly, not by all THAT much. It does tend to \\"buzz\\" when it gets too steamy inside, and it's more difficult to clean because it doesn't come apart.This Canto recorder is slightly shorter than my Schylling 3-piece, which can be a slight advantage for players with smaller hands. The fingering is standard and you'll be able to go through any recorder instruction book using this instrument.The colour-coding isn't just cosmetic, either - I bought one for each kid, and one for myself, in different colours, so nobody's swapping spit or fighting over whose is whose (obviously, you can't do that in a large school group). The matching coloured bags are helpful, too - we can see from the outside whose is whose!I'm thrilled to have found these recorders - they are the perfect thing in our homeschool setting and the kids love them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for School","review":"Recorder has case, and is good quality---perfect for my third grader. She is happy she has her own color unlike other plain beige recorders."},{"rating":"2","title":"Page Turner","review":"This is the place my husband was born in and really liked some of the stuff the author was saying and finding out some things about the town I didn't know, also seeing some of my own relatives mentioned in this book really took me back in the day.

I actually found the single (which I recommend if you can find it) and listened to the song on repeat for 3 days. The rest of the cd is similarly good. I also recommend Cosmicity's Isabella cd."},{"rating":"1","title":"Postal worker is pathetic writer","review":"If 'Reginald Buchanan' is as poor a postal worker as he is a writer then he surely f--- up people's mail. This book seemed interesting but it is dull reading. If the person had some talent such a premise for a novel might be fascinating. But this book leaves me cold. It is self published and I expect that is how it will stay. Don't let postal workers read this stuff. It will drive them postal."},{"rating":"1","title":"a total disapointment","review":"This is a badly written book on a very macabre subject. The idea that a serial killing postal carrier is killing off his customers is horrific. I lost friends in the Edmond, Oklahoma post office massacre, in the Oklahoma city bombing and in the world trade center. This book with it's pointless gratuitous violence is disturbing and horrific. The book lacks well written characters and has very poor dialogue. I highly recommend you ignore it. 'Reginald Buchanan' is hardly a P.D. James. He is only a wannabe writer."},{"rating":"1","title":"a load of rubbish","review":"I was looking forward to this self published book but it is really poorly written. The violence is over the top and totally out of hand. I would never recommend this book to any of my friends. The writer is clearly getting his balls of with all the sex and violence."},{"rating":"1","title":"killer postman sucks","review":"I am a postal carrier in Texas. I read this book expecting some good reading. Boy was I ever disapointed. The book was very badly written with no cohesive plot. The book seems to be aimed at a general audience of non postal workers. I don't think anyone could sit down and read this entire books. The violence is senseless and more for shock value. If you are an insomniac you probably should read the book. It was certainly not my cup of tea."},{"rating":"1","title":"disgusting piece of work","review":"I'm a postal carrier for 15 years. I love my work. I love serving the public. In this badly written book, 'Reginald Buchanan' makes postal workers look like insane crazed serial killers who enjoy hurting people. He has the right to publish anything he wants but this book has hurt postal workers. And it is extremely badly written. The violence is really disturbing to me. He is not a subtle writer but totally over the top. I love the mystery genre. I read everything from Stephen King to Dorothy L. Sayers. This book is not in any of these authors league. It deserves to go out of print and be forgotten. Which it thankfully will."},{"rating":"1","title":"blood bath","review":"THE KILLER POSTMAN is a blood bath passing itself off as a book. it is filled with violence and more violence. A good writer would not resort to violence like this unless it was totally necessary. I believe that the so called writer has alot of problems and is putting them into book form. I finished the book but it left me devestated. One star is to much. How about a rating of zero? No stars!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Simply put...","review":"This book was just horrible. There were a thousand and one characters introduced, no plot to follow, and it hardly qualifies for a mystery novel. I felt as if I were back in the third grade listening to one of my classmates read his/her book report. [...] One thing is for sure, I would NOT recommend this book to others."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not to my taste!","review":"Although well done, it was not to my taste! Too jazzy and upbeat for me! I could not even listen through the entire collection. My original recollection from the \\"old days\\" did not live up to the actuality of the recordings, so I have decided to give it away to someone who will enjoy it better!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great But Pricey","review":"I got a box of minibars for Christmas. I really liked its unique hint-of-lemon flavor. I liked it so much, in fact, that I saved the box to find out where to get more. When I found it, I realized that the price is a bit too high to swallow. (Sorry, bad pun.)

What a joy to watch it again. you feel you know the characters and hate to see the series end"},{"rating":"1","title":"Two Thumbs Down","review":"I've never written a book review prior to this one. After getting half way through this book I felt I needed voice my opinion on one. However, I am concerned that maybe I expected too much after reading some of the positive reviews?This book contains too many errors to be considered a valuable resource. Many examples do not pertain to LM2, many of the downloadable files are not compatible with LM2, text refers to examples that are non existent, references are made to non-existent features, and the list continues. Having purchased over 30 software books over the past few years I can say with confidence this is the worst computer software related book I've ever purchased."},{"rating":"1","title":"LiveMotion 2: A Beginner's Guide","review":"Knowing Live Motion 1 very well, I bought this book specifically to learn more about Live Motion 2's new scripting capabilities. I therefore only read the last 5 chapters (11 thru 15) on scripting.My most relevent comment regards typos. That is misspellings of both text and javascript code. So much so that I couldn't beleive it. This publisher ought to be ashamed of themselves. Is there not such a thing as an editor or proof reader anymore?I found these typos on practically every page (chapters 11 thru 15) and especially in the example code, a most frustrating way to learn (the code printed on page was incorrect and therefore the example files did not work).Although there were some well thought out ideas conveyed, because of so many mistakes, I would not recommend this book for beginners."},{"rating":"1","title":"LiveMotion 2","review":"I have never been more disappointed with a computer related book than this one. I found dozens of errors and spent an excessive amount of time trying to get some of the examples to work....with no success.I went to the publisher's website and downloaded the files and found that I could not load a substantial number of them because they were written for LM1.0 and could not be imported into my LM2.0It's embarrassing that the author is continually promoting his book on the web instead of attempting to correct the errors in an erratum to the website. I highly suggest that he update the website files to LM2.0 as promised in the book instead of trying to push a book that contains so many inaccuracies. I also don't understand why a few dollars of royalties would be more important than the author's dignity and professional reputation.Please correct your errors and make your companion website files compatible with LM2.0"},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful Book","review":"Save your money and your sanity. This is a terrible book, full of mistakes and misinformation. Until a better book appears, read the Adobe documentation and follow some of the Adobe on-line examples. You will actually learn something. The writer and editor (if there was one) of this monstrosity should be banned from ever publishing anything again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dissappointing!","review":"I purchased this book hoping to learn a little of LM2.I am happy to report that Micro Center was able to refund me! I found the book riddled witherrors. I WOULD NOT recommend it to anyone becauseit is, in my opinion, irresponsible of the author torelease a book with deceiving information, such as:online files that don't exist, illustrations out of place,and examples geared for LM1, NOT LM2.If you're serious about learning LM2, stay away from this one!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Confusing - full of mistakes","review":"Mistakes in this book can greatly confuse beginners. For instance page 134 states that filters are no longer available in LiveMotion 2. Page 137 then has a step by step instruction that includes an instruction to select the filter command from the object menu! There are many instances where the text talks about issues covered in the last chapter that were simply not there! The other annoyance is when they refer to files you can download that are also not available. This is a major problem as the instuctions assume you HAVE the files. It seems they took the version 1 book and updated it without checking all the references. I am only on page 140 but have already found more mistakes in this book than ANY other I have used."},{"rating":"2","title":"Compelling reading","review":"The JonBenet case fascinated me, though, but I was reluctant to follow the sensationalist bandwagon. Schiller's book, however, provided me with what I thought to be a very objective presentation of this bizarre case. Yes, at times it seems as if it were patched together as he was writing it and yes, it sometimes didn't appear to have any direction, and yes, there are a lot of characters to keep track of (but there is a glossary of names in the appendix), and yes, it does shift restlessly between the information about the murder and the conflict between the DA and the police. But those stylistic devices in themselves mirror the haphazard, almost chaotic investigation, the animosity amongst the people involved, and the constantly changing perspectives of the media, the people of Boulder, and the primary and secondary players in this drama. Those readers who want sensationalism should read the tabloids. Those who want objective reporting should read Schiller's book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Never thought I'd finish....","review":"I usually read a book in a few days, but it took me a month to read this one. I did get some good information from Mr. Schiller's book, but I probably could have gotten that little bit from some website in about 30 minutes. It is too full of confusing information that was lost in too many words. Would have been better at half the pages..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dull Dull Dull!","review":"I thought that this book would be a little more interesting than it was. All it did was throw out all this evidence that was inconclusive. I didn't even finish this book, and don't even know why I began to read it. Personally, I think that this whole Jon Benet thing is just ridiculous. A little girl got murdered, and yes that was sad, but people get murdered everyday and we forget about them. So why not read a book that serves more of a purpose than this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dull-Same old known facts and theories","review":"I purchased this book as soon as it came out, hardcover, what a waste of money - I usually buy paperbacks. Perfect Town, Perfect Murder is a slow, boring, painful read. The reader can find more interesting information by simply surfing the net. An author of his caliber should not have wasted his time or mine."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poorly written; the word \\"that\\" used ad nauseum","review":"Coming from a Dershowitz book, this book was hard NOT to put down"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent true crime reading.","review":"Off-and-on a huge true crime fan, I found this book to be great reading, particularly since the case is so much in the media and on my mind. Probably the most important facet of this book that makes it great reading is that unlike many true crime reads, the author is exceptionally literate. Though he occasionally gets bogged-down in obsessive detail, I found this to be one of the most compelling true crime books I've read. The difficulty in this book lies in its ending: Suddenly, sort of without warning, BOOM, it's the end of the book.....and the ending whimpers a little, rather than crashing. And, of course, since this case has yet to come to any resolution, the reader is left with that same sense of dissatisfaction that the investigators must feel. Still, it's a powerful book, and, I think, is without bias, which would be a difficult task for most authors to accomplish."},{"rating":"1","title":"A book of trivia about Boulder with side-glances at the crim","review":"The major value of this book is to uncover the jealousy and in-fighting of the authorities of Boulder. It could best be described as an expose of how investigation of a major crime was almost totally botched from the beginning. The book is laced with trivia about the town and its citzens but does little to enlighten the reader as to the culprit. For those who like gossip, this is a winner."},{"rating":"1","title":"Amazingly dull for a story embraced by every tabloid","review":"It was nearly impossible not to get bogged down in the details in this book. The author really is not putting forth a thesis at all as to who did this murder. He is merely providing all of the infinite details of an investigation that really led nowhere. If you think you would enjoy reading 300 pages about the uncooperative behavior between the DA's office and the police, then you might think this is ok."},{"rating":"1","title":"It was like reading a student's research notes.","review":"There is some great research and reporting here. Too bad the author did not have time to sort his thoughts and organize some themes. It was absolutely maddening finding vital facts tossed together with details which a good editor would have removed."},{"rating":"1","title":"dull minutiae","review":"Very disappointing considering Schiller's previous works.Simply a rehashing of every article I've ever read in the newspapers about this case.. Hundreds of pages devoted almost exclusively to the police department/DA's office confliicts of personalities and philosphy of solving crime.Became repetitious and tedious very quickly."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect Murder, Perfect Town - Perfect Book!","review":"I highly recommend this book to anyone with *any* interest in the JonBenet Ramsey murder. If you've got any \\"reasonable doubt\\" of your own, it's my opinion that this book (by way of the evidence, and interviews presented) will make it quite clear \\"who dunnit\\". Unfortunately, the book still leaves at least one nagging question, but through no fault of the author. Only when justice is done, will this story have a satisfactory conclusion. This is the best six bucks and change I've spent in a long time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Schiller Is a Sloppy Writer and Not Factually Accurate","review":"Although a reasonably well-written book, Schiller's work is sloppy, and not as factually comprehensive as he would have the reader believe. For example, Schiller is strangely silent about the lawsuit brought against Alex Hunter by New York attorney Darnay Hoffman in November 1997. It was front page news nationally for weeks. A shocking oversight for a \\"careful\\" researcher, who should know better. It ruined the book for me, knowing he had missed this incident. What else has he left out?"},{"rating":"1","title":"THIS IS A LOUSY BOOK !","review":"This is unquestionably the worst true crime book this reviewer has ever read. I can only surmise that the author was paid by the word. Silly, irrelevant quotes from persons who had no reason to be interviewed. To compare this book to \\"In Cold Blood\\" is an insult to Truman Capote."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too many words.....too little information","review":"This book contains 600 pages with about 200 pages worth of content and information. In other words, the author had very little to say, but he appears to enjoy filling up pages with words. There aren't any big revelations in this book related to the JBR case. The only mystery to me is why Mr. Schiller felt the need to subject the reader to endless reams of useless information. Having said all that, this is the first time I've read anything written by this author. And having skimmed the last 350 pages of his essay (trying to discover anything worth the time and effort to read--which I failed to do), I can honestly say that I will not invest any more of my time reading any of his past (or future) offerings.Save your money on this one....go to your local branch of the public library and check this one out on loan."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring. Confusing. Extraneous details. No revelations.","review":"Having just read Jeffrey Toobin's book about the OJ Simpson case, I was looking forward to an enlightening book about the JonBinet Ramsey case. The book jacket promised big revelations.I ploughed through countless chapters. There were long quotes from people who I didn't have an idea who they were and why they were quoted. There were countless newspaper articles and other boring stuff about the police and the DA's office.I wanted the author to make the Ramseys \\"real\\" to me. I wanted to know what they were like. Nothing in the book gave me a sense that these people could actually beat and strangle their daughter to death. I am left with confusion about the murder and, moreover, confusion about the reason for this book.I didn't learn anything new."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent","review":"I read this book before reading Patsy and John's poor excuse for a book. Lawrence Schiller is a master at digging up every single bit of information in his books. From reading just his book, I learned every single thing about this case including things I'd never seen in the press. He obviously did a great deal of research before putting pen to paper. His book made me wonder about certain incidents in this case that I'd never even thought of before. If you have been following this case as me and several million other people, then this is a must read book. Out of every book I've read so far about the Jon-Benet murder, this book has been the best!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Minutiae","review":"This book is a lengthy, detailed account of the Ramsey murder investigation.I'm sure it is very well researched, but I do not recommend it, unless a person is extremely interested in this case. Otherwise, it could be considered a bit tedious, overly long, and going into many details that may not be important."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too long, poorly organized","review":"I am a determined type and almost always finish every book I read, but I couldn't bring myself to finish this one. Schiller throws in every tidbit of information that is even remotely connected to the case and does a poor job of orangizing it. There are parts that are interesting, but I ended up skipping large sections that just got too boring. Don't waste your money on this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"to slow, rehash of old news","review":"This is the one of the dullest book I have read in long time. Slow to start and doesn't get any better. I would not recomend this book to anyone. Just a cash in on a subject of interest to the public."},{"rating":"1","title":"Packed w/ material but needed editing and organization.","review":"It's hard for me to recall much I read other than material which caught my interest and frustration with the book's layout.The book meanders all over the proverbial map without going anywhere--he tries to include all, remain objective, and ends up being a poor read."},{"rating":"1","title":"A very slow moving nothing new and boring book","review":"This book has nothing new to tell us. The author spent a lot of time telling us the same old story."},{"rating":"1","title":"Perfect Murder, Perfect Town: The uncensored Story","review":"This is by far the worst book I have almost read. When I say almost it is because I cannot turn another page. It is so boring and drags on and on for hours!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Save Your Money !","review":"After the media build-up, this book was a big disappointment. It should have been titled \\"Height Of Incompetency\\" from the DA down. Nothing but the compilation of all the stories published and hashed over and over again on TV. Seems the author's goal was to get his share of the pot before the public lost interest."},{"rating":"1","title":"too many names and law, not enough about JonBenet!","review":"This book is too focused on law and names. I couldnt keep the names straight, however there is a name index in the back, as well as the Ramseys Boulder home floor plans. Only one chapter is \\"devoted\\" to JonBenet.If you really want to read about JonBenet's life and death, read JonBenet by steve thomas.This book doesn't tell anything about JonBenet's life, and it definately doesn't keep her precious memory alive!Although the movie/dvd was excellent, this book wasnt very good. I would not reccommend this book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Mostly boring, difficult to read.","review":"The politics of Boulder do not interest me, nor do the lives of the investigators involved in the murder case. Trying to separate the numerous detectives, lawyers, politicians, friends, relatives, neighbors, etc., and the countinous infighting among the characters was very frustrating. It started with unanswered questions and ended with more unanswered questions and more speculations about the case."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too much murder, not enough town","review":"It reads like a vast collection of newspaper articles, which isn't such a bad thing if you just want a broad overview of the case. To live up to his title, Schiller could have beefed up the 'town' component of the book. Apart from a token introduction that runs through your standard Boulder stereotypes, some namedropping of places like Mike's Camera and maybe some implications about Boulder because of some of the cops' attitudes, the book really doesn't say much about Boulder at all. In the end, I did develop a pretty good theory about the murder, and I don't necessarily feel as though I was led there by the author--though he does hit you over the head a bit with his own ideas."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the effort - book could have been 1/2 as long.","review":"You have to plough through lots of unnecessary and BORING passages to get to the 'good' parts where relevant information is revealed.

This incredible subject suffers from the absolute lack of one, or two clearly defined and established narrators to weave the multiple scenarios together. This is a big failing in a story which deals with such a fragmented set of circumstances and oppositional mind-sets. The author's research has apparently been meticulous but the presentation is as erratic in feeling as the reported circumstances of the investigation and affects the reading enjoyment."},{"rating":"2","title":"Truth Is Stranger Than Fiction","review":"There is nothing more inviting and compelling than a well-written true crime account. Schiller is the quintissential \\"on the beaten path\\" journalist. Imagine him in a long trench coat trudging through the streets of Boulder uncovering and discovering more pertinent information than any other reporter has to this point unveiled. After having read the equally riveting \\"American Tragedy\\" his O.J. Simpson murder trial account, I was jumping to pick up this book. I was not disappointed and would highly recommend this book to anyone who really savors tedious but important details."},{"rating":"1","title":"A review for those who don't know about this crime","review":"This review is written for people coming 'cold' to this issue - from a place (as I am) where it barely rated a mention and received very little coverage.If you want to know EVERY detail, EVERY nuance, EVERY theory, in fact everything other than who did it (because no-one does), about the Jon Bennett Ramsay murder, then this encyclopedic tome is for you.However, I found it got very, very tedious and repetitive. I rarely don't finish a book once started, but this one defeated me around page 500!Much of the material is repeated. A 250 page synthesis would perhaps be more relevant to the reader coming new to the subject. I appreciate others with a background in hearing about it may gain more from this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Confusing","review":"There were too many details in this book. I was given no insight to the case when reading this book (I couldn't finish it). I found myself unable to concentrate as too many facts were presented all at once."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just a note","review":"One item stands out after reading most of this book: Patsy Ramsey and one of her girl friends were fond of teasing John Ramsey for being from the South. The ransom note admonished John Ramsey to use his \\"Southern commonsense.\\" The book explains that John was not from the South."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hit or miss, but mostly miss","review":"I enjoy this product a lot when it is fresh. The problem is that the quality of the product varies and you don't know if you are going to get a box of fresh cuts or stale (hard as rock) pieces. When fresh, i think it is one of the best tasting jerky out there. However, when it is stale and hard, it is not edible. Because of the inconsistency in the quality, I will not be purchasing this product again. Its a shame, but they need to work on quality control."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful","review":"Very little flavor.

Make sure this is what you want before you invest."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not impressed with the taste","review":"Unlike the other reviewer, I am pleased with the texture of this product but the taste of the Original or \\"Natural\\" flavor is not pleasant.

Once you begin chewing the taste mellows."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very tasty Jerky","review":"I bought 3 different types of Turkey Jerky and this one was the best. It has a very nice flavor. It was better than the \\"Original Flavor\\" of this same brand. Great for keeping in your Hurricane kit."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doing hard time","review":"I really like the idea of this all natural jerky,but it's pretty difficult to get past the texture and hardness. The flavor is OK but if you get my meaning, it's hard to get to the flavor when you feel like you're chewing on a piece of *hard* dry leather. I got the box of 1-oz packs and it's pretty consistent among the packs."},{"rating":"1","title":"What Happened???","review":"This review is actually written in Sept of 2011. The original was a glowing review but apparently I'm not allowed to review the same product twice. Really Amazon? This jerky used to be so good and now it's the weirdest ever. The packaging that used to be so easy to open is now impossible without scissors. The jerky itself is like squares of hard rubber that are nearly impossible to chew.I bought my usual boxes of original and teriaki and the flavors were almost identical. After years of being a fan (especially my husband who doesn't eat beef)I'm so disappointed in whoever is responsible for destroying a great product. To whoever designed the new packaging....you need to go back to the drawing board. How about the original? It was perfect on all counts as it was. From 5 stars to 1. Barely."},{"rating":"1","title":"Astronaut Jerky?","review":"I don't know if this is naturally how turkey jerky comes or if it's just this product, but I've never had jerky this dry in my life. It's like they freeze-dried it or something! Instead of ripping a piece off with your teeth, you shatter it. I realize turkey breast meat has lower fat and a stringier, low-connective-tissue makeup, but this stuff is just not enjoyable to eat. It's too bad, too, because the actual taste is really good--spicy, savory, a hint of sweetness. But jerky should be chewy, not crumbly-hard, and my rating reflects this. Very disappointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Good At All","review":"The product came just like the description said. The packaging and quantity was fine, but the quality of the jerky was practically inedible. The jerky was so dried! It was a waste of money and no one in my house will eat it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of Money","review":"Save your money. This is the first dream book I ever bought and I hope all the other books are not like this. It is very vague, horoscopes are actually more insightful.

The Anime cut-scenes are wonderful. They are from the same animators as Giant Robo. The music is great. It's full of great humor. Witty remarks and dirty jokes abound. I recommend this game for maybe 15+ not because of content, but because it's a more mature level of gaming, I think younger gamers might find it boring. Not a good first RPG to play either.

GS tried to get you emotionally hooked all while showing anime and failed pretty well (although I did like the game as a whole). This game is loaded with different anime style cut scenes and has a very good storyline with great emotional intrigue. Only one other game has emotion this loaded, and that would be Final Fantasy 8. Okay, so the gaming graphics could use a bit, but this isn't exactly new. Some people say not to buy this because it is a rehash. But think in my position.

It's gone out of print now and it will be pretty hard to find one, so be on the lookout."},{"rating":"2","title":"Supernintendo Graphics made up for by story and cut scenes","review":"Lunar is my favorite RPG game of all time! What it lacks in battle graphics it makes up for in story line as well as cut scene animation. Lunar provides players with a fulfill storyline and several plat twists. This is one of the few RPG's that will truly make you care about all the characters in your party, not just Alex (the hero). Very few RPG's take the time to develop all characters and maintain an intriguing storyline. The animation for cut scenes will have you watching again and again.

So I've invested a great deal of time to my games, this game was fun but the graphics are weak and the game has been remade about 3 times or so.Working Designs needs to invest some work into the graphics, the music on the other hand is good and the anemie sequences are excellant.However graphics, anemie sequence, an FMV or two, or sound effects don't make a good RPG, plot and music coordinated at the right timing makes an RPG worth playing more than once not to mention a battle system that people will respect and want to use.Lunar SSS has a smooth plot in a unique world that seems very enchanting but it just didn't seem to capture me so well.

The graphics are a little old-fashioned, and the combat is menu-driven, but aside from that, it was a really good game. The story starts out as a little kid's adventure, but then unfolds into a tale of love, honor, and (sometimes) humor as the Magic Emperor begins his crushing advance onto Althena's world of Lunar.

No worries though, I was able to cook it using the outer burners providing indirect heat. It came out great. Just like everything else that gets cooked on it. The thermometer on the cover is accurate too, measuring it against a Fluke handheld multimeter. Phoenix weather is not kind to batteries. I lost the igniter to leakage. So be mindful of pulling the battery out at the end of your season, or replace it annually - even if it still fires. I would have liked an enclosed back on the grill.

This last book 'Orchid beach' is not even close regarding plot and characters descriptions. The plot is less than thin. The characters are simply not interesting. The style reminds me of some mystery books like 'The Hardy brothers solves a case' that I read as a kid. Though-out the book I repeatedly asked myself when the heroine was going to think or do the most obvious things and check-up, that every normal person would do in her situation... I don't expect Holly Barker to show up again in another novel after this fiasco."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dull as dishwater.","review":"Holly Barker is Police Chief of a small town in Florida called Orchid Beach. The book starts with her fiancé being murdered on their wedding day. Crappy beginning, especially considering Jackson, her fiancé, is the only really likable character in the book! In the hunt for his killers, she runs afoul of a possible cult, some neo-nazi types and the FBI.There is no emotion in the writing - no passion. The dialog is dry and dull - the whole thing reads more like a police report than a novel. This happens and then that happens, blah blah blah - I'm talking dull! Holly's father, Ham is the only character I cared about (other than Jackson who dies early) and the only reason I finished the book was to see what happens to him. A great plot is not enough for me (and there are holes in this one anyway). I want characterization. A plot hole the size of the Grand Canyon can be overlooked if there are fully developed characters who I can care about."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointing","review":"Less than halfway through the book, I had a hard time believing that it was written by Stuart Woods.

Yet, the reader will learn after the first few chapters that there is little mystery and no suspense. Instead, Orchid Beach is a novel written at an elementary school reading level. It lacks no imagination and is predictable from the beginning. Woods attempts to grab the readers attention with a homicide and shooting but fails to hold on to the reader as he drags the story out with one dead end after another. Furthermore, the heroine, Holly Barker is hard to buy as the sharp detective Woods attempts to create. Woods tries to grab the readers attention by making her tom-boyish and sexual. But she just comes across as a naive tart who has a really smart dog."},{"rating":"1","title":"Glad I didn't pay much for this book","review":"because I love Stuart Woods' novels and this one is very disappointing.

The cover is what got my attention and made me pick it up. Once I started scanning the first few pages, I couldn't put it down. I finished it within a week, and was glad to be on vacation to dedicate time to the action-packed events! Daisy especially needs more attention as she is very talented, and Holly is brutally honest and a hardnose when she needs to be. They make a great pair, as females who can stand up for themselves, yet be feminine at the same time. I look forward to a sequel! Holly's Dad proves to be her window to the past as a strong independent military brat, and her lawyer love interest allows for the sassy female to break through and make her realistic.

This was well worth waiting for. While there were some illogical plot points in solving the murders, I liked the primary characters much more than those in his last few efforts, and hope that he will bring them back to cross paths with Will Lee, the hero in Chiefs. As usual, this was a quick read, finished in a long afternoon.

I bought the book because I'm in a law enforcement career, my favorite dogs are Dobermans, and I'd seen enough Stuart Woods books around that I thought he was a popular author, but I shouldn't have bothered.The dog has very little to do with the story, this supposedly intelligent policewoman falls for and trusts one of the lawyers way too fast, no character development for you to feel like you 'know' them, and the ending was too 'normal' instead of being something interesting and surprising.

The characters have no depth -- they are cardboard cutouts."},{"rating":"2","title":"Guilty Pleasure","review":"I have listened to all the Orchid Beach books and found the first to be the most intense. They are all good though and I encourage everyone to try the series. Woods does a decent job with a female as the main character, though many of her characteristics are clearly male influenced. I don't know many women who go home after a hard day's work and grill a burger while drinking beer or a scotch, but Holly Barker does. It is always fun to see how Woods has her get involved in the latest mystery. Solid read and worth the effort."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lousy! Must have phoned this one in.","review":"I have read just about all of Stuart Woods books and this one just doesn't cut it. It starts off good and intriguing but within the first third of the book everything just gets too pat, there seems to be no development of the characters and the story is more than outrageous, it is bizarrely improbable. Holly, the main character never shows the color of classic Wood's characters like Stone Barrington or Dino, his former police partner. Once I was halfway through I couldn't decide whether to finish the book or bag it. I still really like Stuart Woods but I feel this book must have been pushed out the door to make a publishing commitment, or surely something like that.

Poor Genny starts out as a independent woman, albeit a man-hater, and becomes a docile and domesticate creature.

There are a few tunes--\\"What Does A Lover Pack?\\" and \\"Night Letter\\" among them--that have a hippy funky zing to them, but the majority of the album is filled with forgettable songs that seem half-written, with lyrics that could have been written by a nine year old, and then repeated a half-dozen times.

Raul Julia (\\"Nine\\") and Clifton Davis are fine as the male leads.

When I first heard the music, I too thought that it was cheesy, simple, and dated. But when I saw how the play came together, I loved it.

It leapt, it soared, and it delighted.

New songs of George's have been added as well as songs that came around before George became big..kind of like songs he recorded before he was anyone. Lefty's Gone....leaves you chilled to the bone while an early song \\"her goodbye hit me in the heart\\" breaks your heart. \\"My baby's gotten good at goodbye\\" is probably where George gets his strongest.

John Cusack can be a good actor, but not as a cowboy...like casting Don Knotts as a serious cowboy. The story line is someone gets hanged for something they didn't do and the last scene is they take his son away with tears in his eyes. The most surprising thing for me to grasp is that anyone would give this movie 5 stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"Jack Bull","review":"JACK BULL is a smart and slick tale of frontier justice taken to extremes. John Cusack nails the role of the horse trader done wrong and the acts he takes in retribution.I especially liked the introduction of the John Goodman character as a no-nonsense frontier judge whose sense of justice is equal to Cusack's. Cusack's acts of vigilante justice work on an individual basis in a lawless society, but Goodman represents the Law. I thought this interesting story became fascinating after Goodman's arrival. What started out as a revenge movie slowly and surely morphs into a tragedy, with two strong-willed characters whose passion for justice negates any other considerations.This one surprised me some. JACK BULL is a minor classic and immensely enjoyable. I very strongly recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good but Lacking","review":"If your looking for a realistic western than this is the best you can do. No epic bloodshed(as with spaghetti westerns)and no overly macho heroes(typical american westerns). This film is about and is based on a true story and its one of the only movies I know of that doesnt take its \\"artistic license\\" too far. This movie keeps its realistic edge while still managing to entertain. That being said, its also a sad movie that leaves you with an empty used feeling at the end. Watching a movie and feeling worse than you did when starting it is in my opinion the mark of a film that has too much of a downward slope. Anyways do not highly reccomend to anybody unless they want a realistic movie that will make you feel sad and used."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great one","review":"John Cusack plays a great part as a wronged cattleman who seeks justice but gets over the line.

A great story showing how someone fighting for what's \\"right\\" can be clearly in the wrong themselves. This movie, apart from having some cool western style shooting, explores this dichotomy and shows that there are no clear or easy answers. I think it would be excellent for children to see as it is nowhere near \\"Hollywood\\" in that this film shows that actions do have consequences and doesn't value the rights to life and possession cheaply. HBO really does get behind some terrific films!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Genuine, no bull","review":"The storyline and its presentation makes you wonder if this is the way the West really was. So believable. Excellent acting by John Cusack, John Goodman (I think this is one of his best roles)and L.Q.

This picture is worth seeing both for the historical value of the real West and for the fine acting abilities of these fine actors."},{"rating":"2","title":"John Cusack Western","review":"John Cusack always seems to play intriguing characters. In this movie he plays the lead character,John \\"Bull,\\" who is stubborn and proud. When a bullying rancher treats him badly, these characteristics lead John Bull into trouble. The movie has many good lessons, but I found it hard to watch at times as I didn't agree with the actions of the main character and wanted him to handle his problems differently.

Although Goodman was only in a part of the movie, he really took his part far and beyond, and made it his own.

It appears that the author is going to cover all of these topics, but all she did was compile a bunch of peoples stories about their struggles with cigarettes and put them all togother and call it a book. The stories are pretty lame too,at least the ones I read. Admittedly, I did not read the entire book-my urge to put this trash where it belonged was too strong.

Both would need some modification before I'd consider them hedgehog safe, but I can't count this against the rating. The little plastic plugs that go on the very top of the frame don't fit--though with a little encouragement from a hammer, who knows, it might work. I didn't think they were worth it, really. The wheels lock in the front and move decently well on carpet. It doesn't look like it will warp easily, which is a definite plus.However, the main reason I bought this cage was for the easy access through the front doors.

(Not counting the completely black image of black particles on a black background.)The US, Burma (or whatever they demand we call it this year) and Libya are the only places where such cryptic units as *slugs*, feet, pounds, mi/h and psi are used.If you think in Metric, like most of the world, you will be wondering why you wasted your money on this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Sinking Feeling","review":"Much of Mudville was cute and fun, and the author/Little League manager clearly loves his son. But I had to wonder about the kids on the team who didn't get a lot of playing time -- they didn't get much book time either. I also thought that the author got a little too hung up on winning. The whole thing made me wish that the author, instead plotting out winning lineups and agonizing over pitching rotations, just would have rotated the kids through every position and given them equal playing time. But that would have been too...fair?"},{"rating":"2","title":"User friendly!","review":"This book is the best intro to the subject that I've seen. The authors minimize the use of notation, mathematics and the like, and invoke the reader's intuition by developing some good, concrete examples. They present those examples as datasets (accessible on the web), as \\"run\\" regressions (i.e. with parameter estimates and standard errors), and graphically.They also demo how to \\"run\\" each of the examples on a PC, using the program MLn. If you don't use MLn (and I had never heard of it); this part of the book is less helpful. It would be great if, in an accompanying website perhaps, they were to demo the same analyses using other packages (e.g. SYSTAT, SAS and the like). But this book is really quite good, and a terrific addition to any applied social scientist's library."},{"rating":"2","title":"This book saved my life.","review":"I was at the end of my belief in myself as a writer; almost threw in the pencil. And then I read \\"Writing Past Dark\\", which gave me permission to admit that yes, it's hard, that yes, occasionally I was silenced and pinced by envy -- and best of all, the book helped me find my way back to my voice. I published a bestseller last year, thanks to B. Friedman's beneficent words."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not helpful","review":"I wanted to like this book. The ideas it explores are interesting, but in the end it disappoints. It is presented at least implicitly as self-help, but it offers no real help. A lot of metaphors (some quite striking) a moderately interesting account of the author's time at writing school at Iowa, all of it adding up to nothing in particular. I think the problem is the writer never breaks out of the jail cell of her own mind and her own ego. Other people in this book are not actual characters but subjects of anecdote, and for this reason they never fully come to life. Nor do the ideas discussed ever get past the stage of what it means to the writer. Not \\"the writer\\" in general, but the one writing this book.Two more practical books about writing I would recommend are Jane Smiley's 13 Ways of Looking at the Novel and On Becoming a Novelist by James Gardner."},{"rating":"2","title":"Inspired by just her language","review":"Friedman's writing made me drool. I was feeling writer's envy just reading her analogies and metaphors, then of course, she talks about writer's envy.I got this book from a creative writing instructor, and I doubt that that instructor knows what a legacy she's given me. From distraction, to --oh my goodness--writing about what's true, I found Friedman's words jabbing me in the ribs the way my husband does when he's trying to tell me, \\"See, See? That's true, isn't it?\\"Personally, I think that even if you don't get anything from the actual content of this book, you can get something from her style. Aside from her poetic language, she uses meaningful anectdotes that made my brain light up in agreement.Sometimes it's just really spiffy to know that all these weird psycological turmoils we go through as writers, or wannabe writers (that's what I am), aren't so uncommon after all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overindulgent and unfocused","review":"I finished this book a few days ago, and the only positive thing I can remember about it is the series of quotations from Cynthia Ozick's Writers at Work interview. I found this book vague, rambling, and filled with cloying \\"poetic\\" observations that made me want to scream and cover the page with red ink.A far, far superior book is Anne Lamott's modern classic _Bird By Bird_, not only for dealing with envy but for just about every other topic covered in _Writing Past Dark_. When I finished reading _Bird By Bird_ I wanted to kiss it; when I finished reading _Writing Past Dark_, I wanted to throw it across the room."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the price","review":"I was very disappointed with the Ironman Speed Jump Rope.

I find the articles very well chosen, most of them elicit a lot of discussion and the cultural topics are both varied and interesting, with enough detail to make the students ask questions and remember things. The discussion activities are also very creative. I also like its emphasis on vocabulary that causes problems to English speakers. However, if you are looking for a grammar book this is definitely not it. It does have a companion workbook that includes a grammar review and exercises."},{"rating":"1","title":"A good book, but without a defined purpose.","review":"Some books serve to improve grammar, others to improve reading comprehension, and yet others to teach spanish culture. This book, however tries to tackle so many different topics that it is not able to do any one of them very well. each chapter is divided into parts. many of the vocabulary words are things that a student at that level already ought to know. there is little taught about grammar in this book, however the workbook touches on some subjects, but only the easy ones. i would not recommend this book for a spanish class."},{"rating":"2","title":"Banzai Falls Splash Blast Lagoon","review":"My five and two year old love this waterslide.

Nothing else here is essential, although both Paul Davis's \\"I Go Crazy,\\" and Bob Welch's \\"Sentimental Lady\\" add a little pleasant counterweight to this otherwise disco heavy collection.

People thinking \\"I like smoked salmon\\" may be thrown by this product at first, but think \\"jerky!!\\" Very chewy: the larger pieces can give your jaw a good workout, and every once in awhile you hit a peppercorn which makes your eyes water (in a good way). Good salmon flavor. I would be a happy consumer except that I have run into moldy strips in two separate orders. Got the 8 pak, and on pak #6, almost the entire contents were fuzzy. An e-mail to the company got absolutely no response, but Amazon was kind enough to replace it in spite of it being a generally non-returnable item. Unfortunately, the replacement jerky also had a white fuzzy mold pocket in one pak. Not in every pak, but since you tend to chew jerky while busy doing something else (fishing, driving, whatever), it gave me the creeps knowing how little I looked at most of this stuff when shoving a strip \\"in between my cheek and gum.\\" Eat in good light and keep your eyes open."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful","review":"Most of the strip were either hard and brittle or so tough they could barely be chewed.

My husband hangs his heavy jeans and belts and tipping is not an issue. That said, we have not put coats on it, but it seems very sturdy. It was also simple to assemble.

Hanging two coats on one side, and one coat on another side will, depending on the accumulated weight for each side, lead to either a leaning tower effect, or a downright fall.The diameter of the four base legs is just too small to support anything else then a mostly centered distribution of items.

Terrible, although i know how to assemble it but i don't have accessories. just a bunch of iron bar!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"It doesn't stay together, it falls apart all the time. Not a good product.","review":"I put it together, and I keep putting it together, it doesn't stay in place. I don't recommend this product. I can't return it because I am a handicap person and I need someone to put it back in the box and take it to the post office.Another piece of garbage to put in the garage."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great product and worth the price.","review":"This was really easy to put together and looks great! Very sleek and modern with a tough finish. The base is a little wobbly but a little bending took care of that. The base and upright pole really need 3-4 screws in them to make it more stable but does fine with just the one. We've got 4 winter coats and a few hats on it now and it is standing tall and straight. Definitely worth the inexpensive price!UPDATE: I ended up drilling holes through the base plate and into the legs so I could put some additional screws in for better support after it developed a bit more of a wobble from continuous use. There's a plastic cover that goes over the plate and legs so the screws don't show at all. Less than ten minutes and it is extremely sturdy now."},{"rating":"2","title":"good for the money","review":"I bought this to use as somewhere to hang the towels when people get out of the pool. It works perfect for that, as it is metal. The only negative thing I have to say is that it is light and blows over easy. I solved this problem by attaching it to the towel rack with a bungee cord. Works great now."},{"rating":"1","title":"it wobbles!","review":"i was pleased with the price, but unfortunately the quality is not all that great...it wobbles! tried to fix it, but not possible."},{"rating":"1","title":"Extremely poor quality","review":"The rack arrived today Dec 14, 2012. We immediately assembled it according to the instructions.In the process of assembly we notice rusted parts from poor paint work and missing parts (leg cap-rubber).

Please donot I repeat donot waste your money on this piece of garbage. I put this thing together, and within a day it was falling apart, I'm a professional engineer so I am pretty handy with the tools, but this rack was definitely not made to hold coats, or anything with that held weight for that matter.I honestly wish i could give this a 0 rating."},{"rating":"1","title":"FREE SHIPPING IS A MISNOMER","review":"Even though the Amazon website advertises this item at $29.90 with free shipping, Amazon will not honor that price.

It's not. It's a discussion of a PR activity which supposedly brought attention to an environmental problem, namely silt. The gimmick was that some silt was used in the manufacture of pottery and some of the profits from the sale of the pottery were used in the silt removal project. Very cute but not very important and certainly not worthy of the title \\"property rights case\\".

My criticism is very subjective, because this music was etched to my soul during the teens and is still holding its place. But on the other side, it went through that sieve."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sammy's the man!","review":"I've had this album on record for several years and finally found it on CD. This is Sammy at his intimate best. Most only think of Sammy as a glitzy Rat Packer. If you like quiet ballads - the old standards - you should find this CD a real treat. Laurindo Almeida nicely complements with thoughtful interludes.I've heard these songs hundreds of times by many different singers and groups. But I think of many of these renditions as the standard others must live up to.

I love these and will use them until my kids are well old enough to handle a juice box on their own with no spills!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Truly is Mommy's Helper","review":"My daughter (2 yr 1 mo) typically has the 4.23 oz juice boxes. They fit in nicely, the top of the juice sits just below the top of the box and the straw is exposed enough for easy drinking. We bring this box with us in case of a juice box being served when we are out and about. The box fits the pouches and bigger juice boxes as well. Her shirts stay dry and I don't have to follow behind her with a paper towel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Broke within a week","review":"Had it for less than a week and it had a crack in it already. Not even worth the few dollars it was. My daughter used it one time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Picture of Product is Deceiving","review":"Like others, I expected to get three juice box holders. I was surprised to only get one in my order when there was no mention of quantity, only the picture to show what you were ordering. I kept the juice box holder, because honestly, it does work great. My two-year-old has had zero spills or accidental squeezes when using his holder. I would recommend the product, but be aware of the quantity issue."},{"rating":"1","title":"You only get one.. not three","review":"I usually always read the review, this one time i didn't since I was in a hurry. Not doing so has come back to haunt me.. The picture of the item show 3 so you would think it is a three pack. NOPE you are paying for one. Once you include shipping, it is a expensive piece of plastic."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a good value","review":"I was very dissappointed when the product arrived. It does look like you get 3 holders and that is what I thought I was buying. It should only show one and then state in the description that there are assorted colors. Never again!!!!!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"misrepresentation of product","review":"It appears like you are getting three holders from the photo. You only get one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Juicy Box Holder","review":"So yeah like everyone else I assumed you got three in a pack. Just so you all know you can get a pack of three at walmart.com for 5.94 (and ship it to the store for free)!!! Except for the deceiving ad this is a great product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not serving the purpose","review":"I read the other reviews over and over before I made this purchase and I should have followed my initial instinct to not buy it. The problem that I have is that there is not a single juice box that fits into it fully and when using juice pouches (like capri suns) as soon as my son takes a few sips, he's still able to take the pouch out and make a mess. I guess I need something with a lid opposed to this open design."},{"rating":"1","title":"Useless","review":"I really wanted to like this product, because I needed it, but - to be blunt - it sucks. I had 3 different types of juice pouches and boxes and it didn't fit any of them correctly, plus, my daughter could squeeze them anyway, defeating the whole purpose (she was only 18 months at the time!). Also, she just turned it upside down and they would fall right out. I used a rubber bad to hold the boxes in, but that did nothing to address the squeezing issue. So into the donation box it went."},{"rating":"2","title":"No more wet clothes!","review":"Love giving my kids juice boxes when we're out and about - don't love them squeezing the juice all over themselves and their car seat. This totally did the trick and saved the day. I have 4 of them and keep them everywhere, just in case. They make it way easier for little hands to enjoy their drink. I'm not sure what someone was complaining about with them chipping, etc. I've had mine for ages and throw them in the dishwasher and they don't have a mark. Don't throw it off a cliff and it should be fine! For $2 you can't beat it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Simple and great","review":"These solved the problem perfectly. Our child uses them instead of squeezing the juice box and squirting all over. Highly recommend."},{"rating":"2","title":"A little big, but better than a spilled juice box","review":"I bought this in the hopes that my daughter would drink out of it without squeezing it so all the juice flys out all over the place. Unfortunately, the box is a little big for most juice boxes so she sees that there is room on either side to pull the box out and do just that with it....squeeze the juice everywhere. I do like this item and I'm glad that I bought it, I just wish it fit the juice box a little better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Item!","review":"This fits capri suns. I found that juice boxes can encompass different sizes, but I use this for the pouch drinks. They can't squeeze the juice all over them anymore! I love it and bought one for a friend."},{"rating":"1","title":"not a good value","review":"Because of the description \\"assorted colors\\" I was a little surprised when only one showed up. When I called to verify the quantity was correct, after the phone at Baby's Gallerie was answered by a simple hello, no identification, the response to my question was \\"for $2.97?\\" I was only asking a question not looking to be insulted. The plastic is thin and only fits the small juice boxes and not juice pouches. Too bad it was only $2.97 because it wasn't worth shipping back for a refund."},{"rating":"1","title":"READ DESCRIPTION CAREFULLY YOU WILL RECEIVE ONE JUICE BOX!","review":"Works ok for drinks. Would be nice if it had a little strap of some kind attached over the top to keep child from pulling the box out. Read the description as the picture is deceiving, you will receive ONLY ONE JUICE BOX. They can be bought for less at other stores."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor quality","review":"I purchased 2 of these last week and even at $2.00 each I paid too much for them. The plastic chips very easily and the design is very plain. It certainly did not fit many different types of juices. The really small juices fit but rattle around in there. The Motts juices don't fit in there. And even juice pouches are a tight fit."},{"rating":"1","title":"DOES NOT fit Juicy Juice juice boxes.","review":"This does not fit the tall or short Juicy Juice juice boxes. I'm very disappointed and feel I have wasted money on this. Its big and looks like it'll only fit a carpri sun or drink in pouch, not any of the juice boxes that the description claims it fits!"},{"rating":"1","title":"okay product","review":"I thought this product would work better but my 22 month old just takes the juice box out of it defeating the whole purpose of it. Also, it is a bit on the large size so it works only with the really big juice boxes. I only buy the 4 ounce juice boxes and this container is too big for it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Outstanding Ethernet Coaxial Cable","review":"This thin and very handy 25 ft. coaxial cable is ideal for a long range network between rooms.

This book, a compilation of multiple authors, is left wing extremism to the ninth degree. You can not get more liberal ideology than this. Everyone from Republican House Majority Leader Tom DeLay to Dr. James Dobson (Focus On The Family) is referred to as \\"a right wing radical\\". The formers crime no doubt is his support for Israel. The latter is guilty, of all things, being pro-family. His family values message is actually compared to Taliban-like mind control of children. One gets the impression that there is not a Republican and/or Conservative alive that could avoid the right wing label from these authors. If you are a person with a moderate philosophy, this book will be a complete turn-off."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very 'Michael Moore'","review":"I found this book to be based more on emotion than fact. The facts that were used were blown way out of proportion and context. While it is always healthy to look at both sides of the coin - politics included - this book would never give a fair representation of the fundamentalist side, because it is so focused on presenting the conservative view from a Gestapo perspective."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lies and bad arguments","review":"I have a Ph.D studying the Christian right and this is the worst book on Fundamentalism and the Christian Right that I have ever seen. What is not outright lies are \\"straw men\\" arguments meant to make anyone who believes in Christianity look like an idiot. I feel bad for the people who gave it a good review, they have been duped by the authors who are not arguing a case or explaining the Christian Right, they are feeding propoganda for their own side. I was given a free copy of this book and after reading it, I threw it in the trash instead of donating it to a library, it is that bad. Be sure to know something about the author of a book before you buy it, especially on a controversial topics like this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Talk about hate..............","review":"What a bunch of hypocrits.This is a radical left-wing hate book. If you are a Hollywierdo, alcoholic, drug addict, socialist, communist, (...), then you will love this book. In other words, this book is for anyone who loves their sin and doesn't want God in their life. Understandable, why would anyone who chooses to destroy their own life want to hear someone preach against it? According to this book anyone who believes in God, Jesus, religion, faith, decency, and clean living is a \\"fundamentalist\\". Which group do you belong to? Whoops, does that makes me a fundamentalist? Well, I'm not. Being a conservative Chrisitian is not necessarily being a fundamentalist.This is nothing but a hate book, which is typical of the new American left that has taken over the Democratic party."},{"rating":"1","title":"surprised","review":"I was surprised to see that my grandmother, who has never spoken ill of anyone under any circumstance, who saw only the good in everyone she met and would give the shirt off her back when she had nothing to give, was completely villified by this book... because she is a christian. I dont think i have ever been more pushed towards christianity than by reading this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book - shame about the amateurish production","review":"An excellent, timely and necessary study somewhat let down by idiosyncratic copyediting and sloppy typesetting. Books like this need to be more professionally put together to be taken seriously by their opponents. But don't let that put you off - it's a highly valuable resource, authoritatively and for the most part sensibly written, which deserves a much larger audience than it's likely to find."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome, but not for the layman.","review":"This book taps into the possible threat of the ultra-religious, espescially here in America. Although it'd take several years or even decades for them to suceed, the idea is just as horrifying. Most of this is political, but it can almost be rated as a 'conspiracy theory'. To the experienced political or extremist nonbeliever (mostly non-christian), this would be a great book; to the layman, a little too far."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good intro to the extreme religious mindset","review":"While it's not news that the superstitious right wing is scary, this book is nonetheless entertaining because chronicles several examples of the lunacy and destructiveness of that movement.

This book is different from any other meditation book I have ever read. The author is smart enough to realize that the trappings are unnecessary. He also presents a new side to meditation by explaining that meditation is a wonderfully sensual experience to be enjoyed for its own sake. I like this book a lot. I have been reading it a few pages at a time and enjoying it very much. If you are looking for a book on how to meditate which is very friendly to Westerners and the non-religious, this is very good."},{"rating":"2","title":"ProGrade 82069 FastBack Utility Knife ProGrade 82069 FastBack Utility Knife","review":"This knife is really good quality, reliable, comfortable, easy blade switch.

What a difference working with a sharp blade."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Knife!","review":"I have bought a half-dozen utility knives from local big box retailers, and they have all worked (lets be real, its a knife) but suffered some mechanical or assembly failure in what felt like a relatively short time span. I added this ProGrade utility knife onto a larger order because the price was right and the reviews were positive.Over one month later and with a heavy amount of use the knife is still going strong. The blade locks into several useful positions and the knife body feels comfortable in your hand. It even has a nice 'bump' to protect your finger from the blade area. Swapping the blades is a snap - just load more in the door. The door is a little flimsy and someday it may need some tape to stay shut, but I have had no issues.This knife is a great deal. I've recommended it to friends and I would recommend it to you!"},{"rating":"2","title":"a very nice U-knife","review":"When I received my ProGrade, I was surprised by its design.

Recently, as I was about to move countries to one that would be enroute from China to Jerusalem, I took a greater interest and decided I needed to have more information.This little book does an excellent job of giving the history of the movement through the testimonies of Chinese Christians. Just a few weeks ago I witnessed the public commitment of western missions leaders to help the Chinese church fulfill this call of God- The time for this thing to really move forward has come. I think anyone interested in missions in Asia would find this book helpful in understanding what God is doing right now, and will also be inspired by the stories of what God has brought the Chinese church through to prepare them for this great work."},{"rating":"2","title":"Chinese Evangelist to the Middle East","review":"The Chinese Christian feels a positive calling to take the Good News to the 10/40 countries of the Middle East made up predominately of Muslims, Budhist, and other religions.

It touches a little on CSS, a little on PHP/mysql, a little on design in general, etc It just sounds like the four authors didn't coordinate well.If you are an advanced user, this book may be good in finding out how to do certain functionalities easier with dreamweaver, but still too much writing to read for that use.

I like it because it is consonant with my philosophy that often, law is too slow and direct revenge is therefore is not always unjustifiable. In Osaka, members of Kurosawa kai, a Japanese mafia group, are being slaughtered. According to the police investigation, the victims were cut in half by a sharp sword and it is obvious that these homicides have been committed by a professional. One of the officers of Kurosawa Kai, Aramaki, seeks to catch the killer: however, the number of victims rises. Clues start to come to the forefront during this investigation which raises suspicions that these are vengeful crimes by 'sekiryu' (the red dragon). One woman stands up against Aramaki who comprehends the truth."},{"rating":"1","title":"Movie is a waste of time and money.","review":"This review is for the movie \\"The Legend of Red Dragon\\".As the review by Christopher Beaumont \\"draven993\\" states, Amazon shows the artwork for \\"The Legend of Red Dragon\\", but has the product details for a different movie with a similar title. \\"Legend of the Red Dragon\\".The artwork shown is for a movie starring Yu Misaki, and does not have Jet Li.The product details are for a different movie that does not have Yu Misaki, but does have Jet Li.The plot of The Legend of Red Dragon is simplistic, about a young girl who grows up to take vengeance on her father's killers. She uses a sword to kill. The subtitles are stupid, the type of dialog I remember from the 1970s Hong Kong chop socky movies. The acting is strictly amateur hour.

Unlike most fans who prefer his earlier music I am a fan of his later stuff which I find slightly more Poppy and more accessible. He really hits his straps on his slower tunes like \\"If Time Permits\\" which sounds like the Thorns to me. Funny that since he\`s in the Thorns. Some of his Power Pop riffs are good too but unkind in terms of categorising an artist who shouldn\`t be categorised. If you are a fan of \`90\`s Power Pop or slightly alternative rock or alt. country check out this example of Matthew Sweet. All his good tunes like \\"Girlfriend, Devil with the Green Eyes\\" are here from his earlier period. This is the best way to get into his thing."},{"rating":"2","title":"In a word.......Sweet!","review":"This was a very pleasant suprise. I often had the idea that the pop/rock of \\"Matthew Sweet\\" was something I would like, but it wasn't until I got this cd that I realized how good he is. Of course I knew \\"Girlfriend\\" and \\"Sick of Myself\\", but after my first listen, I found out that I also knew \\"I've been Waiting\\", \\"Time Capsule\\", and the awesome \\"Where you get Love\\". Plus the songs I hadn't heard, I now enjoy just as much. I'm really glad I got \\"Time Capsule\\". It's perfect for the casual fan, and will make your cd collection just that much more \\"Sweet\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"rock","review":"Dc101 used to play \\"sick of myself\\" all the time when i was about 9 years old and they (like most radio stations do) played it so much i stopped even noticing it.

He has never put together a complete album but is a good songwriter. Why a greatest hits cd? Greatest Hits cds are usually reserved for washed up artists and a chance for a record company to cash in. Who buys these things? Greatest hits CDs always fail to include less popular great songs. They are impossible to make. Buy the individual albums instead.

I thought that this may fit the bill. In the photos, it shines, and the scale is slightly ambiguous.When it arrived, it was dingy and smaller than I expected.

I had it on my wish list because we are expecting our first baby and thought the 3 stones were a nice symbol of our little family. The heart is smaller than I expected, although that is fine with me. I prefer more delicate jewelry. However, the chain is very thin and I had to switch it out with one I already had. I couldn't work the clasp myself it is so small. Overall very happy with it so far."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great pendant, chain a bit too thin","review":"My wife has refined taste in gold and diamond jewellery. So I was a bit concerned if she would like this item in Sterling Silver (which is what I ordered). To my relief, she loved it and has been wearing it since.

Trane knew how to pace himself and make his solo's interesting. This is just plain irritating. Every solo ends up the same. Every song is the same. After a while it grinds you down just as 'live in Newport' did for those brought up on 'village vanguard' by Trane (the first one with 'chasing' on it) If you like your sax playing frenzied be my guest but for me this is just a parody and a bad one at that. He isn't even that good to be honest. Try the Branford Marsalis 'love supreme' dvd to see Coltrane done properly. More light and shade please!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Punk /Hippie Jam Collision: With Great Results","review":"This album, an originally double vinyl set but here on one disc, is a wonderful example of instrumental only punk experimentalism. That is, primarily punk musicians pushing the boundaries of what their music could be, without the constraints of words, into multifarious styles or jams of impressive execution. One could say that this album is treading the line between the aesthetics of hippies & punkers.From Greg Ginn's inside-out Deep Purple riffs with Black Flag/Gone to the scenic Cali-jams of Pell Mell, Paper Bag, Lawndale, & the Alter-natives to the NYC art-damage scene via Renaldo, Sharp, & Kaiser to the free jazz crescendos of Universal Congress Of--this album blew my mind when it first came out, & still does.With modern instrumental bands like Mogwai & godspeed you! black emperor still holding to the spirit of punk, no matter where they stylistically go with their music, makes me realize that such an attitude, perhaps, started here. . . ."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good Car Charger, Poor Battery","review":"I mainly bought this item for the car charger as my last one broke.

The featured stars playing Harrison's two wives also perform admirably. Those of us who saw the film when it first came out and occasionally thereafter, may find it not quite as fresh-sounding as when first issued, particularly in light of the frequent television and film versions of ghost-returning comedies, but the freshness of the Coward variation still retains its ability to entertain.I should recommend it to almost all ages which have achieved the ability to understand speech."},{"rating":"2","title":"classic at it's best!","review":"THIS MOVIE IS SOMETHING i fell love with after we did the play in drama class.

Harrison is neatly cast as the hag-ridden husband, Cummings is particularly charming as the terse second wife, and Dame Margaret Rutherford steals the show as the slightly dotty medium who conjures up the ghost of Harrison's first wife and then can't get rid of her. Fans of cool English comedy will enjoy it considerably; others, however, may find it all a bit too restrained for their tastes."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a shame!

But beware, the colors are either washed out, too yellow or too green, and the sound is very poor (despite the Dolby Digital Mono) and most of the dialogue is practically incomprehensible. The quality of this DVD is in fact so poor that it is completely distracting, such that you spend more time struggling to imagine what the film would look and sound like in the right version than enjoying what it is."},{"rating":"2","title":"VERY WITTY AND SOPHISTICATED","review":"This film is great fun to watch. Rex Harrison and Constance Cummings are the married couple and Kay Hammond is the ghost of Harrison's ex who wreaks havoc in their home. Margaret Rutherford is much younger than we usually see her but blissfully her fey self as Madame Arcati. Rutherford is very funny and a real scene stealer.

For those not familiar with their sound, he's reminiscent of The Psychedelic Fur's Richard Butler, but even grittier. Their sound, although rooted in typical 80s production, is more acoustic, stripped down and certainly melancholy.Their is certainly plenty going on with layers of chiming guitars and a solid rhythm section but it's the moody sadness that grabs the attention. \\"So Much Here\\" and \\"Wish You Were Here\\" are the standout tracks for me with their lilting melodies while \\" One Minute\\" and \\"Don't Drive the Hope From My Heart\\" could have easily been part of MTV'scanon of classic 80s rock."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Read","review":"This was a great read, and a wonderful insight into Asia's greed.

We bought the Marvelous Day CD then, and listened to it EVERY SINGLE DAY until this summer, when we saw him again at Wolftrap and bought the new DVD. For several months after that, she asked to watch the DVD EVERY SINGLE DAY. If you can believe it, she asks for SteveSongs over the Wiggles all the time now. She loved meeting Steve this summer when he signed her new DVD. Whenever we see him on PBS now, she quickly points out that \\"Evie rhymes with Stevie\\", which is the note he wrote on her DVD. The DVD/CD is excellent and I highly recommend it. Even better, though, is to catch Steve at a live show. Beware, however, that you will end up with SteveSongs going through your head non-stop.

Little attempt is made to repeat vocabulary, so I find myself needing to look up almost every word in every sentence. The appendix with grammatical forms is very thin, lacking such basic entries as personal pronouns, definite articles, and adjectives. This leads to constant thumbing back through chapters to find where something was first introduced. But perhaps the worst flaw is that the reading consists mainly of single, isolated sentences. I often find that I can't understand a sentence even when I've gotten all of the vocabulary and grammar correct, because there's no context for the meaning."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good for a Gag, Literally.","review":"This piece is one of the worst I have ever had the unfortunate task of reviewing.

This book goes a long way to help the average guy figure out all the feelings that go with breaking-up, divorce and death. Although there are parts of the book that are a little \\"touchy-feely\\", I would encourage someone to stick with it and finish. The section on the differences of breaking up between women and men is great. It helped me to understand I wasn't crazy and that there are right and wrong ways to approach loss. I'd recommend it to anybody who needs a little help to get over the hump of losing someone they love."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good for Divorces not Deaths","review":"This book starts out encompassing and addressing the different losses we can suffer breaking up, divorce and death of a spouse. The grieving portion of this book although small is quite good in addressing the process of grieving and healing.For me I was looking for a book that addressed the issue of starting over again after the loss of a spouse. This book DOES NOT address this issue. The starting over portion of the book,which is 75%, is directed at break ups or divorces. It talks about taking and accepting blame for the break up or divorce. There is no mention at all about starting over after the death of a spouse.If you are coming out of a divorce or a break up this would be a good book. If your wife or husband died I would not recommend this book. There are better books on the market that address this type of loss."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book is not only stupid and sexist, but dangerous","review":"I too would love to give this book a negative star. During my worst times, my work is what has helped pull me through and my on-going friendships, certainly not going out and scoping out a new warm-body. He recommends that men have sex with as many women as possible, without commitment, while women should date as many men as possible without sex. Has this guy ever heard of AIDS? Honestly, how many women are going to have sex with a guy whose main goal is to use them to help \\"recover\\". The reason why the man is divorced probably has everything to do with his inability to deal with emotional issues,............................ Furthermore, it places the responsibility for sex in the woman's lap, like always, and promotes objectification. What a bunch of garbage. What is the name of his next book going to be after he gets divorced again? Mars and Venus Starting Over, and Over, and Over."},{"rating":"1","title":"More sexist blather","review":"Another condescending book from John Gray, who seems sometimes to be stuck in the 1950's. With most women working outside of the home these days, he fails to address how a woman's intellectual interests may help her to heal. I understand his point about being careful not to deny your own needs by focusing too much on the needs of others. But how come it's OK for a man to concentrate on his work in order to heal, but not OK for a woman? Not all of we women are whimpering crybabies, and emotional fulfillment comes in many forms."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your Money","review":"I thot the original Venus & Mars book insightful, but I think Gray is riding his own wave with this one. It's a -lot- of padding around a very few (and retreaded) ideas. Nutshell: (1) After a divorce/wife's death, men remarry too quickly, usually within 6-12 months. Mistake. (2) Especially after a divorce, women tend to shy away from relationships, perhaps for years. Unfortunate. (3) This is the nugget I took away from this book (which is why you should save your money!): **Don't get into a relationship until you don't need one.** If you haven't read the original book, get that one, but don't bother with this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"I ordered on 11-29","review":"I still have not received my order as of Nov 29.

I recommend it to anyone who is either going through a break up or a loss. It really helps to get in touch with all of your emotions - especially anger (which is sometimes very difficult to reach) - and get through the situation. I think I would have stumbled along aimlessly much longer had it not been for this book. I was able to let go of so much guilt, anger and sorrow. That was several years ago, and now the entire incident is behind me. If you need some help getting through something painful, please read this book - also get some professional help if you can - but definitely read this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not helpful","review":"If I could give less than 1 star I would.

Boriosi certainly knows his way around our psyches, but he manages to keep it simple enough so that the average person can understand where he's coming from. As I read his wonderful examples and analyses of real life incidents, I found myself saying, \\"I was a psych major, so why didn't I ever think of that?\\" Knowing why you do what you do becomes child's play when the good doctor explains it with very obvious affection for his audience. What's more, he does it without using jargon. The man doesn't have a patronizing bone in his body it seems. What he does have is something you can't learn in school--Wisdom.

This was the first CD of his I bought several years ago, and at first I was a little disappointed it only included two really familiar GMO songs that you would expect to hear, A String of Pearls and In the Mood. However, I've really grown to love this CD since many tunes (such as Little Brown Jug and Pennsylvania 6-5000) are great songs but are played all the time and many of the band's other great songs are overlooked.

What could be worse than having your child stolen from you and there being absolutely nothing you can do about it. I felt a real anger that only progressed as the book went on. Kertzer brings forth the pain of Edgardo's father as he tries in vain to save his son. There is no excuse for what happened to Edgardo, but his was not a solitary or isolated story. It is important for people to know that this happened, jews, catholics, everyone. I highly reccomend this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Elian Gonzalez case of the 19th Century","review":"If you want to understand the attitudes behind the Elian Gonzalez case, you can do no better than to read this book. Today as I'm reading the newspaper, I feel like I'm reading this book all over again. It is uncanny how similar are the attitudes of many American authorities toward Cuba (especially the Republicans in Congress) to the attitudes of the Catholic Church and the public toward the Jews. One reason the Church was able to get away with kidnapping Edgardo Mortara was that many people could not understand why a family would want to remain Jewish--just as people today cannot understand or accept as legitimate that Elian's family wants to remain in Cuba."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent","review":"With an appreciation of the fact that \\"the victors write the history,\\" this author has taken the story of the \\"rescue\\" of the Mortara boy from his Jewish family by the Inquistion and turned it into a riveting chapter in world history and shows it as an example of world diplomacy in the 1850's.

The Catholic/Canon laws instituted by the Pope et al and the Catholic church was appalling and painful to read. However, this is a true story with serious research and insight into the power of the church at that time. It is a powerful read.

The images are very basic with a hand outline and the colored lines drawn on to that outline. It teaches you the basics (i.e. finger names, mounts, and basic lines) but pretty much ends there.

The product comes with 0.25-inch and 0.125-inch jacks for your Home-Stereo and also for your CD/Cassette. The 0.25-in. jack fits into the top of 0.125-in jack with easy changing capability. The sound quality is decent and I think it¡s worth the purchase within its price range because I10 stereo phone was the cheapest item I found among all other stereo phones.

Third woman is a young mother, immigrant from Phillipinnes, trying to make ends meet in a country where she knows no one and speaks no language.All three of them have their own destiny, but what they do have in common is that they are facing their internal fear. They are all strong women but detached from the world: emotially and physically.

He doesn't let Xerox off easy by any means--in fact his treatment of Xerox's role has much more credibility than anything else I've seen, because it is so three-dimensional.

The main problem is the author's refusal to allow the loss of a ship (and the main character's assignment to another ship). The story starts with an improbable, larger-than-life, rescue of the ship from where it was beached at the end of the previous novel. Making things too larger-than-life detracts from an otherwise good story. It is a good account of the creation of a fledgling navy. The politics described were a continuing problem for the young U.S. Navy for a long period of time, e.g., the appointment of officers based on connections rather than ability."},{"rating":"2","title":"Trilogy recommended by a Patrick O'Brien fan","review":"Nelson is not Patrick O'Brien, but close enough.

His short stories take you through his life in New York City, back to Poland, and far back to the villages of his ancestors. It's a world of the occult, imps around every corner, and religeon as a part of daily life.Reading his stories is like getting grandfather's tales about the old country. A little bit spooky, a little bit comforting, and quite a bit nostalgic.Although Jews will probably understand more of the historical references, the stories are well written enough for a broad audience. Perhaps this reader's only regret is not being able to read them in their original Yiddish.

I think that the philosophic re-enactman of Wiggenstein's philosophical thoughts, and the analysis of skepticism as a theme of tragedy of the doubting self may elude the non-philosophic reader, but once the reader gets it, it is worth these few hundreds of pages."},{"rating":"1","title":"Guaranteed to collect dust","review":"Whenever the first sentence of any book--Faulkner excluded--exceeds 200 words, you know you're going to suffer, and suffer I did.

The lego structure simply will not be sturdy enough without it. I wish more of these baseplates were included in lego sets, because it seems silly to have to buy this piece separately. It would be better if the baseplate were a bit thicker so that it would not bend even slightly under pressure. That would make it easier to move a work-in-progress."},{"rating":"2","title":"Essential, but not without flaws","review":"These baseplates are important if your little one likes to build structures with Legos. I'd recommend attaching them to a board (I wood-glued 6 of them to a board, added some molding, and put sliders underneath so I could store the board under beds or sofas) so they won't flex.Otherwise, you'll definitely need to encourage your child to play with these on a table or other hard surface, and warn them that moving their constructions to another spot might result in the creations coming apart."},{"rating":"1","title":"WASTE OF MONEY!!!","review":"I paid over $7 for this thing, bought it thinking it was going to be bigger than the ones that come with the set, and then I get it and it is tiny! you can get a much better deal on the extra large ones at lego.com"},{"rating":"1","title":"Showing the pictures as if there are things more.","review":"It is more expensive than lego shop.

BUT - they are not the typical Lego quality, not the rigid plate I have seen before. They are too thin to support even a small structure, unless it was unmoved after building; but that is the point of the base. They are frustrating for kids to use. They are either a knock-off or they are not Lego; I will have to investigate. Has anyone checked the current Lego brand bases; are they all this thin and flexible? Are there any other brands that would work and be rigid?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Obsolete, saturated roller, dont buy","review":"I though since my Blue was low I would buy this one.

We, that is, the students of a noted college in Illinois have to use this book in our Advance Web-Designing class and I can say this for the entire class \\"we have sought out and found other sources to learn from\\".

Unfortunately it did not live up to my standards. The premise was an interesting one but I felt that there could have been more written and that the characters should not have torn the plots apart at the end. That really ruined the stories for me. I hope her next book is back to her usual style of suspense and romance."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is Ms. Michaels' worse book to date!!","review":"Ths premise for this book is very clever; unfortunately the tellling of the stories does not live up to the author's usual abilities.

Don't waste your money!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Dissapointed!","review":"I had waited sooo long for this novel to come out, and when its all been read and done, it was bad. boring and slow, with no intrest at all the novel just never hit it off.

After she has written so many excellent books I don't intend to give up on her, but I really hope her next book is nothing like this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"The worst book she's ever written","review":"I've been a Barbara Michzaels fan for 30 years, since Ammie, Come Home, and her last two books, the Dancing Floor and this one were really quite poor. The Dancing Floor had a couple clever spots--this one sounded good but left me flat. It wasn't the hypothetical gathering--it was the lack of focus. Unfortunately in her alter ego of Elizabeth Peters, our author has fallen so in love with the character of Amelia Peabody that she just can't bear to write anything else. And Barbara/Elizabeth is not a young woman--I'm sure she's hurrying to get through the interminable Amelia saga before she dies. But the rest of her work has suffered greatly and her latest Barbara Michaels titles have just not held up the the standards she set in good stories like Here I Stay."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointed","review":"I can't even describe how disappointed I was by this book. I love Michaels' other books - I own them all, but this was a disaster. It didn't even appear to have been edited - throughout the second story, the name of one character is constantly switching between Harry and Henry, sometimes on the same page. Overall, it was not chilling or witty like her other books. The writing seemed flat, which surprised me since all of her other books are wonderful reads."},{"rating":"1","title":"If I could have clicked 0 stars on this one, I would have.","review":"I am a devoted fan of Barbara Michaels and have read and enjoyed every book she has ever written. I bought this book based on her name alone which I am sure the publishers were banking on because it turned out to be a sore disappointment. You can be sure that I will no longer just buy her next book but will check it to be sure it is worth my time. Shame on the publishers and Barbara Michaels for pulling a fast one over on us, her fans."},{"rating":"1","title":"different isn't always good","review":"While I admire Barbara Michael's attempt at something different, this is not a good example of her work which is normally full of good humor even during the worst of situations. This book is unresolved and more of a scholarly tretis. But thanks for all your other books. They are deeply appreciated and enjoyed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Me, too: disappointing offering from a fav author","review":"I have read all her works as Michaels or Elizabeth Peters and this is very poor, indeed. There are several others (Someone in the House, The Black Rainbow, The Copenhagen Connection) that also bomb, and I wonder what happened. Can't believe these are from the woman who has created and sustained Amelia Peabody & Co. for 20 years. I'll just pre-order The Falcon at the Portal and hope this book is a burp in an otherwise terrific body of work."},{"rating":"1","title":"I truly believed she didn't have a bad book in her!!!!","review":"Like all of the other reviewers, I have been a Barbara Michaels, Elizabeth Peters, Barbara Mertz fan since the terrifying days of Ammie Come Home and the truly hilarious Devil May Care. I wait with baited breath for the next Michaels/Peters offering and have met the author several times. I even have my 12 year old daughter hooked on Amelia! What happened? After reading a brief synposis of the plot, thank goodness I didn't buy this but patiently waited the two months to get it from the library. Summed up? Don't bother."},{"rating":"1","title":"I couldn't believe how disappointing it was.","review":"As a long-time admirer of Michaels/Peters, I always greet a new work by this author with great enthusiasm. When the librarian checked it out to me, she shook her head and said, *This one is 'different'* In this case that meant it was a disappointment! I have adored every Amelia Peabody tale and I consider *Ammie, Come Home* one of the most chilling stories I have ever read. I have to agree with others that the first-time readers of Michaels shouldn't judge her talents on the basis of this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Michaels has disappointed this fan.","review":"Barbara Michaels is one of my favorite authors--I have read all her books, own most of them, and this is the first time I have been disappointed in her choice of stories. The 'mens' club' meeting of imaginary ghost busters is just plain boring. Most ghost story readers are already familiar with the tale of the Bell Witch, and by the time I got thru this and started on the various opinions, I had had enough. I must admit that I didn't get to the second story--I just gave up , and it is seldom that I don't finish a book. Come on, Barbara, go back to the romantic suspense your readers have come to expect and enjoy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not up to Ms. Michaels usual standards","review":"I have all of Ms. Michaels books whether she is writing as Barbara Michaels or Elizabeth Peters, and yes, I even have a serious one that she wrote under her given name Mertz. I waited impatiently for this book to come out and bought it just as soon as it hit the stands. I was extremely disappointed in this book. I hope new readers do not pick this book to start with. Ms. Michaels is a wonderful writer but all I could think of when I read this book was \\"Barbara, Barbara, Barbara, what happened?\\" This will not stop me from buying any new books Ms. Michaels should write. After all the wonderful books she has written and the hours of joy I have received from them one disappointment is nothing to fret over. While I was unhappy with \\"Other Worlds\\" I would like to say Thank You for all the other wonderful books you have written. I believe I am your biggest fan and still love you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horribly disappointing","review":"I have read all the Barbara Michaels-Elizabeth Peters books, most of them several times. Also I live within ten miles of Adams, Tennessee, where the Bell Witch hauntings took place. Needless to say, I was excited when I heard the subject of her latest book. After reading it, I tend to wonder if she even wrote it, it was so bad. I'd rather believe that than believe she wrote something this awful. I'll buy her next one, but I'll pick it up and examine it first instead of grabbing it ecstatically off the shelf."},{"rating":"1","title":"What happened?","review":"I'm a long-time fan of Barbara Michaels/Elizabeth Peters, and have gotten to where I'll buy her new books sight unseen, because they're always so fabulous. When I read this one, however, I was sadly disappointed. The case histories were interesting enough, but there was no conclusion, no drama, nothing. It just left you hanging in the air and feeling horribly dissatisfied. Usually when I finish one of her books I'm panting for the next one, yet satisfied with the conclusion. Not this time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Barbara -- what happened???","review":"I have read every Barbara Michaels book ever written, including her incarnation as Elizabeth Peters. I have loved each and every one! This book doesn't even seem to be her writing style. I was actually bored, and read to the end only because I just kept hoping to see the old Barbara Michaels take over. I never did. I don't know what happened, but I want the old Barbara back!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I can't believe she wrote this poorly","review":"This book was very disappointing, especially since I had waited so long for another Michaels' novel. I didn't mind the change in genres, but these stories didn't give me the chills the way all her others have. Not even one tiny goosebump. In addition, the second story was poorly edited, with the name of the little boy switching back and forth from Harry to Henry, sometimes even on the same page. I can't believe someone would recommend this book when such a distracting and confusing mistake pops up again and again. I couldn't bear to give it only one star, since I feel so loyal, but in my heart I know that I really think it deserved no star. Try one of her other books - you'll be much more pleased."},{"rating":"2","title":"A comment","review":"Although published in the 1970s and long out-of-print this book is very enjoyable. It is a broad overview of the world of Gilbert & Sullivan, with emphasis shared on the works and lives of these remarkable men. Scores of photographs and sketches detail their theatrical era and the author avoids any kind of musical analysis. The book seems aimed at the layman (like myself) who wants all the major points of this Victorian phenomenon."},{"rating":"2","title":"He just keeps getting better and better","review":"The latest author just keeps getting better and better.I was waiting impatiently for this latest novel after the events of #122 and was not disappointed.The return of old characters plus the introduction of new ones make this book a delight.Especially good is the development of Remo's character at long last.Enjoy 5******"},{"rating":"2","title":"Really Good Read","review":"This is the first book I have read by this author. This book put me through a lot emotions. Happy, sadness, frustration. Through it all I really enjoyed it. Would definitely recommend."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely Glorious!","review":"I've been a fan of Deadsy for a good while now, growing to adore all their downloadable bootlegs and previous promos. Naturally, I was excited when I heard \\"Commencement\\" was ACTUALLY going to be released. I waited impatiently for the release, and snatched it up ASAP. I was not disappointed. This incredible band was even better on a real album. The production is flawless, each seperate recording track amazingly clear, and the songs are breath-taking. This album is definitely reccomended. Highlights are: \\"Key To Grammercy Park\\" (their most guitar-oriented piece and most easily accesible), \\"Mansion World\\" (the layered vocals on this sound great), and \\"Cruella\\" (my favorite on the album, just beautiful and strangely emotional)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Refreshing and solid release from Deadsy","review":"On the whole, a good album, but some of the not so exciting down tempo tracks take away from the overall punch of the record.However, I find \\"The Key to Gramercy Park\\" absolutely infectious and I would recommend the album for that song alone.Although the sound is nothing new, its really refreshing at the same time. It reminds me of a heavier, more contemporary metal-like version of Kraftwerk."},{"rating":"2","title":"Surprisingly Good!!","review":"I had read that this was a good band for over a year now, and was sorta looking forward to the cd, but I wasn't dying for it mainly because of the ties to Jonathan Davis, who I respect as an artist, but the only other bands he has signed are Orgy and Videodrone...neither of which impressed me. But this band truly does have an original and interesting sound that doesn't sound at all contrived or nu-metal like or trendy, it really creates a genre of its own....If you've read anything about the band you know it sounds kinda 80's synth pop mixed with metal/goth tendencies and that's true, but you've got to hear it to really understand the originality of the music....anyway, this cd is worth it if you want something fresh and new.."},{"rating":"1","title":"just a note","review":"this stuff is okay...nothing new at all, but all of you who like \\"brand new love\\" should realize it's a lou barlow tune...you can get different versions of it on sebadoh's \\"freed weed\\" (acoustic) and \\"smash your head on the punk rock.\\" (electric w/full band) both versions make \\"deadsy\\" pale in comparison."},{"rating":"1","title":"I lost $12","review":"I bought this cd because I thought it was something else, and gave it away two days later. You know those metal artists who write fun intros but should just keep their mouth shut before they ruin it with their ridiculous little melodies. That's kind of what this band is except their guitar work isn't all that great either. The melodies sound like they taught a child a key and let him wonder around a keyboard in it until he found something pretty. And they explore all of one guitar sound, within very strict, mainstream rooted confines. I hoped it might make some feel-good background noise to a conversation, but I couldn't take my mind off how bad it was. I went ahead and gave it two stars, because I know there is an audience who can at least groove to it better than me, but I still won't say it's good."},{"rating":"2","title":"The church of Goth for every religious fanatic","review":"This album might not get your pulse rating, but Commencement combine the good old days of new wave and delightfully creepy gothic tweets. Elijah's blood soaked vocals seduce you in slow, relaxing tunes that seems to be 10 years late. Who doesn't love the 80's dark new wave. Everyone wanted to be don johnson."},{"rating":"1","title":"How terrible is this CD?","review":"It makes you want to go out and buy everything Cher ever recorded and crank it way, way up. The best song, by FAR, is \\"Keys to Gramercy Park\\" - and that song is average, on a GOOD day. I agree with some of the reviews here - this CD does sound like something from the 80's - but folks, not everything from the 80's is worth celebrating. Some of it should be forgotten forever. When I first listened to this CD, I thought \\"this sounds like bad Orgy.\\" But after a couple more listens, I can't even associate this CD with Orgy because it would be such an insult to that band. The best thing about \\"Commencement\\" is the artwork on the front cover. Do yourself a favor - look at the artwork and then put the CD back down. You'll be wiser for it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful.","review":"Terrible album. All of the songs are repetative, and the keyboardist mad witchdoctor (or whatever he is) is an awful musician. When these songs by Deadsy are played, they are supposed to remind us of darkness and sadness. The only darkness I see is when I have to close my eyes from laughing so hard, and the only sadness is the tears I cry, also from laughing. I don't even know if you can consider these guys musicians, and this album should obviously make it into the W.A.E. Hall of Fame. W.A.E.: Worst Album Ever."},{"rating":"1","title":"one hot, steamy pile of s**t coming your way","review":"This cd is nothing but monotonous, droning, boring [junk].

It's eighties synth alright, but with something else in there. (I did notice someone else compared Deadsy to FoS, glad I'm not alone).Firstly, the design of the CD is stuning with the four-color aproach. Anyway, the music itself is just as bright. KEYS and WINNERS are certainly my favourites, as is BRAND NEW LOVE but towards the middle of the CD it starts to droop into montonomy. Oh well. However, the first few songs on the track are definately worth it and don't be suprised if you listen to it over and over again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not by far as good as the original release","review":"I have been listening to Deadsy for a couple of years and back then the only stuff I heard was from the original promo and the first release of Commencement which by the way has a different track listing.

The cd is way too 80's pop for me. the guitars don't even sound like guitars, the singer's voice is pretty good but i don't really like the lyrics and i think the keyboards make the songs sound a little too 80's. If all the songs were more like the first one that would be good. I mean, they even went to Family values. I thought they would be a little harder. If you like poppy 80's style synth music with funky keyboards, buy it but if not, definitely do not buy it!!!you'll be like...\\"what the hell???\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"I never thought I'd like it, but...","review":"I do. Eighties sounding synth-pop rock is quite a diversion from the indie-rock I usually listen to. But I like it. A friend of mine talked about Deadsy non-stop for a year and how great they were. I didnt really listen to him. But the demo he gave me changed my mind. Deadsy has a unique sound, interesting concepts and cool lyrics.

Whenever \\"He's A Mindbender\\" and \\"Continental Walk\\" came out, they weren't big hits (though I really like Sue Thompsona nd Hank Ballard). The favorite Coasters tune of mine, \\"Litle Eqypt\\" was in 1961 and was a hit with great production values.

The current (US) 2006 reprint, \\"printed digitally[and poorly at that]...in order to ensure its continuing availability\\" (?), has a gloss,cardboard cover with the dust-jacket image printed on it, is perfect-bound (so the pages will eventually drop out), and is on mediocre, non-acid-free paper.

This latest \\"techn-thriller\\" from Patrick has very little \\"techno\\" and the \\"thrills\\" are somewhat lacking also. I thoroughly enjoyed both \\"Nimitz Class\\" and \\"Kilo Class\\", but this one was a major disappointment. The long sections describing Ben Adnam's \\"journeys', including excrutiating detail about what he ate for Breakfast, Lunch, etc were quite boring.

I really enjoyed this book, it had a good start that got me interested, stretched the imagination but not to breaking point. Adnam was more like a James Bond on the wrong side. The descriptions of the food was a tad over the top. I thought the ending were Adnam colaborated with the US top brass was all over to quick, considering the depths of the story when he left Iraq to join forces with Iran and then systematically destroy various flying machines. I would of liked to of spent more time with Admiral Morgan than the Baldridges. The language was a bit over the top for an Admiral in the year 2006 I'm thinking, but saying that in some of the situations it put a true realism to the situation. Overall I enjoyed H.M.S Unseen and I will now be out in search of Kilo class and Nimitz class seeing others reviewers report these as being better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book - stupid ending","review":"No, I'm not going to tell you how it ends, except to say that such an exciting and riveting book should have had a better and more satisfying ending. There was at least one gaping, cavernous plot hole, which kind of ruined the last couple of chapters. I had the impression that Robinson had run out of gas, editors were screaming, and he had to wrap up the book quickly. He wasn't very careful. It felt like a rush job, almost as if someone else had written it.Other than the last section, the book is fantastic. I've already bought the rest of his stuff and plan to wade through them pretty quickly.One other quibble. The men are always big and brave, unless they're older, then they're incredibly smart and suave. The younger women are always beautiful and the older women stand by their smart and suave men.Speaking as an older guy who isn't suave, I must protest! ;-)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring as watching grass grow","review":"I don't know why anyone with an IQ above 43 would read this piece of junk masquerading as a real book. Tom Clancy nothing, this joker sounds like Dr. Seuss in comparison. I don't know what the two morons that wrote 5-star reviews were thinking, if they were thinking at all, but this book is one of the all-time worst excuses for fiction I have ever seen. I would love this book if I could remove 3/4 of my brain while reading it so as not to be in danger of retching violently at the plethora of gross absurdities found therein. I was assured that this book was excellent, but it took no more than the first 4 chapters to completely disabuse me of that notion. Inane, childish, moronic, dull, you name your adjective, it fits here. In summary, my opinion of this book can be summed up in one word (a highly technical term that is full of deep meaning): UGH."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good read, and a bit less rah-rah for Repugs than other Robinson Books","review":"The challenge I have with Patrick Robinson's books is that I absolutely cannot stand his childish political jabs. This book at least was not as bad in that regard, except that the most liberal character that was portrayed in a somewhat positive light got killed off. I am a liberal Democrat and I believe in a strong U.S. Navy, so I find Robinson's political posturing to be insulting - and it is unnecessarily and unfoundedly antagonistic. If I set aside Robinson's frankly idiotic political nonsense, then I usually enjoy the story and the details. I agree with some reviewers that Robinson can be a bit repetitive about some things - like who cares the 100th time about \\"buckshot\\" in coffee! But that is minor. Some characters are reasonably well developed and overall I enjoyed this particular book. It was a good read while at the beach."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing but political BS","review":"I am so sick of the political undercurrents in Patrick Robinson's books that I have stopped reading them. Though the stories are good, Robinson diminishes them by labeling and pigeonholing and demeaning anybody he does not agree with politically - especially Democrats. I stopped reading Scimiter SL-2 because I got so sick of it. I'm sure HarperCollins would sell more books if they could get him to stop the bashing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fine Read!","review":"A solid book by a fine author.

Save your money and wait for Clancy's next book."},{"rating":"2","title":"So Much Detail, It Feels Possible","review":"I almost didn't read the book because of the corny name for the submarine. I'm glad I persevered. Excellent story of an imaginative plot to retrofit a submarine so it can knock high-flying aircraft from the sky. By the time the renovated HMS Unseen downed it's third--and that the Concorde, I wished the F-15 Eagle was out of mothballs and trolling the LEO skies above me. A nuclear sub has never been hijacked, but Robinson makes it believable thanks to the level of detail he includes. He also adds an interesting twist to character development when he makes the reader like the terrorist--before we realize that's what he is. Clever plotting.The book ends about 2/3's of the way through--sadly, the bad guys win--but the story takes on a new life which carries it through to the end. This is my only complaint. That side plot should have been woven better into the main plot so they finished simultaneously. As written, I was confused by what came off as almost a new book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring compared to Kilo Class","review":"H.M.S.

Seriously, an absolutely riveting read for the first 300 pages, then disaster strikes! One of the most tame endings I think I have ever seen in a thriller! Please Mr. Robinson, go back and write an alternative ending! The fact that the majority of the book is brilliant only means the dissapointment is magnified by the poor ending! Read with caution. Honestly, alarm bells should ring like crazy in your head when in a 400 page thriller, you realise that the author is going to conclude it in less than 20 pages!! What happened, did his typewriter run out of ink?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Cardboard characters","review":"Kilo was bad, this is worse. Characters have the depth of cardboard and sooo predictable.

I'd like my money back, please."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good Story... But...","review":"HMS Unseen is a relatively interesting read, but the plot plods along in places.

I still wanted to finish the book, but I wouldn't put Robinsin in a class with Tom Clancy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lousy ending, bad psychology, poor premises","review":"Fine example of how popular authors are pushed by publishers to do novels too fast, with poor results.This story expects you to believe that a consumate professional military man/terrorist, who has never made a mistake in his career, allows sentimental attachment to a lost love to fuzz his intellect, producing simple behavior/mistakes which doom him.It expects you to believe that the US Navy is constrained by budget from pursuing conclusions reached by the National Security Advisor, a retired admiral, thereby dooming a more people in a repeated terrorist action.It expects you to believe that the news media will ignore an obvious lead from a reliable witness in the last incident, even when sensational, anti-military and anti-gov.

I had never taken calculus before and if it weren't for my wonderful professor, I would have hated and failed calculus. This book was definately not geared toward beginning calculus students-its way too theoretical. Instead of working out examples, they spend most of their time proving theorums. When you're just trying to understand the basics of calculus, how to differentiate, integrate and determine whether or not a series converges, you don't care about the proof, you really don't! I think this book would be better for an advanced calculus course where the students already understand the basics and want more theory. This book was just way to abstract for me.

Sometimes you could see a lot of the surroundings and at other times it was a 2-3 inch circle of light, but when the infra red lens comes on, it was much bigger.

The film was very well done in an even scarier Blair Witch style in which a reporting them following a group of fire fighters into the unknown and documents the events that follow. The atmosphere, intensity, great acting and superb effects make this film terrifying. They depict an infection is spreading turning people into rabid flesh eating zombies, but never have I seen this type of film, and a zombie film no doubt done with so much realism. This is one of the greatest films I have ever seen, it's not very often a horror film buff gets to be scared by a good horror film anymore. Enjoy many horror films yes, scared no. I have had three films truly scare me: 1. Excorist 2. Blair Witch and now 3. Quarantine. This is one of those films that will leave you thinking about it for a while.

The movie wastes the first 30 minutes on the virtues of a fire station pole and by the time we get to the action - we don't care who lives or dies.I could have saved this movie --The movie should have been 2 hours; the first hour being filmed 'traditionally at the actual 'lockdown' Quarantine area so we could get to KNOW the people involved, instead of them being thrown at us at a fever pitch so in turn we feel NO attachment to them.. the second hour should have been filmed with the shaky cam as they ran for their lives.. and in general even though I like Dexters very own Jen Carpenter, the whole cast needs to take it down a notch, the whole movie is over acted and a real mess of shrieks and \\"OH MY GODS!\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome Movie, better than the original.","review":"A must see, it kept me on the edge of my chair.

This film tries to virtually copy \\"Rec\\" scene for scene with lower grade scares and FX. Unless your're a completist just skip it and watch \\"Rec\\". Even those who hate subtitles will be glad they did. What's with this trend anyway? Even Michael Haneke remade \\"Funny Games\\", his own film, for crissakes. This unneeded remake cycle seemed to occur about the time Gus Van Sant made his biggest mistake in tackling \\"Psycho\\" which I think everyone agrees was a waste of celluloid.

The movie scenes were \\"viewed\\" from the cameraman (the actor holding the camera), and so the entire movie was freaking shaking left right up and down.

Plus, a police officer is not going to shoot at any person that appears in a window. Also, they just bit people, never did EAT them-movie review said they turned cannibalistic.To be fair: I thought the main character did really good with looking scared as hell, and blind in the dark.

That ending would have been great, had I not known!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Surprisingly good","review":"This one's a bit underrated, I think! Sure, after movies like Blair Witch, Open Water, and Cloverfield, documentary style horror is starting to become a cliche. But hey, how many horror films are there that DON'T borrow heavily from others? I thought Quarantine was well written, well acted, and more genuinely scary than most modern horror films, and I really enjoyed it. And I consider this a zombie movie, which I typically don't like at all. In fact, this is probably my favorite entry in that genre (after Dead Alive, of course).I can't wait to see the original Spanish version, because if it's better than this, it must be really amazing.

Quarantine is one of those films that has SO much going for it that you almost want to cry when the entire thing falls to pieces. The entire sequence at the beginning with the firemen was great! Clever scripting, realistic acting, awesome characterization... As soon as the crisis occurs, the film is dead. I can't even see how this film could be put in the same league as Cloverfield...

The movie didn't get any better from there. The in/out of focus effect was terrible. If the cameraman in the movie was supposed to be a professional, he should have been fired. They tried to build suspense but failed because of the distracting camera work and all the talking. To top it off, a movie that shows the ending in their previews and their DVD case means it didn't have anything else that was good in the movie. Thankfully I watched this movie at home and not the theater. I ended up turning the movie off at least 4 times because I wasn't sure I wanted to finish it.I suggest you save yourself and pass this movie up.

I was very happy about that mode because it doesn't take 1 hour to build a castle and wait 20 minutes for the enemy to come.

Because it's one of the old ones, the difficulty isn't as high as the new ones like San Francisco or the Austrian Castle, but it's still pretty tough.Once finished, it's very good looking and you can use it as a display with little toy soldiers. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another great gift from amazon.com","review":"I did give the 3D puzzle 5 stars because I didn't do it myself. It was a gift for my nephew.

It had more of a science fiction feel than I anticipated, with the main character's other world. It seems like the author knows what she wants to say with the other world, but she's not making it clear to the reader, atleast to me. The book was kinda boring in the beginning, but it gets more interesting. Even so, while I was reading it, I was waiting for it to end. When it was over I didn't think it was a terrible book, but the ending was nothing spectacular.

It makes you crazy. Later in the story she goes into a mental hospital. I thought that part was interesting because they told you about it and the psychiatrist.

This was written before doctors knew of chemical imbalances, so Deb's schizophrenia is attributed to a traumatic childhood surgery and an over-bearing grandfather.

The concepts of the other world, Yr, are not clearly introduced and there is a vagueness about these ideas at first.

I bought it from a used bookstore when I was ten. all I can say is READ THIS BOOK, it is absolutely amazing. every time I've read it, I've found something new. The author's writing style is unique, with many levels to her story: one being the level of the plot (which was about all I could understand when I was ten), and the rest are something deeper (which I've discovered since then).I Never Promised You A Rose Garden is a great book for those with depression. The book gives great insight into the power of the mind.

I did like the many side notes and jabs at the Yankees, but it seems that is the real focus of the book, rather than explaining why so many may love and hate the team. The format of the book and style of the pages can at time be a bit confusing to follow. The book tends to come across as a cut and paste collage of pokes at the Yankees from a few guys, nothing more.

The only words to describe this book would be ludicrous and preposterous. The plot flaws(after you have finished think back on such things as the woman in the bar in Panama and how she could have ended up there) are one thing, but the last 40 or 50 pages involve people doing things that no one in the world (even in thrillers) would consider doing.

I really like Rachael Ray, and I really wanted to like this knife sharpener, too, but the bottom line is:IT DOESN'T GET MY KNIVES VERY SHARP.I used to use rolling knife-sharpeners (can't find any more the quality ones I used to buy), and they got the blades of all my knives really sharp - \\"tomato sharp\\" is what I want. While this Furi DOES get my Wüsthof Classic 4582 Cook's knife somewhat better-than-dull (to be fair), still it feels a bit awkward to use, doesn't work well at all on my paring and smaller knives, and what sharp edge I do get doesn't last very long.BUMMER -- I'm still looking."},{"rating":"1","title":"Scratches blades","review":"I tried this on several knives.

We all find it very effective and easy to use. So, we now keep our kitchen knives sharp at all times and it's an even greater delight to cook now.

The shell and build quality are perfectly fine, but I was only able to run one knife through it before I had to stop. It emits the most excruciating, fingernails-on-chalkboard-esque scraping sound that I've ever heard (at least from a kitchen product). It sent unbearable chills down my spine with each hard-fought swipe.Perhaps the piece I order was defective, but I'm not giving the product another chance. Extremely disappointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"dont be fooled!!","review":"this product is a good idea but a poor implementation. the diamond surface is too rough and uneven to make a very sharp edge.The diamond surface is the only crappy diamond surface Iv'e ever seen on a knife sharpener.

I gave her mine since she is leaving the next day and I don't have time to order her a new one. Then I bought another one. This was a HUGE mistake. The quality doesn't seem to be the same. When I ran my knife through the first time, it made this terrible metal scraping noise. I thought maybe I have to break it in so I tried it a few more times. Then I noticed scratched on the edge of the knife. I took a close up photo so you can see it for yourself. Unfortunately, I threw the away the packaging thinking that it will work as great as the last one. Very disappointed.

However, just after 5 swipes or so with my chef's knife, it sliced right through the 'diamond' sharpening strips between the fingers and ripped it off. I believe I did it the right way and didn't abuse it, but noticed my knife frequently 'catching' on the diamond strips. The strips looked like they were glued on and not prepared to handle an actual knife's blade. For $20, I'm getting something else that will actually hold up."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Impressive","review":"As a collector of sorts of various blades, I wanted to be sure this item worked well before I tried it on some of my better knives. Its performance was slightly above mediocre when I tried it out and if you are new to knife-sharpening, I can definitely see how you could get scratches on the side of your blades. This item did sharpen a blade or two but only a little and it is very very loud and annoying.

I run the knives through it a few times after every use and they are as sharp as new.Gave it four stars because it's a little funky to open up but really the design is clever.

It's a standard murder mystery, but well written. I had read the other customer review here on Amazon.com before I finished the book, so I was prepared for the ending, which certainly is a disappointment. In a mystery novel, the mystery is supposed to be solved. In this book, everybody thinks the mystery is solved, except for Wycliffe, so the investigation continues, and more evidence is unearhted, making their initial theory less probably, but Wycliffe for some reason decide not to proceed with the case.With a proper ending, this would have been a pretty good mystery novel, but it's not. You'd be better off with most other murder mysteries instead of this one. Not recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ugh...

The information on the CD does not provide any indication of when these songs were recorded, but it sounds like they were recorded by a MUCH OLDER Johnny Paycheck than the original recordings.Heaven's Almost As Big As Texas -- the version on this album doesn't have any of the punch of the original.I subsequently bought The Soul and the Edge, and was much happier with that, thought to get Heaven's Almost As Big as Texas, I ended up also ordering the album, Take This Job and Shove it.Oh well."},{"rating":"2","title":"BeautifulBrazilianmusic","review":"It's everything the editorial review says it is - wonderful musicality - samba-jazz/bossa/hip-hop/pop - very distinctively Brazilian.

First, it's been written on good authority that Spalding wrote the first three volumes of this \\"fantasy\\" before he ever left the United States, later admitting having visited these \\"masters\\" while in his astro-body. And then there is the overall racist tone to his writing. I am amazed no one has yet to mention this in a review (at least none that I've read). Spirituality based on racism is not true spirituality.

When it was far from hip to be a bodybuilder, he quite simply became one of the best the world has ever seen. Later, when it became not only hip, but potentially highly profitable, to be a top bodybuilder, he walked away from the hype and \\"scene\\" of it all, returning to the serenity and purity of the movement and work for its own sake and its own inherent rewards. Rewards that many of the current crop of pros apparently fail to grasp, and will never attain. Dave now offers the lessons and teachings of a lifetime in the gym with the wisdom and patience of a true master of the discipline.

In the experiential narrative of the trilogy, matters of the mind, body & spirit, questions about life and the great beyond, our origins and our evolutionary potential, are all addressed. The ponderous subject matter and the thorough, succinct and descriptive writing style of Dr. Wesselman make for a powerful and persuasive read.In some instances, I felt like I was reading a Dan Brown novel, except that this was not fiction.

But the packaging of the product was pretty poor. I feel lucky that it arrived unbroken. The sensor lay in the box next to the \\"air bubble\\" material that is supposed to cushion the product. That meant it was unprotected on 5 out of 6 sides. It's not enough to throw in some cushioning material. Why not surround the product with the cushion and tape it?

I sleep with one across my back, or knee, and I don't stay in the same position so I'm turning and twisting thru the night and I have no trouble with them coming off. But I did have issues with that happening with the other brands I tried. When I wake up the muscles are thoroughly relaxed and I'm pain free. They do smell like BenGay, but I guess that doesn't bother me. I wonder if other folks are trying to get them to stick when they lotion on there skin or something??"},{"rating":"1","title":"very disappointed in the patch","review":"Bought this for lower back pain...it didn't even get hot.

It kind of tears at your emotions, but that only makes it more enjoyable. Once again, the dolphins always, and I mean ALWAYS being super-friendly to Jody as if they were aquatic humans can be quite annoying. After all, wouldn't mistreated captive dolphins be frightened and a little bit tense around humans? And Jody's love of dolphins can be eye-rollingly sickening as well. I mean, it's not like she just really loves them or something, she's practically OBSESSED! She cries every time something bad happens to a dolphin, and passes up fun activities just so that she can SEE them. But although those things can be bothersome, I still enjoyed this book. All of the characters had their time to shine in this book, or so it seemed, and the story, although difficult to imagine in some parts, was interesting and even kind of absorbing. I recommend this series to dolphin lovers, and girls who like unique and entertaining books."},{"rating":"2","title":"Chasing The Dream","review":"This is an amazing book and teachs lots about owning dolphins.

Just create a simple, light story with likeable characters. While the story was simple, light, and predictable, none of the characters were likeable at all. I kept reading, hoping that there would be a point in the book where I would start to like even one of the eight main characters, but it never really happened. All of the characters are either stupid/gullible, snobby/pretentious, or just plain annoying. The ending wasn't a clean ending with a lot of unresolved issues. I've read a lot of chic lit, and this was by far, my least favorite one thus far. I liked it so little that it made me want to log online to write a review."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of my time","review":"What a disgusting book. That's it. That is all I can say about it.Not a single redeeming quality in any of the characters. Nothing about this book is inspiring, nothing about it gives us hope, or makes us tingle with emotion, or makes us wishful or makes us think. It is not even a feel-good read!! It's a highly provoking, repulsive story.Friends taking a stab at one another, spouses cheating on one another. Everyone betraying everyone else, everyone conning everyone else. Just one big fat mess. I have not enjoyed a single Madeleine Wickham book, and definitely prefer Sophie Kinsella's style, but this one...this ones takes the cake! I didn't think it could get any worse, but man oh man, Wickham proved me wrong.The only reason I read it (and trust me I read it as fast as I could), was because it has been lying there on my bookshelf for months and I thought what the hell? I'm in need for a light, quick read. This was ridiculous though.If I could give it no stars, I would."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst book I have ever read","review":"I just finished the book and had to come to Amazon to see how it was rated and I agree with most readers that it was horrible!

In this case, I checked how long ago this was written (over fifteen years), because today's economic climate would be handled very differently if this was written today. The book takes place over a weekend, where four couples, former friends and neighbors, get together over a lot of Pimm's to play a \\"friendly\\" tennis tournament. The feel of this story is much darker than a light-hearted Becky Bloomwood romp, as these characters connive from the get go among one another."},{"rating":"2","title":"Summer Fun","review":"It's not quite summer yet, but would recommend as a great read for the pool or beach.

Agree with other reviewers - it is not new but a re-issue of The Tennis Party and not nearly as good as some of her more recent work like Remember Me. I expected light and fun with some good laughs thrown in, but this one was just tedious and boring without redemption for anyone at the end - they are all unhappier than when it started.

I'm relieved to learn from other reviewers that this is just a reissue of her first novel, as otherwise I would be wondering what in the world happened to her writing.

I made myself finish it because I was hoping that her usual great story writing would kick in but it never did. She wasted so much time talking about the boring tennis matches and spent very little time on the stories of the characters. I started scanning the pages about halfway through and didn't find much to focus on and the ending left me wondering why I even bothered. Valerie and Bob served no real purpose in the story and there was no real explanation about the whole Lloyds of London situation with Charles and Cressida, and we were left completely hanging as to what will happen with that situation or their marriage.

However, in the spirit of Austen and having read that Elizabeth was a favorite of hers I would think that better things were in store for the Darcys.This book was so repulsive and disgusting I couldn't even look at it! I could barely finish it. I had to read the original a few times to get myself back on track.Think of it this way, The Bar Sinister and Presumption were better and that's saying a good bit.

I agree with those who call it a soap-opera. It might be an analysis of the ups and downs of marriage, but why the Darcys were picked is beyond me, as almost all facets of their P&P; personalities appear ignored in this book. This sequel might just as easily be based on any other fictional couple.It will not please die-hard P&P; or Austen fans, and it will certainly not please anyone looking for a sequel that has a sense of continuation from the original."},{"rating":"1","title":"HORRID","review":"This book is an atrocity! It takes the beloved characters from P&P and twists them so badly you don't even recognize them. Elizabeth seems meek and cowardly...not like her true sprited character at all.

I enjoyed Mr Darcy Takes A Wife MUCH MUCH more."},{"rating":"1","title":"Difficult to read, no redeeming qualities of plot, characterization or language","review":"After reading the first 50 pages I began skimming through this awful excuse of a book.The book is so poorly written that the train of thought is difficult to follow.

I could not follow her train of thought even with careful attention.I only bothered to finish skimming the book to see if there were any redeeming qualities in the plot. Answer: Don't bother."},{"rating":"2","title":"Putting dramatic structure on the user interface","review":"The idea that is perhaps most central to this book is that if you design the action involved in a user interface, the design of all other objects in the domain will follow. To support this, Laurel reconciles the seemingly disparate and relates user interface design with producing a play in theater. For example, the way she brings in the Freytag triangle works very well.This said, I wish I wish that we would see a book from Laurel (or from one of her other usability guru companions) that treats with more recent issues-- particularly the Internet. I think she's one of the smartest people out there in the field, and I try to read what she's written, but I'm getting tired of reading about Habitat, Guides, and the Holodek on Star Trek. That's not the fault of the book, given that it came out pre-Internet hype, but it did inflect the reading experience with some weariness."},{"rating":"1","title":"Um, a book about researching potatoes?","review":"I made it about 80 pages into this book.

Best when somebody else uses it on you. A bit of advice for beginners: start by using the large attachments, and work your way from there. Even the largest one in the kit gives a short haircut. There are bigger attachments that can be bought separately.The machine buzzes very fast and deep, hence the expression \\"buzz cut\\". It takes three or four bad haircuts until you get it right, but then you will feel very rewarded. Also safe.

Bennie Rosato is a very good lawyer, she is contacted by Alice Connolly who claims to be her twin. Alice is in jail for a murder she says she did not do. Bennie takes the case and then begins to uncover a conspiracy between the cops involved an attorney and even the judge. A retired cop, named Lou, is very helpful. I hope he is used again. The case goes to trial, you don't know until the last if Connolly is guilty or not or is she is a twin to Rosato or not.And after the trail, what happenes to Connolly. It all has a very good twist to the ending, at least one I did not expect. The action moves better than some of her other books and I enjoyed it very much. Would love to write the ending as it is very shocking but you will have to read the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not her usual fare....she's better than this!","review":"I've read most of Scottoline's books and liked them. They're not Grisham or Turow, but they're good for a couple of nights' reading.This particular offering, however, never pulled me into the story, nor did I for one minute believe that Bennie Rosato -- tough girl that she is -- would fall for such a con artist as her \\"twin\\" sister...the entire thing just didn't ring true.And the stereotypes Scottoline used are so tired and overdone.I've worked for lawyers and am pretty sure that no judge worth his robes would deny a continuance after an attorney's parent died, so that part didn't work for me either.I think Scottoline ought to go back to what works for her rather than trying to turn out a book every 6 months or so. Her writing, timing, plot development and characterizations are suffering."},{"rating":"2","title":"An emotional twister and legal thriller in one","review":"Interesting premise...a lawyer is confronted with a convict who asks her to represent her, and informs her that she is really her long-lost twin. Question is, would you take the case?Scottoline does an admirable job in keeping the emotional questions interesting, while developing an excellent legal thriller. The questions surrounding the case concerning police corruption and the guilt of the defendant continue to pile up as you progress. Keeping you wondering until the end where the truth really lies.While I truly enjoyed the book, and found it generally well written, I did find certain decisions and motivations lacking in believability, hence 4 stars instead of 5. It is definitely worth a read though."},{"rating":"2","title":"Suspense thriller that you can not but down!!!","review":"This book was a good read and was very hard to put down. It was amazing how she intertwines all the characters in the book to be all connected to the main characters. There were so many characters that were so diverse that it was so hard to keep up with each character.... It is a must read for who ever like the author. However if you are not great fan of Lisa Scottline this book will definitely covert you to the other side of liking the author. This is the best book that has Bennie Rosetto as the main character of the story and shows a completely new side to Bernie Rosetto that as a reader I have never in countered. The book is the best book written by Lisa Scottline and I hope that all the books written by her are as good as this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lisa Scottoline novels","review":"I have read all of her books and now am re-reading them.

As others have said, unbelievable & un engaging. What attorney with only a week to prepare a capital murder case pulls an all nighter opening boxes and setting up the victim's apartment? Definitely not up to par with her other books. Bring back the detectives and characters of your earlier books, Lisa!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I love Phila","review":"How I wish the characterizations were better. Bennie is unbelievable as a lawyer taking one week to prepare a case for murder that happened one year ago. Her boy friend is unbelievably blah...its unbelievable that Beanie cut her hair with a nail sissors and it looks cute...Mary is unbelievably terrified by a murder that happened one year ago...Its all unbelievable and Bennie seems foolish and inane to the nth degree...and I never found out why the Judge was also a crook...was he greatly enriched??? Lou Jacobs rings true as does Judy the associate from CA. How about Scotoline kills Bennie (how about calling her Beanie?) and promotes Judy to top dog. Or just incapacitates Beanie, like put her in the hospital. yeah."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book was not \\"all that\\"","review":"I was dissapointed with this book.

No, it was a fashion house, there were enough clothing descriptions through the book for me to deem it that. This is the first Lisa Scottoline novel I've read and it's, well, readable? The climax of the book was so unbelievable, Ford Exporer climbing steps? Give your head a shake. I cared nothing for the characters at that point either. Time to read a Pulitzer prize winner, perhaps a Nobel,or a Booker because I know this author's coming back with her identical twin...what will she be wearing?"},{"rating":"2","title":"An up-all-nighter!","review":"I have read all of Ms. Scottoline's legal thrillers and think this one is the best!

This book is sure to be a national bestseller!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved this book!","review":"This is the first of Scottoline's books that I have read. I enjoyed it so much I immediately ordered four more, and have only two left to read.

WHAT????The ending was a twist and very shocking, but too many loose ends were not cleared up.POSSIBLE SPOILERS*****what happened to connoly at the end? there was never a mention of if she was alive or not?how did the plastic bag end up in the dumpster?why did lenihan try and kill bennie? citrone? what was his deal?if the cops had nothing to do with the murder what was the problem?what happened to the judge? i mean i know he sailed off in the end but why did he get involved in the first place?some of these questions may have answers I am missing but I wish I knew the answers. in fact if anyone does please contact me here!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Textbook hackwork","review":"The only people who might gain from reading this book are those interested in the publishing industry and analysis of the minimal requirements for publishing thrillers. \\"Mistaken Identity\\" will show that those elements do not include the following:1.

In my opinion Mr. Grisham has provided an involuntary strong influence on Lisa Scottoline, this book looks like a copycat but cannot attain the level of the former writer. With a quick pace marked by short chapters and with a poor language improper for a legal-thriller, the author is determined to trap the reader into the plot and scores, because as the pages go by, she learns how to exploit the story setting the mystery out and then turning it into tight suspense which snowballs toward the last chapters, but when you finish the book and look at it as a whole in retrospect, it is easy to perceive loose ends during the course of the events as the author falls sometimes in traps set by her own creative ideas, leaving some important situations unresolved or sidestepped, this go hand to hand with the flabby character drawing and shows a definitive poor writing style."},{"rating":"2","title":"SUPER - Don't Miss It!","review":"Don't wait another minute.

The noise and the difficult assembly didn't bother me. The two main problems with this machine are the lenght and the monitor. At 6' I'm not very tall for a rower and I'm not getting anything close to full extension, I'm barely half an inch away from the end of the slide on my drive and I can't pull the handle all the way in, and when I come up to the catch I can still stretch my arms almost past the fan assembly. The monitor displays distances in miles and speed in mph instead on meters and 500m split, making it extremely difficult to keep track of my performance.

The overall message is a good one, and the teacher in the book is obviously well intentioned; however, I found the illustrations to be, in truth, a bit creepy. I guess it could work as a read aloud with some rich classroom discussion but I would never just put it into my classroom library for kids to discover on their own.

And although \\"Recently in the Sahara\\" does display Boards of Canada influences (as do other tracks), its sweeping qualities and low, rumbling tones help alleviate the similarities. The tempo changes in \\"Kittenplan A\\" keeps the listener on his toes, while \\"Cathart\\" tweets as pretty as a bird in the spring. \\"Scraph\\" puts some concrete rhythms into the mix and \\"You Can Use Bamboo as a Ruler\\" closes out the album on a gentle note, clicking its way into silence.

Yet over the years, modern dance itself became fragmented and could not be recognized as the unified form of balletic opposition it had once been. Not only did modern dance change, but people's ideas about what modern was also changed. This book consists of seven different third generation modern dance choreographers describing their seven different beliefs of what modern dance really is. From Anna Sokolow's ideas of rebellion to Alwin Nikolais' ideas of abstraction, these written testaments to the lives of the some of the most innovative and important choreographers of the century allow us to see what lies behind dance and to gain insight into what modern dance was, is, and can be."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fug hucklebee whatta gotta vulcan idiots!!!","review":"Bam and the crew rock!

Why would Lego produce such a chintzy product?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Unused...","review":"Well, it seemed a no brainer to have a base for the Lego bricks my son got along with this item for Christmas. Unfortunately, this piece of plastic has been overlooked and unused since it was opened and has proved unessential for my children's enjoyment of Legos. To it's credit, it has held up after being stepped on, flung, and tossed aside in room cleaning. But I do regret spending the $15+ shipping to get it. Unless you are a die-hard lego sculptor and/or need it, skip this item. Just another thing to clean up along with the hundreds of bricks they actually play with."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT GOOD TO BUILD ON - DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY!!","review":"I purchased Lego Duplo blocks for my toddler, and thought this would be a great idea to build things on, since it would keep everything in place. I didn't realize, however, that it would be a FLIMSY piece of plastic that should cost NO MORE THAN $2 - and even THEN I wouldn't buy it! It moves/slides around too easily, so it won't stay in place on a tabletop, and I doubt it would on any other surface! I put my daughter's on top of a Little Tikes table (a GREAT buy for $[...] - she LOVES it!), and used DUCT TAPE to secure it to the table! (little loops under the plate around all of the edges, so she can't peel it up!) It works well, but this is the ONLY way I can see it doing so!

My son has a large Lego collection and I wanted to get him some lego roads since I no longer have mine from when I was younger. For whatever reason, it seems that Lego doen't produce nearly as many road sets as they used to and those they do sell, in my opinion, are significantly more expensive than I think they should be compared to other lego products. Still, I bit the bullet and bought 2 road sets and my son has played with them. The major drawbacks to this basically good Lego product are just (1) they are so expensive you can't get many road sets and (2) the road piece variety isn't what it used to be. These drawbacks combine so that the child can't make nearly as good a roadway as I remember being able to make when I was younger."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sharp edged, thin.","review":"Perhaps it is because we are new to candle making but these molds did not serve the purpose.

There are a couple that I didn't know and I asked my Japanese friend if they were common and not old-fashioned. (I'm always skeptical if books are using outdated terminology.) She assured me that they are common expressions used today.My main gripe is that Kanji and romaji are used but not furigana.

Even with the anti-shake on and custom picture settings, you can not get a clear picture 6 out of 10 times trying. I am now looking to go back to my Sony cybershot since it seemed to provide better picture quality than this."},{"rating":"1","title":"no go","review":"Bought this digital camera a few days ago. Worked great for the first week. By that time I had thrown out the box, pachaging and info as to who I actually bought this from. Then two buttons stopped working. Can't seem to get them to work. Now I have no idea where it came from and who to send it back to. Amazon doesn't actually sell these things, they pass it off to a third party.Also, the shutter button has a delay. I took the first 40 pictures of the back of my dog's head because by the time the shutter actually engages teh subject has moved. Use this camera only for taking pictures of a mountain or something.The memory that is in the camera is about enough for 5 photos, so you need to buy a memory card as well. The memory cards are on the sales page, but I didn't get an idea if I needed one, till it showed up.Not sure what I am going to do with this broken camera. Sure don't want to buy one from Amazon again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Camera","review":"I really like the camera it is one of the best I had so far. The pictures look sharper and clearer. The only thing that I don't like is the pictures it takes at night they don't come out clear; however,I haven't found a digital camera that takes good night pictures yet so that's why I took away only 1 star. Overall, love the camera and it is a good buy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great","review":"The camera is great!

I bought this simply based on the great reviews on amazon. This takes great video at 640x480, the pictures look great. I am pleased with the new features. I mainly bought a Casio because of the coupling feature on the camera and they took that feature shot off and replaced with other shots such as underwater & autumn which are useless to me.

Since the first day I did not feel good with this camera but I was not sure if it was my unexperience or the camera, but now that I have a second hand Cybershot of only 8Mb I know the casio EX-Z1050 is or defective or it is a terribly bad camera for pictures.Image Stabilization really sucks. I can get a less bad picutre if that feature is off.For video it is great, but still it has bad audio recording.I called several times tech support to see if I can get a replacement, but all they say is that my camera is not broken and once Casio releases the 1st firmware for this camara all these issues are going to be resolved, but now I have almos 1 year waiting for this firmware...

I own a D200 and was getting tired of carrying the heavy SLR and the lenses on my trips. I missed quite a bit of shots because of the bulky nature of SLR. This camera is very slim and fits in your shirt pocket. I always carry this camera with me. I wish this had a viewfinder. It is a bit difficult to use only the LCD screen for composing shots. The 4 star is just for the missing viewfinder, else I would have given it 5 stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great ability in a tiny package","review":"After using this camera on a couple of trips, and now being familiar with its features, I have to say I'm very happy with it. I purchased this after I lost my older Exilim camera, and this smaller, lighter version is much easier to use.As with any ultracompact camera, don't expect the kind of photography you'd get from a digital SLR, or a dedicated video recorder. However, the quality of the pics & video is excellent, seeing as it's coming from such a small package.The only reason this is 4 and not 5 stars, is because of the inability to set advanced settings for each shot. You have to select pre-set modes (like \\"Party\\", \\"Sports\\", or \\"Scenic\\") to get the right shutter speed or light sensitivity that you want. This can be frustrating until you familiarize yourself with the different modes available. Once you know your camera, though, it is enjoyable to use.This camera's best for casual to intermediate photography, which is what I do."},{"rating":"2","title":"Small in size but big features","review":"I currently have a silver one of these and a 7.2megapixel Casio as well.Huge rear screen is a bonus and for those out there that hate puttons etc all over the camera, this is the one.You can go deep into the menu structure or just stay on top and shoot all you like.This is a go anywhere type of camera and is robust enough to be used by the kids if. I would like to have it have a longer exposure time as I sometimes like to take long exposure night shats but that is life. I use the 7.2 for that.the flash is bright enough for a normal size room. and the antishake is great.I can see it won't be long before a touch screen is added to the back instead of buttons, for furute models.Overall a great little camera with great big features and capabilities."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Instructions...Poor customer service","review":"I wish I would have returned this awful camera!!!!Customer Service is terrible....the manual stinks....the camera is not what all these folks say it is cracked up to be....total waste of money."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Very Good Camera","review":"I have had the camera for a couple of weeks now.

I got the book and indeed they were right: this book is astounding. Mr. Jensen offers insightful step-by-step guidance with useful pointers and tips for every facet of restoring the 1958 sliding window export model of 'the rolling egg.' When I bought my Isetta, the seat and inside panels were missing. Imagine my joy when I found, in the book, templates for the panels and a design for a replacement seat. It was almost a spooky, spine-tingling, X-files kind of sensation. It this thoroughness into the restoration process that I found extremely useful.

Every song she sings invokes such emotion, you can really feel her spirit. My favorite song is \\"Free,\\" it brings me to tears every time hear it. Now, I can go on my soapbox about how sad it is that truly gifted singers [like Ms. Griffin and other like her]don't get the kind of airplay they deserve.

The biggest issues I had with the book are that Edelman encourages people to get as large a mortgage as they can and then invest the money they do not put into the house. When giving his examples he uses a 12% annual investment return (you read that right - 12%). The payment of debt is guaranteed, while investment returns have inherent risk and are seldom guaranteed outside of low interest debt instruments (which still have default risk). He also does little to help people prepare for job loss. These two issues have come to the forefront since the recession and housing bubble, but they have been risks forever. For Edelman to treat these topics so optimistically is just bad advice."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book","review":"I enjoyed this book.

It doesn't seem like much thought was put into the book. It comes across as a cheap imitation of \\"the Millionaire Next Door\\" (which was a great book).

Period. A ... mortgage paid off in thirty years will cost you [more]. It does not make sense to pay 3x what something is worth. Even if it appreciates 200% all you have done is broken even.Except to have a horn to blow, I can't imagine why ric continues giving this same advise in every book that has his name on the cover.

The entire time he was making his insane points, I felt like he was implying anyone who doesn't follow his advice is stupid.

Imagine, it's not always best to pay off a mortgage that has an interest rate lower than the market's long-term average return. Who would have thought that the best strategy for a 401K is NOT to diversify new contributions? Very thought-provoking, but left me yearning for more information about when to diversify the existing balance, etc. But, since the price of the paperback is so low, it's worth it.

Here's the author's main recommendation: Carry a large mortgage and instead of paying it off, invest money in the stock market because \\"you can easily make 10% returns a year.\\" If that's true, why did so many people lose their life savings recently in stocks and mutual funds? Of course, this guy is a fund manager, which is why he is trying to convince people to invest. BEWARE this sly salesman!!! Edelman encourages people to invest the money they should be using to pay off the mortgage because \\"mortgage interest is tax-deductable.\\" True, but that does not mean the IRS refunds ALL of your mortgage interest. It is still costing you money, so why gamble on stocks that might lose money when you know you can be paying off your house and having that security?

While thrilling the viewer with big mountains and impressive skiing, this documentary tells the gripping and true tale of a young son who tries to fill the shoes of a father he never knew by skiing the route that killed him. The film's larger story, however, is an exploration of the camaraderie of big mountain skiers who share a dangerous sport that regularly takes their best friends, fathers, sons, and husbands. Alternately sad and uplifting, this is a film not just for the adrenaline junkie, but for the entire family.UPDATE on 12-Jan-11: I was contacted by the film's director, Bill Kerig. He told me that this seller is not authorized to sell the movie (Bill is trying to work with Amazon to change the distributorship).

However, my print addiction won out, and I opened it up. Stone Barrington is one of those characters that seem too perfect to be true--rich, handsome, a babe magnet, and an astute detective to boot. The more I read, the less I liked him. It is the rare book that I don't finish, but \\"Worst Fears Realized\\" is one of them. Granted, Woods writes with a lightning pace, but he sacrifices character and plot development to achieve that speed.

The master of the mystery thriller has taken a real vacation in Worst Fears Realized. The story begins with a pretty compelling scene and what looks to be a good thriller in the making. Unfortunately, that's it...it's downhill from that point on. Stone Barrington, the sexy, smart, ex-cop/lawyer has become a cartoon character, totally inane and unbelievable. It's sad to think that this is the same great character from New York Dead. But worse yet, the story is silly and implausable and has absolutely no merit. Don't waste your time on this one.

Thankfully, he's advanced from his book-end descriptions of how progressive his typesetting is to how he now answers e-mail, as opposed to snail mail. And while I comment Mr. Woods for entering the 90s, it's blatantly apparent that he still needs to find a competent editor."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the effort","review":"I agree with many other reviewers. This book is a step below some of Wood's other works. The story is fairly weak, and the ending comes far too easy for Stone.

Worthy of only two stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Fears Realized by Stuart Woods","review":"Woods first books were riveting. Perhaps, at times far-fetched, but good character development, etc. This thing is not worth the time it takes one to read the cover. There is little plot and that is true of only the first few pages. Stone's \\"bedding\\" becomes central with little relevance to plot. Very poor. I agree with another reviewer - I didn't care if they were all murdered. I wouldn't have cared if I had lost the book!

I've never read such pretentious dialogue! It's hard to empathize with a protagonist who says things like \\"As you wish\\" more than a couple of times. It was kind of like reading about a character whose snobbishness is being spoofed, but there is apparently no joke intended. The plot seemed like an interesting idea, but instead of dragging it out, there was really no room for any suspense. If you're a fan of this author, maybe this is what you're looking for, but I found myself rolling my eyes a lot."},{"rating":"1","title":"Zero Stars -- Do not buy this book!","review":"Well, Stuart Woods has already proven he can write. Too bad he doesn't try to write in this book. It has all the hallmarks of being tossed off in fulfillment of a multi-book contract. One wonders, nevertheless, how any self-respecting editor could have passed on it.The book is a piece of garbage. It's not worth even a dollar. I read it because I paid for it, but as I've done with many paperbacks I should've just quit reading and tossed it after 30 pages.For anyone who has admired Stuart Woods past productions this project will be a profound disappointment.I should have paid more attention to the Kirkus review, which is on the mark.Do not, repeat not, buy this book!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Stone Barrington, at it again!","review":"I have been following the Stone Barrington series, reading them all in sequential order, one right after the other. I do have to say that this book is not like the others thus far. I did not read this book with the passion to finish it because it was great. Instead, I wanted to keep reading it just so I could finish it and move on. It seemed to drag too much on Stone's personal life, which ended up not even having a real significance in the end of the novel. Take away all of this \\"mush\\" and the book still had the Stuart Woods mystery, suspense, and thrill. If reading the series, definitely read it, because you will miss out on a lot, but it is not one of my favorite Woods' novels."},{"rating":"1","title":"Truly a lost cause","review":"As an avid reader, I've read 4 or 5 of Stuart Wood's books before this one. I've always enjoyed his work, but this one is a big disapointment. This book focuses more on Stone's bed hopping than it does on suspense. In fact, if I had to use one word to describe this book it would be \\"boring\\". Mr. Woods I hope you will do better next time. I've gotten about 3/4 of the way through the book and I doubt I will finish it. Reading this book is like walking through muck.

When the author lacks evidence, he simply speculates by saying things like \\"it seems\\" and notes how his conclusion is \\"evident\\". Rather than always citing to evidence, he favors political commentary and other biased sources. When I was pleasently suprised to find an unbiased reference, more often than not the author provided a slanted interpretation of it (often through omission). Lastly, the author blatantly misrepresents the legal aspects of international law in favor of how the author would like international law to be. As an attorney who works in international law, I found this to be the book's greatest flaw. In sum, this book is little more than an anti-American rant presented in a academic format.

If the professor really believes in law and justice, then why doesn't he beleive Saddam's and Milosevic's actions were grounds enough for going into Iraq and Kosovo?

Anna then faces one catastrophe after another, starting with being kidnapped, her home being destroyed by arson and then ending with the kidnapping of her business partner and friend, David. Anna realizes that someone is out to get her and she follows each trail, from Donaldson (the vampire who turned her), to the Revengers, to the vampire police chief, until she finds out who is behind all of it.

I offer the evidence of his performance in the regergitation scene where I have seen more convincing acting in my children's school plays. The other actors don't even merit a mention. To be fair I think the script and the directing did little to enhance the performances. perhaps the actors did the best with what they were given. On to the plot.

This means no more CD's rolling around in my truck. The sound quality is amazing! The motorized face works smoothly, and seems fairly sturdy.The Cons: This head unit has a pretty large learning curve. Because of the single knob/enter button, scrolling and selecting options can be kind of a pain. Initial setup is also a painstaking task. It has sound settings for every seat and speaker in the car, but trust me, the sound quality is worth the 1.5 hour setup. Also, the display is a little on the grainy side.Overall I would highly recommend this unit.

I think my favorite right now is \\"Monday Monday\\" since it brings back to me memories of listening to the original when I was just 7 or 8 years old.Unlike most pop music today, this CD will stand the test of time. Sure, the songs are 40+ years old, but they are classics and need to be heard and re-discovered. I salute them for taking a brave step with this project, and I too am looking forward to Vol. 2 and beyond! Maybe a tour?? We can only dream!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Pop Music At It's Best","review":"You don't have to be old enough to have heard these 40 year old songs in their original releases to enjoy their covers by Hoffs and Sweet.The harmonies are flawless, and the arrangements are impeccable."},{"rating":"1","title":"SUPER Light","review":"I usually don't bother to write reviews of music I don't like. Well, I will an exception here after buying the cd that got me sent this one( FreeBird,a rehash of Beatles songs that sucked).I only could listen to about twenty seconds of \\" Its all over now, baby blue\\" and \\" Cinnamon Girl\\"( two of my favorite 60's songs)...there was a real threat of my throwing my new lap-top through the wall.Gutless, ball-less,watered-down pathetic pap.Mathew Sweet and company SHOULD NOT try to tackle any song that has any power...stick to the pop-pap that you do best.The only reason it got any stars at all is the hope that mybe someone buying this dreck will seek out the original versions of the selected songs...this is great music being mutilated."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Misguided Adventure","review":"How anybody, who knows anything about the covered songs can rate this as good, is beyond me. Susanna Hoffs singing is off and awful!!!

As the press falls all over this record with glowing praise, you listen, and......the two words that come to mind are pedestrian and soporific. Matthew Sweet has always been a third-stringer (at least Ms. Hoffs used to be good; the Bangles' first recordings were what this record is trying to recapture) and they really don't nail any of these songs. Please skip this and spare us a Vol. 2!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"this stinks!","review":"Matthew Sweet by himself is good. \\"Girlfriend\\" is a classic cd. Suzanna Hoff is many years past her prime and the Bangles were...okay.This cd is bad. The versions are week and detract from the original songs. Sweet and Hoffs have no synergy. Why are they even together? They add nothing to these songs and simply sound like a wedding band doing covers.Did you see them on the talk shows (Conan, Leno). They were horrible!If Matthew Sweet doesn't lose weight, he may not be able to ever get a \\"Girlfriend\\".This seems like a desperate attempt to make money. A better covers cd is the Def Leopard one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why?","review":"This is a note for note reproduction of some 60's classics. If you like the songs, listen to the originals! To Matthew Sweet: why? There is no reason for this CD. Here are to fine guitarists, Richard Lloyd (formerly of Television)and Sweet and they could not put their own spin on the songs? The Zombies' Care of Cell #44 is really in need of an updated arrangement. The only value is playing this CD along with Joan Jett's [ASIN] The Hit List at a party to make your guests think they fell into an alternate universe. That said, Susanna Hoffs is a fine singer and does justice to the Velvet's Sunday Morning. If one song is worth the price of the CD, it is that song. Then again, Sweet's background vocals on the Fairport Conventions' Who Knows Where The Time Goes? really ruins the song."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great CD, but...","review":"First off, these are great songs given an excellent second (and in a few cases, third) life by two terrific singers. Makes one wonder whether much contemporary music product will survive well enough to be given such a loving rebirth years down the road. The only sour note: My CD, which I bought through Amazon, did not include liner notes. I opened the sleeve expecting a nice little booklet to pop out with lyrics, credits, and photos. But there was nothing in there. Where's the quality control, folks? This wonderful CD deserves better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Recording not very good","review":"With so many others having already given detailed reviews of this CD, there is no need for me to elaborate here. Instead, I'll just briefly say what I think is most relevant about this disc. Other reviewers have said that this disc is well-recorded. It is not. It is hard and glassy-sounding and tiring, especially when listened to on better stereo equipment, though it is less problematic on portable CD players and headphones. The music itself includes some great songs, though I did not like some of them. For what it is, this music is well enough performed here, but the recording is not very good. I'd rather have my money back."},{"rating":"2","title":"Four and a Half Stars, but I can't add the Half","review":"This is a delicious and irresistible pop confection, with more staying power than most feel-good treats provide. If you have any musical perspective, you don't expect Sweet and Hoffs to improve on classics by Neil Young and the Beatles (not to mention less well-known, but no-less-stellar tracks like Love's \\"Alone Again Or\\" and the Left Banke's \\"She May Call You Up Tonight\\").You simply enjoy \\"Sid and Susie's\\" sparkling, well-performed, and fresh takes on these gems, smile at the sweet-and-spicy harmonies, nod happily with the jangly guitars, and bliss out.And play the cd again and again.At least, that's what I'm doing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not about the Church Fathers","review":"If you're looking for a book on the Church Fathers, this one is probably NOT what you're looking for.The aim of this book is to present church doctrine. It contains 250 headings that are chosen in accordance with the Cathechism of the Roman Catholic Church. Each one describes a point of dogma according to the Church's official teaching and offers some quotes from the ante-Nicene Fathers to support it. The point the writer is trying to make is that the teaching of today's Catholic Church doesn't differ from what the Fathers taught. If that is what you're interested in, then this book might be something for you.For me, however, it was a disappointment. Willis doesn't let the Fathers speak for themselves, and the book doesn't really give an impression of what the theology of the Fathers is all about. Willis is trying to impose a medieval or post-medieval way of presenting the Christian faith on the patristic era."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tired","review":"I was a big fan of the early Skinner books and so I thought I'd see how the series was doing. If Gallery Whispers is anything to go by, the answer is: Not well. This book suffers from terrible telegraphing of plot points, a number of the most horribly graphic sexual scenes I've ever read, and some of the worst editing/proofreading I've seen in a very long time. To say the book is disappointing is an understatement. It's difficult to keep a series fresh, which is why my hat is off to a writer like Thomas Perry who has the sense to end a series before it becomes stale and move on. Jardine would be well advised to do the same, if Gallery Whispers is anything to go by. If you're interested in reading this author, the wisest course is to start back at the beginning with, say, Skinner's Rules.Not recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible","review":"My mom and I both bought this vacuum cleaner based on a sales recomendation.

In my case I obtained some idea about how the diagrammatic techniques look in covariant form. However, many questions I had had are still left unanswered. While it is obvious that the book is out of date, and it is hard to blame the authors for that, there is no even brief overview of the field and the basic problems it faced in that period. There is no mentioning of the approaches altenative to diagrammatic techniques.

His ethical and moral musings in the latter part of the book force all of us who are participating in the evolution of the Internet to stop and think about why we do what we do."},{"rating":"2","title":"Way to go!","review":"Weaving the Web is a book written by the Web's creator \\"Tim Berners Lee\\". The book is divided in three main part. The evolution of the Web, the moral behind the Web, and the future of the Web. The special thing about the book is that you can read it as a technical book, and you can read it as a moral book. After reading some pages in the book, i had chosen to read it morally.The book has only 209 pages, but you learn very much about the Web by reading it. I think it should be morally obliged for every web creator, and everyone that concerns the Web, to read the book. In the book he speaks about how the Web evolved, what its potential is, and what his personal vision about the Web is. It's a amusing book to read in that way. The moral behind the Web."},{"rating":"2","title":"Really interesting, but lacks TCP/IP background information","review":"A most interesting history/sociology of the Web, the book is well written and very accessible if a little \\"chatty\\". For the serious minded it gives us acronyms and directions to watch out for. I feel there are a couple of gaps. I would have welcomed more on the TCP/IP protocol stack, how this foundation was established, how secure it is, and likely future directions plus implications for the Web. I also feel the author skipped over the period in Spring 1995 when ISPs' ability to dynamically allocate dot addresses opened up the Web to those of us who were mystified by the TCP/IP stack. This appeared to lead to the explosive success of the Web among ordinary folk."},{"rating":"2","title":"OH, WHAT A WEB WE WEAVE......","review":"While he doesn't enjoy the fame or fortune of a mega mortal such as Bill Gates, Tim Berners-Lee is more than a major player in the world of the Web - he invented it. Dubbed one of the greatest minds of the 20th century by Time magazine, Berners-Lee is a visionary who relates how he created the World Wide Web, and what it means.He describes the Web's true nature, some of which helps us use it to better advantage. In addition, he offers his thinking regarding censorship, privacy, and the titan-like companies that have evolved.Now director of the World Wide Web Consortium, Berners-Lee has provided a lucid and compelling outline of today and tomorrow.- Gail Cooke"},{"rating":"2","title":"Insightful but ends in obscurity","review":"This is a must-read for any postmodern Web developer. Helps keeps your eyes from succumbing to tunnel vision ideas like web 2.0.TimBL tells his story and provides a great explanation of his intention for what the Web really is. Points out that really the Web is only half done, and should spawn some really great killer app ideas for any smart developer.The latter half of the book seems filled with Tim's unclear ideas for the future, which are unclear because he doesn't know. Getting too old to see any further perhaps? Such is the fate of all visionaries.If you're a developer, read this book. It's a quick one."},{"rating":"2","title":"A book of two halves","review":"For the non-techie this is a good book to understand what drove Berners-Lee to invent the Web.The first half provides an interesting history leading up to the present day.The second half details Berners-Lees' thoughts about the present - day web and his vision for the future . I found this half less interesting and could have been improved by reducing the word count devoted to his philosophising on the world.If you have a passing interest in the Web,read the first half.Anything more than a passing interest then the whole book is worth a read."},{"rating":"1","title":"I expected more...","review":"Another book I read for class. I knew a little about Margery Kempe beforehand, like she had 14 children. I didn't know that the first autobiography ever written in English was so boring.

I don't think I would pick this up unless you are specifically interested in early Christianity writings."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is a love story...with a sting in the tail","review":"It's about a life together that could have been perfect, but for a secret.The book's \`blurb' warns of disaster, but there's no hint while you're reading it when or who it will strike. The story accelerates and events suddenly spin out of control. There are lots of interesting twists in the storytelling but the final twist (and sting) comes out of the blue - my only criticism is that it is a bit far fetched, and though you feel sorry for the characters, you're not entirely sure you should.Although the book is unevenly paced it didn't at any point lose my interest."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good,but it was the usual \\"men bad,women good \\"movie","review":"This movie was good,but it was the usual,run-of-the-mill \\"men bad,women good\\" movie.Like \\"Enough\\",the acting was good,but the storyline was just another \\"abusive husband\\" thing..."},{"rating":"2","title":"From Michigan","review":"I thought it was good concidering it seems that one of the Other Reviews forgot that this was not just a Hollywood Made movie It really did happen I know one of the kids and it was not at all easy for any of them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Farrah's Best!","review":"If Farrah didn't receive an award for this movie, she was seriously robbed!

I still think this is an excellent movie and I am glad that I watched it. I saw this movie a few years ago and read the book about a year ago. The book blew me away, there were several horrific parts that should have been added to the movie to really tell the true story, its shocking.

I found it very readable and interesting. It says a lot about Horowitz' and his wife's personalities in later years. Of course it says a lot about the author's own personality as well, but I don't agree with one of the reviewers who say that the author seems \\"self-absorbed\\".

Please avoid it and turn to something other than this self-serving waste of trees."},{"rating":"2","title":"Warrior ethics never change!","review":"It is amazing to me that such a small book can cover so many deep and life changing principles. This is not just a code of conduct for warriors it really should apply to all people. The concepts of loyalty, bravery, and honor are brought out and explained in a clear straightforward manner. I really enjoyed reading this book though I have never trained in martial arts or studied anything about the samurai. I became interested because of our American warriors overseas and decided to give this a read. I am blown away that all the same principles apply to warriors today as several hundred years ago."},{"rating":"2","title":"Quite a lot of fun!","review":"It was soooooo much fun putting this thing together! I am quite amazed at the level of detail which was put into this kit. Moving pistons, a working differential, working steering, real rubber tires, a rocker-arm assembly, and the back section raises up on a spring-loaded air-pistion! Amazing! There are whole sections in the fat instruction book just for certain parts of the car. And the instruction book is fantastic. There are no words, only excellent pictures, showing every little step, piece-by-piece.

There is no doubt that anyone having problems with Yad Vashem (as this author does, arguing that the Grand Mufti of Jerusalem should not have been included in the exhibit, never mind that he was a major reason Jews could not go to Palestine to escape the holocaust) has to be at least a bit anti-semitic and anti-Israel There are other problems in this guide. Having been in Israel many times before, I agree that this guide has many items other guides do not have. But the tone and the bias of the author is hard to overlook. I suggest you look elsewhere for a more balanced view. All in my opinion, of course. I'd have preferred giving it no stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"I want more!","review":"Gideon's Wall left me with a hunger for a stack of books just like it. It's been far too long since a story has taken me in as such. No necklines and sighs, no kidstuff, no rambling, no re-told D&D sessions, no kidding!Falling closer to the line of a speculative-fiction/fantasy hybrid, the creative voice that resonates throughout is a believable one.It has a good flow and I can honestly say I cared about the main characters--unfortunately very rare for me. Even though the book is fairly clear throughout concerning their fate, I found the ending to be very 'European' and I didn't want to deal with it.But I'll be all right.All in all, four out of five thumbs up."},{"rating":"2","title":"Heroic Fantasy at its Best","review":"Gideon's Wall is heroic fantasy at its best. A straightforward tale without any of the silly trappings and tired cliches of standard fantasy. This is about soldiers called to fight in a war they cannot win. Period. Kurzawa's writing is vivid, and he outlines the triumphs and sorrows of his characters with great skill. Gideon's Wall holds no punches. This book is highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Seems to me like a good read","review":"I was encouraged to read this by a colleague of mine and, at first, I was hesitant: I'm not one to read a lot of fiction/fantasy. I finally gave in and I have to admit I rather enjoyed it. The build up was slow but neccesary to set the tone and atmosphere for the plot.

Then I listened to the retail version and the beats just weren't as good. \`Stand Clear', which was originally featured on an Adam F project, was one of my favorite M.O.P. songs. This version butchered it and showed it no justice. \`Ante Up' (listed as \`Robbin' Hoodz' here), their most famous single to date, was also butchered.

Returning to Vincent of Lerins and others, he feels this is it. However, he makes no effort to refute the Bibical admonition to find such unity in all of God's words, e.g. John 17 and Mt. 28:20.

After purchasing 4 bad devices in a row I am done with this company."},{"rating":"1","title":"Battery issues","review":"This is a great product -while it works! Within 6 moths after buying the product (or ten times of usage) the collar stopped working due to some issue with the battery charging."},{"rating":"2","title":"Petsafe PDT00 Ttrainer","review":"This product is wonderful! We saw it mentioned on \\"The Dog Whisperer\\" (not a commercial) and looked for it as we were not happy with the shock collar we already had. That one had only \\"tone\\" or \\"tone and shock\\" and, although the shock wasn't horrible (I tested it on myself first), it was a \\"shocker.\\" This Petsafe Trainer is great because you can set the levels down to just a mild tingle to remind the dog without shocking. We love our German Shepherd dog and hate the thought of her being shocked but think of it as \\"tough love\\" as something had to be done. This was the humane answer. She has become well behaved and normally doesn't have to even wear it anymore.Both collar and transmitter recharge off the same power supply (\\"Y\\" cord) and it will signal you when charging is done. It has 3 buttons that you can program for tones and tingles in many different combinations and levels. This was obviously made by someone who knows and loves dogs. Highly recommended!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Training lifesaver","review":"I purchased this product for my 100 lb. Doberman. I was having problems with him when cats were around, he would become so fixated on the cat and wouldn't respond to any commands. I am very impressed with the quality of this product, it seams to be very sturdy and well built and it works every time. My dog understood very quickly that if he didn't stop the behavior when told No that he was going to get shocked. Now I very rarely have to shock him, most times re responds to the verbal command right away. I strongly recommend this over a choke or pinch collar. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because I think the actual collar material seamed a little cheesy but so far it's holding up well."},{"rating":"1","title":"UNRELIABLE, NOT RECOMMENDED","review":"As soon as I charged the receiver and remote and tried it out the receiver stopped communicating with the remote. I called customer service and they told me how to reset the remote/receiver and then it worked for a few hours or so, then I would check it and receiver wasn't communicating with remote again. The second day I used it, I had to reset remote/receiver 3 times. I was so bummed it was so unreliable. I bought it to keep my Boston from chasing cars, so reliability is crucial. For $140 I would expect better quality. Highly unrecommended.I just bought the dogtra 175ncp for $175 and it is awesome, very reliable and the range works well on the ranch, and the charge stays good for many days, High quality. It also has a pager function that is really cool."},{"rating":"1","title":"No charge?","review":"I've trained all kinds of dogs, from shih tzus to huskies to collies with great success. But when my german shepherd came along, I was presented with a huge challenge - a profoundly stubborn 80lb girl with 'alpha issues'. I finally decided to get this remote trainer. It was very effective on her. I don't use the shock function; I just created positive and negative associations with the tones. It was working very well. The only problem is, the darn thing won't hold a charge for more than an hour. And Murphy's law dictates that every time she is performing an unwanted behavior, I press the button ... and yup, not a darn thing happens. So the training lacks any form of consistency .... which is of course, how a dog learns. Such a shame :("},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome","review":"I work with animals for a abuse and neglect shelter. This is an awesome tool. I know it is a controversial tool but used correctly its great. I have a very excited pitbull, the first night working with the collar I corrected many issues I had not been able to correct in over a year. I do not feel it is in any way abusive or mean. Most dogs that are deemed \\"UN-trainable\\" will be put in a shelter and killed. This is not a magic wand to replace regular walks and other training methods. Bottom line is it works great. It holds a charge, it's dependable and it works. I did try the settings on myself, I would not go past a 6 so I would not expect my dog to. A 6 got my attention.My dog knew what to do and knew the commands but would choose when to perform them. He would almost give me a look of \\"I don't feel like sitting now.\\" With the collar it gave him the reminder he needed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worked for about a year.","review":"This was a great collar for about a year. After that the whole thing just stopped working.Contacted Petsafe, ordered new batteries... toast. So I bought a Dogtra to replace it and love that one more.Before it died it was a pretty good collar. My only problems were with the transmitter and the collar not communicating all the time. I had to reset it multiple times. Within a few months of use, it was kind of unreliable, thankfully it was just a backup measure when we were out in the field, just in case my dog started to chase some critter.Spend the extra money for a Dogtra collar. While this is an OK collar for a few more bucks you can get a collar that is much better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best device ever!","review":"I've had this remote for 2 years now and it still works perfectly. We have an almost 3 year old Brittany and got this when she was 1 because we don't have a fenced yard but would like to be able to let her run around as we live near a semi-busy street. It was quick and easy to train her with this system. We put it on her EVERY time she goes out to the bathroom and she is good with it, its part of the routine. We've only had to actually use the \\"shock\\" feature 5 times or less, but the \\"warning\\" beep is perfect for the times she starts wandering off. We take it to parks where she can just run and run and we feel safe knowing that we have control of her if she would get off track. The quality is good and we only need to charge it once a month (we turn it on 3-4 times per day!). Our next house will have a fence but for now, this is a great solution. It doesn't hurt her or bother her too much, but its for her safety.

I read them afterwards, my problems were the same with those of others. The device didn't work properly. I did everything in the book, many things they don't mention. It eventually started working, but it was unreliable. Exactly what you need in this kind of a product. I live outside of US, for most of the year, so exchange was not a real option. I read on of the bad reviews, took its advice and bought a tri tonics which i have been using for a while now with no problems. So, if you don't think you'll be lucky, like most of the reviewers, and it is hard to exchange. I'd say go with tri tronics. They are good."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Reliable","review":"OK had to redo my review. Here we are about 3 months later and the product has become unreliable.

It took two times out for my wandering beagle to learn what her boundaries are. Before she would dash off into the woods after rabbits and squirrels and although I didn't mind that, it was the not coming back that was the problem. With the collar all I had to do was push the button that beeps, say \\"come\\" and she would come running back from whatever adventure she was in. Now we hardly even put the collar on because she listens to all of my commands instantly and stays close while I work in the yard or sit on the porch!I highly recommend this product for the weather resistance, long battery life, ease of use and light weight components!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Works well","review":"Bought this shock collar about a month ago and so far it has worked extremely well. We use the number 6 setting and always issue a tone for a warning prior to the shock and it only took about 3 times before our lab began to catch on.

It worked wonderfully for about that week, but after I recharged it last night, it now does not want to work properly.

I immediately check it again and he responds.Five minutes later it has stopped responding.

Once your dog learns that the bad dog sound means his or her behavior is unnacceptable, the need to shock is rarely if ever needed..The only gripe I have is that the collar doesn't hold a charge for very long and so i would advise turning it off when you are not in a position to need it.

Anna Maxted is definitely a fave of mine now. She writes in such a way that when I finish the book I feel as though I lost some friends. Every character is true to life & hysterically funny. She's very raw & blunt which makes her books really comical and twisted at times!Though the middle of the book took a surprisingly weird twist that I didn't remember reading in the 1st half of the book - it seemed to flow anyway.I recommend this book for any Getting OVer IT fans!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Ugh....I Never Believed in Book Burning Until Now","review":"Wow....what a terrible book. I wish I had read the reviews before I actually exchanged currency for this book. There was no character development whatsoever. Natalie is just a big mess and you actually wind up hating her in the worst way possible by the middle of the book. The ending (if you could call it that)was the most ridiculous thing. The author basically leaves the audience hanging. It is a terrible story, but at least give us a complete ending. This is the first book I've read by Ms. Maxted. Unfortunately, I don't think I'll be reading any more of them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another Amazing Hit!!","review":"I love Anna Maxted's work. She's such a talented and gifted storyteller. \\"Getting Over It\\" (her first work) is one of my favs and I have been eagerly anticipating her next novel. I was not disappointed. The levels and characters in this book are wonderful. She tells a story with such intelligence, care and thoughtfulness. I really enjoy her pace and character development. The story goes deeper than the usual \\"modern romance\\" and makes you work harder. You will completely enjoy this book - and feel satisfied with a job well done. I highly recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Newsflash: Natalie hates herself for nearly 300 pages...","review":"I couldn't wait to read this book - and I should have. Anna Maxted is a truly talented writer who, with Natalie, has created one of the most unsympathetic characters I've spent time with recently. If you're prepared to wallow along with Natalie in self-loathing and self-doubt, this is the book for you; we spend page after page watching Natalie's unrelieved downward spiral. Getting Over It was delightful because Helen's hapless foibles were like our own, but Running In Heels was a well-written bummer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Waste Your Time","review":"After being captivated by Maxted's writing the first for the first 1/4th of the book, I had to force myself to finish reading the rest of it and was ultimately disappointed. The book's cover misled me to believe that the book was about the main character's reaction to her best friend's new marriage -- an identifiable situation for many readers, right? I would feel sorry for anyone who has a friendship as lacking in communication as the one portrayed in this book. In any case, the book wasn't really about the friendship. It was about ... well, I'm still not sure if there was any real focus to the book other than the tedious semi-recovery and self-realization of a really pathetic and unlikeable main character in need of some serious therapy. I am sorry to have wasted my time and money on this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a downer!!","review":"I was so excited to see that Anna Maxted had a new book out, I snatched it off the shelf in a nanosecond. The sleeve will have you believe it's a story about a girl coming to terms with her best friend's marriage. Ummm...maybe for the first 10 pages anyway. It quickly turns into a depressing, confusing, and muddled plot line of a story with a character so unlikable, you'll wish there was a sequel to In the Drink to cheer you up. Even the friendship between Natalie and Babs is hard to understand. It seems like they hate each other. Frannie? Wait, wasn't she Rebecca in the Helen Fielding novels? Don't be fooled by the 400 pages, you'll power through this book in one day and then wonder why you even bothered. Boooooo! Hisssssss!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I would have given this book 5 stars, except","review":"I didn't like it. Haha. Anna Maxted has some great books, but this one really wasn't one of them. It's funny, with her standard awesome humor, but it just gets long and tedious, with the protagonist sabotaging herself at every opportunity. This was one Anna Maxted that I had trouble finishing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Modern Sympathy","review":"There's an old, old trick in the literary book which it's rare to do well: Take an unsympathetic stereotype and use a sympathetic treatment of it to illuminate the society reflected in the book. Think Madame Bovary, on a smaller and frothier scale. Maxted isn't the best at it, but I've seen a lot worse.Once you can take the imaginative leap of having sympathy for a character you'd love to hate instead, the book is a good read. It's clean, flowing and well-crafted. Not all the surprises are that surprising, and not all the funnies are very funny, but the dialogue is smooth and the narrative has good drive with few pointless excursions."},{"rating":"1","title":"...and twisting an ankle","review":"I loved the cover of this book enough to buy it, I'm sorry to say. And the first couple of chapters - read in the bookstore - were quite entertaining. This seemed to have all the Bridget-y elements: career girl with woeful man skills (but better, of course, than she thinks) and a slight pudge problem having entertaining social misadventures on the way to eventual Happy Ending. It's not a lot, but it's what I wanted.(*SPOILER ALERT,* if, technically, this sodden retread could be spoiled by me in the first place.)What I didn't want: Another damn anorexia story. That's what this is. I was duped - she only THINKS she's fat. Pardon me for sneering at a serious health issue, but come on - that's so predictable, so 80s! And the fun parts all dry up so we can suffer along with our tedious heroine. Bah."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your time or money!","review":"When I bought this book, I couldn't wait to read it! It sounded like it would be a fun, easy read, but I was TOTALLY wrong. I couldn't even get into at first. The characters were flat and there was no real, convincing relationship between them. The author went off on tangents that were totally irrevelant to the story and didn't make any sense. I started to get into the book by the middle, but instead of being the lighthearted, funny book I had hoped for, it turned out to be disturbing and depressing. The book was absolutely awful, talking about self-hatred and distorted body image. The synopsis on the back of the book was completely misleading. Don't waste your time or money on this horrible book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Did not grab my attention one bit","review":"After reading \\"Getting Over It,\\" I felt there was no other book that could top it, let alone come close to this wonderful novel.\\"Getting Over It\\" got me \\"hooked\\" on british lit/chick lit. I laughed out loud numerous times- needless to say, could NOT put the book down.I figured, of course, \\"Running in Heels\\" would fulfill my interests bc it was written by Maxted. Despite the reviews, I bought it. All I can say is:WHAT A MISTAKE!

I saw a small book review in a magazine and saw this title recommended so I tried it. I can easily say that this book was very realistic. Nothing was too overdone or not true to everyday life. It started off as what seemed to be a humorous account of relationships gone bad for the main character Natalie, but the farther you get into the book bigger problems surface that deal with how Natalie views others and most importantly herself.This was a great read because it kept you smiling but also brought into the mind of someone who is dealing with very hard decisions. I would highly recommend this book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Entertaining read","review":"I found Running In Heels an entertaining read to get me through my days at work...I also found myself reaching for it's pages afterwards at home. It's true that when I started it I thought \\"This is bridget Jones with a different name\\", but most of the chick lit books I've read are comparable and have quite similar situations to other books in the category. Each one has a special feature and in this one I thought it was her relationship with Babs. I thought their relationship was portrayed very life-like and well. Who hasn't gotten in a fight with their friends over something and wondered if they'd never speak again? I didn't quite understand the relevance of becoming a yoga master until the end, but it was well worth reading to understand it. I have, and will continue, to recommend this book to friends as a good read."},{"rating":"2","title":"slow start, good body, fine finish","review":"I feel that those reviewers who didn't like Natalie for being selfish have missed the point! I also found Natalie to be annoying and whiny and needy and everything that the negative reviews promise that she is. However, I thought that the book did a wonderful job of documenting the systematic breakdown of this woman's clean facade to expose the damage that she has done to her body and her mental health. The writing is rich and flavorful, and Maxted hits the female friend dynamic right on the money.My main criticisms are that the first part of the book drags and I thought that the romances were underdeveloped, although this could be a side effect of Natalie's emotional underdevelopment as anything (reviewer acknowledges that this is a stretch). This book would be a fun beach read, but it could also elicit some strong emotions from readers who have watched a friend succumb to anorexia."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't bother","review":"I, too, wish that I had read the reviews here before spending money on this book. It's not only that none of the characters are likeable -- I actively disliked them all, especially the main character. The story doesn't really go anywhere, either. I alternated between being bored and infuriated by this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Really Didn't like it.","review":"I am really big fan of \\"Chick-lit\\" and \\"Running in Heels\\" by Anna Maxted looked liked it would be a fun read. Well, I wasn't thirty pages into the book when I realized that it was really bad. Natalie Miller, has to most unappelling character ever. She got so many problems such as: eating disorder, relationship problems, parents problems, that I can't by the end of the book, which ones have been solved. The ending was the worst. Ms. Maxted just seemed to out of ideas, so the book just ended. This has to be one of the worst book that that I have read a long while, so just to your self the favor and don't read it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good novel","review":"I am surprised by the negative tone of the reviews here. I really enjoyed this book, I found it moving and funny and very believable. Yes, the heroine is somewhat selfish, but we are privy to her innermost thoughts and most of us would appear selfish if the world could hear our inner monologues! I liked the way the anorexia snuck up on the reader; since the book is from Natalie's point of view, that made sense to me. My only criticism - I loved the character of Babs and wanted more of her."},{"rating":"1","title":"What?","review":"I won't repeat what others have said other than to comment on the flow (or lack thereof) in this novel. It was poorly planned out--at first it felt like a typical entertaining \\"chick-lit\\" book--but then suddenly I felt like I dove head-first into a very sick person's psyche. Lots of random thoughts and emotions with little or no explanation or context. Having said that, this book is not without insight, but someone rushed this book through--probably due to the first novel's success--without properly editing it first."},{"rating":"2","title":"Intriguing","review":"I enjoyed this easy to read book. It is rather different from the typical romantic comedy book. The plot flows in so many different directions, but it does manage to keep you intrigued until the end. She truly loves her characters. I will definitely be giving her other books a try."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wickedly Delightful","review":"This book is an example of chick lit done correctly. Maxted does a fabulous job creating a main character who is completely zany, yet totally relatable. The book contained elements of surprise and at times I found myself laughing out loud. I would highly recommend it for anyone interested in an enjoyable and entertaining read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not good","review":"This book is not very good. I thought it would be different than it turned out. I really enjoyed \\"Getting Over It\\", but frankly, I'm sick of Bridget Jones' knockoffs, and the main character in \\"Running\\" is a pathetic one at best. Anna Maxed apparently thought that making insecure, \\"silly\\" Nataline anorexic (in addition to neurotic) would exceed her in character, but it just makes this novel all the more shallow and drab. You have to wonder the character of the author herself.....I got tired of reading it. Basically it was a big waste of money. It went into my recycle bin."},{"rating":"1","title":"What???","review":"I picked up this book thinking it would be about the friendship between Babs and Natalie, and it started out that way. Then, all the sudden, out of nowhere comes the anorexia. The plot jumped around so much, i couldn't figure out what it was supposed to be. And Natalie's solution, pilates, seemed pretty farfetched. The book would've been a lot better if the author had picked a topic and stuck to it as opposed to exploring so many differnt things."},{"rating":"1","title":"what a book...","review":"seriously, i had never read a book that made me want to punch a hole in the wall! Until I read more than half-way through this book. Seriously, I ABSOLUTELY HATE the main character, Natalie. I wonder why they would concentrate the story on her, or even include someone like her in a novel. I understand that some people are as such, but why waste the time writing a whole novel about her?? she was not interesting AT ALL. Very Very VERY annoying. I wish I would've known before I purchased this book (at Barnes & Noble). I tried really hard to like this book, but alas... she kept getting worste as the book progressed."},{"rating":"1","title":"How did this get published????","review":"I found this on the bargain rack, but I think I paid way too much! I dutifully plowed through it, but Natalie Miller, the main character, besides being totally unlikable, is also totally unfathomable. The book jumps from sub-plot to sub-plot, with no analysis or warning.It could have been good, if some editor had taken the time to read it, and not just cash in on the success of the author's other book (which I confess to not reading, and now have very little desire to!)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Very Funny","review":"I have read a few of Ms Maxted's books and I find them humorless. Since went has anorexia and self loathing funny. This has been a constant theme in many of her novels. Marian Keyes is a far wittier writer than Maxted"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not very good","review":"One of the worst chick-lit stories I've read in a while. Natalie, the main character, is incredibly messed up with food issues and anxiety about being left behind. You find yourself working through her issues with her and not understanding where she is coming from. It seems like she is developed in such a poor manner that you don't even understand what her deal is. I would not recommend anyone reading this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as good as Ms. Maxted's novel Getting over it","review":"After reading the novel Getting over it, I was excited to find Running in Heels! I loved Anna Maxted's first novel and couldn't wait to read Running in Heels. Unfortunately, my expectations were very high. Although both novels were brilliantly written, the subject matter of Running in Heels is most distressing. A quarter of the the way through the book it's revealed that the main character is losing control and has become anorexic. From that point on there was much discussion of her disease by her friends and family & how she was chosing to deal with it (denial). I thought I was getting a light novel about a 20something trying to make it in the world, but I got a novel about an anorexic coping & there was no forewarning. It was sad not comical and I wish I hadn't started the book. I did finish it, only to find out if she would get well or not, but I wanted to warn others who might think this book is about an ordinary girl."},{"rating":"2","title":"funny, funny, funny","review":"I diagree with the reviewers looking for a big \\"heavy\\" book.

It's just a great, fun read."},{"rating":"1","title":"running in place...","review":"I adored Maxted's first novel, and had great expectations for her second. After reading it, I am glad I didn't buy it. The story of Nat's eating disorder is not so much as even mentioned until about 100 pages into the book, which I found to be odd. Being that it is so vital to Natalie's character, it should have been mentioned alot sooner. The characters are somewhat likeable, even though at times I felt really frustrated with Natalie's spineless-ness, and felt like giving her a slap across the face. I didn't really find much humor in this book either. It could have been alot shorter if Maxted would have cut out all the unecessary self-analyzation by Natalie and pointless flashbacks. That is not to say I am no longer a fan of Maxted; I will still read her third novel. I swallowed up Getting Over It in about 2 days. However, with this book I found myself putting it down for days at a time. Take this one out from the library and save yourself the money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hated this Book!","review":"I really disliked this book.I can't say that about many books. Especially when they come as recommended as this one. If you read the back this looks like a funny \\"Bridget Jones - Diary\\" or \\"Amanda's Wedding\\" type of story. I was looking for a funny story centered around Natalie trying to adjust to Bab's marriage and maybe finally finding a real boyfriend to love.Be forewarned what the back of the book does not tell you is that it turns into a story about how Natalie turns into and anorexic and basically looses all her friends and how she deals with her new druggie boyfriend while her fair is falling out.The book became so depressing mid way through it was painful to finish reading, I finished as the writing was ok but I kept hoping that the story would get better. Geesch. I can't recommend this one to anyone!The jacket for the book was VERY misleading!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your time or money!","review":"I truly enjoyed \\"Getting Over It\\" by Anna Maxted, which is why I was shocked at how bad this book was. It seems like a first draft that was never edited. The plot is all over the place, the characters are flat and unlikeable, and the writing reads like stream of consciousness. I usually read almost every book I pick up through to the end (regardless of how bad), but I found nothing redeemable in this book to keep me reading past the middle.

That's exactly what is it. The advise is exclusively for injuries from taekwondo - predominately impact injuries from sparring. The author says absolutely nothing about any other martial art including the grappling arts of judo, jujutsu, submission wrestling and NHB. Thus there are an entire class of injuries that are not addressed by this book.

It has a powerful comparation with the old paradigms of Business"},{"rating":"1","title":"It really addressed the challenges of the mid-1990s","review":"The book was disappointing since what Mr. Drucker views as the management challenges of the 21st century are really the management challenges that have been with us for most of this decade. For example, his \\"new paradigms\\" include the aging population and the increase in shareholder influence. His \\"new challenges\\" include the increased availability of information, managing knowledge workers and the constantly changing organisation. This is hardly insightful to anyone who has managed, or simply worked, in a corporation in the last decade. One bright light - the final chapter on \\"Managing Oneself\\" is like a nice pep talk from a favourite grandfather."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not his most relevant work for electronic marketers","review":"I read Peter Drucker for what he says that is relevant to electronic marketing strategy. His earlier collections, like \\"Managing in a Time of Great Change,\\" have been foresightful and though-provoking. His latest book mostly revisits previous themes, and otherwise spends too much time on things like the birth rate. If you haven't read Drucker, then this book, like all his work, is well worth it. But if you follow his work, this book won't \\"change the world\\" for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Info","review":"I highly recommend this book for beginners, as well as advanced bodybuilders/people. The content is excellent and gives research-backed information and advice. As avid followers of MM and EAS probally know, this book contains a lot of previously printed material from those sources. Nonetheless, it is an excellent book for learning new strategies about nutrition and training, or even reinforcing what you may already know.The key to the program is the \\"Life\\" word. This is truly a \\"life\\" endeavor. To acheive optimal results, and to continue those gains over an extended period of time, you must literally change the way you live, eat, and perceive things. However, even adopting a few of the techniques of the program will net sufficient gains.Highly recommended! Also, I have been following B.Phillips' work for almost 10 years and he is undoubtebly one of the pioneers of the sport, as well as a reputable individual who truly cares about his customers."},{"rating":"1","title":"BILL IS FULL OF BULL","review":"Bill is so full of himself and his company and this book just confirms it. I don't know if you all have seen his video, but let me tell you, this guy is all about making the almightly $$$ and inflating his ego even more. His \\"contests\\" are nothing more than promotions for folks to buy his over-priced EAS suppliments. I made the mistake of buying some of his products and now I'm stick on both his e-mail and mailling lists. To his credit, this man knows how to market and I was one of the fools who fell for it.I wouldn't recommend this book to anyone...you can get the same information FREE from Bill from his various promo items. I agree with the comment several others have made... his staff must be giving the 5 stars because any person who actually read the book wouldn't.Good luck Bill...all I can say is someday you'll get yours. Enjoy your corporate jet."},{"rating":"1","title":"Some serious problems","review":"I just finished the book and I noticed some serious problems. As someone who has been lifting weights for several years, I have a real problem with his lack of warm-up or cool-downs. No one in their right mind would just pick up a weight and start lifting. That is a prescription for disaster! As far as the aerobics go, I like the idea of the intervals, but 20 minutes? Study after study has shown that you need to have your heart rate up for 30 minutes or more. I'll keep my aerobic workouts longer, thank you. Finally, his nutrition information. Where, in the grand plan, is 5-9 servings of fruits and vegetables a day? You need the fiber, not just the nutrients (which are available in the supplements?) I agree with other reviewers, you many be getting a buff body out of this plan, but where is the health? Like any other book, I'll keep some ideas, but the majority of the book will not be used."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just Like Any Other Fitness Book","review":"There's nothing here that you probably don't already know. Nothing that you couldn't find for free at your public library. Does the program work? If you follow it. However, isn't that true of just about any somewhat rational diet/exercise regimen? I lost 40 lbs. by simply reducing my portion sizes, walking daily, and working out with weights. I understand many of us want a cheerleader, a motivator, some \\"expert\\" to tell us what to do, when the hard part is just getting on with it, and doing something. Buy the book if you have little or no access to diet/exercise info."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wrong, wrong, wrong!","review":"Although Phillips' exercise regimen is, I think, a reasonable one, and he's clearly a good motivational speaker, I found the book infuriating for two reasons:1) It's a prolonged advertisement for Phillips' nutritional supplements business. It IS possible to be fit and healthy without taking all that overpriced stuff!2) His definition of \\"fit\\" is limited to those who are buffed and slender. This isn't unique to him, of course. But the idea that you have to be buffed and slender or you're not \\"fit\\" has, I think, discouraged a lot of people from pursuing exercise regimes that are more appropriate for their personal needs. The goal, after all, is not just \\"fitness\\" but HEALTH, and someone who's fat and old but takes a half-hour walk every day is probably generally healthier than someone who spends 12 weeks on Phillips' regimen and then gives it up because they don't have the time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Exersize","review":"This book has a lot of good information and it is easy to understand.

However, if gaining muscle mass is your main concern, don't bother even trying this. The program does not allow you to eat enough in order to gain weight. By the way, the only way to actually gain weight is to eat a surplus of calories. EAS supplements do work, but so do many others that cost much less. Do yourself a favor, by Bill's magazine, Muscle Media AS WELL AS others and be your own judge. Find out what works best for you and stick to that. Don't be convinced that Bill Phillips is the only fitness expert around. Most of all, don't buy this book unless you have no knowledge at all of fitness or bodybuilding."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can't judge a book by it's cover...","review":"You are right! You can't judge a book by its cover. If you judged this book by its cover it would be a five star book. When you dig a little deeper and acutally read the book without allowing the hype to get in the way, you will find its not all it claims to be. I wish you the best in your search for a better physique, I wish you the best in being able to avoid this hype."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not An Effective Program","review":"This is the most expensive book I've ever bought- it cost me over two months of my life! I followed the program faithfully with great enthusiasm and optimism, only to see precious little change over nine weeks' time. I think it is probably an appropriate plan for relatively lean people who want better muscle definition, but it is not effective for weight loss."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too complicated for me","review":"I was looking for a good weight training book and found this one much too complicated and time consuming. Basically you do about six sets on each weight. The routine took over 45 minutes and wasn't very fun. Fortunately I have my own equipment. I can't imagine doing this at a health club with people waiting for the machines."},{"rating":"2","title":"Satisfied","review":"It definitely takes some work to follow this program, However anything that is worthwhile and long lasting takes work and sacrifice. So I am satisfied with this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Body for Life: I Dont Think So","review":"This book will not help someone who is looking to change their lifestyle for more than 12 weeks (If you can stick to the program that long). The manner in which the program expects you to eat is impossible for any normal person (unless you love nutitional shakes). The only thing that this book will give you is a hole in your wallet."},{"rating":"2","title":"IT REALLY WORKS!!!","review":"I'm a 37 year old mom who's never been completely happy with my body.

I can see changes and I feel strong! I haven't used any of Phillip's supplements.I have a treadmill and small set of dumbells in my garage. All you really need is a desire to change and the knowledge that you can! JUST DO IT! The only thing in your way is YOU! You CAN change your body!"},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointing","review":"Really nothing revolutionary about the book or the program. Basic workout routines and the non-revolutionary concept of eating a bunch of small meals a day rather that the traditional three.The disturbing thing I find about it is that this is really just a way to sell \\"nutritional\\" supplements.When I inquired as to participating in the Body For Life Challenge I found out that the one requirement was that you use Bill Phillip's Myoplex supplements in order to qualify. You don't even have to use the exercise eating program, you just *have* to use the supplements. That should tell you something. All the advertising, etc., that come with the book and the program are geared at you buying these products."},{"rating":"2","title":"Some great ideas, minus the supplement hype.","review":"This is a great book designed for individuals who are looking for weight loss. It's easy to understand, and doesn't confuse the reader with all of the technical jargon that can make a person quit eating right and exercising. It does tend to push EAS supplements (a requirement to enter the contest) and although convenient, there are other, less expensive ways to get the recommended 6 meals per day. Having participated in the contest and doing well in the 12 weeks of time, I must admit that some aspects will help the reader/user achieve their goals, the workouts are a good starting point, and the concept of the free-day, although not revolutionary, is well founded with scientific research."},{"rating":"2","title":"A book for beginners","review":"Phillips, a great motivator, details EXACTLY what to do and how to shape a quality physique. Although the information about training and diet is elementary to experienced trainers, the goal setting and motivation techniques are very applicable. Mind set and motivation are the most important protocols in any endeavor, so it only makes sense they are the core of the program to go along with a precise diet/exercise strategy. Training and eating strategies in this book are easy to follow and are detailed in full. It would be hard NOT to get good results following this book to the word."},{"rating":"1","title":"All Fluff! No Real Content","review":"It is sad to see a such a useless book get so much hype and publicity.

But no one I know, including myself, has ever been able to stay on this program. And don't kid yourself, it's a program that involves intensive(though brief periods of)excersize. There is nothing wrong with excersize, I do it, I enjoy it and it's good for you. But realistically you have to eat right (good fats) to not have cravings and hunger, having cravings is a sure-fire way way to NOT follow a diet. I would not recommend this to anyone simply because it's not a program people stick with. This author is also a big promoter of \\"his\\" weight-loss and protein products, which are expensive and can be bought in other forms much cheaply. I'd pass and go with a diet program that promotes healthy fats, low carb and low protein. It's the only way I've ever been able to lose weight, keep it off, feel good and have success sticking to."},{"rating":"1","title":"Book is a waste of time","review":"I had heard alot about this book, and really hoped that it could help me get back into shape. It didn't. The author shamefully uses this book to push the supplements he sells. Mr. Phillips seems to know alot about bodybuilding, but not how to apply it to an average person who needs to lose weight. He obviously does not have a backround in nutrition and has not done his research. This book was really a waste of time and money. The only thing Mr. Phillips has done well is con people into buying his advertisement."},{"rating":"1","title":"something better","review":"Myself and 4 friends didn't get any results from this book.I saw a review for another website and ended up using it to lose 23 pounds in 3 months - and i'm still losing.

Pick up any issue of MuscleMedia and you can find the same information (it doesn't take much thought to realize why MuscleMedia sales are at their lowest levels in years). This information has been rehashed by Mr. Phillips time and time again (and by countless others before him). Bill Phillips fancies himself a new age fitness guru ready to help you if you help him buy his new Lamborghini. Some of MuscleMedia's former writers have started a web site with good insight into this industry (steroids, steroids, steroids)."},{"rating":"1","title":"BE FORWARNED","review":"Remember before you even think of buying this book that there are a few prerequisites before you can even think of getting started. 1.) The required excercises must be done in a gym. 2.) You need 20 minutes 3 days a week, and 45 minutes 3 days a week for the excercises. 3.) The program relies heavily on supplements which happen to be manufactured by the author's former employer. So besides the investment of the book (Which you don't even need because all the info is free on the web site for free), you need a gym membership and a budget for supplements. Be careful if you are a novice dieter or weightlifter--this is not for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"The problem is not the book it's the Supplements","review":"The book may be fine but the problem is that Most of EAS's products including Myoplex has Aspartame (Nutrasweet) which turns into formaldihyde once inside the body! It is also a neurotoxin which kills brain cells! By the way Nutrasweet is the most toxic substance ever approved by the FDA and should be avoided! This is why I won't use EAS Products or any program that I must consume Aspartame several times day! That is why I can't recommend this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"To be totally fair...","review":"I used to be an enormous fan of Philips and Muscle Media before their change in image lately. However, MM as a whole is not what should be commented on in reviewing this book.You can generally find as good or better information than this in the books at your local library as well as at websites. For that matter, researching \\"fitness\\", \\"weight training\\" on a powerful search engine will probably turn up as much information as you can learn here.The motivation aspect of this book is lauded a great deal. If it's motivation you lack, then pick up a book by a good self-help author like Stephen Covey or Tony Robbins.All in all, unless you have dreams of winning one of EAS's contests, you honestly do not need Philips or this book for anything."},{"rating":"2","title":"Real solution to physical fitness!","review":"Fitness made easy could be the subtitle of this book. Of course, you've gotta stay with it, but it ain't hard. It's one of the best guides on physical fitness that I've read in many years. Certainly, this book is a motivating read.

Most of the material is simply reprints of articles he has printed in his MUSCLE MEDIA magazine.

It is one big pep talk."},{"rating":"2","title":"What a great body-shock to get me moving!","review":"I love fitness books. I think this one particularly beneficial because, frankly, it's realistic. We're not all trying to compete. Also, it focused on not just your body but also the importance of the mind in this whole healthy process. The quotation book \\"Timeless Wisdom\\" is also a great book to help get your thoughts in shape... the first step in attaining any goal."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why only one star?","review":"First off let me say that Bill Phillips is running a business. Of course he is in it for profit. He should profit from his work and he does quite well from MuscleMedia, EAS, NeoElite, USR, etc. I'm happy to see him donate book profits to charity, good for him. Now why do I give his book one star? This book is too much of an advertisement for his products. I felt like I bought a book telling me how my life will change with Amway. Maybe my life will change if I get involved with Amway but I don't want to read a book about it. Second, Bill's program does not contain any new information. Basically the book is a rehash of Bill's magazine and other fitness books. Third, Bill's tone is a bit much. Bill strokes his ego more than the average bear.This book is a one star book to counter all those 5 star reviews. If the positive reviews were honest they would give this book three stars, as it deserves."},{"rating":"1","title":"A book for beginners who know nothing about fitness","review":"The sad truth is that a very large part of the population is obese or don't work out at all.

The obese and out of shape people will reach the same if not better results by doing virtually any exercise. When you are in that poor condition, whatever you do will improve your pathetic shape. If you have any experience at all of working out, don't buy this book. It's a waste of time."},{"rating":"1","title":"A load of BS!!!","review":"What is so different about this book and ANY magazine you buy at the good ol' corner store.

I also used the recommended supplements, and I went from 178 pounds 25 % body fat to 155 pounds 8.5 % body fat in 12 weeks. I would highly recommend this eat right/exercise routine because there is no counting calories, you never get hungry and you have dramatic results with only 4 hours a week in exercise. The photographs are not fakes, my photos were just as impressive as those printed in the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Body for Life","review":"I am pleased with the purchase, timely shipping and service.

Thanks for asking."},{"rating":"1","title":"im starving on this regime!","review":"there is no big secret to the success here. consume less calories and burn more. i felt faint the whole time i was doing this program. i was starving! and my god, a can of tuna fish with non fat mayo? i'd rather eat cardboard. unfortunatley, this diet leaves you feeling hungry and weak with the only thing to look forward to being your next \\"meal\\" of a \\"portion\\" of pasta the size of your fist with a little lemon juice on top mmmm!mmmm!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Overhyped","review":"I've seen my wife bring home various exercise and fitness books - this is just one more of the same. One of the strengths touted of this book is the support group behind it. When we tried to use that support group, we received no response. The book can be summed up easily: Lift weights, do aerobics, and eat lots of protein. Now you know, save yourself some dough."},{"rating":"1","title":"mostly a waste of time","review":"don't buy this book...it is a waste of time and paper...everything in it is common sense and could be said in a few words: eat healthy small portions and exercise daily and drink lots of water...it was not motivating at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stay Away","review":"All this is is a motivtional book. This book is filled with all sorts of just fluff and filler. It has a little bit of fitness and food advice, but not near enough to warrent even 2 stars. I feel very [disappointed] by this book. Buyer beware, and I'm advising you to beware."},{"rating":"1","title":"A total waste of money and shelf space","review":"I purchased this book thinking that it would provide a guided program for working out and body building. The author wrote much about the concepts and the theories but failed to provide the promised program. He kept encouraging the reader to start the program which he promising to talk about later in the book, but he never got to talking about it. I flipped the pages back and fourth and found no concrete program to follow. Concepts and promises of providing the program later is all you get. If you know that muscles are good for you and can be built by working out three times a week for twenty minutes and doing aerobics in between, you already know most of what this book has to offer. If not, you know it by now!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The diet depends on supplements and is not for vegetarians.","review":"I read many of the reviews before I purchased the book but have decided to return the book because you do need the supplements to make the diet work. I'd say having 3 shakes a day for 12 weeks is a big part of the program! Also, this is not a diet for vegetarians."},{"rating":"2","title":"This works.","review":"My uncle is 59 years old and in great shape. I asked him what his secret was, and he told me about this book. SO, I tried it myslef. It works. I have lost 15 pounds since working this program in about 7 weeks. My waist is smaller, and I've dropped a pant size. I am using holes in my belt that I haven't used in quite some time. Even better, I am stronger and healthier.It works because it's not a gimmik. This is NOT a diet. This is a way of life that average people like me can manage. I've never been hungry while doing this. In just a few weeks I noticed a difference... and more importantly, my wife noticed. I am 37 years old, and I feel better than I have for a long time. I look better too. I have new confidence in my daily life.I highly recommend this book. Life isn't about dieting and being miserable for a couple of months and then falling back into bad habits. Body for Life is about being realistic, enjoying life, and beign healthy."},{"rating":"2","title":"good book","review":"I followed the book and lost 40 bls in 16 weeks. very good plans set up for work out and diet."},{"rating":"2","title":"Almost halfway through,amazed by results.","review":"Wow, what varying opinions here. A very interesting comment from some wannabe claiming that the photos are doctored. If they are, fine. I haven't taken any photos of myself, but the results are amazing. Energy through the roof, twenty pound weight loss (10 to go) muscle definition for the first time ever, and time to enjoy my life, wife and kids. Oh yes, and no hunger or mood swings either. Fat pants to the back of the closet, size 34 back to the front.For those of you who don't like the idea of 20 minutes of aerobics,do 30 like I do. All I know is that I sure feel better now doing interval training. Did Bill Phillips publish this book to make more money by selling supplements? Probably. Do I care? Absolutely not!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This book has all the right tools for being Fit-for-Life.","review":"I had read about this book in Bill's magazine called Muscle Media, and my life hasn't been the same since. This book provides one of the easiest nutrition programs ever while also being the best ever. You can choose your foods and you don't even need to count calories, grams, or anything, just portions. Portions, described by Bill, are the size of your fist. After reading about his Nutrition for Life method I could not wait to test it out. Because of the variety in all of your meals your body gets it all. I put on muscleand felt energized all day. He does try to sell his Myoplex shake to replace a couple of the small meals but I saw results even without his product. It is the best and will stay the best overall fitness book I have ever read and I will continue using the methods described in it the rest of my life."},{"rating":"2","title":"This program WILL work","review":"Even looking at the poor reviews for this book one thing is certain, if you eat right and excercise properly you will loose fat and gain muscle. The best part of this book however is how it makes the entire process VERY easy to follow. You don't worry about calories at all. You follow the basic guidlines and you will loose weight.For all of the na sayers who claim this pushes supplements I say read the book again. The suppliments are not necessary as Bill Phillips mentions. If you have the time and desire to cook 6 meals a day, do it...if not, get a supplement.You can't loose with this book....I am living proof and the only reason I bought the book is because a friend of mine had such amazing results with it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Proof is in the pudding...","review":"Body for Life is not the ultimate solution to our weight and health problems...it is merely a tool with which, by choice, we can use to enrich and add years to our lives. \\"Choice\\" being the key word primarily because it is up to YOU to make the change in your life. Mr. Phillips provides a detailed, healthy guide to attaining a goal. Easy it is to blame others for our own lack of action... wearing those pants that fit 5 years ago, or a bathingsuit with complete self assurance - Just Do It! It feels great and Bill Phillips asthetically reflects the fact that he lives, eats and breathes his program."},{"rating":"1","title":"I don't need a guru","review":"Having read this book, I'm not surprised about all the positive reviews. Giving this negative review I feel like the one person in Jonestown saying \\"Don't drink the Kool-Aid!\\" Weak people need a leader, someone to tell them how to think and feel, someone to program their actions. The masses tend to search these people out and raise them to demi god status. I understand your desire to have someone make each decision for you but Bill Phillips' is not worthy of your praise. Phillips is building a small fortune on the weak. Do you need this? Would you have swallowed the Kool-Aid? Buy into fitness, not a cult."},{"rating":"1","title":"OK for beginners to Weight Training & Bodybuilding","review":"Having read a recent exerpt from \\"Body for Life\\" in Bill Phillip's Musclemedia magazine, I thought the book would get into a lot more detail than the article. I found the beginning to be nothing more than testimonials from individuals and couples who all said the program changed their lives-inspirational yes, but I can get that from Bill's magazines & his ads for his supplements. I was looking for more of a direct approach (\\"here's how to do this, why it works the way it does, and how it applies to you\\"). Instead, I feel I read a slightly longer excerpt from his magazine with really no added information. For someone who needs advice on weight training or bodybuilding, and who has really never done research before, this book may be a good find."},{"rating":"1","title":"Republished Magazine Articles","review":"Body for Life is a compilation of author Bill Phillips' magazine MuscleMedia. About 75% of the book was already published in the magazine at one time and I would be willing to bet the other 25% will appear within the next 6 months. The workout itself is very good. I have tried it before, because it was in the magazine about 2 months ago, and if done correctly does produce results. The diet section leaves a lot to be desired. All in all, I feel it is a below average book that can be read by looking at the last two issues of MuscleMedia."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the Greatest Guides to Fitness!","review":"This book is really easy to understand. It gives you the knowledge and skills to transform your body into a fit body. We've read it again and again."},{"rating":"2","title":"A book worth its weight in Gold","review":"I have read the book, and I am currently on day 12. This is a must read for anypne looking to make a drastic change in their life. I have put on one pound of muscle, and can finally see shadows of my stomach muscles. Thank you Bill Phillips!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Did not meet expectations.","review":"I was truly disapointed by Bill Phillips' book. I was expecting some new revelation that would motivate me to work out. It did not move me at all. I thought some of the stories were good but the training methods were stuff you could find anywhere. I take the EAS products and they are fantastic. Overall, this book was a quick read and not worth the price. Get it in your local library for the stories."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book could have been on third the size...","review":"This book could have fit into 100 pages. It would have been a hundered page book if you took out the EAS references and repeated information from the mighty Bill. Ever since I saw Bill on Oprah I knew his tune had changed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wake up","review":"People, people wake up. Bill Phillips is out to do nothing but to make money and push his supplements on you. There is NOTHING amazing in this book except the same rhetoric you'll find in his \\"no holds barred\\" sections of Muscle Media, a magazine that I do like. But this book is seriously nothing but a big advertisement with a few simple exercises in it. Don't belive the hype. You CAN lose weight WITHOUT supplements these days. Think about it, before all these supplements people still looked good and lost weight right? You DONT need supplements and you DONT need this book. All it takes is old-fashion hard work. Put in the work and the results will come."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great source for common sense fitness and nutrition","review":"The book is easy to read and contains a simple common sense approach to overall fitness and nutrition. The book goes a little over the top on the inspiration side but generally the book is detailed and specific and contains useful information. I tried the 12 week challenge presented in the book and experienced tremendous results and have seen the same happen to others who tried it. I would recommend this book to anyone who feels like they are in a fitness and nutrition rut and need a kick start."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's SIMPLE yet so many people are still out of shape","review":"Sure, it may sound the same BUT this plan allows you to eat and doesn't recommend a long workout at the gym for a healthy body. And unlike Joe Weider, Phillips does not promote steroid bodybuilders as the epitome of health and fitness. Don't blame Phillips because he pushes supplements (and owns EAS), because Weider does the same thing. The critic/skeptic that tries to undermine the information here does an injustice to the thousands of people that have been helped because of this information. Phillips talks the talk and walks the walk. Not too many supplement manufactures and fitness magazine owners can say the same thing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simple and effective","review":"I have read dozens of fitness books and Body for Life is one of the most simplistic, easy-to-follow fitness books for beginners that I have come across. Beginners be warned that much of the training is more intense than the average aerobic routine. But, it is difficult to beat Bill's simple explanations of training, eating and recovery. Being lactose intolerant, I only tried the recommended EAS supplements for a couple of weeks. Did not work for me due to my own nutritional requirements. For people wanting to look good and get into good physical shape, this book is a great time-saver. Many other readers whom I have talked to speak very highly of Body for Life. It is no surprise that this book continues to be a best-seller. Not really suited for advanced body builders and athletes. Still good info.Doug Setter, Bsc.Author ofStomach FlatteningandOne Less Victim: A Prevention Guide"},{"rating":"1","title":"This book has NOTHING to do with being healthy!!","review":"If you want to get healthy, this is not the book for you. If you want to fill your body with chemicals -- then this is the program you've been waiting for! This book was a waste of money and the program is a waste of time. I did not feel healthy on this program at all. I had headaches from all the chemicals that I had to ingest using EAS supplements. Yes, I lost fat and gained muscle -- but it is done in an unnatural way. I now choose to eat right and exercise regularly in a natural way that will last for life.

This book does nothing more nor different than a sermon, a sales pitch, or a smooth-talking pick-up artist does -- and that is regurgitate information we already know and help us to make up our own minds. This book's content is much more than a regime for the \\"perfect\\" body, it is an oasis in a desert of desperation and lies in the same realm as does such successful motivational pyramid-building schemes. If the saying that \\"the body follows the mind\\" is anything true, than do yourself a favor and find alternative ways to lead the life you want to live."},{"rating":"1","title":"Get to the point","review":"I bought both the book and the tape, thinking I could reinforce the text by following along on the CD. They don't track very well.Also, I am into the second track on the second CD, and still not into the program yet. As I've flipped through the book, I find his ideas not too different from others I've read. Perhaps that's to be expected. Fitness generally comes from a basic set of regimines. But I'm thinking much of the material in both the CD and the book focuses a lot on personal back patting on the author's part, rather than getting to the point of the presentation. One of his points is to minimize the time spent with the diet and exercise, yet the book will take several hours to read and the program only is dealt with late in the presentations."},{"rating":"1","title":"Motivating testimonials but lacks content and depth","review":"This book has lots of testimonials which are great if you need motivation. However, the content, I thought, was shallow and elementary(what was with all the sappy stories?). Also, the small \\"healthy\\" eating chapter (and it was just that a \\"small\\" chapter) was elementary and boring. Basically it told you to take supplements to make up for the nutrients you aren't getting from the foods he tells you to eat. They consist of veggies and lean meats. Although his information is simple, I was not at all impressed and learned nothing that I didn't already know. I would not recommend purchasing this book-just use common sense."},{"rating":"2","title":"THE absolute best intoduction for getting in shape!","review":"I'm going to make this review short& sweet.

I know of several bodybuilders and fitness beginners who've obtained stellar results. As for those who are bent-out-of-shape (excuse the pun)claiming Mr. Phillips is pushing the Myoplex line..relax. You don't need to buy his meal replacements, and he clearly states that in the 1 1/2 pages dedicated to this subject. Anyone can tell you that supplements are an important component in an effective nutritional plan - whether you use an EAS product or chose another line - you'll be well served to invest in a portable protein and/or MRP supplement.

We are your average people who like to eat take out, cookies, cake, etc. I wouldn't even go to a gym before I read this book. I didn't know how to fit in with the \\"regulars\\", I didn't know what exercises to do or why. The explanations, illustrations and tips in this book have made me a regular at my gym.

MuscleMedia was the original steroid magazine. Although they did not publish photos of those steroid freaks, they did publish articles about how to buy and use steroids.

Bill Phillips is a smart guy, maybe his next book will be better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Exercise, discipline--a new lifestyle!","review":"Bill's book is excellent if you stick with the suggestions regarding physical exercise and nutrition. It's more than an exercise book and I'd say overall it shows a healthier lifestyle. Also the nutritional programs discussed in \\"Body for Life\\" are helpful and even valuable. In short, it's one of the best books to physical fitness. Regarding the aspect of mental fitness, I really can't agree, even though the book with all it's anecdotes is inspirational and motivational, and it's fun to read. For mental fitness I'd rather recommend a book that really deals with the rearrangement of priorities and our attitudes, and a book that has helped me so much, which is Dietmar Scherf's \\"I Love Me: Avoiding & Overcoming Depression\\"-- also available at Amazon."},{"rating":"2","title":"The pictures ARE true.","review":"You may think the picturs are not true, but they are.

It does require work, but it also doesn't have to be difficult.Bill Phillips plan is practical, and requires a only a reasonable amount of work from you. You'll work hard, and you'll sweat, but you won't spend hours at the gym, and you definitely won't starve. I recommend this simply due to the fact that it's easy to do, and easy to understand.

Body For Life is a very difficult way for the average person to live. Bill puts forward a very structured program that must be followed to the letter or it does not work.

Nothing is misrepresented in the book.It isn't a miracle cure.

Yes, the suppliments that he talks about are expensive, but the money I have saved over the last 4 months on food (I should say garbage!), easily covered the cost of the suppliments. I also figured a heart attack would cost me alot of money so it was worth it. This has changed my life. I owe it all to Bill.

It is at times inspirational and does contain a few nuggets of information, but for the most part the program is unrealistic.

There is a specific weight, aerobic, and eating plan that is easy to follow and doesn't take much time to do. I read the book in one night and started the next day (and have so far kept it up longer than any other program I have tried). For people who need structure and motivation, this is the book. It also is a great way to get introduced to weight training, and is worth a purchase for that alone.One bad word on the EAS supplements, the \\"Myoplex\\" shakes that the book recommends you have three times a day (and of course is a company started by the author)..they have both aspartame (nutra-sweet) and partially-hydrogenated vegetable oil (of which he actually talks about in the book as being bad). Therefore, if you are going to take nutritional shakes, it makes more sense to buy your own at a health food store. It's cheaper as well. If you want to join the 'challenge' you only have to purchase one EAS product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent for just about everyone","review":"This book is well written and timely in its advice. Mr. Phillips has done an excellent job bringing together the concepts and execution of the three major aspects of fitness; nutrition, weight training and cardivascular exercise. His manner of presentation is engaging and appealing, and the information presented is free of jargon and buzzwords. I feel that many of the people who criticize his book for promoting his product, or claim they cannot afford Myoplex and therefore cannot complete the program, are missing the point. The book clearly presents the concepts necessary to succeed, and at no point labels any product as absolutely necessary. All in all, an excellent book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Body For Life","review":"This book has transformed both my wife and me.

You can find the same and more for 2$ in second-hand \\"get into shape\\" books, or for free by browsing the Internet. There are pretty good sites that give advices for free, and don't advertise for supplements. This is the main drawback of this book, and that's exactly where it loses credibility. By advertising for products he sells, the author shows the real goal of his book. So not only he earns money with a not really useful book, but he tells people to buy his products, which are quite useless to a beginner! So this book is basically just an advertisement. You have the choice of buying into this marketing sheme, or look for real info elsewhere. If you really want to do something about your shape, get another book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing useful that you couldn't learn yourself","review":"Bill Phillips is at it again. With his Sports Supplement Review the founder and owner of supplement company EAS disguised a marketing piece as a semi-informative discussion of nutrition as it relates to bodybuilding. This book is yet another attempt by Phillips to sell his overpriced and generally ineffective supplements. His writing motivates some people to better themselves. Me, I can't get past his smarmy, self-congratulatory attitude. \\"Shawn, warm up the private jet!?\\" Please."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bill is the most knowledegable man towards weightlifting..","review":"I am a 17 year old student athlete that plays basketball, football, and track.

Body for Life is an easy to read book that should be purchased by everyone who is serious about being fit."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ingenious and simple all at one time.","review":"Bill Phillips has been saying each and every one of these principle for some time now. The only difference between then and now is how he has packaged them all together. Before, Bill always relied on the reader to apply all ideas. He has come up a program for everyone from the experienced weightlifter to a person who just put on their first pair of gym shorts. He is the role model for drug-free bodybuilding."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well worth the time for beginner or fitness veteran","review":"As usual, Phillips has created something of value in the fitness and bodybuilding realm. I have yet to find a publication or supplement product produced by Bill that does live up to its claims.

Since this writing, the gains I have made while using the Body for life techniques are amazing! I feel stronger, leaner, and more confident then I've ever felt before. I've even had people at my job ask me what I was doing to get bigger. I look forward to the book hitting the stores soon.

Body For Life make sense; it doesn't go to an extreme in either direction, and it's entirely doable... Bill Phillips has taken information the gymrats have known for years and presented it to the public in an easy to understand format. Give it 12 weeks, and you give yourself the gift of a habit of good nutrition and exercise habits. You can't beat that!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing new to share.","review":"Bill Phillips has made himself into a guru of strength training for the average american. He has also been able to market his company's products by doing so. I found nothing in the book very helpful. The exercises are not unique and I have a difficult time agreeeing with his suggestion that aerobics being done only three times a week for 20 minutes. While the book may be helpful to those who have no idea of weight training or couldn't previously find the gym,the book will be a big disappointment to those familiar with weight training looking for a way to improve.I do have to give it to Phillips: it appears he has a cult following and has made himself rich doing so, but not offering anything different than others."},{"rating":"2","title":"The book is easy to read and understand.","review":"I followed his program starting in Jan. 1999. After 3 month of intense workouts and following Bill Phillips nutrition guidelines I lost 15 lbs. of fat and gained 12 lbs. of rock hard muscle. I will never go back to my old self.

I told myself, that as soon as I felt up to working out, I would start this program.Three weeks after my surgery, I started working out and eating better using the guidelines in the Body for Life book. After two weeks on the program, I have lost 8 lbs. and am feeling great!Now, mind you... I have to work out with a neck brace on and have had to work around my injury as not to damage the work that the doctor did in December. But to date, I have had no problems... So, if I can do it, even with a neck brace on, then anyone can do it.

The people on the show seemed to have such fabulous results. But after reading the book, there is no way that I can do this \\"diet.\\" You have to belong to a gym (or own a lot of your own equipment) to do the exercises this diet requires. The exercises require specific timing and duration. In addition, you also have to eat 6 \\"balanced\\" meals a day. Who has the time or money to do that? I've decided that this is just too complicated!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I'm sorry I wasted time on this book...complete garbage!","review":"Kudos to all those EAS employees for their loyalty. You guys wrote some plausible reviews, were it not for this annoying little thing called content of the book. Body for Life is absolute garbage. Where should I start: the poor writing, the specious looking before and after pictures or the thinly veiled marketing tone of the book? Anyway, I hope Bill and his legion of devotees one day channel all this effort and cultish devotion towards more spiritual (and therefore more rewarding) pursuits. Exercise in moderation is great. Squandering your wealth on high carb muscle food is stupid. But thanks to Body for Life, the toast of Golden, CO can be a Millionaire for Life."},{"rating":"1","title":"I didn't like it at all","review":"I'm not really anti Bill Phillips like some other reviewers and I don't know his history. I bought this book, followed the technique to a key and felt worse after. I have a feeling it was the supplements because I never had such headaches just from working out, and I've been working out for years. Somethings I did find annoying like the \\"late night infomercial\\" tone through most of the book and each page had the e-commerce website on it six times.

Although the whole Body-for-LIFE is supposed to be centered on healthy life and healthy body it is still promoting the (excess) use of aspartame in one's diet, which we all know isn't healthy. Personally I have been waiting Bill to somehow react and answer to the people wanting more information on this subject, because no one's going to buy that 'it's all safe' talk, which I'm sure he's not even going to start with.So before EAS finds another way to sweeten their products I suggest that you stick to a healthier diet but apply the other good advice the book is offering."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your hard earned money on this book of eas ads","review":"Why did bill phillips write this book? 1. to sell eas product. 2. to congragulate himself 3. to let everyone know how \\"awesome\\" he is.

Nutrition is the fuel. Without both, there can be no flame...\\" What Phillips does, with this book, is throw in the oxygen and create a major fire. He covers everything needed to succeed at building a life from the body up, and he does so in an easy to understand, conversational style. The only people knocking this work are those who are jealous of Bill Phillip's phenomenal success in the fitness industry. Try it, you'll like it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Clear, concise, and helpful.","review":"After first READING this book and then looking at the reviews here, I am troubled. Sprinkled among the 4-5 star reviews and personal success stories there are more than a few 1-2 star reviewers who are filled with venom. I have no idea about B. Phillip's past or MM's history, but I do know that seeing the video and reading the book gave me hope and the spark of belief that I could change. Of course the book isn't revolutionary (or even evolutionary) but it is exactly what it claims to be. The chapter on the Abyss alone is worth the cover price (to me anyway). This book has given me the belief that improvement is possible, even for me. Those who are so full of spite, what do you offer?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Fitness Book Ever Written","review":"Are you fat? Are you overweight? Have you been going to the gym day after day, but haven't seen any progress? Are you unhappy with the way you look? If you can answer yes to any of these questions, this is the book for you. Bill Phillips will teach the basics about nutrition and exercise. In addition, he has created his 12 week Body For Life program. He will teach you what to eat and when and will help you reduce the time you spend in the gym, yet your results improve. This book will help you acquire the body you've dreamed of. If you follow his program, you will experience the success that millions of others have already experienced. A must read!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A \\"Fitness Revival Meeting\\" instead of a concrete plan","review":"Unless you enjoy endless self promotion and sophmoric hype (saying \\"body for life\\" when doing reps), stay away from the cassette. There is nothing here but testimonials and hype. I couldn't believe that for this price, there were only general references to a concrete exercise plan....you have to buy the book to get that. A complete disappointment!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Flim Flam","review":"Bill Phillips is quite a salesman. But this book is very short on nutrition and completely ignores the common side effects of a high protein diet, which can wreak havoc with the digestive tract. The book gives an 800 number for diet counseling, but the counselors are similarly lacking knowledge of basic nutrition and understanding of metabolism. Phillips provides numerous testimonials from his \\"champions\\" yet admits every one of them uses the supplements his company sells. Those supplements are mentioned throughout the book and if taken as recommended would cost the dieter over three hundred dollars per month. I suspect this is what the program is all about."},{"rating":"2","title":"People are so cynical","review":"This book is self-serving, supplements are expensive, and some of the diet information is incorrect. This may or may not be true (depending on who you speak to). But I can ganentee that this program works. And will work for you better then you expect! I have been to two personal trainers, and used other books/videos. Nothing even comes close to this program. Bill is a genus because he has taking so many fitness concepts and integrated into a program that the average person can follow. It is simple and it works, really, really well. But it also takes hard work. If you are willing to believe in this program for 12 weeks and NOT MODIFY it at all, you will transform your body. Its that simple.If you think those photos are not real, go to www.clubs.yahoo.com. Join one of the Body for Life clubs, look at photos of real people and judge for your-self.

I am only on my 3rd week and I have seen amazing results. I weight in at an amazing 145 pounds so as you can see I am not studing the body for life plan to loose weight but to gain muscle. 1/2 inch gain on biceps, 1 inch gain on chest. Went from 35lb dumbbell press to 55 pound press in just 3 weeks. I am telling you plan your work and work your plan and you will see some truly amazing results in a matter of just a few weeks!

You could summarize the whole book by recommending; 1. Vary your strength training every three weeks. 2. Eat more protein (only Myoplex if you want quick results and an unreliable Italian car). 3. Do interval training for fat loss.and number 4 if you need a number 4- Watch Oprah every Friday."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very informative and inspirational.","review":"If you're looking for inspiration and tips on nutrition and fitness and willing to take the plunge then Body for Life by Bill Phillips is the book for you.

After reading the stories and looking at the photos you're all pumped and ready to read more. Phillips explains to the reader what carbohydrates, proteins and fats are by making it easy to understand. There's tons of information in this book just waiting to be read. In the back, there are also tons of different exercises for each body part.Everyone will be able to benefit from Body for Life, regardless of fitness level. It's definitely a must read!"},{"rating":"1","title":"One big advertisement","review":"This book is okay but nothing special. I was expecting much better from Phillips. The information is this book is very similar to what is in MuscleMedia so it is probably better to just buy that magazine. I can't really recommend that you buy MuscleMedia but the magazine is very, very similar to this book. I was hoping that new information and insight would be included but this is the same information in new packaging. I can sum up the book in a few words \\"Buy my supplements and work out\\". Is that amazing? I truely don't understand why the reviews here have been so positive. I would sum up the book as lukewarm and nothing to get excited about. Reading the positive reviews here I'm reminded of those all too excited participants in infomercials."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't bother with this book.","review":"Like most of the negative reviews have already stated this book reads like one bid advertisement for Bill Phillips EAS line of supplements. You can get the same information from an EAS bottle or the EAS website. As for the exercise routines, you can find much better in other books."},{"rating":"1","title":"Every Bill Phillips product is the same!","review":"It all comes down to selling more supplements. Bill Phillips has a book you can pick up in heathstores around the country called \\"Bill Phillips' Sports Supplement Review, 3rd Issue\\". The SSR and BFL are very similar as is MuscleMedia and Bill Phillips grand film (long advertisement) called \\"Body of Work\\". Each one of these releases spends every moment pushing you to buy EAS products. The examples Bill Phillips will show you are in good shape and have transformed their bodies but I'm sure if they put the same effort into a different program the results would not be different. Be careful reading Mr. Phillips' because it is easy to get sucked into placing an order. His operators are standing by."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book tell us nothing new at all","review":"Please if you want to learn how to get in shape buy another book, if you want to hear about EAS products, then buy this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"GOOD PROGRAM","review":"THIS IS A GOOD PROGRAM TO FOLLOW.

Yes, I lost weight, but even taking the shakes, excersing 6 days a week and controlling my meals -yes, 6 a day- I don't look (by any means) as the folks in the book. Honestly, after eating as explained in the book and excersing so much, the least I expected was looking slim. But by following the program I didn't get the results offered in the book. Bottom line: if you want just to lose weight, you don't need to buy this book. And if you expect to look really good...well, buy something else or get a trainer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not buy this book!","review":"It was the biggest waste of 12 weeks ever! I lost maybe a total of 5 lbs and toned up a little bit. For those of you with binge eating problems like myself the free day looks heaven sent, but it cost me my sucess. The book is not oriented for people with our mentality.Also, I found articles on the internet that claimed the photos are retouched and some of the people are not even part of the program.This book tells you what you already know. Eat healthy and exercise. My advice... their is no better weight loss coach than yourself."},{"rating":"1","title":"Been there, done that","review":"Waste of time, waste of money. This is basic body building repackaged with a high protein diet. I still have a pamphlet from the 1970s by Joe Weider that espouses exactly the same thing that is being said here at a fraction of the cost and without the contest hoopla (what a 90s thing! sheesh).No doubt about it, if you follow this plan, you'll loose weight and buff up. But how many people are actually going to stick to this? Yeah, yeah, I got suckered into buying this book cause everybody everywhere is talking about it. But being a veteran of the diet wars (anyone remember the grapefruit diet the first time around?), I should have known better.There are NO magic bullets and NO magic cures. Losing weight is tough, hard work. This author isn't saying anything you haven't heard before: eat less and exercise. It's just got a very slick package going for it. Your money can be better spent on a new pair of walking shoes."},{"rating":"1","title":"May work but not healthy","review":"Let me preface this review by saying I have read the book and I tried the program for about 1 week but that's it.I think this program would work for many people if their goal is short term fat loss and/or muscle gain. However I have done extensive research into health and the role of foods in good nutrition and long term health and this sort of a fad program based on a fair amout of processed foods (such as myoplex bars) is not the way to go. For optimal health and long term body fat management most research points towards a paleolithic-type diet as the most effective.May be a good start for some but should not be viewed as a good long term solution."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a great marketing scheme!","review":"This is not a good way to get into shape. For one thing he does not advocate healthy eating practices, but he sure does advocate buying his EAS products. He doesn't mention getting plenty of fresh fruit and vegetables only plenty of EAS products, which by the way cost more than actual food! My husband & I both tried the diet, exercise and products for 8 weeks. He lost 3 lbs and 1% bodyfat, I lost 3 lbs and 1% bodyfat also.Then we followed a plan of our own that included lots of fresh fruit, vegetables, protein and limited processed refined foods, still exercised and dropped more lbs, inches and bodyfat than we did following the Body for Life guidlines and using the products. You can get good results just by getting off the couch, exercising, and eating properly. Bill Phillips is a great marketer that is all plain and simple."},{"rating":"1","title":"All Fluff, Little Substance","review":"Complete waste of money. The workout routines were good, but the substance of the book could have fit on less than 10 pages. The book's website has all the useful info you will need, so save your money on this one. Not recommended even a little."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good motivation, lacking some specifics","review":"He could be a bit more detailed on the foods, I know he's trying to make it easy but I think anybody who has issues with food and portion control needs to be counting calories.

I tell you what, if you want advice from BP, don't get bodybuilding/fitness advice, but instead business advice. This guy can really write ads and suck you in. But each and every time I bite, I am profoundly disappointed. His books, articles, etc. are nothing more than a big advertisement to buy some more EAS product.

If you wanna get a EAS catalogue, you can ask it for free on the EAS homepage. The book contains very simple routines and a lot of biassed advices about nutrition.

If you are serious about getting fit, learn how eat right instead of spending hundreds of dollars every month on supplements as he advices."},{"rating":"2","title":"You don't have to finish in 12 weeks","review":"When I started this program, I was convinced I too could do it in 12 weeks! With 2 boys, a husband, and other obligations, I soon found that maybe it was going to take 12 months. That's ok though! It is called Body for LIFE!! I have been at this lifestyle for 7 months now and I have come about halfway to my goal. Others, usually men, seem to get to their goals faster, but for this stay-at-home mom, I am just glad to have a plan to follow for my exercise and eating.

He goes a little over the top, and loves to mention himself and his product line a little too much.

Having a \\"free day\\" is also great. However, the program involves too much time. Preparing six nutritious meals per day and exercising six days per week, is something that could not fit into my schedule long term. I was completely burnt out by the end of the fourth week. I felt restricted by the foods (probably because I am a picky eater)and I found his recipes to be bland and boring. He advocates the use of supplements in the form of shakes and food bars, instead of one or two of the six meals. However, when I went to the website, I thought the supplements were outrageously priced. So I tried the program without them, and found it very difficult to maintain long term.I have a busy life. I was constantly staying up late to prepare extra meals for the next day and getting up earlier in the morning to fit the exercise into my schedule. This program requires a lot of free time despite what the author says."},{"rating":"2","title":"It will change your life...","review":"This was THE BEST thing I have ever done for myself.

His question and answer section is great, too. It thrashes so much of the mis-information that's out there. The author obviously knows his stuff.

The stories are interesting and I for one liked Bill Philips relaxed style of writing. This is not Shakespeare, but that was not the goal.

I can fit into pants I wore in high school (I'm 38) and am, truly, in the best shape of my life.This book describes a program that you can stick with for life.

I recommend this book to people who are unsure of the correct path to follow, and to those of you that are currently up to date with what needs to be done, this book will clarify any questions. If you are a MuscleMedia subscriber you can find the same valuable information in his magazines. The only negative I have with this program, is that if you follow his supplementation guidelines, it will cost a minimum of $200 a month on supplements alone.

Laffin does not have a basic understanding of the military situation in 1916. In fact, its important to point out that John Laffin does not have a history degree. He is by trade a tour guide who is making money by jumping on the band wagon about Haig.

Something bad happened to Mr Uris at the time he wrote this book...but what? It is not a fair representation of his talent and I am befuddled enough to take time to write this review.

For that I will forgive him (maybe not his editor), and I can only hope we will see a return to the writing standard of his previous works."},{"rating":"1","title":"Quick! Call the Cops!","review":"Because someone has apparently kidnapped Leon Uris!This book is so bad, I don't even know where to start. The characters are one-dimensional, the plot is a hodge-podge of what appear to be Uris' pet peeves, the editing and factual errors were both irritating and shocking for such an accomplished author, the dialog was implausible, and the sychophantic fawning over Bill Clinton really was sickening -- \\"the agony that befell Bill and Hillary Clinton\\"??? Oh, puleeeze.As for his take on the Second Amendment, all I kept thinking was how odd that the same man who had written so eloquently about the Irish struggle for freedom --- the ARMED struggle for freedom, by the way -- had suddenly become so cavalier about American freedoms. What in the world would Conor Larkin say?Don't waste your time reading this tripe. In fact, plant a tree tomorrow to replace those that were sacrificed to print \\"A God In Ruins\\". You'll feel better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Who use Leon Uris' name?","review":"I think Mr. Uris needs to find whoever used his name when writing this book and publicly flog them. I can't believe that the same person who wrote Trinity and QBVII wrote this drivel. The plot is poor, the characters are ill-defined and the pacing is absolutely horrendous. The book leaps from the past to the future and back and often times left me wondering what era am I reading about? I think I'm going to bury this book in my garden as it should serve well as a load of manure."},{"rating":"1","title":"Did Leon Uris Really Write This ??","review":"Halfway through this book I finally got fed up. I came to this site on-line to read the reviews to see if I was the only one who couldn't believe Leon Uris wrote this book.I loved Leon Uris' earier books, in part because I thought I was learning something. But now I have this question: If he wrote such over-the -top tripe about the American scene, was he equally inaccurate about the other cultures dipicted in his earier works."},{"rating":"1","title":"Saving Slick Willy","review":"I've been an admirer of Uris from the time I read Battle Cry while I was in the Marines. This latest book is a far cry from Battle Cry. I'm about half-way through and just got to the part where he begins praising the \\"slickster\\" and doing a job on the NRA -- and I mean a one-sided trashing of the organization. All Democrats are good and all Republicans are bad. Leon, my erstwhile friend, you've lost me. Your mind has opened up so much that your brain has fallen out. I'll finish this one, for the purpose of discipline only, then you and I are through. Wish I'd have read the reviews before spending my money on the hardcover version."},{"rating":"1","title":"TAKE IT OFF THE SHELVES - LET HIM SAVE SOME FACE","review":"I also thought that maybe my tastes had become more sophisticated since reading Exodus and Mr. Uris's other works, which I loved. I'm relieved to see I'm not alone in thinking that this book is really bad. The writing is especially poor. The publishers should really take it off the shelves and let us remember Leon Uris for Exodus, Trinity and his other fine works."},{"rating":"1","title":"a dismal failure","review":"One of most poorly written books I have read. It jumps from place to place with seemiinly nothing to really bind it together. A real disappointment from this author."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I can't believe that the same author who wrote THE HAJ AND MILA 18 wrote this book. It is scattered and sophomoric and I'm most disappointed. Perhaps he was \\"getting on\\" in years or health and just needed the money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of time","review":"This book ranged from the unbelievable to the ridiculous.

It is a shame Mr. Uris didn't retire with his reputation intact."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very relieved to see that I am not alone!","review":"After reading about half of the book (I was stuck in an airport and had no choice), I finally did something I've never done. I put the book down with no intentions of ever picking it up again. I couldn't believe that this was the same writer of Mila 18 and Trinity! I, therefore, am greatly relieved to see that I am not alone in my opinion of this extraordinarily trite book. Thank you to all the other reviewers - I wish I'd read your reviews before buying this book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"flat as a pancake","review":"Uris violates every possible rule of \\"show, don't tell\\", but does not get away with it. Ziltch character development, impossible situations...the only thing lacking is organ music in the background. This mess could never have gotten into print had it been written by anyone else. This is the first I have read of Leon Uris & I'm really disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Is this an Author in Ruins?","review":"Was this a quick write for the big buck? This is not the Leon Uris of Exodus, Mila 18 and The Haj, among others. His characters are caricatures. They have no depth, they are unreal. The editing is horrible. I wish I had read the reviews before I bought the book. I would not have bought it, I do not advice others to buy it. Extraordinarily disappointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst novel I've read in years","review":"Like others who have reviewed this book, I expected much more from Mr. Uris, and I'm terribly disappointed that any editor could even find the nerve to publish such a work! I have read dozens of books like this, and I must unfortunately admit that this is the worst one I've ever read. Not only is the plot of the book lame and boring, but his usage of the English language is an embarrassment. I have told all my friends to avoid reading this book. Amazon won't allow me to rate this book with less than 1 star, but if I could, I'd give it a minus!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Dreadful","review":"I just stopped reading it ... I tried, I really did, I wanted to know what was going on, what would happen with the characters, but the writing is just so awful. I find myself constantly stumbling over sentences, having to go back to parse through them slowly to see if I can figure out what he's getting at. Sometimes I get it ... other times I'm still left wondering what they hell he's trying to say.I read Uris in the past, and enjoyed his work. But this is just dreadful, and to be quite honest I was left wondering if perhaps he wasn't getting a little senile by the time he got to this book ... the writing is just so obtuse, so strangely structured, that there seemed to be something seriously wrong with the writer. Either, as some other reviewers have suggested, a ghost writer wrote the book, or Leon Uris was in serious decline by the time he wrote this. Either way, the publisher should have fixed it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shockingly poor story","review":"Kindly refer to others who have offered their thoughts in this regard. Specifically, I can't believe that this was actually written by Leon Uris. As a point of reference, I have read a half dozen of his other works.... For the first time in my life, I stopped reading a book, not caring what happens to any of the characters, plots, or subplots. I only have 90 pages to go and I can't spend another minute reading it."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"Is it just me?\\"","review":"I got 80 pages into this book, and on every page, I kept thinking \\"Is it just me? Or is something seriously wrong with this book? How can I get so doggone IRRITATED with a book written by LEON URIS??\\"Well, after reading other people's comments here, I realize: It's not just me! This book really IS embarrassingly bad!Unlike some of the commenters, who say the novel breaks down halfway through, I would say it's weird from the very start. These characters do not seem real at all, the plot seems implausible, and there's something about his writing style in this book that strikes me as just plain GOOFY.I won't waste my time forcing myself to read this clunker to the end. I'll quit now and cut my losses.Full disclosure: I'm particularly choosy and hard-to-please right now because I recently read Tom Wolfe's \\"Bonfire of the Vanities\\"--one of the sharpest, most on-target, fun, exciting books I've ever read. Probably anything following on that book's heels is going to feel like a let-down!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Undeserving of Leon Uris","review":"I have read a number of Mr. Uris's books, including Exodus, Trinity, Mila 18, Topaz, and The Haj. Mr. Uris has previously been one of my favorite authors. With eager expectation I picked this book to read.However, I find nothing in this book of redeeming value. I would classify it as a piece of trash. The writing is poor, the plot is poor, and the book is filled with extremely foul language, sexual situations, and political bias.I don't often throw away books, but I am tossing this one in the dumpster so no one else in my family is tempted to absorb its filth."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shockingly Poor","review":"On the heels of great books like Trinity, I was very surprised by this poor effort. Terrible character development, unbelievable dialogue. The book spends a great deal of time on what are obviously Uris' own political views at the expense of plot. It is so bad that I have a hard time believing Uris actually wrote it! Don't bother. Re-read Trinity instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Writer and a Book In Ruins ....","review":"Amazon.com doesn't give a '0 Stars' rating, which I would have given \\"... Ruins.\\" I've read \\"Trinity\\" and \\"Redemption\\" twice, and \\"... Ruins\\" isn't in the same league, let alone ballpark. The testosterone level is off the charts. Every character is exaggerated beyond belief. It's downright comical. A cheapskate, I have two more chapters to get through, after which I'll save the book -- as fodder for this winter's fireplace. Mr. Uris, how could you?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Had to be written by an imposter","review":"I have always considered Uris as one of the top writers and his works have not disappointed me ... until now. This poorly written book makes me think that it was written for a Hollywood screen play one weekend in order to generate a little cash flow. If I read it without knowing the author I would have tossed it thinking it was a dimestore novel. Save you money on this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can't bring myself to finish it","review":"I pride myself in finishing every book I start. I've only broken that rule once before. Fortunately I've forgotten which book that was, hopefully I'll soon forget this one as well. I recall Leon Uris as being able to write very good books. I don't know what happened with the writing and editing of this book, but it really stinks. Thanks for the laughs, but I think I'll quit reading and retain my last shred of respect for Leon Uris."},{"rating":"1","title":"The title should be Leon Uris in Ruins","review":"If you are looking for the outstanding writing of past Uris' works, pass this one by. His continuity is poor, the characters are either all good or all bad, and the political opinions of the author are shrouded in not so subtle qualities of his characters. The story line is weak and the characters flawed. Don't waste your time or money on this one! I would not even assign one star."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dreadful!","review":"I bought this book because it was written by Leon Uris. What a mistake! The book is dreadful! It is poorly written, poorly edited, and seems to be a parody of a novel. Did he write it tongue in cheak? It is choppy and poorly organized; the pacing is uneven at best. It seems like a decent outline for a good story that is poorly executed. How do \\"they\\" let work like this get published? It seems that \\"they\\" are just cashing in on Uris's good name. But how about the unsuspecting reader who puts out cash expecting a good read? It's not fair to the reader or to the reputation of one who has written some great books to put out such a weak excuse for a novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"A very poor effort.","review":"I have read all of the novels by Mr. Uris and have enjoyed mostof them, especially his two on Ireland. This one was a terribledisappointment. I find it to be nothing but 483 pages of left-wing propaganda. The characters are either saints or devils, and totally unbelievable. I hope Mr. Uris does better next time or retires."},{"rating":"1","title":"Extremely disappointing","review":"I'm glad to see that I wasn't the only disappointed reader of this book. Being that he is my favorite author, I tried to give it every possible concession, however, none could really be had. He has always been the author who finished what Michener started. I was so disheartened by this book. Please, if you read this Mr. Uris, give us the beautiful and touching stories you alone are so gifted to give us."},{"rating":"1","title":"If you like Uris, avoid this garbage.","review":"Tremendous disappointment from a big Uris fan. I can't ever remember discarding a dearly bought hardback book after a single reading but this one is in my hotel room trash can. This book is a travesty for anyone expecting the kind of deeply researched and informed novels that Leon Uris has produced in the past. I have to believe that most of Mr. Uris' \\"research\\" came from the NY Times and the White House/Hillary for Senate Press Offices. Avoid."},{"rating":"1","title":"Maybe I Remember \\"Exodus\\" through Rose-Colored Glasses","review":"As a teen, I was captivated by \\"Exodus' and devoured \\"Mila 18\\" and a few other Uris novels in a matter of days. What a disappointment then to read \\"A God in Ruins.\\" A convoluted story with dialogue that hardly ever sounds real. I'd prefer to remember \\"Exodus' as being wonderful rather than re-reading it. Uris has the name, the track-record and therefore the ability to to deliver for a publisher. However,I suspect that even Quinn Patrick O'Connell, the central character in this \\"read-it-on-the-beach-only-if-nothing-else is-available\\" novel would have had the integrity to have passed on the opportunity to publish this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Even for a liberal, this is horrible","review":"I didn't expect much when I picked this up - a vacation book, something diverting to block out the cattle calls in airports. But I did expect something coherent, and this was, just barely.The editor in me kept fidgeting about the errors - calling the ATF, the AFT, for instance (by the director of the FBI, fer chrissakes.) And the characters, good and bad, are cartoon-like. One keeps seeing thought bubbles over their heads, with exclamations like \\"Gadzooks!\\" And the \\"tropicana George Washington Bridge?\\" Gimme a break."},{"rating":"1","title":"An embarressing decline","review":"Anticipated the usual Uris quality read. It had potential and lost it. Poorly edited and error - ridden. Avoid. Shame on you Leon."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ridiculous","review":"This book is ridiculously sophomoric. The contemporary \\"bad guy Republicans\\" vs \\"the good guy Democrats\\" is needless and inaccurate.

I am utterly disappointed. I actually had to check out the review's to make sure I didn't complain about it already.Everything was terrible.

Uris's previous books certainly fit this criteria, however, his latest attempt, A GOD IN RUINS, did neither! In fact, I ended up trashing the book, about half-way and decided that my money was unwisely spent. Unlike his other novels, his characters were weak and his plot was non-existent, thus the book was neither entertaining nor informative. My observation is that the sole purpose of the novel was to promote Mr. Uris's political beliefs - which I do not share!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A God In Ruins","review":"I have been reading Leon Uris since, in high school in the 1950s, I picked up Battle Cry. Maybe the writer owes his New York friends so much that he put out this piece of trite pap. The NRA must have really pissed him off! The book is basically about one shallow character's fight for gun control in America. Characters are written in broad generalizations that show Uris spent his time in Ireland researching his books and decided that he can throw off his own country in stereotypes drawn from the shallow New York literary scene. I was lucky. I bought the paperback book on sale. I would be most disappointed had I paid full price."},{"rating":"1","title":"Uris lets us down","review":"I'm a fan of Mr. Uris and when I saw this book in an airport before a long flight, I was excited. That excitement didn't last long. DO NOT BUY this book! It is shallow and was apparently rapidly written and edited. There are some glaring errors in the book and the main characters are stereotypical. I don't mind an author with an agenda - I love Gore Vidal, but don't agree with him on much politically - but there has to be something of value in the writing. Nothing here!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible, Horrid, Terrible...","review":"That pretty much sums it up. I think Uris had a go at proving the notion that if you gave 700 monkeys 700 typewriters, in 700 years they would reproduce every great work of English literature. They got the English part half right. Way to go boys, here's a banana."},{"rating":"1","title":"I didn't know Leon Uris wrote soap operas","review":"Trite! Silly! Many years ago I read my first Leon Uris Novel, \\"Battle Cry\\",I liked it. Since then his books have been spotty. This is trash! Irish cop turned rancher, good priest, bad busniness man and mysterious parentage haunting the presidential candidate. It would not even make a good soap opera."},{"rating":"1","title":"Utterly Dreadful!","review":"What happened to the brilliant author of Exodus, Trinity, and Redemption? I couldn't get past page 100 of this book. The characters have all the depth of the Saturday morning cartoons. The facts are mercilessly misrepresented.

I wish I could get my money back."},{"rating":"1","title":"a major disappointment","review":"A major disappointment from a previously great writer.

Please Leon, write something good. I know you can do it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointment!","review":"The only thing I can say is, \\"don't spend your money on this book.\\" I had looked forward to a new book from Leon Uris, but this is not it. Someone in a Leon Uris suit wrote this, not him. Perhaps the Microsoft Word Wizard did it...you know: \\"Do you need help writing this book?\\" Mr. Uris should have refused.

No, more than one notch."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Huge Disappontment","review":"Uris has been one of my favorite authors until this book. Be warned, this is nothing more than an anti-gun screed (combined with a laughable martyring of the Clinton Administration) masquerading as a novel. The characters are completely one-dimensional - existing only to spout Uris' political platitudes. I could live with that flaw if at least those views were thoughtfully drawn out, instead of reflecting a complete lack of thought or scholarship. As it was, his views were about as deep as a bumper sticker slogan. This book was a complete travesty, and a bitter disappointment to those of us who have admired and enjoyed Uris' past novels. Save your money - there is nothing that recommends this book to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing bigotry","review":"It is hard for me equate this writing of Mr. Uris with the likes of Battle Cry, Mila 18, QB VII or Exodus. This book is very ugly in its' treatment of Christians, Southerners and of course Republicans, treats the Clintons as martyrs and the Catholic Church as a hot bed of adulterers. Marines are treated very well (deservedly so)but the Nation that has created and supported them does not do as well. Maybe it is time for retirement and put away the poison pen."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Bother","review":"I did not bother to finish this book, giving up in disgust half way through. The lack of depth in this book, compared to \\"Trinity\\", \\"Exodus\\", and \\"Armegeddon\\", is appalling.This author use to be one of the best. Now he seems to be skating by on reputation. Maybe the paycheck was worth it."},{"rating":"1","title":"An author in ruins","review":"A God in Ruins should be retitled An Author in Ruin. It is sad to see an author renowned for his painstaking research produce such a flimsy work. Uris has produced a piece of left-wing propaganda, painting the fictional Republican president as evil incarnate and his Democratic challenger as perfect. His portrayal of the issues involved in the debate over the Second Amendment right to keep and bear arms, is incredibly simplistic when one considers Uris' reputation for scholarship. His Exodus, Mila 18, Trinity, etc., all brought us a profound understanding of an important confict. This book is the work of someone either senile or bent on deepening our national political conflict rather than creating mutual understanding."},{"rating":"1","title":"an absolute waste of time","review":"I would have given this less than one star were that an option. There is nothing kind I can say about this pointless book. I question if Leon Uris even read this book let alone wrote it. I did finish it and kept waiting for something to catch my interest but that never happened."},{"rating":"1","title":"Leon Uris wrote this???","review":"I have always enjoyed Uris' books and his writing style. I can't believe he actually wrote this. I will admit that I'm only two-thirds into it and I have contemplated giving it up but I'm invested now and want to see how it ends. I just don't care about the characters and don't feel any drama in the story. Very disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"How about giving credit where credit is due?","review":"Contained within this Leon Uris offering - A God in Ruins - are 2 poems written by a young, talented New York poet. Uris failed, in his responsibility, to copyright credit this gifted writer.In my opinion, these poems were the only redeeming quality of the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"He should stick to historical settings","review":"Uris demonstrates in this novel that, while he is excellent at weaving a human story around historical events, he is unable to fashion a believable story without such a setting. His lack of knowledge concerning computer technology and firearms (the issues of his two antagonists) renders this book as grossly unreal. Uris is definitely not cut out to write science-fiction. If they offered the choice of less than 1 star, this book would have gotten it. No other author has ever disappointed me this thoroughly."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Sad Farewell to Leon Uris","review":"\`A God In Ruins' indeed. Leon Uris' latest work -- perhaps an indication that he is the god in ruins. I grew up on Leon Uris and came, over the course of three decades, to revel in his attention to detail, his grounding in truth, his objectivity and his ability to weave a tale that had a point and yet did not preach. In 'A God In Ruins', Uris has become a one-eye-blind street preacher, sermonizing the book away through barely possible characters, a semi-credible plot and a set of issues that, although important, do not justify the context of the book. As though to add insult to injury, the book is full of little errors -- ridiculous things such as Eastern time being three hours behind Pacific.I bid sad farewell to Mr. Uris' work, hoping only that I can revisit \`Battle Cry' in all its glory un-tainted."},{"rating":"1","title":"Somewhat entertaining.","review":"Mr. Uris wrote eight great novels in a row, peaking with \\"Trinity\\". With the last three novels, including \\"A God in Ruins\\", Mr. Uris seems to be living on his reputation.The passion and power of \\"Trinity\\" and \\"Exodus\\" are non-existent in \\"A God in Ruins\\".Mr. Uris clearly is very sympathetic to Bill Clinton and his political problems. In \\"Trinity\\", Mr. Uris created the Conor Larkin character seeking his truth about Irish freedom. It is hard to compare that quest with Bill Clinton seeking his truth in 800 FBI files that were \\"accidently\\" transferred to the White House."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Author has done better","review":"I did not believe the intitial reviews on this book as I have read all the author's other books and thought they were excellent. A God In Ruins does not even come close to his other works.His story is disjointed, his characters have little depth and lack passion. If the author's intent was to make the reader question the intent of having the second ammendment in the 21st Century, he failed as the story just does not hold up.Try again!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst book I ever read","review":"I find it hard to believe that this piece of garbage was written by the same author who wrote Exodus, Trinity, Mila 18 and other brilliant novels. Either Mr. Uris had reached senility or the book was ghostwritten under his name. Don't bother. It will ruin your image of Leon Uris as a novelist."},{"rating":"1","title":"Transparent political issues","review":"I see that Mr. Uris is a big fan of Bill Clinton, Al Gore and Jesse Jackson; and for re-writing the Bill of Rights. This book seems to only be his biased opinion of members of the leading parties in the US. As a novel, the book started well, and seemed to be leading some where, I couldn't put it down. Then after only half-way through the book, I was quickly disappointed. There was no climax. I only finished it because I bought it. If you buy the book, only do so for the first half or so. The rest is garbage."},{"rating":"1","title":"What happened to the plot?","review":"Leon Uris usually weaves trmendous epic novels. This is not one of them. The story baically leads up to the presedential election of 20008 and spends most of ts time onthe main characters' backgrounds rather than developing a plot to get excited about."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Worthy of Uris","review":"As one who believes in finishing what you've started, it is extremely rare for me to walk out of a movie prior to the ending, or, in terms of this book, pull the marker prior to the last page.

No more Uris for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"I wish I had read other reviews before tackling this book","review":"I liked the way this book started.

This should have been done as an 750-word opinion piece on Clinton and gun control."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bah, Humbug","review":"I wish I had read the other reviews prior to buying and reading this book. It was a total waste of money. Is someone capitalizing on Leon Uris' past successes? No way did the real Leon Uris write this. Not the Uris of Exodus, Battle Cry and other great reads."},{"rating":"1","title":"A dissapointment","review":"I was prepared for the polically correct, ultra liberal slant, but not for the sophomoric writing.

You can tell he's a liberal! His bashing of conservative values and people is shameful. The only redeeming quality of this book was the section on Quinns military exploits.Don't bother reading this book if you actually know anything about religion, ethics, or technology. If your a bleeding heart liberal, you'll probably love it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pure rubbish.","review":"This novel is an incredible disappointment. I finally gave up and pitched it away after reading about a third of the book. The plot and characters are flat and predictable. The background research is deplorable. After tossing it away, I consulted Amazon to see how other readers had received this book. It appears that the majority are as appalled as I am. Who would have known that this was the creation of Leon Uris? I read my first Uris novel fifty years ago (Battle Cry) and enjoyed many more since then, but Uris was clearly in decline when he churned out this dreck."},{"rating":"1","title":"The worst Uris book ever!","review":"I honestly cannot believe Leon Uris wrote this book. I bothered to finish it only because I hoped he (Uris) would redeem himself. Now after having finished it and knowing the touted \\"secret,\\" I realize that I could have quit reading on any page and not regretted it. This \\"secret\\" which was supposed to be apex of the storyline, was a \\"so what\\" instead of the nation-shattering event as depicted in the book.

If you must read it, don't read it before driving or operating heavy machinery."},{"rating":"1","title":"Time for Leon Uris to retire! This was terrible.","review":"I expected much more than Uris gave. He seemed stuck in the '60's. Everytime a middle-aged man spoke, he ended with \\"man\\".

Give this one a miss.","review":"A God in Ruins is so bad, I wonder if Leon Uris actually wrote it. The first third of the book lays the groundwork for a story that goes nowhere, the characters are one-dimensional, he gets the technical details wrong throughout the book and some narrative descriptions are so flowery I had to stop reading to laugh! Worst of all, Mr. Uris uses this novel as a pulpit to lecture about gun control and aggrandize the Clintons. Where were his editors?I have read all previous Uris novels, many of them twice. A God in Ruins is so bad it is exploitive of Uris readers. This book was my last from this author and this publisher."},{"rating":"1","title":"A previously superb author has betrayed his fans","review":"A huge disappointment!

It starts out with predictable characters: the hero is brilliant and perfect; the anti-hero is brilliant and evil and all the woman are brilliant, beautiful and passionate. So much for creativity! But it gets worse. Halfway through you realize you were conned into thinking this is literature, when it is simply a position paper on gun control. If a prominent author wishes to write an essay to promote a personal political agenda, he/she ought at least to put a disclaimer on the cover."},{"rating":"1","title":"Did Leon Uris Really Write this Book?","review":"Unfortunately, I was gravely disappointed by this book. I have read just about all of Leon Uris' fiction and looked forward to another fascinating piece of good historical fiction. Instead what A God In Ruins delivers is one-dimensional stereotypical characters, predictable events, and easy solutions. I didn't believe the plot or any of the characters. Worse, it was boring!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"At least I only spent $1 to read this book from the library's rental collection. It falls far short of the author's earlier works. And where were the editors? Too many silly, silly mistakes: Milta Pass; Snyder (Snider); Camp (Campy); Greet for Greer; Eastern time 3 hours behind Pacific; main for Maine; prairie schoolers for prairie schooners; etc., etc. Apparently, the editors relied too much on their computer's spellchecker. I read to the end because it was Mr. Uris, but this book lacks real characters, is mostly unbelievable and is just too shallow. I could put up with the political (I agree with a lot of it), but whitewashing the Clintons turned me off. If you can't do better Mr. Uris (and HarperCollins), please hang it up."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst book I've ever read from, once, a very good writer","review":"Uris must have wanted to do his small bit for changing history regarding the Clinton administration at the expense of quality. What a lame excuse for a book. I was so disappointed as I thought Uris' other work was great. A God in Ruins is TRASH. Don't waste your time reading this. I'd like to get my money back."},{"rating":"1","title":"Political position paper disguised as a novel","review":"I own every novel written by Uris, and have read most of them more than once, so when I heard a new was forthcoming I grabbed it.This is no novel. It is a political treatise with no attempt at disguise. When Uris portrays gun owners as Heehaw loving denizens of trailer parks the bile of his stereotypical prejudices drips from the page. I can accept the numerous errors, and the convoluted plotline, but not the attempt to shove his veiws down my throat.While Mr. Uris is entitled to his beliefs, he has no right to pass them off as a novel. An authours views should color a work, but not in this ham handed fashion. You owe us one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save the full purchase price, DON'T BUY IT!!!","review":"The other customer comments I have read relative to this book give Mr Uris too much credit. The amazon.com review is pure tripe! This story starts out as if it were going to be a 'real' Leon Uris novel but at the halfway mark, the author passes away as does the story line. Mr Uris has chosen this book to pass off his somewhat skewed social/political agenda as a literary work--with worse than disastrous results. If you believe, as Paul Harvey recently said: \\"It must be the guns\\" and/or that Bill and Hillary are two totally innocent, morally upright individuals or that Bill is among the holy innocents, abused and wrongly accused, then, this book is for you. Otherwise, stay away. (I only finished this book because I was stuck on an airplane, on the ground, for over an hour and a half and all the cross-word puzzles in the air mag were done!)"},{"rating":"1","title":"This book is far beneath what I expected from Leon Uris.","review":"I am a long-time fan of Leon Uris's works, particularly his earlier books. So, it was with great expectations that I bought A God In Ruins almost immediately after its release. I have read only 150 pages, and will read no more. In fact, I was tempted to quit earlier, but feel you must give a book some time to come together.A God In Ruins never does come together. It is one of the most disjointed storylines I have ever seen. It is almost jarring it jumps around so much from time to time, place to place, character to character. Simply put, it is a jumble.I have also found it to be incredibly poorly written, almost to the point of annoyance. I am not certain how old Leon Uris is now, but I kept thinking he must be approaching senility and has lost his gift. It saddens me because I have gotten so much pleasure from reading him in the past. I would not recommend this book to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"A total waste of time","review":"I could not believe that the author of so many great stories could produce a book as poor as this one. I would have given it a rating of NO STARS if I could have. The book has no redeeming qualities and it appears that Uris has gone senile or has hired a high school ghost writer. My advise, don't even read the inside cover of the book as it bears very little relationship to the actual story and plot. THE BOOK IS A TOTAL WASTE OF TIME!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Unfortunate Indeed.","review":"I am glad I finished this book. I am glad I read it despite the meagre two stars I have awarded it. Having read Mila 18, I have probably started my Uris \\"experience\\" on a high note. I cannot say how much I truly enjoyed that book. However, this book...I understand that a book is truly a symbol or a mouthpiece in many cases for an authors philosophy and socio-political leanings. In this case it seems that Mr Uris really wrote with his heart on his sleeve without really remaining with the mechanics of the story. He failed to excercise his craft properly. Yes you saw it here first. He was intent on waxing maudlin and commented too plainly from within his personal belief system. If anyone reads this they will surely shake their heads and state, \\"Is this not true of every book? Why else does an author write?\\" That would be correct, as long as you do not lose track of the story."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Terrible Boo-Boo.","review":"\\"A God in Ruins\\" is a stunningly bad novel, and a complete waste of time in all respects. This novel also demonstrates that an author's once-immense talent can leave him in the cold. I am being brutal to Mr. Uris because he is one of my favourite authors of all time, and it is horrible to see the man who wrote brilliant, haunting novels like \\"Exodus\\", \\"Mila 18\\", and \\"Trinity\\" produce such a lifeless piece of trash. The writing is poor and amateurish, the characters are uninteresting, and the pro-liberal, anti-conservative tone almost made the book feel like propaganda. You should feel ashamed of yourself, Mr. Uris!! You have done your fans (myself being one) and your reputation a great disservice by writing this novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"An author in Ruins","review":"Leon Uris has often been a \\"Gun for Hire.\\" While this poorly crafted anti-gun screed shows occasional sparks of his former skills, it lacks their balance.

Stereotyped characters and poorly developed story line didn't give this opinionated writing sufficent credibility to survive as a novel. What a disappointment from the historical perspectives of his previous works."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"This book was clearly not Leon Uris's best effort. Uris is one of my favorite authors, but this book was difficult to read at best. The characters were not developed to the level of those in \\"Armageddon\\", \\"Battlecry\\", \\"QBVII\\", \\"Exodous\\" or \\"Trinity\\". It appears that this book was rushed into print to take advantage of the 2000 election. I would recommend reading this book only to appreciate Uris's other works. I hope this is not his last book, I prefer to remember \\"Armageddon\\" and \\"Trinity\\" not \\"A God in Ruins\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"An Almost Treacherous Disappointment","review":"I actually felt betrayed. The book, and especially the dialogue, reads like a seventies TV miniseries. Very shallow, stereotyped characters, a ridiculous plot, overt moralizing, and an anticlimactic climax. The only -- and I mean the only -- interesting thing in the book is a commando rescue mission in the middle of the book. The editors deserve special blame, not only for missing obvious mistakes but also for not trying to whip the book into shape."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very very disappointed","review":"I wish I had read the reviews before just buying on the strength of the other books I read of this author - and enjoyed thoroughly! This one had a good plot and that's were it stopped. I found it disjointed, disorganized and I kept on looking on the cover page for something that indicated a co-author! IMHO this was a good plot that fell flat on its backside by bad writing."},{"rating":"1","title":"a terrible disappointment","review":"I have just returned from a long holiday car trip with \\"God in Ruins\\" on 10 cassettes. I finished 5 and decided even radio would be better. I have read almost all Uris' other books, several twice, so I expected great things. Was I ever disappointed! The sex scenes were the fantasies of an old man, real bodice rippers--but utterly unbelievable. Then I was subjected to several chapters of Tom Clancyish war scenes with brains dripping off the ceiling, etc. Gratuitous gore! In short, it takes a really bad book for me not to finish it. It saddens me to see someone who has been so great fall so far. Where were his editors?"},{"rating":"1","title":"If I start a book, I finish it - but this one wasn't easy!","review":"A new book by Leon Uris! Of course I would buy it! I could hardly wait to read it. I didn't bother reading the reviews. Too bad! It was one of the worst books from one of the (once) best writers. If the name Leon Uris hadn't been on the cover, I would have thought it written by/for junior high school. And such corny, one dimensional characters! AARRGGHH! and UGH!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful. Re-read one of Uris' earlier books instead.","review":"Had this been a first novel, the author would have collected rejection letters from every publisher in town. Technically flawed, sophomoric dialog and descriptions, paper-thin characters and badly edited to boot. A God in Ruins is a thinly disguised vehicle for the author's liberal agenda, nothing more. For shame, Mr. Uris."},{"rating":"1","title":"An Entertaining Read For The Literate Liberal -Others Beware","review":"The characters and sub-plots are sufficiently well developed to keep the reader interested in the evenly paced story line. Unfortunately, Uris'life-long bent to apply broad strokes of the literary brush to his socio-political foes emerges here as polemic against the bulk of its potential readership.The premise that a kabal of gun industry gnomes and whiskey drinking, blood -thirsty hillbillys is the evil demiurge behind the National Rifle Association, the Republican Party and the Conservative Movement is credible only to a handfull of Leftist Idealogues. These folks read pamplets-not novels.In order to succeed, any novel must foster the readers natural desire to suspend disbelief and to vicariously interpose himself into the microcosm of the book. \\" A God In Ruins\\" does not succeed."},{"rating":"2","title":"I still love Mr. Uris","review":"I haven't read any of his books for quite a while, so I picked this one up with excitement. I settled into his wonderful writing style and thoroughly enjoyed myself.I really prefer his historical novels - just can't beat QBVII, and Trinity is probably my favorite - but I so enjoy his writing that his subject matter could be anything and I'd still like it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A dreadful book.","review":"This had to have been the worst book I've ever read. The story line jump constantly, such that I re-read paragraphs to see if I missed something.The back cover of the book mentioned an explosive secret, and that was the only reason I continued to read it. Once it was revealed, I couldn't help but think that even a predictable, government conspiracy type secret would have been better.I can't believe I read this book. I can't believe I bought this book. I've never sold a book to a used book store before, but I think I'll get rid of this one. It doesn't deserve to sit on my bookshelves.On top of it, I didn't appreciate his sermonizing. His AMERIGUN was an obvious attempt to negatively portray the NRA, of which I am a life member."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wow! Did Uris really write this tripe???","review":"I've read most of Uris' work, and this was so far below his other works than I was stunned. Cardboard cutout characters, contrived dialouge unworthy of a soap opera, and a bizarre story line than included characters and scenes that added nothing whatsoever. Obviously, he was deeply wounded by Columbine and what Clinton went through, but this, if intended as a response, came off 'half-cocked'"},{"rating":"1","title":"A God in Ruins","review":"Having read literally thousands of books with Leon Uris being one of my favorite authors, I can honestly say that I was extremely disappointed by this book. It is poorly edited with numerous flashbacks that are very confusing. For example, events are referred to that have not yet occurred. The author seems to have as a prime objective the furthering of his own political agenda at the expense of a rational plot. The characters seem to have little depth and their actions do not seem realistic."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad writing","review":"I was extremely disappointed in this book. Being a big fan of Leon Uris, I expected much more. The characters were so stereotypical, I laughed in disgust. The simplifications of complicated political ideas were equally annonying. No more Leon Uris for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Who wrote this book?","review":"I also wish I'd read the reviews before reading this book. Leon Uris has written some of my favorite books. I now question if I was misled in my opinion of his skills. Terribly disappointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"MIA in the Culture War","review":"The question begs. Would he have written this book if he knew that a substantial number of his readers would tumble it into the wastebasket as soon as the message emerged? This reader made it to page 160 and has learned that others more astute bagged it considerably earlier.It appears that the arthor laid a trap for a considerable portion of his life-long readership fully intending to slap them in the face for their loyalty. Contrary to Uris' characterization of the \\"American Gun Culture\\", the bulk of those interested in reading political and historical novels come from just that sector of modern society. Uris has really done mischief to his legacy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing...","review":"Having read all of Uris' books (and almost all of them more than once) I can properly say that this was by far the weakest and shallowest one. I couldn't stop reading books like EXODUS, TRINITY or REDEMPTION, but I had to force myself to read this one.The story and the characters are weak, as plenty of other reviews have pointed out -- I have nothing to add to them.Another negative point goes to the research: in a scene supposedly set in the late 70's, you read \\"People have gladly traded their freedom for a web site\\"; a couple of pages later you find a URL (web address), and then someone inserts a CD into a computer! Internet didn't exist then, and CD's are a 90's invention! The references to SCARAB (in actual life, OSPREY) are also wrong, for the aircraft started flying in the 80's.

I actually wonder if he really wrote this book or if some liberal pupil of his from Columbia conned him into letting him use his name for this worthless, poorly edited, cartoonishly poor work of strawman arguments. The \\"author\\" (yeah, right) is obvious in his desire to grind his politically liberal axe in the face of the average western American male. Mixed metaphor? Of course.Every character becomes a sterotypical caricature. The liberal politics are obvious. The editing is amateurish. And the story isn't even very interesting.Pretend Mr. Uris stopped writing after Redemption. Pretend he died with thoughts of the Irish free of politcal and religious turmoil and his notoriety will be saved."},{"rating":"1","title":"Leon Hubris?","review":"It is difficult to believe that the man who wrote Exodus and Trinity could pen such unmitigated tripe. It was all I could do to finish it. I would have pitched it, but it was the only thing I had on a long plane flight, and I became fascinated, wondering just how bad it could actually get. Beyond my worste imaginings. One of his statements is so absurd it defies description. Uris says that Bill & Hillary Clinton suffered more than any other couple in history! In all history? This alone demonstrates how hopelessly out of touch Uris is with reality -- or history. His take on gun ownership is likewise stupifying. I could go on and on, but all you need to know is -- don't waste your valuable time. I should have just reread the inflight magizine 20 times.

The plot is totally disjointed and unrealistic, the characters are poorly developed and stereotypical, the political agenda espoused by Mr. Uris is non-original ultra-liberal tripe disguised as common sense, and the Jewish persecution complex weighs heavily through the final chapters of the book. My advice to Mr. Uris is 'please retire' and leave writing to those authors who enjoy giving their public a well-thought-out and balanced product. I for one will never invest in another Uris book."},{"rating":"1","title":"An Author Ruined","review":"Mr. Uris has written some of the finest books ever. This book was not one of them. Characters are undeveloped and uninteresting. Technical references are incomplete and inaccurate. Writing is sloppy, arrogant and highly politicized. Uris deconstructs, as he should, myths of Jewish conspiracy to gain control of finance and government. At the same time he constructs myths of a redneck American right bent on destruction of liberty in the name of Christianity. He spends far too many words defending the immoral conduct of the Clintons, then charges fictional, Republican characters, with similar histories of sexual disfunction, political spin, and conduct that undermines trust in government and business. He has spent far too much time in New York. This is garbage compared to Exodus and Trinity.

I feel like her money was totally wasted...the book lacks the well-researched, historical background that has been so characteristic of his other novels.

I've gone back to the store, and bought more, thinking it was a bad lot, but have had the same problem over and over. Forget baitless, the traps still need to be baited. I recommend smearing peanut butter across the paddle. After throwing away the half that can't be set, the remaining ones do catch mice, but I recommend buying the traditional snap trap with a metal bait petal.

The eerie aspect is that I heard mouse squeaks and movement thereafter. A short while later, I found the mouse in the trap with its leg and tail trapped. So, I had to deal with discarding the live mouse.Warning! This trap should not be used around children.

Instead of the metal bait/latching area, there is now a yellow plastic thing in place which is very hard to latch. It took to me about 20 attempts to get it latched properly and I came close to snapping the trap on my own fingers. This is more trouble than it's worth.

Buy the old school Victor traps with the Metal trigger..I just threw these away. useless."},{"rating":"1","title":"They don't catch the mice!","review":"Thanks to these traps, the mice in my barn are now well-trained to avoid traps in general. I don't have any trouble setting the traps, and they go off with enough force to flip them across the hay stall--but they never catch the mouse. I haven't had this issue with any other kind of basic spring trap."},{"rating":"1","title":"Quality control issue","review":"Very poor quality control. For this trap to set properly the components must be placed fairly accurately on the platform. There is a lot of variation in their placement, to the point some traps can't be set or are too sensitive. Nothing like creating a product that bites the customers fingers. Genius marketing. Perhaps the company wants to show a loss for tax reasons."},{"rating":"1","title":"A step backwards","review":"I've used the old version of this trap, the one with the metal bait platform, for many years and had 100% success. This version works about 25% of the time. Either the mouse takes the bait without setting off the trap or it releases spontaneously due to temperature change or minor floor vibrations. Living in the country I have to set traps indoors and in unheated out buildings.For bait I use sunflower seed from the bird feeder because it doesn't get rancid, you don't have to be refresh it on a regular basis, it's not messy, and it is easy to secure on the metal bait platform. This is not the case with this version where you have to use seed just the right diameter to securely insert it in one of the holes in the plastic platform without destroying the seed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Trust The Negative Reviews!","review":"These have got to be one of the worst mouse traps i've ever used. I doubted the negative reviews and bought a pack to try out b/c it was cheap, but the reviews weren't lying, you will not be able to get them to set. If you do manage to get one set, it wont' be Easy like the manufacture claims. I will be returning them b/c i can't believe they actually sell this garbage, what a rip off. Very suprised it hasn't been discontinued yet."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worse than Worthless","review":"I tried setting eight traps about thirty times. Not exactly \\"Easy-Set\\" in any way. I'm sitting here very angry, smelling of the peanut butter that got flung all over me when the traps inevitably went off in my hands, and with hurt fingers from trying to set these pieces of junk into place.Buy a cat, set poison, get more expensive traps. You'll be much less frustrated."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sensitivity is not a problem","review":"All of those reviewers who claim that these traps are too sensitive or not sensitive enough need to realize that you can set it to be as sensitive as you want. The yellow cheese shaped trigger has an adjustable range of motion, so depending on how much you engage the lever mechanism determines how sensitive the trap is. Come on, the traps are made by Victor, a company that has been making mouse traps since 1890. Do you think they would put out a bad product?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not buy","review":"These traps are so cheaply made half of them would not even set and the ones that did started falling apare within a week."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not so easy to set","review":"These traps work just fine once you are able to set and place them as you want. It often takes two or three tries, including a few near-heart attacks to get them to set properly without snapping closed before you are able to get your hand off of them."},{"rating":"1","title":"...and they got away","review":"Okay, I live in the country so I get mice when the cold weather hits...I put these in the basement and caught a couple after spending a frustrating time of setting them. I thought it was me until I read other people had a hard time too...they snap sooooo easy and are difficult to get them just right. I say they work 1 out of 4 times or so. The mouse gets a treat and the trap is either set or snapped. I had one 'get away' injured...didn't kill him. I'm getting the electronic one and the old fashion snap traps. My cat tells me the cellar is all clear for now."},{"rating":"1","title":"To hard to set!","review":"I have bruised fingers from trying to set them. Then I would gently put them on the floor and they would trip as I walked away! DO NOT BUY!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Hard to set","review":"In all my years, I have never written a bad review, until now. I bought 3-packs of these and tried all of them, with only 20% success at setting the trap. If you are skillful enough to set it, you have to be extremely careful to set it down. It snaped on me multiple times when i was just pushing it with a stick on the floor. Also the directions say to lift the plastic lever 45 degrees while you are springing the trap. Do they realize that when you are doing this, the finger you are using to lift the lever is in the zone of the the trap spring? I got snapped a few times and decided to quit trying this. Bad design.I will say that the 3 that I did manage to set did kill the mice, but in my opinion is not worth the fustration."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful. Try to find the old version.","review":"I have used these before this last attempt with them. With a lot of careful work reminiscent of a bomb disposal expert, I did manage to get the odd one set, but it was a very stressful affair.Little mousey is back, so I recently bought another packet. Try as I might, I could not get the first two to set. In frustration, I threw them in the garbage, and headed off to Home Depot to find a better design. Low and behold, the shelves are stocked with Victor mouse traps - but they're the old design!Could it be that Victor have read the endless unfavourable reviews of the new design, and decided to go back to the old version that worked? We can live in hope.Anyway, I returned home with the older design (the ones with the metal trigger), had three of them set up in no time at all, and they're now lying in wait.Let's hope Victor have had a change of heart on their new design."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love this trap","review":"I have had no problems with this trap. I've used them for years in the garage and basement. I never bait them with anything. Mice will always run along the wall so I set the trap up with the plate facing the wall . They run over it and snap gotcha. Added bonus is there Made in the U.S.A."},{"rating":"1","title":"ultra intelligent mouse? or worthless trap...","review":"Two nights in a row my resident mouse (or as I know refer to him \\"The Brain\\") has eaten the peanut butter and gotten away without tripping that trap. I gave it two stars because unlike other reviewers I didn't have problems setting the traps."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible, dangerous","review":"The review by S. Diamond is right on. The traps are extremely frustrating to set and will trigger many times in you hand before the tenstion bar will engage with the plastic paddle. If you are not careful you can get your finger trapped. I've had to throw some away because I could never get the tension bar to stay engaged. Also the cheese paddle does not attract mice. Only when I put some cheese on the paddle are mice attracted and about 1/3 of the time the mouse gets the cheese without triggering the trap."},{"rating":"1","title":"Got it set right away, put it in the cabinet and it snapped 4 minutes later....","review":"I heard thrashing for a minute or two, after the snap. When I went to check on it, the poor thing was barely under it, and it was snapped across it's eye and right below it's other eye, causing the eye to pop out! There was blood slung all over the place from the thrashing, and it's mouth and snout area was all caved in. So much for being humane! It was horrible! I just shut the cabinet and wrote a note for my husband to \\"check\\" it before work...I can't bear to look at it anymore, and I don't know whether to cry or throw up or start drinking.I had some \\"regular\\" mouse traps work perfectly and snap the neck, not the face! They were the metal type with the tiny catch. The catch for these are way too big, only allowing for the snout to tap the edge before the wire comes down and breaks their faces."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do Not Buy!!","review":"A better mousetrap???? I think not. The things would not set or stay set by the time I tried to set it in place. One of them the problem was that the catch was too far from the end of the arm and would not even secure. They were bought at WalMart and the receipt thrown out, so $$ is lost. Progress has consequences. Not good!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Just Junk","review":"My local stores no longer carry the metal pedal type of trap. These plastic pedal types are all anyone carries locally any more. I cannot understand why Victor would make these, and why stores would swap the old style with this junk. They're nearly impossible to set. The nylon/plastic pedal is too slippery to hold the pin. I've had to throw away more than half of these because they won't set. I have a lifetime of experience setting mouse traps in horse barns, garages, houses. So I'm not exactly a novice mouse trap user. And yes, these traps do actually work when you can find one in a pack that will set. But save your money and your fingertips by opting for the old Victor trap that has a metal pedal!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good for Cool Pix 4300","review":"I bought this for my Cool Pix 4300. I thought it might be too small, but I am able to fit the camera, charger, usb cable extra battery, extra memory card, and it is still possible to squeeze in the manual if you bend it a little. Would be too small if you have additional accessories to accomodate. It is hard to judge the size of camera cases online, so I hope this helps someone."},{"rating":"2","title":"awesome carseat","review":"We love these car seats! I bought two, one for each son. I love knowing that they are safe. The ONLY negative (and this is not always a negative)is that it is very tall and may not fit in all cars in the rear-facing position. When it is front-facing, that is a positive, as it can accommodate taller children! The push-button release on the LATCH clips is also great. It makes installation a breeze! I wish more people knew about the amazing safety features. I don't believe they have ever been recalled and they have a 5 point harness up to 80 pounds!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Radian 80 Princess Car Seat for Bigger Kids","review":"We decided to keep our little one in a 5-point seat a bit longer and she was fine with that; especially when we showed her the picture, her favorite color and style (Princess). She's 4 1/2 and loves the seat. This is a HEAVY DUTY seat and could probably take a direct hit by a BUICK (kidding)..but it's a VERY SOLID seat. We bought this to be able to travel with and it'll get its first excursion this fall to Scotland from TX and I've no doubt it will make the trip fine. It has a very solid feel and in spite of being quite stiff, daughter says its comfortable. Go to their website and download the manual, quite good, excellent details. I wish we'd found this before her last seat...BUY THIS ONE. Looked at the Britax and it's HUGE...a portable Barco-lounger; this has a much smaller footprint and just feels better (looked at other locally). THIS IS THE ONE TO GET IF YOU'RE ONLY GOING TO BUY ONE."},{"rating":"2","title":"Car Seat - excellent","review":"I love this car seat. Best feature is the steel frame so it's a wonderful sense of safety and security. I love the seat because it is narrow and doesn't consume all the space in your back seat. This would work great for smaller vehicles where space may be an issue. Compared to ohter seats, it's lighter in weight. Another great feature is the the bottom seat folds up so that carrying it or moving it between cars is very easy."},{"rating":"2","title":"We Like It","review":"It's a big seat, but sturdy. My son is 6 months old and enjoys being in the seat. He likes being able to look left and right without obstruction. The SuperCool feature was a big bonus. My son gets hot very easily and his head gets sweaty, the SuperCool material keeps his head nice and dry. We love it and recommend this car seat."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful Car Seat","review":"I would suggest this car seat to anyone. It is up to 80 pounds so you can really get the use out of it for the money put in. I love that it is not obtrusive and other people can sit beside the carseat comfortably."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sturdy car seat","review":"I purchased this product for my son, he was previously in a graco infant car seat which he couldnt stand being in. The visibility is better in this one. If I had known earlier, I would have started him in this convertible one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Safety plus comfort! We have a winner!","review":"My son has a sensitive stomach. His previous carseat (Graco) always produced spit-up, no matter how long I tried to wait before taking him after feeding him. Now he can ride right after eating and is completely comfortable. Plus with the slim design, he can look out the window better. This is a huge help with reducing tears on longer drives. He sleeps comfortably without a lot of head lolling and strange positions. Even better than the one (Eddie Bauer) my husband got for his car too!Only downside is the weight. But since it stays in my car 90% of the time, its just fine for us! Easy to seatbelt back in after removal when needed.I am thrilled that he is so safe AND comfortable!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent car seat--too tall to fit!","review":"This is an exceptional car seat in many respects. However, it will not fit in my sport coupe car in the rear-facing position as it is just too tall. I'm sure it will perform wonderfully once baby is facing forward."},{"rating":"2","title":"Compact like promised","review":"We ordered this carseat because we have 2 little ones and travel by plane at least twice a year. It is not as bulky as the Britax car seats that we have. It's easy to crawl over in the backseat to sit between them. And although we haven't flown with them yet, we expect them to be much slimer than anything we've seen."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible convertible car seat, not worth the money","review":"I bought this seat for my son after reading other reviewers email raving of how wonderful the seat is. As matter of fact, it is over-price, not as comfortable as I though it would be after spending $250 for this seat(I didn't buy it from AMAZON though). When you place the seat in a forward facing it does not give you a 45 degree angle. Making it very a bad posture for my son. POOR Instructions, very confusing to follow. It wasn't easy to assemble. The only thing that it does is, it could fold for traveling. I wish I didn't buy this seat.I went ahead and bought a different convertible seat for my son, it is called First Year True Fit convertible seat. It is much more comfortable, very easy or to none to assemble. Easy to follow instructions. This seat cost $75 less I love the seat and so is my son. My recommendation is DON'T WASTE your money on this seat. BUY THE FIRST YEAR TRUE FIT Convertible seat instead. Trust me you won't regret it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love this carseat!","review":"I did lots of research on carseats prior to buying the Radian and this was by far my favorite. I have the Pink Princess version. This seat is so easy to install. I love the support cushions that come with this model. We used both pieces with my daughter as a newborn and now at 10months she uses just the bottom piece. It just makes for a more comfy ride and more secure fit.The size of this seat is also a bonus. I can actually sit next to my daughters carseat in our car unlike so many other brands. Or even put 3 of them across my backseat.And last the safety ratings on this seat were a huge selling point for me. I love that it has a steel frame and is airline approved."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Car Seat","review":"We love this car seat! We have two, one for each of our children. It is the only one that folds which made it easy to take on the airplane when we went on vacation. It is one of the few that you can use from birth to 80 lbs. We only wish we had found it sooner. The only down side we found which is true for many car seats is when the cover needs to be cleaned due to accidents. It is difficult to take off and put back together. Also, the straps do not come out so they can be cleaned. Otherwise, it is most likely the only car seat your child will need."},{"rating":"2","title":"too tall for regular car seat","review":"Our daughter has always been on the 100th % for height and our Britax Marathon car seat was too small for her. We own a car with a fairly small back seat and were happy to find a booster seat that would accomodate both our daughter's height [while providing great safety with 5 point harness], as well as free up some of the space in the back seat. Our daughter loves how she can get in and out of the seat by herself, \\"just like big brother\\". The only complaint we have received from our daughter is that the bottom buckle [by crotch area] hurts her when she is wearing shorts or skirts. This however is completely eliminated if you make sure the attached padding is placed in the right way before buckling. All in all a great product. Look forward to testing it on an airplane, since Britax was a nightmare to take in and out of an airplane seat."},{"rating":"2","title":"NOT for SMALL cars as rearfacing","review":"This car seat is good in terms of safety and functionality. However, its compatibility up to 80lb passenger cause problem on the other hand. Its size, specificity the length of its back, it so long that, when install as rear facing, its top will lay on the back of the front seat, which is not recommended and dangerous. The solution involves moving your front seat forward, which will make the front space smaller. I do need to move forward A LOT to get enough space for it, and I know I will need to bear this uncomfortable for a year until it convert to front facing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great carseat","review":"I love this car seat. We own a 2007 Dodge Grand Caravan (with stow and go), and a 2008 Dodge Ram truck, and it fits great in both. I love how it is not overly bulky - a HUGE plus. There are spots on the back to store everything, and this works well. I do not like how unnecessarily long the tether is. But that is my only complaint. We also own a Britax, and I like the Radian more, again mainly because of it not being bulky. My DS, who is 2, loves it. It is comfortable for him, and that is a big thing - he is 2 and 40 lbs. Anyone with bigger kids, I highly recommend this seat!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Sunshine Kids Radian 80","review":"[...]This is a great car seat. The only issue is that is can be difficult to install in some vehicles but I believe that the quality of build and safety override that issue. It is much more difficult to install in rear facing mode; not bad in front facing mode. Make sure to always use the tether in either mode - it really helps to tighten up the install."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great seat, with easy to install crab-claw fasteners","review":"As good as the Britax we had, with a lower price point. Folds for travel, though heavy. Comes with a strap to attach to your luggage for travel. All car seats get very dirty... After having three boys, this is by far the easiest to clean, as the cover comes off in a snap. It is also the easiest to install in the car. Worth every penny, and we have two of these."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great carseat, but not super cool style...","review":"This was our second Radian 80 and we love the carseat. However, the SuperCool style is anything but super cool! The polyester covering gives it a weird texture and it just doesn't look as nice as our other one. I still think that the strap between the legs can be a bit short for older children(you can request a bit of a longer one from the company I think). Overall, the safety aspect of the Radian by far overshadows the style, but still..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Samsung TVs are defective do not buy!!!!","review":"There is a huge problem with these TVs developing tiny white spots in the picture....it is a known defect.

It will vibrate loose, and you'll end up plunging too deep and possibly ruin your workpiece.Second, it is too time consuming to set the depth stop accurately. With the lock screw loose, there is almost 1/8\\" of play in the mechanism, so the fine adjustment knob is almost useless.Third, the centering cone is plastic and junky, it wobbles and will not center the base accurately.Other than the plunge base the router is fine (although I haven't tried it in a table yet).

His recommendation was all I needed to pick up the book. However, after reading \\"Every Step You Take\\", all I can say is that Coben may be a brilliant author, but when it comes to reviewing novels, he is far too generous.This novel was not worth the work it took to read. There were so many subplots mixed in that all I was left with was a flurry of inconsequential characters to muddle through. Although the character of murderer B.B. Lebeau had the potential to be fascinating, the author never fully developed this.This novel continuously hinted at there being more to its plot, but never reached its potential. The ending was especially unsatisfactory, as it was implausible and even ridiculous. Motives given for crimes committed were weak and absurd.This novel was, unfortunately, a letdown."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book but ridiculous ending","review":"I have read 5 of Judith Kelman's books so far, and enjoyed every one. This one was particularly gripping. HOWEVER, every ending so far has been ridiculous.

I don't know about anyone else but I personally like suspense/murder/mystery books that actually talk about the people who are murdered and try to figure out why. I would throw this book away if I hadn't paid full price for it. I would never read this author again and I know this only half way thru the book!

This is without a doubt the worst book I have read in years and I read a lot. While the premise of identity theft is both interesting and contemporary, the execution is awful. Filled with trite phrases, pointless wordiness, and characters without character, Every Step You Take is simply a painful and unrewarding read.

The book was slow, and as others have written, too many characters and plots going nowhere, and the ending was so contrived I felt the author was like her lead character in that she couldn't come up with an ending so she made up one of the worst nonsensical ones I have ever had the misfortune to read. Most of the time I wanted to just put the book down and say \\"forget it\\" but since I paid for it I kept going.

The story content was as thin as the book itself. There was only general information on how he died; no detail at all.I was very disappointed with it and do not reccommend it to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"well, folks...","review":"3 September 2010: just saw a screening of Amir bar-Lev's documentary.

For example, the art of the Nok (the oldest African art outside of the Nile Valley)includes only a few pieces.The worst thing about this collection is that nearly all of the photos are in black and white. It's difficult to appreciate art of such a vibrant nature (with the exception of photography) without colour."},{"rating":"1","title":"No Table of Contents or Navigation for Kindle","review":"This review is specific to the Kindle version...

I have been listening to the last two Yerba Buena CD's and the music is contagious, you automatically start dancing and singing if you can catch the song.

In the background, it sounds okay. but when it's you and the stereo, in the truck, on the way to work and your major attention is put on the music, Island Life just doesn't cut it. $17 bucks wasted"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good grief!","review":"I ordered this for my brother who has a wonderful life but often calls me when he's feeling disgruntled and needs to talk it out.

Since I've purchased several excellent quality Shakespeare plays from Caedmon(all of which followed the text of the Riverside Shakespeare exactly), I decided to buy this collection.Alas! One only has to listen to the first three paragraphs of \\"The Cask of Amontillado\\" to realize that several sentences have been OMITTED (about 10 sentences from the entire story).Price and Rathbone do an excellent job with the EDITED material, and that saddens me, because I can imagine what they could have done with the unabridged text."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just turned me off...","review":"I know that this is supposed to be a great and highly-regarded recording, but all I could hear was a dry old man's voice and a boring British accent.

My poor review of this CD set is removed from Poe himself, but with the word \\"Unabridged\\" that is unabashedly displayed on the cover. While some of the stories do appear in their original form, many are cut, truncated, and butchered.

This CD is gutless. It has no volume, no amplitude, no power. To use it in my junior classes, I had to place an ampflifier mike at one of the speakers of the CD player I was using. I never had to do this before, and I've played plenty of audio CDs in class. Surf the web for free downloads instead of paying for this dog. I highly recommend \\"The Cask of Amontillado\\" as read by Norman George and \\"The Tell-Tale Heart\\" as read by talk-radio host Glenn Beck. The latter has sound effects and, when I played it (sans amp) in class, Beck kept the kiddies rapt until the grisly end."},{"rating":"1","title":"phooey","review":"Audiobooks are books meant to be read aloud, enunciation and clarity are among the most important.Using these very old recordings done for a 'dramatic appeal' has left me with a feeling of wanton waste of money.Basil Rathbone's renditions are from a Shakespearean attempting to do Poe. If he would simply read. Alas, he acts, not reads.All of his recordings are: Volume too low, adjust up, volume to high, adjust down, yelling, adjust down again, whispering, adjust up again, etc. etc. ad nauseum. One cannot possibly hear using one setting of volume.It is a waste of money. Find a human who can read it and enunciate and let me do the fantasizing and imagining and conjuring. The poetry and prose should stand up alone and by itself, not acted upon. Rathbone died in 1967. The recording is over 50 years old!!Anyone who needs it play acted is not getting the correct message. It's about the words, not the actor."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rathbone and Price spook it up","review":"Wonderful performances by Rathbone and Price, BUT volume on these CD's is lower than your average CD's and require one loud speaker & delivery system.

No introductions and disk information. There was no preface or other supplemental information. The publisher just slapped the recordings into on CDs. The sound quality, volume, was poor as well. Horrible waste of great talent. Buy Poe, with Price and Rathbone as readers. Do not buy from this publisher."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Quality","review":"I bought this TV directly from Panasonic. Got a great deal, the picture is sharp although there is some shadowing I can't get rid of completely.I would not recommend this TV however. I have owned my TV for 11 weeks and it has not worked for 6 weeks of that time. It has spent more time being repaired than it has working. The TV has had multiple failures and Panasonic refuses to replace it. They want to continue fixing my current, obviously seriously flawed TV. At a very slow pace might I add. Panasonic customer service has been horrible, I would not recommend this TV or any Panasonic TV to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy this TV","review":"I bought this TV in Feb 04. Used it weekends only for 3 years, and fulltime 4th year. It quit working Nov 08. No power from remote or front button. Extremely heavy and bulky to move around. I should have read all the negative internet chatter on this model and bought LCD."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as reliable as my other Panasonic experiences","review":"I bought this Panasonic a few years ago before LCD's and plasma's dropped in price. I specifically shopped for Panasonic because I like the brand and was always happy with whatever Panasonic product I bought. Today I wouldn't recommend this model because: (1) I' ve had to have it serviced twice--my previous Panasonic lasted nearly 20 years with ZERO repairs. Both times the parts were under $5.00 but home service and labor cost me more than $230 bucks; and (2) It's a beast, weighing over 100 pounds and very bulky. Why buy a monster like this when you can buy and tote home an LCD under your arm?! And, of course, if you need an LCD or plasma repaired, you can carry it in yourself. So it looks like next time this TV craps out (as I'm sure it will), I'll be looking for a different brand."},{"rating":"2","title":"Engineering level","review":"High technical level.

It was a worthwhile read, but the problem with the book is that it's an extraordinarily fast read--I got through it in about an hour. It's effectively a newspaper feature article on the subject, packed out to book length and packaging with a few gimmicky graphics tricks--and six pages of songwriter credits--that pad out additional pages. It also presumes that everyone reading the book is familiar with every song--which may or may not be the case."},{"rating":"1","title":"Almost made me stop reading Dave Barry","review":"I bought every book Dave Barry ever wrote the day it came out, and this was no exception. Unusually, I was a little reluctant to buy this one (I had hated the Bad Song Survey columns so much), but I ended up buying it the day it came out as usual. I should have paid more attention to my instincts. While there were some funny parts of the book, most of the book just upset me because it trashed so many of my favorite songs. I was depressed for weeks after reading this book and 13 years later I still become very upset sometimes when I hear one of the songs that is unfairly maligned in this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Funny, but the book on tape format begged the question...","review":"...'why not include parts of the actual songs?'Yes, I realize it would be a publishing nightmare - trying to convince someone to let you use their song just so you could make fun of it, but it would have been so much more effective!Oh well, what might have been!This really is a funny book. Dave's quirky sense of humor was effective, as always. I thoroughly enjoyed Dave's list of bad songs and his analytical dissection of the lyrics, especially when I also intensely disliked the song. However, I liked it even more when I actually loved the song ('American Pie' comes to mind)!"},{"rating":"1","title":"DON'T Buy The Audio Version!","review":"Now I know how much of comedy is TIMING. This tape was HORRIBLE! What might have been funny if read by Dave Barry, or even if I read it myself (if I'd gotten the book), was root-canal-like painful read by Mike Dodge, whose delivery reminds me of every safety training video I've ever heard.The producers must have known how un-funny his delivery made the material, as they even added \\"pa-da\\" drum staccatos to let us know when a joke was being made. If you love Dave Barry, DON'T buy this tape - it'll kill you to hear the material so butchered."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I read this book in about thirty minutes.

He's great on paper, but not on Memorex."},{"rating":"2","title":"A hilariously funny book","review":"Dave Barry is one of the cleverest men alive. His ability to come up with these funny books is simply amazing. To completely appreciate this book, you should review some old songs from the 60's through the 80's. My personal favorite joke in the book was when he took the song \\"Timothy\\" and the song \\"Yummy, Yummy, Yummy I got love in my Tummy\\" and made it \\"Yummy, Yummy, Yummy I got Tim in my Tummy (if you know the lyrics to both songs, you would get the joke)\\". Or when he took the song \\"There Ain't No Woman Like the One I Got\\" and made it \\"There Ain't no Woman Like the One-eyed Gott.\\" Well, I don't want to give the whole book away, but those are just a few of the jokes in the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty funny stuff","review":"My husband got this book last December and loved it so much that he read has read the whole thing to me, laughing the whole time.

Just keep Kleenex at hand because you will laugh until you cry"},{"rating":"2","title":"Teenage Death Songs, Weenie Songs, etc....","review":"Dave delights (& horrifies) us once again with hilarious commentary on materials collected over the years from his Alert Readers. The subject: a long list of Really Bad Songs that will take up space in your brain that could otherwise be put to good use.No genre of music is spared. Neither are we. We are treated to reminders of Country, Rock \`n' Roll, and all sorts of well-known \\"popular\\" selections in between that we would have rather forgotten and which will now be playing in the backs of our brains all night. The compensation is that we will get to laugh first.If you generally find yourself snickering, chortling or otherwise guffawing as you read Dave Barry, this book will be no exception. I especially recommend the Audio version to listen to as you embark on a long road trip.-Andrea, aka Merribelle"},{"rating":"2","title":"Laughed 'til I cried","review":"Barry did a survey that asked readers of his column to vote for their all-time worst songs, and the results of that effort are the basis of this book. This might be the funniest thing I ever read. I teach school, and I read this on the last day of school this year while the class watched a movie. They kept turning around to stare at me, wondering why I was alternately laughing and crying. I am of the generation that grew up with these songs, so if you are not, it might not be as funny. Be aware also that my wife did not think it was very funny, as she really LIKED most of these songs."},{"rating":"2","title":"MANDATORY READING","review":"If you're one of the lucky ones who actually remember what Rock and Roll WAS before Elvis died and immediately thereafter, disco and punk interbred & killed it - GET THIS BOOK!!!

And as an ex-playing-4-nights-a-week-musician myself, I really, REALLY appreciate his list of songs that \\"cover bands hate to cover,\\" because he mentions \\"A1 & A2 on the Jukebox-in-hell,\\" \\"Stairway To Heaven\\" & \\"Free Bird.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Most beautiful book in the World!","review":"This book was the absolute BEST book i've ever read, and i just can't narrow it down any more than that!

But this book did not provide that. It was a struggle to finish bc the novel is laced with ramblings. It just never seemed to flow and the mystical aspects seemed out of place and implausible. I had to skip chapter 19 entirely for those reasons.Maribel's boss, Caleb, seemed to be just thrown into the mix early on with no prior history revealed.In general, major details were left out and the novel did not tie everything together. Loose ends abound.Very disappointing..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Crappy Frother","review":"This machine looks very nice and was built fairly well for the most part, BUT the cappaccino machine needs more steam power for the frother and the rubber piece they have over the froth wand is useless and the machine actually froths better without it. The coffee maker takes forever to brew and the pot and its lid are kind of cheap.I would NOT recommend this machine."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not So Hot","review":"I found this product to be poorly made and flimsy. The espresso was more bitter than my previous machine and the machine itself clogged easily. I found that coffee of both types made with this machine was just a little funny tasting, perhaps because of the plastic or other materials used in its manufacture.On the good side, the warmer plate for regular coffee was not very hot, but hot enough, allowing the second cup to taste almost the same as the first."},{"rating":"2","title":"so far ...great","review":"Well so far this machine has been great for the price, while the espresso isn't great it makes a fairly good mocha. It isn't a 3 or 5 hundred dollar machine, let's face it it wasn't even $50.00. I usually spend $5.00 or $10.00 a week on mochas so if I get even 6 months out of it will will have paid for itself several tiimes over. If you are looking for Starbucks either go to Starbucks or get yourself a $500.00 machine but if you are looking for a fairly good mocha or cappucino then give it a try."},{"rating":"1","title":"Leaves a bad taste in your mouth","review":"For the price, the machine looks great and I was not expecting miracles just good coffee and occasional decent cappuccino. That said I was happy to read Miss Mary's review because the bitter taste the coffee has from this machine is amazing. First, I thought it was the water then the coffee after changing both and getting the same result I'm glad it was not just me. I plan to send it back today!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Looks can be deceiving","review":"Wow! Too good to be true would be a correct summation here. It is flimsy and coffee doesn't stay hot.

Do more than make it pretty."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the great buy that it seems","review":"My problem is different from the other reviewers. Maybe I'm not the espresso taste connosseuir(sp?) that the other reviewers are, but I was perfectly happy with the machine.... when it worked.I got the machine and used it about 10 times... then the frother just stopped delivering any steam. I sent it back and got another one. Used the second one about 10 times, and guess what? You guessed it... it stopped delivering steam in the frother again. Arghhh!!!Maybe I just got a couple of them out of a bad lot; I don't know. But, I would not buy this machine again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Absolutely Terrible","review":"This has got to be the worst coffee machine we have ever had. It is nearly impossible to pour the coffee out of the pot without it spilling all down the side and onto your counter (or hand, whatever) Also, when the coffee brews, it spits and sputters all over the place. We have papertowels underneath our machine and it is staining our countertops.Absolutely terrible."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointing","review":"This coffee pot has been full of disappointments. The expresso acts more like a drip coffee pot, so you end up with something that resembles strong(er) coffee, but NOT expresso. It is hard to know where to exactly place the expresso carafe so that you don't end up with coffee all over the counter. It is even hard to pour the expresso out without making a mess. The coffee pot takes a long time to brew a pot. The filter basket is hard to swing out. Overall, this is a poorly made machine and the performance is poor. It's products like this that are teaching me that you have to SAVE THE BOX AND RECEIPT for much longer than you think you should have to!

Unfortunately, within the first week or so, the \\"pause and serve\\" broke off. This was one of the MAIN reasons I agreed to this machine. It takes up much more room on my countertop than most other machines we have purchased. Now, about a year later -- I agree with another reviewer -- it DOES take 8 years to brew a pot. No, I take that back, to brew a HALF pot! Stay away from this machine. Decide what features are important to you before making your final decision. If you are looking for a sleek, pause and serve, and efficient coffee maker -- LOOK ELSEWHERE."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheaply made!","review":"I bought this item from walmart and tested it out and it worked great so i threw out the receipt and the box. A month later the plastic peice has broken off the drip part so now a sping hangs down and its a pain in the butt to get the pot in place. I cant return it (although im gonna try). Ive owned some cheap coffee makers in my life and they seemed to be made better then this expensive one. Plus, the coffee doesnt get very hot. This was just a big disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bitter tasting","review":"Initially I really liked this coffee maker. It has all the features to make lattes, etc. and is easy to use. However after a couple of weeks I decided to return it. It does something to the taste of the coffee. I tried making it exactly right, tried changing coffees but it still have a funny bitter taste which I can only assume is from the type of materials used, or the way it creates the coffee. Also had a problem getting hot enough coffee. So not recommended unless you don't care how the coffee tastes (like my husband).However, I have a WestBend kettle which is fantastic so this is not a review against the brand which has does have good products."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Coffee Maker....EVER","review":"We bought this piece of junk thinking it would be a good addition to our kitchen. WRONG! The little knob on the bottom of the filter broke after the second pot. The filter tray gets clogged up if you have even .01 tsp over what is needed and then...it overflows! We now have a nice brown stain where this piece of junk sits. The overflow of water caused our toaster and breadmaker to burn up...lovely!I'd suggest writing to westbend to complain, it's the only way to get it replaced by them."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Good Espresso, The Bad Coffee, and The Ugly Mess!","review":"I read these reviews prior to purchasing this item, but went and bought it anyway because I wanted to save money. Well, now I am suffering from the worst coffee I have ever had. The espresso is great, the frother works great, etc. The espresso carafe doesn't sit well and it does splatter all over the place, but I have made some great Cappucinos. As for the coffee side, if you like black coffee, then the temperature will be ok. If you like milk in your coffee, its not hot enough. BUT, the biggest problem is the taste of the coffee. I use the same coffee I used on my Drugstore bought coffee maker, I have also tried freshly ground Starbucks, and still there is a wierd taste and it makes that early morning experience I look forward to...SUCK!!

The Sound Quality was so-so even during the short time that it did work.I have since bought a new XM AUDIO SYSTEM distributed by the Belkin Corporation. All I can say is I wish I would have spent a little more the first time and got the Belkin instead of the GPX. There is no AM or FM (who cares) and the XM music is crystal clear with the Delphi RoadyXT. It really sounds excellent and plenty of volume.

There may be problems with some copies but certainly not mine. This is not an easy go but the acting singers do a wonderful job on what can be a very difficult score. Frankly, I liked this stark looking production a great deal. It isn't pretty but does it need to be? It keeps the focus on the drama and that's exactly where it should be. As for memorable melodies, there aren't any and I wouldn't expect there to be. This isn't Verdi or Puccini. Personally, I dislike the way the term Euro trash is thrown around.

I have identified a number of birds in my back yard and around the area with this book. The illustrations are excellent.

I still have to use two other bird books \\"National Geographic Birds of North America, Vol. 3\\" and The Birders Handbook: A field guide to the natural history of North American birds\\". The Birders handbook has much needed information about such things like nesting, number of broodes, food types, etc. The information in the Sibley Guide mostly compares one species with another.

Sommers appropriately emphasizes the important stuff of teaching (and of life): self-understanding,listening, trust, reflective practice, and more. While the appendix is of particular interest to art educators and their kin, Teaching from the Inside Out can inspire all educators, from the neophyte to the 30-year veteran."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thorough and effective, but...","review":"I have tried to teach myself Hindi, and there is no denying that the key to learning the language and its pronunciation is learning the script. This book is methodical, thorough, and very effective. I used it at the beginning while working with more comprehensive books, and I learned the writing system very fast with its help. This in turn made studying with the other books that much more valuable.However, once done with the book I actually didn't have to go back to it., which is a good thing, because the physical quality of this book is appalling. It is so poorly bound that during my very first attempt to open and copy from it, it came apart immediately, and only lots of scotch tape kept it from disintegrating entirely before I was done with it. This is unacceptable for the price!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good book to study before studying Teach Yourself Hindi","review":"I bought this book simply because Amazon said that many people who bought Teach Yourself Hindi bought this book. I think this recommendation was quite reasonable. When I opend the Lesson 1 of Teach Yourself Hindi, the skit was written in Devanagari. Teach Yourself Hindi also has some pages about the Devanagari Script, but I don't think that's enough. So, I opened this Teach Yourself Beginner's Hindi Script and studied the script first. The book explains strokes and shows plenty of examples of hand written scripts. Those were quite useful. Now I am comfortablly studying the skits in Teach Yourself Hindi. I recommend studyging Teach Yourself Beginner's Hindi Script first."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I thought Seawolf was a good read until the Captain (with a significant lack of balls) allows his boat to be captured, with no resistance, and does nothing while it is towed backward all the way to China. Gimmie a break! (I would have put a couple of torpedoes down the stern tubes). At that point it all went downhill to a very dissatifactory ending. We are set up to know that Linus collaborated with his interrogators, but this never comes out. The press is amazingly cooperative and uninvestigative. The crew doesn't leak news of torture and Linus' complicity. Too much unblievable ploting, too many loose ends and an ending that doesn't work. I don't think I will read the next one by this author."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice start then it headed for the bottom.","review":"Having just read \\"Kilo Class\\", which I enjoyed, I thought that I'd give \\"U.S.S. Seawolf\\" a try. I certainly was disappointed. Robinson returns many interesting characters, both American and Chinese, in this book and starts out with an interesting plot involving new Chinese submarine and nuclear capabilities. But about half way through the story the plot twists become so dramatic and sensational that they become unbelievable and farfetched. I've got nothing against irrational or unlikely outcomes but Robinson falls to make then plausible. Overall it's not a very good book. Had I not been on a long flight, with nothing else to read, I don't think that I would have finished it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Read something else","review":"USS SEAWOLF intends to be an exciting novel about submarine warfare. All it achieves, though, is to put some stupid, lame Chinese ( who talk and act like the Americans, but are only 5 ft tall and wear thick, horn-rimmed glasses - so much for cultural empathy) against swearing, brave Americans. Don't read this book if you don't consider the frequent use of \\"heh heh heh\\" and \\"whaddyamean\\" to be literature. Don't read this book if you don't feel like saluting when Robinson declares that the underlying stratum of goodness in Reagan's foreign policy renders all disobedience of the law irrelevant. Don't read this book if you don't like grotesque attempts at tragedy (We're gonna get your son back out, Mr. President, I promise!). But, most of all, don't read this book if you don't find the subtle, fascistoid morality (Let's sink the Chinese pricks so they can't do whatever they please... after all, they're CHINESE!) funny.Actually, don't read this book, full stop."},{"rating":"1","title":"Close but.........","review":"Like so many other authors, Mr Robinson has trouble nailing the endings of his books. Too many loose threads were left hanging about; Crockers' suicide?, the presidents son not having his treason revealed, the Chinese C in C... I enjoyed the book, until the last 50 or so pages. Too bad the ending of the book couldn't have been as tight and satisfying as the action in the middle!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Basic premise totally unrealistic","review":"There is no way an immature,irresponsible naval officer such as the XO in this garbage book would ever be placed in a position of such responsibility. His portrayal of senior officers is equally off base. There may a bozo or two like the senior officers in both the American and Chinese navies in this book but I seriously doubt it. Robinson should stick to tactics. That was interesting reading."},{"rating":"1","title":"Plain Chauvinism Under The Cover Of a Thriller","review":"I have read all of Partrick Robinson's books and I think this one is the worst. After the glory of HMS Unseen I had come to expect something even better from this guy. But what he has come up with does not make sense at all. If he wants to write a Frederick Forsyth style novel, it will be fine so long as he does the same kind of research. Praising \\"realism\\" and accusing the perceived excesses of \\"pluralism-liberalism\\" will not do. You simply can not send a squad of SEALs right under the nose of the Chinese mainland, you can not blow up a nuclear submarine in a Chinese yard. This book does not make any sense at all. If you have not bought it, do not and you will not be disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT WORTH THE EFFORT","review":"I like submarine novels, and if the author knows his or her way around a nuclear boat, then I try to give him/her the benefit of the doubt on their treatment of the story, providing, of course, that's it's filled with realistic underwater super action. But I'm afraid I have to go along with the naysayers on this one. It's shallow, unbelievable, something is definitely wrong with the writing, and it's just not worth the effort. I managed to read the whole thing thinking it would get better, but nothing worked. From the fly on the wall view of the Chinese high command, to the idiotic Executive Officer of the U.S.S. Seawolf, it was a total let down. I wish I had watched television. I give it two stars, and that's being generous."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good story line ruined by this author","review":"Follwoing my read of USS SEawolf, I doubt I'll purchase another book by this author. His representation of all US Navy personnel as racists was offensive. Surely not everyone in the submarine service believes that all Chinese should be working in laundries or as take out delivery boys. It really takes a lot to bug me enough to write a review like this but this guy did it.I'm also over his repetative use of words like \\"growled\\" as in \\"The plane growled across the sky.\\" Somebody buy this guy a thesaurus."},{"rating":"2","title":"solid and truthfull","review":"This book covered truthfully and acurately the aspects of submarines, seals, the president and the chinese. The personas of the chinese leaders were real regarding their obtuse nature, the mission of the seals was executed as a real one would, the ending is an unexpected twist that only adds to the quality of the book, I'd recommend this to anyone who likes a good adventure but without all the hard to understand military prose that tom clancy adds"},{"rating":"1","title":"Clive Cussler Watch Out!","review":"This is one of the most dismal reads I've had in a long time. The prose is juvenile, the plot confused, and the premise implausible. As an added bonus, the book is cluttered with the most rabid of right-wing fantasies (such as Clinton was responsible for various spies in the LANL labs and in California, though the spies had plainly been in place for many years, if spies they were). The characters are at best 2 dimensional comic book cutouts, with the motivations of Jesse Ventura and the Amazing Spiderman in one muscle-bound tower of manliness. At least Clive Cussler is fun to read; this mess makes me wonder if the publishing houses have run out of capable authors."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where do I start?","review":"I'm new to this author but I got the book for free (Thank God I didn't waste money on it.) From the beginning I was getting into what I thought was going to be a good read. It started out well and then quickly went down hill. Too right-wing, Clinton started it all, Chinese are \\"Little Pricks\\", etc. The ending was a GREAT letdown. What happened to Linus? Why did Judd commit suicide, what happened to the Chinese C in C? All questions with no answers. I think I'll skip this author from now on."},{"rating":"1","title":"Getting Worse","review":"I recently picked this up at Sydney Airport, and having read his others, was very disappointed. Approximately 50% of the book is a sycophantic promo for special forces, including deafeningly wooden dialogue, and the other half has a good plot (mind you it has been done before by Dimicurio). If you are an avid fan, wait for the soft cover, because you'll feel disgruntled paying full freight for this for an author that has been rushed by his publisher. 2.5 stars"},{"rating":"1","title":"Submarines + right-wing rhetoric = bad book","review":"I have all of Patrick Robinson's previous books. While nothing special, they all had decent stories containing a bunch of comptetent American military men cruising around the world in submarines or undergoing secret operations to keep the world free for the American way.The characters and plot in USS Seawolf are fairly standard Robinson. The characters aren't too deep. The plot is ok, but is very slow in the middle.However, after finishing USS Seawolf, I felt that I like I had been bludgeoned over the head with right wing ideas without mercy for 3 hours straight. According to the book, politicians are stupid, Chinese are evil, and military men are the only people worth anything on this planet (unless they're the offspring of politicans, in which case they're useless).I was prepared for an average techno-military thriller. Instead, I got a book that seems like it should have been serialized in an ultra-right-wing magazine."},{"rating":"1","title":"Profoundly disappointed","review":"I am an avid reader of military novels both fact and fiction and found this book to be a poor representation of basic naval strategies, protocals, and practices. This book contained every stereo type and cliche imaginable. The author did not do his research to present a plot line which was believable or coherent. The use and practices of the US special forces made them appear as pyrotecnic street thugs that like to blow things up, instead of the most percise and lethal troops our nation has. The ending was the most disjointed nonsense imaginable not to mention that our commander and chief was portraied as a self serving whimp! First and last book I'll read from this author."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why write about something you know nothing about?","review":"Potential good plot, but unbeivable dialogue and full of ignorance. Why would anyone write a book about something they know so little about AND fail to do any decent research? Robinson claims he had help from Admiral Woodward. I simply can't believe that. Time after time Robinson shows his ignorance--he seems to think subs only outside source of info is periscope, that the Chinese don't have satellite ship surveillance, that two F/A-18s were ready \\"in case it's engine didn't start.\\" he doesn't even know that the Officer of the Deck is a job all the officers share, and isn't a position such as Naviagotor, Ops Officer, etc.I once threw a book about B-52s over the side of a sailboat in mid-ocean because the writer was so ill informed. I surely would have done the same with this book if it hadn't been a Kindle edition."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of time","review":"Credibility seems to be low on Mr. Robinsons list of priorities in researching this book. I guess that is understandable for a Brit. trying to sell a book about the USN. He makes the Submarine force out to be incompetent, but does let them be second to the British navy. Even the Seal Team that this book is really about can't pull off thier mission without help from British SAS. Give me a break! Terminonogy is weak and the repetative British chest thumping is tiresom. This author should should stick to writing about The Brit navy, but then who on this side of the ocean would buy them if he did?"},{"rating":"1","title":"mind-numbing predictability","review":"Just didn't float my boat, I guess (ha ha). Robinson seems to have directed his work at those who find Tom Clancy a literary challenge and Rush Limbaugh too liberal. Aside from that, this is nothing the average reader hasn't seen before. The characters weren't well developed, leaving something more to be desired. Save your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Blatant propaganda","review":"Robinson has wasted a great deal of paper to trash the Chinese as laundrymen, the (US) Democratic Party a treasonous fools, the (US) Congress as obstructionist idiots. How the righteous military establishment gets anything done is beyond me. I picked up this book because, as a former deck officer, I usually enjoy a good sea-going yarn. I closed the book when I found that Oliver North, thinly disguised as Col. Hart, was the Second Coming instead of someone who should have been stripped of his commission."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good Book With a Lousy Ending","review":"I enjoyed the book although not as much as Robinson's earlier efforts. The ending, however is rushed and has people acting out of character. Without giving it away, I don't mind unusual endings, but they have to hang together with the rest of the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Could be much better","review":"After reading the first three submarine thrillers which I found really fantastic (especially HMS Unseen), I was very much disappointed with USS Seawolf. I felt there was something missing to glue the parts together and especially the ending could have been more elaborate. I hope there will be a fifth one but judging from the ending I very much doubt it."},{"rating":"1","title":"The worst of the worst","review":"If you share the paranoid right-wing fantasies - and racism - of Pat Buchanan, and don't mind some of the worst writing ever visited on a military thriller, then you may find this pathetic attempt enjoyable. If you can suspend disbelief, or worse yet actually believe, in the absurd plotlines, and don't find the American characters to be racist, abusive jerks, then full speed ahead. It is astonishing that a (previously) respected publishing house like Harper would issue such trash."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good, but not as good as his last","review":"I enjoyed this book and was glad Robinson added the last 38 pages that most authors would skip, namely there are consequences for mistakes and not all ends well. On the down side, I think there was a little too much filler with the seals Special forces talk and action and he gave us breif histories of too many seals, going into more depth for two or three individuals would have been better. Also his NSA character does go way overboard talking bad about races, religons, and nationality. I think this is wrong, I prefered the way Clancy and others would have a lower level person doing it with higher ups pointing out that the majority of these people were good and they were being misled or kept in the dark about things by a few bad leaders which all races, religons, and nationalities occassional get."},{"rating":"2","title":"Clancy LITE","review":"When I sit down to read a Tom Clancy book, I know I'm (usually) going to get a good plot with lots of supporting detail. This book had the plot without getting mired down in all the technical gore. Usually I like detail, but in this case it kept the reading fast-paced and exciting.Politics and military action are combined in a good balance throughout.The ending (last 20 pages or so) seemed to be extra and unnecessary. Torture scenes in the middle had me squirming. The writer also seems to have his own political agenda that he conveyed through his characters... could have done a better job veiling that.Despite some flaws, I still read it anxiously... well worth the time for Clancy fans."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Disappointment","review":"I give this book two stars for action, but that's it. The plot has major holes, such as the Chinese conveniently hiding the prisoners on an island jail, readily accessible to the SEALS. Where was the Chinese air force during the escape?? The right-wing comments were way overdone. A second term President completely falls apart??My biggest problem with the book is the ending. It's completely unsatisfying. Its a bummer. The deal about Crocker's dad writing a tell all book did not fix it. And how about some closure on the incompetent Chinese leaders?This book does not meet the standard Patrick set for himself in his previous books."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ignore this book","review":"I have read numerous submarine novels by authors such as Tom Clancy and Michael DiMercurio. Their books are far better than this. USS Seawolf is one big cliche. First of all, the characters are all one dimensional. The Chinese are portrayed as the evil supervillains, while the Americans are all red blooded patriots. The plot is simplistic. Plus, Robinson's writing style is mediocre at best. His descriptions are good (possibly the only good thing about this book) but his dialogue is sub-par. If you want a good naval novel, read Hunt for Red October, or Phoenix Sub Zero (by Michael DiMercurio). Just not USS Seawolf."},{"rating":"1","title":"A weak effort","review":"Okay, so I'm English but I have enjoyed the previous novels and was looking forward to this one. Now I don't mind a military novel if it is well written and the characters are believable, but this novel fails in many areas. The US Navy are too Hawkish and the SEALS are invincible superheroes (and how nice that three SAS soldiers are un-necessarily involved to make us Brits feel better) and the US President is portrayed as a rather pathetic individual rather then the leader of the free world! The writing is oddly stilted and I suppose the ending was supposed to have a twist, but in reality it was rushed and did not feel right. Mr Robinson has proved that he has in in him to write good navy novels and I hope he gets back on the right track again soon."},{"rating":"1","title":"Captains Don't Say \\"Aye\\"","review":"Submariners will gag on the techical inaccuracies and a vocabulary lifted from Jack Aubrey stories - \\"for'ard\\"?

The fact that he totally misrepresented the San Diego Zoo makes me wonder about his creditability regarding other information in his story. I realize this is fiction but if you are going to mention a world class site, you should have correct information. His characters were interesting and he did have good story development. There were no low points where you could be inclined to skip pages."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Even Close","review":"This book was a great disaster. The plot is completely absurd and the behavior of the sub commander utterly stupid. They drive the sub right into the hands of the Chinese and then the US government just let the Chinese take the sub. This book does not live up to the prior three in the series. What a dissapointment"},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible...","review":"I am a fan of the techno-thriller. Sub novels in particular. I picked this brick off the shelf and decided to give it a whirl. Guess what? It kept whirlling all the way to the trash heap. The characters are shallow. The plot is unrealistic. The cliches are abound. I can go on but I would digress.If you are looking for a truly good SUB novel try Attack Of The Seawolf by Michael DiMercurio. In my opinion the best SUB-Novelist in the biz."},{"rating":"1","title":"Uggh, A complete waste of time and trees.","review":"To compare this book to an 8th grade writing class paper would be an insult to 8th graders everywhere. The plot had all the twists of a steel rod and the characters have the depth of a silicon wafer. The author would have us believe that a complete moron/coward could rise to the level of Executive Officer on a US Nuclear Submarine, that the Commander of the Chinese Navy could be an irrational rabid psychopath, and that the president of the United States is a doddering fool with no sense of national security. I like good military fiction, this book barely rises to comic book stature. Don't make the same mistake I did, the comparison of the reviewers I read to Clancy are grossly overstated. If I were Clancy, I'd sue for slander for even being mentioned in the same room with this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"VERY Disappointing -- Patrick Robinson is losing his touch","review":"Let me be clear: I am a fan of Patrick Robinson. Nimitz Class and HMS Unseen were wonderful novels.Unfortunately, USS Seawolf does NOT even come close to his previous quality of novels. First, characters are overly simplistic and, to a large extent, needlessly racist. The author's constant derogatory remarks regarding the Chinese was EXTREMELY offensive and did not serve the story. Second, the ending was awful. The story did nothing to allude to the sudden abrupt change in character. Third, the book was highly predictable (with the noted exception of the ending, which did not follow any sense of logic).Overall, this was a disappointment. If you have not read his previous books, spend your money on those instead, and forget all about USS Seawolf."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good idea but poorly done","review":"I picked up this book used in Krakow even though using my Nook a lot.Just wanted to add to the other one star and two star reviews. The plot is a good idea but breaks down in the end. I enjoyed the sea story part. The book totally breaks down in the ground combat... unrealistic, many technical mistakes and hokey lines (like a bad John Wayne movie).... I almost tossed the book before the end but is an easy read and now getting painful.If you are looking for a good action read skip this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ok, bad ending","review":"In my view this is his worst book yet. I've read Nimitz Class, Kilo Class, and H.M.S Unseen, and this is nothing compared to those. It starts off ok, but gets slow in the middle. It does not have a lot of action in it, and the NSA Arnold Morgan is well out of character. At one point he said he would have left an entire submarine crew all for trade relations, when at another point he said he didn't care about trade. The was other instances of poor character development, and the ending is poor. I do not think it fits the book, and he rushed it, not properly explaining what was going on. I would recomend it only because I like to read techno-thrillers, and especially read all the books of certain authors, but I wouldn't recomend it to be at the top of you list."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a bad read, but I've read better","review":"The other reviews here are very accurate when they mention the weak ending. Overall, the book is an enjoyable read, save for the one-dimensional characters and horrible ending. The fact that the XO of USS Seawolf is a complete moron doesn't make any sense. Early on in the book, after a slight mishap on the boat, the XO pretty much panics and begs the Captain to surface. A true XO would have kept his cool and dealt with the situation. The Navy would not allow such a spineless ninny to be the XO of a nuclear submarine. So many things in this book were audacious, I felt I had to write a review to vent my frustration. Oh, Patrick, you started so well. What happened, buddy?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Dissatisfying","review":"An excellent basis for a story but poorly handled.

She points out all the negatives about what happens in a divorce, but doesn't mention anything about how those same children would have fared if parents stayed together (how would you mature if all you see was constant fighting by your parents?). Studies has shown conclusively that parents that stayed together 'for the children' despite their unhappiness cause more harm to their children than a happily divorced family.

This book is based on assumptions regarding the suitability of classical mariage, but those assumptions are never admitted. What happens as you read this is you are lured into accepting the author's point of view regarding marriage being the prefered way to live and in which to grow up.

It is great for a compact kitchen, but if you are looking for something to last for a few years, invest in a different one."},{"rating":"1","title":"WHERE IS THE ADD-ON FOOD!?","review":"I bought this product for my nephew. He plays with it all the time. HOWEVER - it is extremely difficult to find the add-on products that allow it \\"OVER 700 phrases\\". Not only that, but the few add ons that are accessible only come with 2 or three actual \\"FOOD\\" items that would work with this product. I have searched the web and have been unable to find any other products other then the breakfast set (which most of the items come with the kitchen), pizza, and pasta. It is his birthday and the cake and candles add on would be great, but i have yet to find a store that sells it - online or off. I am very disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Happy Birthday Pudge!!!","review":"Just purchased this kitchen yesterday for my daughter's 6th birthday. She absolutely loves it!! I had no problems putting the kitchen together, in fact, as a previous buyer of too many Little Tikes to recall, it had to rank as one of the easiest in terms of assembly. Price was a little more than I wanted to spend but I am happy with the overall quality of the kitchen. My only issue was with the interactive laundry component. It did not work. I called Little Tikes and after about a 10-minute wait to talk to an operator everything was resolved.This may very well be the last Little Tikes product I buy for my children (due to age, not complaints) and I would recommend it highly."},{"rating":"2","title":"Super fun!","review":"My son loves this kitchen! He hasn't yet left the stove and I have had more 'coffee and french fries' than a mommy can take! He is two and a half, so he gets frustrated easily with the iron not working the way he thinks it should. His little fingers cant quite get all the way around both sensors. Overall this toy is really great in that there are enough buttons and noises to keep him entertained without taking away from his own imaginative noises and play. A chef like daddy? I think so!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Almost Perfect","review":"This kitchen was given to my daughter on her 3rd birthday. She has used it non-stop, and enjoys \\"helping\\" me when I'm doing my kitchen chores.One HUGE BUYER BEWARE--not one of the pre-drilled holes were drilled! and many were not even marked to show me where to drill out! Needless to say, this was not a show stopper, but I was really happy that I had decided to assemble it the evening before her birthday. It took two adults just over 2 hours to assemble and place stickers.As to the included food items, etc. I would plan on purchasing (or asking for as family gifts) the Intelli-Tykes add on food items right away."},{"rating":"2","title":"Really Good Choice","review":"I struggled with which kitchen set to get as well. This kitchen is super sturdy and the phrases that the burner says are a cute feature. I'm glad it doesn't \\"talk\\" in more ways, because that would impede imagination in my opinion (and drive me nuts!). So, if you're looking for a really good kitchen that looks like it will last forever, this is it.I will say that she is almost completely uninterested in the ironing part (she's 2). I could have easily got the model that costs less and doesn't have it I believe. Anyway, you won't go wrong with this kitchen!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Real Scarlett O'Hara","review":"Sarah Morgan is the real Scarlett O'Hara. As the world as she had known it crumbled to ashes around her, she had hardships she had never even dreamed of in her upper class society before the War. She knew nothing of the harshness of slavery or of the stuggles of others outside her own crumbling world. It is a beautiful narrative, an historical treasure and she is a gifted writer beyond her years. The description of the death of her father brings me to tears every time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Intimate, vivid and unforgettable!","review":"What an amazing book! To read this book is to take a trip back intime. Not a politically correct book, but the diaries of a complexyoung woman who was haughty and kind, flirtatious and proper,deferential to men and determined to be an independent spinster. SarahMorgan was a rebel in terms of both her Southern heritage and herpre-feminism beliefs. Her words depict a white world-view that doesn'trecognize its own racism, as well as her personal defiance ofsociety's expectations of her as a woman. She was a talented writerwith opinions that varied from modern, by today's standards, tocripplingly in sync with the standards of 1860s Louisiana. As a CivilWar book, as a woman's memoir, and as a journey into one of the UnitedStates' most fascinating and tragic times, this book is trulyoutstanding."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sarah Morgan","review":"I have just began reading this.

I found out the song's title and artists through amazon. I later downloaded and eventually burned this song onto a disc. I honestly like the song more with every listen. It has such a calming and unique sound. Both Finley Quaye and William Orbitt have very sexy and musty voices which allows them to perform the lyrics very well and convinsingly. If you are a fan of the more mellow and indie type music, I'm sure you will enjoy the song!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Does the job when in a bind","review":"I'm a triage nurse at a children's hospital. I've been using this book for about a month. It does contain some pediatric spanish, just not enough to get a thorough history. Like \\"How much Tylenol did you give?\\", and \\"when was your child's last bowel movement?\\". I looked everywhere for these questions, which are very common things to ask, and could not find them any where. This book contains most history questions and does a quick history when in a bind. I've not found a better book, but I haven't looked everywhere either."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Commissario Brunetti Series on DVD - Just as wonderful as the books","review":"This series is -- at least for the American viewer who is sick and tired of the same old same old -- a revelation. The filmmakers took great writing by Donna Leon and faithfully executed her vision of a muy simpatico Venice cop doing his job in Italy's most scenic setting. In each of these 90-minute stories, Brunetti is allowed to be a caring father and husband, a non-violent thinking policeman who solves crimes by gathering and evaluating information, a citizen's citizen. No car chases (in a city without them), no shoot-em-ups, just patience and brain power. Finally, a mystery series that appeals to the heart -- and shows that truly good police work need not pit a citizenry against an adversarial police force. Each of the double DVD sets in these (up to now) six volumes is worth buying and viewing again and again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another satisfying Brunetti","review":"Great entertainment, quality production.

The \\"Academy Awards Handbook\\" both through its year-by-year arrangement and its extensive index allows me to quickly find the specific information I'm looking for. The other book \\"The Envelope, Please,\\" has lots of delightful information but the table of contents listing is rather cutesy (What exactly would you expect to find under \\"Missed Opportunities\\" or \\"First and Foremost\\"?) and there's NO index; it has to be read as a novel and has essentially no usefulness as a reference work!"},{"rating":"1","title":"If you're online, no point in getting it","review":"Data is data.

Other books on Oscar (for the same price I strongly recommend the excellent \\"..AND THE ENVELOPE PLEASE\\" by A.W.

The material is surprisingly pedestrian! The bottom line is that if you are not investing for real-time operations, you should be because of the changing technology landscape. If you did not know that already, or you do not know that speedy response to customers is important, then perhaps the book will be of some value to you.

No artificial colors, flavors, or preservatives.Our bichon had been having major problems with itching and skin allergies. Our vet suggested we put her on a bland diet and gradually introduce foods to determine the cause or causes or her discomfort. One day an employee at a local pet store suggested we try Wellness with whitefish and sweet potato. I wasn't sure about feeding fish to our dogs but gave it a try.The switch to this Wellness formula was a great success. Evie loves the flavor of this recipe and eats it eagerly.

But no one mentioned the fact that the cup measurement on the carafe does not agree with those on the reservoir. I use a pitcher to fill due to the small space allowed for water. If one fills to the 10 cup line, the carafe is filled to the rim. I burned my hand badly enough to raise blisters. I wish I could give it a negative star rating.UPATE: I also contacted West Bend.

A few covers from \\"The Mind is a Terrible Thing to Taste\\" ('Thieves,' 'Burning Inside,' 'Breathe') are acceptable, but still long shadows of their original selves. But for the few GOOD moments on this album, there are a lot of grating desecrations of songs, namely 'TV II' and 'The Game Show' (done in the vein of 'hey yo' Limp D1cksh1t).

If you want to really get information though I would recommend the encyclopedia of religion by Mircea Eliade.Consider this book more for an introduction than something to be used for in-depth research. I still like it and recommend it because it gets into allot of different subjects of the paranormal. It's also better than allot of garbage that is found in books stores on the subject.

Here is what the World Health Organization has to say about the length of time for breastfeeding, it is a quote directly from their website. \\"exclusive breastfeeding for the first six months of life is the recommended way of feeding infants, followed by continued breastfeeding with appropriate complementary foods for up to two years or beyond.\\" In the book she is advocating the baby be weaned BY one year of age.

The adventure is written well, with interspersed drama throughout the voyage. I've read a number of true life adventures and some are written for the audience-at-large, while others are focused more for the informed expert. Throughout this account Knox-Johnston uses technical jargon, always describing experiences as a seasoned seaman would discuss it with other seamen. He uses hundreds of terms and procedures that even the pleasure sailor would not have experienced and would probably not comprehend. For that reason, the account grew a bit tedious at times. For a good comparison/contrast you might want to pick up the book Adrift, in which a man drifts in a liferaft for over 70 days when he loses his boat on the high seas. Still, a story of a great achievement."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for non-sailors","review":"I'm halfway through this book.

As I've gotten older, I've increased my use of the Nickolaus Technique and feel as though it's my best defense against Father Time. Since we are as young as our spine's our flexible, this method is ideal for us 50+ types. It maintains range of motion, overall flexibility and increases core body strength.

I understand this idea is not accepted well, if at all, in the scientific community but it would have been nice to have some of the world's leading scientists in the fields that Carmen was talking about actually interviewed to get a feel of what they are thinking.In the end this seems like a piece to get her name out there, allow her to add some more book sales, and push a small, albeit interesting, idea in the name of science.

Grrrrr! So frustrating! In addition, an older Egyptian who apparently grew up around the pyramids provides a lot of the commentary, but between his heavy accent and the loud music I couldn't understand half of whatever knowledge and wisdom he had to share.

He is left to take care of his six year old daughter and to make sense out of what could have happened to Beth. A serial killer is on the loose and we wait with baited breath to see if each murder will explain what happened to his wife. Grippando's prose style is crisp allowing the reader pick up the book and read as little or as much as time permits but always wanting to get back into the story.
