I should have known better; I've bought other books from Jo Packham and found the same things."},{"rating":"1","title":"Reading with Tequila","review":"The Year of the Intern reads like a non-fiction memoir-like account of a medical intern. It focuses on the dull, day to day life of an intern that we've all seen countless times on medical television shows like ER. Robin Cook fans are used to his fast-paced thrillers and this early book is nothing like his more recent novels.The Year of the Intern looks at the stressful and exhausting job a surgical intern has. The book focuses on Dr. Peters' fear and his grief at the loss of patients. It's disconcerting reading about a doctor unsure of himself as we usually like to believe that doctors are strong and have all the answers.The bottom line is the book just wasn't that interesting. It kind of got under my skin, making me fear being left in the hands of an intern at the hospital, but the actual story in the book left me wanting more. If you're looking for suspenseful, medical thrillers, skip this one and stick with Robin Cooks later books."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bad Medicine","review":"This is and old book and I really hope things have changed. They have not in Third World countries where some of the terrible things described in this book still happen every day. If you study Medicine or are a physician, you will find this book quite useful with its rough stories to make you reflect on the so many things that can go wrong in a hospital and how important is to realize you work with and for human beings. The book is great but to know this things can happen is just sad."},{"rating":"1","title":"YEAR OF THE INTERN","review":"This was obviously one of his first books and did not have the finesse and intrigue of his later books."},{"rating":"2","title":"a good start","review":"a good start for a Robin Cook journey.

Even better if you are a nurse, doctor or other health professional","review":"This book was written in the early 70's. What I loved most about this book is the truth to it. I am a registered nurse and work with a lot of interns. It is amazing that although this book was written a long time ago, nothing has changed. This book is not only entertaining, but it also will give you a very good idea of what it is REALLY like to be an intern. It did amaze me after reading this that after all this time, again, nothing has changed. I could almost say that this book does not belong in the fiction category. Robin Cook fans will enjoy this one and medical professionals will appreciate this one as well! Happy Reading!! :)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Difficult to read at times.","review":"The Year of the Intern is not a good book. If your wanting a good medical thriller to read, this is not the Robin Cook book for you. Though fiction, it reads as non-fiction as Cook takes us into the life of a medical student's internship in Hawaii. I struggled, at times, to understand the medical jargon which took away from any enjoyment I might have been getting from reading the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"IT'S GOOD FOR STUDENTS","review":"This book is excellent for students who are looking to become doctors.

I must have read 5 times. Engaging writing style, sharp wit, and a great story line. Sounds very truthfull, and at times, scary.

My only problem with this book is that it was written in the eighties, and so could be outdated."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor design","review":"Armband is of very poor design. Band material almost inflexible, and of rather small circumference overall. Worst of all if the connection point with the iPod. You have to use the \\"supplied\\" \\"skin\\" which is almost impossible to put on, including the supplied USB cap. The cap has such a tight fit on the iPod that I'm concerned about damaging it. \\"Skins\\" from other manufacturers don't fit, and the iPod doesn't fit in the band without one on.

I give it 5 out of 5 stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"HS Advantage 2002 lacks cohesive planning","review":"The individual products are generally good and learner friendly. However, each title appears to be programmed by a different \\"team\\" who thought their computer settings should be yours as well. This means: I had to change screen color characteristics (16 colors, 256 colors, etc.) using Win 98SE and even load an alternate driver for the video card before one program would run.This was an incredible hassle to set up before it could be used and then reset to do anything else or run another title from the same publisher. It would be nice if those who bundle this software actually sat down with an entire set of disks and tried to use each one--it could lead to consistency of performance. Imagine that!If you don't mind \\"adjusting\\" your computer, these programs are generally well thought out and progress the student appropriately. Myself, I'll look for a more considerate package that allows kids to pop a disk in and learn."},{"rating":"1","title":"High School advantage- disappointing","review":"We homeschool our children and have enjoyed past 'Advantage' titles, and so were disappointed with this one.

Thank would be greatly appreciated. Thanks."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not What I expected","review":"I purchased this album on the thought the songs were all original recordings. These were recorded later in her life and have a different tone and speed. The music that accompanied her singing is as another reviewed stated 'like elevator music'. I probably would not have purchased this recording. The songs simply do not have the feel that I remembered from my early days. It is almost modern in style. Still a great voice, though."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the original recordings","review":"I might have scored it higher than one star if the packaging stated that it wasn't original recordings. But then again, I wouldn't have bought it in the first place. Good mostly for napping in an elevator. I gave it away after one listen, and hope to find her originals soon."},{"rating":"1","title":"pastiche","review":"A great artist of the folk music era of the '60s and '70s has re-issued her greatest songs with lame orchestrations.

The end result is a real deep and bone crunching track list.Vocally, Alexx performs excellently providing the necessary front-man style needed for this genre of music. And let's face it, vocals sound more powerful and meaningful when sung in German.Eisbrecher have hit the mark with this CD, something Rammstein should have done but fell short of with their Rosenrot release."},{"rating":"2","title":"Haunting, beautiful, & peaceful","review":"Gabriel Faure is hardly among the best known classical composers in the world, but this album makes a strong argument as to why he should be.

Every room made me say \\"Whoa, I can't wait to run this!\\" It was because of the fun tactical details Mearls created for each encounter. I loved every one of them, until the last level when the vile details got a little more Peter Jackson than anything I'd want to present at my table. I recommend this module without reservation, and if the Dungeon Crawl Classics line has more titles this good (I know, they've been out for years) it is a very good product line indeed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not washable!","review":"That is it's bad point.

Great toy and easy to pack and take with you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unable to see mirror","review":"Baby is unable to see mirror when on tummy propped by own arms or using pillow.

That's ok because I can turn pages at the speed of light on my kindle. Ben was the very handsome alpha rich male who had a history with Caroline. I don't want to tell you too much about the story because very few stories make me go hummmmmm- didn't see that coming but this one did. Ben was wonderful and romantic, and I just loved that he kept coming back- Caroline mostly kept running but you know opposites attract. I will read this book again, loved it. I gave it four stars because that internal dialog was getting on my nerves but other than that the book was perfect."},{"rating":"2","title":"a good dictionary/thesaurus combination","review":"This combination dictionary and thesaurus from American Heritage is a good resource to keep by the desk.

The binding of this book broke quite fast and the insides are nearly out of the book. We buy many books and handle them fairly well. It is very possible this was just a bad copy?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Impressive quality - Not too easy to setup though","review":"The product quality of this item is unbeatable. It is sturdy and offers tremendous room. The actual useful room is significant because the walls go almost straight up so you can stand near the edge of the tent so the amount of internal space is great. The only problem was setup. You have to follow the directions carefully, even then, the setup is not too easy. I feel like there is lots of pressure on the poles as you lift the tent in a circular, add one leg at a time manner. The height is also challenging but that's what you are after so I don't complain about that. This is a 5 star tent even with the difficulty of the setup except for what I consider excessive pressure on the poles during setup."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's is really bad.","review":"It happen to me too.

The storyline is easy to follw..those who enjoy Westerns will like this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"83 minutes, 82 are boring","review":"Everything about this movie is small: barely an hour long (shorter than a Disney film), barely any story (one Mountie cleans up some little settlement), no fun factor (slow action even where there's any action), small cast etc... It does a good job of portraying the harsh realities of the period and the region (Yukon territory, the only thing that's not small in this movie), but unless you're a die hard western fan (or a Canadian history buff) I would pass without looking twice."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Eye's Have It","review":"What can I say. It was just a bad read! The story starts off with our so-call shrewd female FBI agent trying to obtain a DNA sample from the suspect. The way it's obtained was just poor judgement on her part. Of course getting hair samples or a letter, never occured to the FBI's brightest. The story was choppy. The sub-plots to the book made no sense to the overall theme. By the second chapter the suspect already knew who and why he was wanted by the FBI agent. So much for keeping a state secret. The romantic development between the two main characters was forced and superfical. I finished the book in one hour, because I skipped several pages of the book just hoping that it would get better. It didn't. I figured out the outcome before the the end of the first chapter."},{"rating":"2","title":"nice camera","review":"Nice camera for the price, although within one week of buying it Circuit City had it cheaper. Anyway, easy to use and fits nicely into a purse. A larger SD card is a must."},{"rating":"1","title":"fragile","review":"Bought this for my 14 yr old son. He dropped it on carpet last weekend with the telephoto lens out (taking video) and that was it. It may be inexpensive to buy, but it sure wasn't inexpensive to fix (warranty doesn't cover it). We were hoping for a little more than 4 months use. I am afraid of the lens problem Canon seems to have, but it took really nice pics and was easy for a kid (and non-digital parent) to use. Wish Canon wouldn't use cheapo plastic on otherwise great camera."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ugh!","review":"I just got this today as a replacement for a kodak I had for several years. This camera is not user friendly. Instead of words for a menu, Canon has decided to put little meaningless pictures on the camera and in the menu.

Out of the blue one day it said \\"low battery\\", and would shut off when I tried to take pictures. It was no help to change the batteries. I sent it in for warranty repair, but the factory found a dent in the lense ring (which to my knowledge has no relation to the batteries) and because I had \\"damaged\\" the camera, they were going to charge me $94.29 to repair the whole thing. After I told them lense repair was not wanted or necessary, they told me any damage anywhere voids the entire warranty. I have heard of similar battery issues from at least one other person.

Mr. Levy's disection of the four movements are very technical, very dry, and not meant for the layman. My 2 stars then are given as a layman. The biggest problem is just over half of the books 226 pages are simply a measure by measure breakdown of each movement. To me it seems like stating the obvious, espically if one can read music. The later chapters do however provide accounts of the first performance and the symphony's legacy. If I had known of the technical aspect of the book I would have passed. I guess the insight into the composer I seek might better be found in a biography."},{"rating":"2","title":"Outstanding Work!","review":"Picked up both of the author's books at a symposium afterhearing him speak.

But the book isn't well written and the main culprit is the dialogue. Every character speaks in ridiculously thick, phonetically spelled dialect. All the Southerners talk in the most stereotypical way imaginable. The author's presentation of the horrors of Libby Prison, while eschewing any discussion of the equally awful conditions faced by Southerners in the North, gives a feeling of unreliability to the novel's status as well-researched historical fiction. Overall, I wouldn't recommend this."},{"rating":"2","title":"A novel that requires time and thought","review":"Maureen Howard's \\"A Lover's Almanac\\" is not an easy, pre-packaged, \\"pop-culture\\" read. Although the base of this story is a simple love story: boy loves girl, boy gets drunk and proposes marriage, girl gets [angry] and dumps boyfriend, and finally they reunite. This, however, is not what is important about Howards narrative. Whats amazing here is the claims she makes about the characters ties to history -- the importance of history in allowing live as they should. If you're a reader who demands an author of high intellect and wit Maureen Howard is for you. Hopefully, she will one day gain the recognition she deserves"},{"rating":"1","title":"Fancy digressions but no core","review":"The book promises to be right up my alley. It's about lost love, it's set among New York artsy Yuppies, and its narrative is a formal experiment. A broken couple's story, beginning the morning of the new millenium, moves freely in time and point of view, broken by a true almanac of famous dates, to chart as well a parallel love of the man's grandfather regained after decades. Only we never get any clearer sense of what drove any of them together in the first place, apart, or back together. The prose is blandly elegaic, and the digressions, which could have been copied verbatim from an encyclopedia, never convinced me that the events are somehow paradigmatic of history or, conversely, that the historical anecdotes and Y2K shed any light on the couple. So ambitious but forced and numbing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"It is clear that a lot of work went into this book, however, inspite of the large number of pages in the book, it is not very useful.

Since I already know how the sizing for John Fluevog shoes works, I knew to order an entire size up for them to fit properly. I LOVE these shoes for the look, the profile of the heel is unique and the lacing adds a bit of whimsy. I get lots of compliments on them but that is not why I buy shoes, it's just a bonus. Why I did not give it 5 stars: I expected the color to be more brown, it is more deep caramel; the shoe could use a bit more padding in the ball of the foot area, it's very common not to have that in this type of shoe, but I can't help but ask for it hoping the shoe gurus will take a hint.

I am 50 and didn't always take perfect care of my teeth. Luckily they are healthy now but I still need a sensitive brush that will massage and brush my teeth and gums but be gentle. This brush is a soft brush which all people should use but I really do need to be aware of the pressure I am using when brushing with it. My gums don't bleed or anything but sometimes it just feels like the bristles were working a little too hard. I am definitely brushing correctly. I have found that the GUM soft Super Tip brush works better for me but this is my second choice. I believe that if you have taken proper care of your teeth and gums from the get go this brush should be perfect. But if you have sensitive gums it may be a little too harsh.

Why? It's flat out boring. There are no memorable songs; the playing is sloppier than the music demands; the vocals are uninteresting; and the theme of gayness is overworked (just as would be a collection of songs about being straight). The worst aspect is the lyric content: admirable though the sentiments might be, the lyrics are horribly inept, as if the composer were simply counting syllables rather than bothering to make the words actually scan and _be_ lyrics, rather than metered speech.It's a shame, really, that a band that one would _like_ to be worthy is not: buy it and show off the cover, but don't bother opening it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect Fit","review":"I purchased this for my Kodak C182 camera.

The finish and quality of this case is excellent and well constructed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Quite Pleased","review":"This case is unique because it has a Velcro closure rather than a zipper. This makes for easy access to your camera. Your camera is secured upon return to the case as you don't have to stop to zip it closed.

I am purchasing a second case."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great camera case","review":"I really like this camera case. My Nikon Coolpix 5100 didn't come with a case and the Lowepro Rezo 15 fits it nice & snug. I'm a bit of a clutz and this allows me to not worry about my camera. It has good padding for protection and the velcro flap is nice & strong so the camer stays in place. I've never used the strap that came with it. I 'm not really a fan of belt loops, but the one on this case is pretty convenient. It's sturdily built and has a strong velcro closure which allows me to take it on & off without having to take off my belt. I've never used the shoulder/neck strap that came with it, so I can't vouch for that."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for the Canon S100","review":"I bought the case based on the reviews believing it would be ideal for carrying my Canon S100. However, while it's reasonably well padded, it's too small for the camera. Getting the camera in and out takes two hands, one to hold the camera, the other to hold the case. And the cover flap's velcro pad just meets case pad when the accessory pocket is empty. I do not recommend this case for the S100 camera."},{"rating":"2","title":"case for Fuji f31fd camera","review":"Perfect. Just what I wanted. I use it all the time. Fits the f31fd perfectly.

Just the right size for small point and shoot cameras. I bought it because it fits my Canon 940IS and it has a small front pocket for an extra battery and/or memory card. The only problem so far (and it is fairly significant) is that the little front pocket has no velcro or snap to keep it closed. Therefore, every time I take the camera out and lay the case down, the spare battery tends to fall out of the front pocket. All this case needs is a bit of velcro to hold that pocket shut and it would be just about perfect."},{"rating":"2","title":"Impressive","review":"This is an extremely well-made, well-designed little camera case. I bought it for my S95 based on some of the reviews here. To be honest, it's a little bit tight: the camera is snug in its compartment, and it bulges a little with an extra battery, I might have liked it to be a *TINY* bit bigger.... But it's OK. The velcro strap still closes, securing both camera and battery in the case, and it attaches securely to my backpack chest strap, so now my camera can truly always be with me and easily accessible ....Granted, I just got it, but at the moment: Very impressed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Best Price Mirror: Honda Civic headlight - driver's side","review":"\\"Best Price Mirror\\" = HORRIBLE!

I realize that most experienced guitar players this is not an issue but for beginners or those that have been taught to read tablature only this will not do anything for you.Now, as for the selection of music, I have to say that it is an interesting collection and not quite what I thought it would be.

I do not recommend this book to beginners."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not such a great book","review":"This book makes no attempt to introduce anybody (even with a good technical and scientific background) to show the principles of loudspeaker design. The author makes a show of knowing the principles of design and evaluation, but the job of puting them in print is , at best, sloppy. Most of the formulae have bugs, thus making this a poor choice as a refernce book. As a summary, it is not a GOOD book on loudspeaker design. It is even, in absolute terms, and comparing with other disciplines, a very poor book on design. It has some interesting remarks, though.If you are looking on building a good understanding about the principles and methods guiding today's loudspeaker designs, forget about this book as a guide (not that I know of any better alternatives, though)."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must for professionals","review":"This book has been called \`the best book on loudspeakers ever written', and it is certainly very good.

My sister and her friends went and I remember them laughing about it afterward. I'd forgotten about it until I ran across the video on Amazon and decided to satisfy my childhood curiosity about this film. What a lame movie! I must credit the film's distributor with a great marketing ploy back in the 70s, because I understand 'Mark' made a lot of money! Hard to believe though - the dubbing (?) is awful, the music just doesn't fit (sounds like a 60s cocktail party soundtrack)and the torture scenes are laughable by today's standards (ANY standards really!). The film is more of a curiosity piece, and the fact that it's based on factual history is rather disturbing and sad. But by no means is it 'terrifying', except in being 'horrifyingly' bad!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor excuse of a film","review":"This is probably one of the most if not the most graphic films I have ever seen. I suppose it was written to shock people into understanding the horror of ignorance and the suffering of all during the middle ages, but it passes the point of being shocking in its portrayals of torture and death. One of the great aspects of the film genre is that we DON'T have to see everything. \\"Mark of the Devil\\" gives the viewer absolutely no release. The gore and carnage are SO graphic that they make the movie unwatchable. I stopped watching half way through, and I'm one of those people who NEVER stops a movie, no matter how bad.

I have to say, at 12 years old, the film was pretty cool...it was so fake, but at the same time I was covering my eyes and squinting at the screen in a total gross-out experience. It was great! This film was obviously produced specifically for kids. Kids often have a better grip on reality than adults in the first place anyway.Sorry, people didn't find my initial review helpful. Ok.

But, you know, \\"Nosferatu\\" which had been made about 50 years before looks by far more scary.Here acting is so-so, special effects... well, there are practically none. If you think you'll be terrified by a shocking sight of brutal tortures don't indulge in illusions. Everything that ought to be scary, violent, shocking, gross and disgusting is not that at all.

When I unwrapped it, I couldn't help notice but one thing only, this disturbing and very strong odor. After leaving it in my living room overnight, this strange odor had taken over the entire room. I wondered where are these items exactly kept, right next to household hazards??? I'm very surprise only one other review mentioned anything about this terrible odor. The one star is just for the correct thickness."},{"rating":"2","title":"Happy with this mat","review":"Overall, I'm very happy with this mat. At first, I wasn't sure I was going to like the mat because it had an unpleasant smell but the smell disappeared within a week or two.

I was disappointed.The book is hastily written, rife with typos, and looks as if it were printed at Kinko's. It's copied onto heavy paper and cardstock, has no photos, and is essentially 18 episode synopses, reviews by the author, and the same for a variety of websites - most of which have more involved, intricate and entertaining information than this.The author obviously likes the show, and has substantial knowledge of what makes it tick, but does very little to express that in this book. There is nothing to hold your interest for more than a page or two, and it looks little better than a fanzine. I expected a LOT more than this.Sorry, but I can't recommend it. Even Rygel would spit on this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic guide to the best sci-fi on television","review":"This guide to Farscape is really great. Not only does it include descriptions, URLs and site titles for close to a hundred Farscape related sites on the internet, but it also provides an episode guide for the first 18 shows.Most episode guides just give you a short description of the plot and maybe the writer's ideas about the episode, but this one's different. Talis Pelucir really goes into detail about where some of the ideas might come from, drawing from world mythology and an incredible in-depth knowledge of other sci-fi stories. He also critiques the show honestly. He doesn't just say he loves or hates a particular episode, but explains why some parts work and some don't. He never trashes the actors, either, which is nice.I really recommend this book for any Farscape fan."},{"rating":"2","title":"best scifi series","review":"farscape is without a doubt the best scifi program i have seen in over 5 yes i said 5 years.it makes star trek look small in comparsion, even though star-trek is a good program.the visuals the people use to make each epsoide are in my book state of the art, dont stop using them. the members of cast are on their way to stardom. congrats to them all. is there going to be a second season? the writers realy left all of us out in t-v land really hangin. this show in my book is the best scifi program on t-v. please keepo it on the air. thanks a deciated fan"},{"rating":"1","title":"It's a FAKE bag!","review":"Please don't buy the bag, it's fake.I ordered it last week, pricing 899.99, now it's 799.99The smell of the leather is strange and handle is made of some cheap rope.I returned it immediately and warned Amazon not to post it any more.To my disappointment, it even lower the price, trying to get rid of the stock.Amazon, so shamed of you!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Sick of waiting","review":"I've been waiting and waiting for this item.

I was impressed with Lauren Maddison's skill with storytelling,and her uncanny ability to convey the very fabric of British life; but even moreso with with her ability to take a classic murder mystery format and add a \\"New Age\\" twist convincingly. I think this writer has found a unique niche for herself within the mystery genre. And I appreciate her sweet portrayal of the affection and loyalty between Connor and her soul mate Laura.

For Inbal, elegance and vehemence go together. For Chailly, elegance and softness go together. The Chailly version is slow, but not too slow. Makes things beautiful.

There are no concrete guidelines to use--only vague generalities found in any real estate book.I think the best comparison of this book would be to a stock picking book with the premise of \\"buy low, sell high\\" but with no real information on how to value stocks, how long to hold, how to buy on margin, etc.Honestly, this is the first negative book review that I've written.

I bought the Dorf collection, which was entertaining and mostly funny. That brought back happy youthful memories of his escapades on TV, so I bought this DVD. Regardless of many of the other reveiws, I find this Tim Comway Timeless Comedy DVD hillarious. Although I wish it was longer, the skits are very humorous. Tim doesn't need props to be funny. His facial expressions and timing, much like Bob Newhart from his early days, bring out the laughter. Adding to the laughter are when his partners in the sketches can't contain theirs' at Tim's responses, and many times have to turn away to keep a straight face or somtimes just outright explode in vocal smiles. The humor is clean and for the whole family- no smut or fowl language. A definite good buy.

I heartily concur with the other reviewer; it is a magnificent and fun trip. If the reader knows Rutter's music at all, he will probably know that he has a rare melodic gift; the settings and songs on this CD will linger long in your mind after it has stopped playing. I tell you truly: if you enjoy choral music in any form, you should buy this collection immediately. It has in it the pure delight of childhood, viewed with the wisdom of age. And if you enjoy Rutter's style, try also the more brooding and powerful Requiem. A treasure."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great performance as always - but why bother?","review":"I don't want to get off on the wrong foot here - I was once a die-hard John Rutter fan. But, things have changed. His music, though beautiful and always extremely well performed, is just garbage. This is the most insipid collection to date (unless you consider the Requiem a collection). His music from his college years (The Falcon comes to mind) is wonderfully engaging: Original, thoughtful, moving - the whole kit-and-kaboodle. But it seems like his music from the late 60's on is just pandering to the populous who would really rather be listening to some guitar mass. Rutter is obviously too talented a composer and musician to be stuck in this syncopated D Major poppy schleck.

As such, it would deserve 5 stars.Unluckily, the C++ code snippets show a profound lack of basic C++ understanding. To give a few examples, replicating std::pair functionality as \\"useful template\\", checking pointers returned by operator against null for validity and eror checking, and \\"safe deleting\\" pointers (checking for zero before calling operator delete and setting the pointer to null thereafter) or talking of constructors that cannot fail when objects are allocated via the normal, throwing operator new are things that do not precisely enhance the reader's confidence in the overall quality of a book's third edition published in 2009 (neither does startup code which will not run under a non-privilegued user on any recent version of Windows)."},{"rating":"1","title":"One big gripe...","review":"Although the author, in his comment below, points out that correctly-running code is available at his web site, he neglects to note that this code will only work with Visual Studio .NET, the latest-greatest-and-most-expensive release from Microsoft. I would guess that most people who would be interested in this book would be more likely to own Visual Studio 6.0, but the source code won't compile under that product. The web site offers little more than a suggestion that the user without the megabucks to get the new Visual Studio should simply rewrite the source code to get it to run under 6.0...but I would suspect that, if you have the programming skills to do that, you probably don't need this book! To my mind, it borders on the unconscionable to release a book with code that only a few well-heeled readers will be able to afford to use, then shrug off that barrier by suggesting that the rest of us should simply \\"roll your own.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Ouch","review":"For a complete book it is heavily lacking in many areas... if you want something more complete check out the Introduction to 3D Game Programming with DirectX 9.0 book, its much better.

The watch is automatic self winding with a clear back and Miyota 21J movement. Not the most accurate time piece but few self winding watches are very accurate. It is a large watch and the polished case looks great on a large person, but I think it would not look so good on a small wrist.

It was not - poor results - may have been a bad sample who knows. It shipped through Amazon supplier Cameta, and they took it back - VERY easy process - zero hassle. I was concerned that on-line would be riskier than in-person. It was actually a Better transaction - go figure."},{"rating":"1","title":"A bad copy. Unusable at 2.8f","review":"Like some of the other reviews here, my copy was a bad one and I had to return it. Completely useless at 2.8f. Strangely enough, all the problems suddenly goes away and the lens tunrs tack sharp at f4. I bought this lens after I tried one of my friend's copy which had good sharpness at wide open through entire zoom range. I know this particular lens had same wide open sharpness problem during early production and was hence recalled in some counties like Korea and Japan. It makes me wonder whether we are receiving those recalled product or I was just unlucky with my copy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Nice Lens","review":"I just couldn't bring myself to pay $1,000 or $1,200 for a mid range zoom lens due to my limited photographic skills. I saw this inexpensive f/2.8 lens and thought I would give it a try. I was blown away by the quality of photos this lens produces. I think this lens and my Nikon D300 produce some of the best quality pictures that I have ever taken. This lens,my copy anyway,is sharp at every setting that I have tried."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wondering if actually an EX","review":"I read the mixed reviews here on Amazon and figured why not try it. Alot of EX lenses produce great pictures. I took a few hundred pics and as said in other reviews the results were dissappointing. Some pictures turned out sharp and in focus however the majority of them were soft and unuable. I downloaded a calibration sheet and tested all of my lenses. All of my nikon lenses focus point were dead on, however the sigma always focused 3mm short leaving the focus point soft and unsharp. Yes you could crank up the f-stop to eliminate the softness, like a f/ 5.6 but whats the point. I have a cheap nikon D that will shoot @ that range easily and very well. The whole point of buying a f/ 2.8 is so you can shoot @ 2.8 in low lighting and when wanting a shallow depth of field."},{"rating":"1","title":"Super soft focus. Blurry on edges even with smaller f-stops","review":"I returned this lens after one week. This lens had a very soft focus on my D80. The more pictures I took, the less I liked this lens. I tried this to take in door and outside pictures, both with poor results. The center sometimes would be almost sharp, but the edges showed distortion. I tried everything from shooting in a smaller aperture, manually focusing, and shooting on a tripod, I just couldn't get this lens to take a tack sharp picture. I think this lens may work for portaits because the bokeh is very soft, but I would worry that the image would not be sharp."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Products.","review":"I have been using these products for four months and they are indispensible to me.

This film is underrated but will be recognized in years to come for its creepy atmosphere and serious approach. The first time I saw it was on TV and I could not forget it. The scenes of a creepy girl dressed in white in a cemetery and a mysterious woman in an old scary house are just too terrifying. And the voices echoing Jessica's mind makes you wonder whether she is going mad or she is being haunted by ghosts or vampires. Either way the film is very intriguing and should be appreciated for its efforts. This is true serious horror--which is what horror should be about."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beyond bad","review":"Absolutely no reason to purchase this movie. Doesn't even qualify for quirky or cult.

When are you going to start?","review":"More haunted house fun as a group of people are haunted by the eerie presence of Ingmar Bergman. 'Hour of the Wolf' had been released something like three years before and I suspect the director was a fan. British viewers of a certain age may also be minded of those BBC 'Ghost Story For Christmas' adaptions of MR James's stories. Unfortunately, the director has neither the budget or sureness with actors to pull of his warped premise. Despite some risible moments and the unnecessary early flyposting of the plot at an antique dealers, any film that pokes fun at the vulnerability of the hippy philosophy can't be all bad.(Undead, and can't cross running water?

It is one of my all-time Halloween favorites. I remember watching this years ago on TV as a kid. I couldn't even watch it alone in the house when I became an adult. It may be a bit dated, but the creepy feel created by the voice of Jessica talking in her head, the first stop in the graveyard, and the weird sound track all combine to keep the viewer on the edge of his/her seat. I lent this movie to my stepson and after one viewing, his 18 year old friends wanted to borrow it again.

The acting was horrible and seemed like it lacked any sort of emotion and because of this; I never cared if Jessica was going crazy or if the vampires existed.

Where were the scares? A little trippy, it hints at being a countercultural horror film: Easy Rider on Vampire Island. Interior monologue from our heroine, Jessica, reflects her insecurities about what her friends will think of her, but offer no insights into her mental illness. This is the film's one and only device. And the filmmakers have no idea what to do with it. BORING."},{"rating":"1","title":"Seriously Stupid","review":"I love 70's horror movies like the exorcist and The Changeling. This movie is so stupid, I turned it off half way through. It's poorly acted and not in the charming way that so many older movies are either. I would suggest renting it before you buy. I just don't know what other reviewers saw in this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Who can explain the good reviews for this turkey?","review":"Watched this last night with a group of die-hard film buffs, and we all though it was awful. I know this is not a new or particularly original jab, but it really does deserve the title LET'S BORE JESSICA TO DEATH!Unlike some of the few who saw this for what it is, I don't think the actors can be blamed - NO ONE could have made the script work. They also get no help from the lousy directing and terrible score.There are a few moments of good atmosphere thanks mostly to the photography, but it is not enough.Not NEARLY enough.Do yourself a favor: clean out a neglected desk drawer, go through your fridges meat and cheese bin, balance your checkbook.Any of these is scarier, and ultimately more rewarding and productive than watching this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Atmospheric, Creepy, and very good storyline","review":"I saw this movie as a young kid and remembering that it scared the hell out of me. I have since then purchased a VHS copy. Just as good as I remembered it. Lots of heavy atmosphere and a feeling of isolation and distance from an ordinary normal world. The soundtrack for this movie makes up for the 70's feel of the movie because it maintains a subtle feel that something is not quite right throughout (A lot better than the Scream's and wannabe Scream films which seem to have been made solely to sell a soundtrack). Great ghost/vampire storyline and pretty good cast of characters who make the film believable. The film is necessarily slow in parts, but always stays true to the storyline. I really enjoyed this one and I can't wait for the DVD release in 2005!"},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the creepist movies EVER!","review":"My,my,my.I saw this on TV as a child and it SCARED ME TO SLEEP WITH MY PARENTS FOR A WEEK!Well,I had to see this again and was happy to see it available on video.Jessica is a timid young woman,puting her life back together after spending time in a sanitarium.She,her husband,and a friend move into a creepy house in a small town for relaxation.Well,are supernatural things happening or is it that Jessica is relapsing?Very spooky and intense."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just as good as I remember","review":"I saw this movie as a little girl and it was very frightening to me. Seeing it as an adult, was a lot of fun and brought back memories. the performance that Zorha Lampert gave was exceptional.

It's deliberately paced but never boring...complex and intense but never confusing. Basically the entire film is open to the interpretation of the viewer but the palpable sense of dread never relents - right up to the chilling and masterful closing scenes. Highly recommended for a rainy night!! 4.5 stars!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A treasured classic","review":"I have held this lesser known scarefest close to my heart for several years, ever since seeing it on tv when I was in 6th grade. It is a startling, literate, frightening chiller starring Zohra Lambert, best known for her 1980s Goya Bean Ads.I love the atmosphere in this film. The low budget leads to a suprisingly realistic feeling. The house itself in the countryside is eerie in itself, with its old fashioned wallpaper and antique furniture.In this film, the lines between reality and what may be only in Jessica's mind becomes blurred. The conspiracy elements, the love triangle, the strange whispered voiceovers, and most of all the sight of Emily in that wedding dress will send chills racing up your spine.A must have for horror collectors."},{"rating":"2","title":"LSJTD Stands the test of time!","review":"After having just watched this movie, I can say that it stands the test of time! Yes, it's from the 70's and you can't miss that. The clothing and hair styles make it impossible to miss, however, despite that, the music, the setting, the story...it's still eerie, it still creeps me out! It isn't one of those old movies I loved as a kid and watch now and wonder what I saw in it. Watching it again, just now, I'm reminded of why Emily scared me so much, why I couldn't look at a rocking chair in the dark...why I was afraid to swim in the lake at camp!If you loved this before, you will love it again. Give yourself a treat, get SCARED to DEATH!"},{"rating":"2","title":"low key haunted house/vampire/late hippie creepfest","review":"This film works well simply because it build an odd isolated rural world where who really knows what is going on. It's creepy because its all played in a SLOW oddball way one little clue or unexplained breeze away from waht. Is the heroine (beautifully played by Zohra Lampert) just still nuts or paranoid. Is it a story about potential infidelity, insecurity and fear in the at the end of the free-love, commune era? Then it could just be a an old farmhouse with a free-spirited and hungry vampire? What? I know. Somehow it works and is a pretty effect little nerve-racker."},{"rating":"2","title":"About time!","review":"I have been waiting for this DVD release for YEARS. It's about time that the distributing companies are starting to listen to movie buffs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointment","review":"I was expecting it to be scary, richly textured and ambient. However, the low budget quality of the film creates many boundaries. Something as simple as the lack of makeup on any of the actors is...distracting. This movie is not compelling and is not scary. The story is predictable. This is not a movie you \\"think\\" about after you watch it. I would recommend this only to those who love the genre."},{"rating":"1","title":"Girls Going Nowhere","review":"I had high hopes for this because the four protagonists are all lively and intelligent creatures. The plot proceeds to see them abused emotionally, sexually and intellectually. Abortion, typhus, murder, rape, thwarted ambition, its all here. Plus it is difficult to tell two of them apart and to keep their exploitive families straight. War is hell."},{"rating":"1","title":"How fast can we play Freight Train, boys?","review":"This album is tiresomely the same very fast tempo, track after track, so much so that the music gets lost. I'll be putting this one directly into a donation box -- it gives me no peace but rather irritates me, and that's not what I'm looking for in this kind of music.

While the information on the drawbacks and imperfections is mostly accurate (and mostly well known), the authors are unwilling to just present it clearly - they insist on beating you over the head with it.The authors are pure deciples of the strongest version of Modern Portfolio Theory. Untroubled by the reality of frequent, serious mispricings in the market, they insist that is is impossible to make money buying individual stocks.They also ignore what I feel is the major drawback of index investing: it effectively forces you to take large positions in very large cap companies in whose future you may have serious doubts. Think about what's happened to the prices of GE, IBM, Intel, Microsoft and the money-center banks.There are many better, far less strident books that provide the same information."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not totally inaccurate","review":"The Great Mutual Fund Trap is primarily a compilation of complaints about mutual funds and conveyed little new or useful information.

It made me wonder what was missing from the rest of the book.A couple of questions were completely ignored in the social security analysis:1. What return are we getting on our current investment of tax dollars (ours and our employers)2. What can we reasonably expect given the reality of the demographics?3. How does this compare with what we could expect with our SS dollars invested in index funds?4. How have privatized systems in other countries worked?All of these questions were ignored in favor of a diatribe about keeping the fees out of the hands of wall street.

I hadn't seen this film for many years. I guess I was a teenager when I first saw it back in the 1950's. The film is badly miscast: Louis Calhern as a high priest of Baal wearing a replica of the papal tiara, Edmund Purdom (where is he now?) as the prodigal son should have won a raspberry for his performance. And Lana Turner was much, MUCH too old to play a \\"virginal\\" high priestess of Astarte. After watching this film I came to realize how much more sophisticated films have become over the past fifty years. The film storyline was set seventy years before the time of Christ.

Edmund Purdom is the prodigal who is smitten by Turner's Samarra.The story plods along with some over-blown and sometimes trite dialogue, but the costumes and sets are eye-popping. This movie era could only produce such grandier and Miss Turner as the brilliant center, is sinfully beautiful. She reveals more of her self as any much younger actress would dare at the time.

Fans of well-written/acted/produced films take note: this is one such gem.The comedy works as well as the romance, and the characters poke fun at movie stereotypes as well as at themselves (the wacky smoker gal is hilarious) and the relationships are brightly played out in the 90 minute run-time. From start to finish I couldn't find anything wrong with this one!There are 3 central characters, each trying to find love, each with lessons to learn. The gay roomate's story is especially touching.In the film the characters watch \\"Breakfast at Tiffany's\\" and one states its her favorite film. That older film may be a classic, but I enjoyed this one much more.5/5 stars! Funny, romantic film.Blu-ray: 1080p video is great, colorful. DTS HD sound is fantastic.

It's a scavenger hunt gone wrong, with a predictable ending. The writers attempt to misdirect the audience halfway through the movie to lead up to a twist ending, but they try a little too hard, making the conclusion obvious.The film's production quality is poor, and the directing is below average. The cast does a decent job, as most were relatively experienced television actors. I have no idea why the word \\"unrated\\" was thrown on the cover, as the kill scenes will only make the average horror fan yawn. The only reason I gave the film two stars instead of one was because I enjoyed the movie's score.I thought it was painfully boring, and not paying for to watch online."},{"rating":"2","title":"A scholarly treatment and fun to read at the same time","review":"Peter Garber's short book pokes holes in the view that markets today can exhibit \\"irrational exuberance\\" simply because it is \\"well known\\" that they did so in the cases of the Dutch Tulipmania and Mississippi and South Sea Bubbles. He says a bubble can only happen where there is no fundamental economic rationale for the rise and subsequent fall in prices. He states that these early events may not have been bubbles. He provides coherent explanations for these events based on economic fundamentals, and he supports his argument by analyzing the available price data in historical, economic, and political context."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Good Read!","review":"During the collapse of the so-called Internet bubble, the legendary Dutch fiscal intoxication with tulips, called tulipmania, was widely cited as a lesson from history. The financial press hyped stories of deluded Dutch farmers who mortgaged all their worldly possessions to purchase a single prize tulip bulb, only to meet financial ruin when the bubble inevitably burst. Economist Peter M. Garber dug into history, and found that most of the common wisdom about the tulipmania was false. So, if you ever wondered how Dutch investors could have been so foolish, there is a simple answer: they weren't. Famous First Bubbles clearly evolved from a series of academic papers but, nonetheless, the book is entertaining. The primary focus on the tulip bubble makes the sections on the Mississippi and South Sea Bubbles seem like afterthoughts. We recommend this to iconoclasts who enjoy debunking historical legends and to bubble watchers everywhere."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good, but not very academic","review":"Episodes as the Tulip Mania, The South See Bubble, the Crash of 1929 are going to leave a permanent trace in financial science. So they deserve close investigation. The Author has achieved to make really a very interesting and vivid one. His ideas are very controversial, but exactly they make the book amusing. However, I haven't seen anywhere in the book a formula, integral, etc. Perhaps the purpose was to give more informal treatment of the bubbles phenomena, but it will be very interesting a formal one to be made in future by fitting concrete rational expectations models in the historical data.Vilimir Yordanov, Bulgaria"},{"rating":"1","title":"Good Topic, Poorly Written","review":"I picked up this book with high expectations as the topic is very timely, the author has a good reputaiton, and given the size of the volume thought it would efficientyl get to the point.While the arguements made are important they are lost in a difficult ot read academic writing style. Hence while I did get the point, I didn't enjoy the process. The three events discussed, \\"Tulipmania\\", the \\"Missiissippi\\" and \\"South Sea Companies\\" are well know within financial circles. Each carries a lore and mythology which is what perpetuates them today. Humanizing the narrative would have been a more effective way to make the points that each had logical explnations other than manias that distorted asset prices.Finally, particularly as the author is works in contemporary finance, the book really should have a chapter on the lessons applied to today."},{"rating":"1","title":"shattered bubble book","review":"I did not finish this book entirely but I do not like it much.

I used shoes once on it while doing plyometrics and now there are several large chunks missing out of it. Also, I workout on a linoleum floor and any moves that require you to be up on elbows or knees are painful as the mat is not dense enough to support you and you can feel the hard ground underneath (I weigh 200lbs). When doing yoga, any pose such as warrior where your feet are spread apart will stretch the mat. There is 6+ inches of stretch when in any warrior pose and it makes for a pretty unstable base.

While I wish it was wider, the simple fact is no exercise mat is going to be wide enough for every single workout. A great thing about this is the length. I can comfortably lay down on it for exercises without worrying about my arms or feet being off the edge. I no longer have to worry about sliding or slipping when doing floor work. It also allows me to set up 2 \\"stations\\" which I can shift between without ever stepping off the mat or having to move anything. It rolls up nice and easy for when I want to put it away or take it with me.The end without the straps does curl up due to the way it is rolled, but I did a combination of folding it the other way as well as putting weights on it and it is pretty much resolved, but doesn't bother me.

I don't really sweat that much so I can't say how it does with a lot of moisture, but for me it's been a great help.

I injured my knee in an accident along the way, and the extra padding with this mat has allowed me to continue doing Yoga. That has been a big plus. I noticed after a year there was a slight slippage in the mat when I was doing lunge positions. Also, I found that it was difficult to do balance positions, because of the extra thickness.

I keep it in my small laundry room and every time I open the door I'm hit with its chemical odor. So if you're going to buy this, know that you can't store it in any room where people live, or any closet where you keep clothes or anything you don't want to pick up a stench.Otherwise it's a fine mat. A bit stretchy, but fine."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works well, no complaints","review":"Perfect mat for what I use it for. Generally, it gets a little tricky with P90X workouts that require a wider stance, but other than that, provides the cushioning I need on a hardwood floor."},{"rating":"2","title":"exercise matt","review":"This is a good comfortable matt, however it doesn't stay rolled out flat by itself like some others do. That is why I only give it 4 stars out of 5."},{"rating":"1","title":"Strong Smell!","review":"This mat is great except for the strong chemical smell. It was so strong when I received it that I unrolled it and hung it outdoors for two weeks. Even after that, I could still smell it in the room where it was stored. I don't know what it's made of, but it off-gasses for a long, long time.For floor work it's comfortable and I like that it can be rolled for carrying. I don't store it rolled because the odor intensifies so much when it's rolled. I wouldn't buy another one just because of the overpowering smell, and I am not a person who is overly sensitive to odor."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good cushion, too stretchy","review":"Nice soft cushion, but the mat stretches when you use it for certain exercises. When doing push-ups, for example, your hands stretch the mat away from your feet out of the intended position. Many exercises and yoga moves are more difficult on the mat because of the stretching. The mat also slides around on hard floors too easily for my tastes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Smells Really Bad","review":"A nice mat except for the smell. Very strong chemical smell to the point I had to put it in a plastic garbage bag. I would not recommend it for that reason. Too many other good mats in this price range that do not have this problem. Sorry I bought it."},{"rating":"1","title":"dissapointed","review":"I regret purchasing this. I ordered it for use with my insanity work out, to help muffle noise from ky downstairs neighbors. I slipped Alittle due to my sweat on the mat. It doesn't stay put on my floor at all. It gets dirty way to fast. It stinks and its not wide enough at all for most of the workout from the insanity program. It does do well against the noise though, until you get to the faster warm ups."},{"rating":"1","title":"Slips too easily","review":"This mat is very cushy, and would probably work well on a carpeted floor. I have tile floors, however, and bought this mat to use with P90x. It slips all over the floor, and stretches with my body when I'm holding simple yoga poses like downward dog. It feels like it's going to rip very soon. Don't buy this if you have hard floors or if you're using it for yoga alone. I'm going to go buy a new mat tomorrow and throw this one away."},{"rating":"2","title":"Like it better than yoga mat","review":"I got this to do simple workout such as sit-ups. i like it better than the standard yoga mat since it is thicker and softer. i find it easier on my back than the thinner yoga mat."},{"rating":"1","title":"adequate but would be better if covered with fabric","review":"The one I had before had a cover making it more comfortable and washable.It's sticky and also dents easily.For the price it's basically a foam mat."},{"rating":"2","title":"First yoga mat and so far no complaints...","review":"Been using it regularly and the only thing i advise is to wipe off the sweat when done with your session to avoid funk or anything else thats nasty"},{"rating":"1","title":"22 DAYS","review":"22 days later and i still haven't gotten the harbinger mat. the mat is probly pretty good i wouldnt know since the company never shipped it to me. they emailed me the past week saying they will ship it blah blah blah got another one today saying next week told them to cancel it. don't buy from company they obviously aren't professionals."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Thrilling Character Study...","review":"Anne Rice does not so much describe vampiric life in this book as describe the daily life of a traditional Roman woman. Only the last quarter of the book has Pandora as a vampire; the rest of the tale is a delight to anyone who has loved I, Claudius or history in general. The characters are also wonderfully drawn and refreshingly unpredictable. In Rice's earlier novels, the reader could almost always know what would happen to the protagonist; here, all is a surprise. I heartily recommend this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"DRIBBLE!!","review":"Ever heard the term \\"stream of consciousness\\"? Basically, it means the author started writing whatever came to mind and just kept on writing - no rhyme or reason to any of it. Well, that's how I would describe Pandora. I was thoroughly disappointed. I can only hope that this book was a necessary intro to more to come. Maybe it's one of those books you have to read twice to understand - I don't know. I DO know that I didn't like it the first go round. Rice's last couple of books seemed like an attempt to fulfill a contract and sadly, this one is in the same category. I expected a LOT better."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book is terrible...","review":"Again I'm dissappointed with an Anne Rice novel. The first vampire chronicles were fabulous, I couldn't put them down and have never tired of reading them. Pandora, on the other hand, really was a waste of money. I kept reading to the end just in hopes of finding a really good part. The good part was actually finishing the book, never to pick it up again. The history was incredibly boring. This was one of Anne's worst yet."},{"rating":"1","title":"manages to make a fascinating time period boring","review":"I haven't read much Ann Rice and judging from this book I haven't missed anything. I slogged through half of it before giving up in ennui. Some of her insights and narrative devices were interesting, but it was all bogged down in leaden prose."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pandora","review":"I thought Pandora was very well written. Though it may not be as long as most loyal Rice readers are use to it is still worthy to be a part of The Vampire Chronicles. The history that was included in the story, was to give you a better feel of the day to day life of the times; or at least that is what I feel. I would suggest that all Rice fans make sure to read this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"pandora is beautiful","review":"Anne Rice deserves a full round of applause for the one. Pandora kept up with the suspense and tension that you expect from Rice."},{"rating":"1","title":"Well at least this covers better","review":"What can I say? Anne what happened??!! Awful, that's how to discribe it. Just horrible. Ussually I like Ms. Rice's books. I guess I should get a clue after finding the Rosie O'Donnell likes to indulge herself with Rice's books and bon bon's at the same time!! Rambling, and rambling. Sexual tensions fill the book. She even has sex with Marius after they became vampires. I thought Vampires couldn't have sex, at least that's what I was led to belive..by her. Anyway, save some money, and time. You can get all this in the other books. The only good part was the first chapter where David meets her. Two Vampires face off!! Was hoping for a little Vampire fight. Would have been pretty cool. But once she starts writing, everyone starts going to sleep. Pretty usless and bad. Should we place Ann on the shelf next to Jackie Collins and Dannelle Steel...under TRASH?!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful...","review":"I really loved this book. It kept me up all night! I loved Pandora. I hope Anne Rice writes a book about Marius!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Pandora is a dissapointment","review":"I was so looking forward to more vampire chronicles. This book rehashed bits and pieces of Anne's other vampire works, but there was little here to make you love, or hate Pandora. More than half of the book set up Pandora's 35 year pre-vampire life- who cares? she lived 2000 years as a vampire- and this is not even touched upon in this book. The Pandora Anne Rice brings to us is just not a very interesting character. I was very dissapointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Please STOP carbon copying your books!","review":"Having always been a fan of the Vampire Chronicles, I was very hesitant about reading about Pandora's story. After trying to read the trash that was the Violin, and being disapointed with the book on Armand, I was almost dreading what Anne was going to do to Pandora. I shouldn't have bothered. She didn't make it into a horror fest like the Violin, or leave me bored as with Armand, no she told a similar story as that of Armand and Marharat and her twin. Anne Rice has lost her character's individualness that was so unique. Please stop belting them out for your publisher, Anne. Return to basics, we know you can do it, perhaps then we can recover from The Violin, Pandora, Memnoch, and Armand. Ugh."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Triumph !!","review":"I bought this book expecting a 'nice' vampire story. Once I got to the second page I was hooked! The characters and the historical detail captivated me throughout the entire book. This has to be one of Rice's best efforts. How she packed so much detail into only 353 pages is incredible. I've read it 5 more times since buying it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Goodbye Ann","review":"I've loved Ann Rice's writing from the beginning and have read all her works (with the exception of Servant of the Bones and Violin which I couldn't bear to finish). The quality of her work has slowly degenerated since Taltos, and Pandora is one of her poorest efforts. The book reads like a sales pitch for her other novels and repeats much info found in previous books. The references to other works is confusing for those who haven't read them and not neccessary for those who have. I agree with others who note she seems to be repeating information to pad a weak story. There were one or two glimmers of the style and imagination that made Ann Rice novels thrilling, but alas, they quickly vanish leaving a weak, unsatisfying and seemingly unfinished novel. I think in the future, I'll save my money for authors who have something interesting (and new) to say."},{"rating":"2","title":"She does it again!","review":"Anne Rice's vibrant mind has taken control of the world of the vampires once again. In this novel she unleashes an incredible character by the name of Pandora to the chronicles in fuller detail. Anne Rice did what she does best and sharply intertwined great writing, with a great story with great history. Her ability to take fascinating history into the plot of her story is phenominal and it seems that no one can compare.It's a great story, told in a new fresh voice. Not to mention it is the first vampire novel to be told from a woman's point of view. Pick it up and enjoy it. It's a great read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pandora did not follow the idea previously given by Rice.","review":"Pandora was supposedly a vampire who was reincarnated as a mortal. She remembered the vampire life so clearly, Marius believed her and made her a vampire again. However, in the new installment, Pandora was supposedly given visions by Akasha. First of all, the idea that Anne Rice threaded into the other books was more interesting than what she gives in this book. She should have kept with the previous idea, if not solely for continuity, then for the sake of a better story. If anything, this description of a vampire's life should have been given to a lesser known immortal, like Mael or Eric, if at all possible. The vampire books have become disappointing since after Queen of the Damned, and Pandora was no better. I'm just waiting for The Vampire Armand in hopes that my truly favorite vampire is not given a weak story the way Pandora was."},{"rating":"1","title":"waste of time","review":"i can no longer waste my time reading anne rice...was this book even edited? instead of getting better, her prose (if you can call it that) just gets worse -- now she can barely write a complete sentance. i did enjoy interview and the previous vampire books, but this seems to be her failed effort to get back on the bestseller list with another vampire series...please spare me! i tried to read the last revival of lestat (memnoch?) but couldnt get past him sucking on a used kotex..yeech! the cover is nice, however...i give it one star (there is nothing less)"},{"rating":"2","title":"A wonderful surprise, total page turner","review":"I picked up this tiny hardback on a whim. Two and half hours later I had deposited this gem into my mother's hands. The next week my mother says no more Anne Rice until school's out. Apparently, her student's lessons were suffering form lack of attention. My dad's fiancee couldn't put it down either. Pandora shimmers as woman both completely modern and ancient. I loved the vivid colors and word plays here. I also loved how Pandora would bring marius down a few notches when he got all high and mighty. This is a book to read over an over again. Perhaps with a little Tori Amos playing as a soundtrack."},{"rating":"2","title":"HER BEST EVER","review":"I have read all the chronicles( the new tales to) from front to back twice and I would have to say, they all get 5-stars from me but \\"Pandora\\" tops them all! a reader FOREVER"},{"rating":"2","title":"ann rice fans satisfied by this book","review":"the realism she adds to this book, not only makes the story more believable, but interesting as well. not one of her best, but recommended nonetheless. also read the vampire lestat, that one is a must read.read the vampire lestat, that one is a must read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just not up to scratch","review":"As a keen reader of Rice's vampire novels, I waited in anticipitation for this one. However, the tale lacked the intense passion and action of the origional vamipre cronicles. Too much background completely obiliterated what could have been a great story. Which is not to say that what was written was not fascinating on one level, but it simply did not live up to the earlier novels achieved - to shed a whole new light on vampires and the passion contained within their lives. Perhaps only so much can be said?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Finally","review":"This book is like a breath of fresh air. After ready the last 3-4 books I thought Anne Rice lost her touch. Now with Pandora's release Anne Rice is back to being one of the best story tellers of our time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing....","review":"Because I enjoyed most of the other vampire books so much, I was really looking forward to reading this one. It doesn't go anywhere new. It was a rehash of the other stories. I finished it; but found it rather dull."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pandora is classic!","review":"Pandora is a beautiful creation at the hand of Anne Rice. In the other vampire chronicles, Pandora was a two-dimensional character. She was part of the story, but we didn't know how or why she was the was she was. Now, Anne Rice has given Pandora a third dimension and the results are esplendid. Also in this book, Anne Rice shows her incredible knowledge in Ancient History. Thru the eyes of Pandora we see the rise and fall of the Roman Empire. It was almost a history class. My only complaint is that the book is too short. I want more!"},{"rating":"2","title":"NOT LONG ENOUGH. LEFT YOU WANTING MORE.","review":"SHE WROTE FIVE BOOKS ABOUT LESTAT, SHE SURELY COULD HAVE WRITTEN A LITTLE MORE ABOUT THIS INTRIGUING CHARACTER."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rice has done it again!!","review":"I enjoyed this book as much as the rest of the series. I wished for so long that Anne Rice would continue her Vampire Series. If you enjoyed reading into the lives of the other vampires in the other books, then you won't be disappointed by this book. Pandora is an interesting character who takes you back to ancient Rome. I bought this book to read over the summer and I finished it in less than two weeks. I would recommend it to anyone who truly loves Anne Rice's Vampires."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow! What a story!","review":"I just finished the book, and I just want to say that this novel compares to all of her other novels. Wonderful imagery! Anne is a brilliant story teller. The way Marius and Pandora interactive was wonderful. I wish there would have been more of it. Perhaps, too much time was spent on Pandora's past. However, it worked very well to develop the character and to make us care about what happened to her. Maybe too much history, although I appreciate what she was trying to do. It did get drawn out too much. Anyway, a tremendous read, and for anyone that thinks Anne is slipping, check out the way she describes Pandora's taking of a victim in front of David on the bridge in the first chapter. Wow!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Slow beginning - excellent after first 10-15 pages!","review":"As usual, Anne Rice is spell binding with her sense of place and time in history. After a slow beginning, this novel proves to be a delicious beginning to a new Vampire saga!"},{"rating":"2","title":"ANNE RICE IS TEASING ALL OF US","review":"Pandora was a good book..no doubt about that. It just didn't live up to the other ones. So I cannot respectivly give it a ten...we all know she can do better.Still, she excels so many other authors. This book is like a small sampling of what she can give..it tempts us and leaves us wanting more.It didn't satisfy my craving for her seductive writing..a sure garuntee that I will be the first in line for ARMAND. It is sad, but true..the age old philosiphy of leaving the audience wanting more. What suckers we are to be lured in!! And still we love her! I think we like to be teased!"},{"rating":"2","title":"great book","review":"I really thought this book was one of the best books I have ever read. Ms. Rice did such a great job describing the historical events. I do wish that the book was a little longer. The reason why I enjoyed this book so such is because in the other books Ms. Rice never really wrote too such about Pandora and there was no mention of her history at all. I always though she was quite and liked keeping to her self. But when I read the book I realized that she was not quite at all, but instead she is lonely, and still is not recovered from the things that happened to over the years. This book is filled with romance, history, adventure, love and lose. I recommend it to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"A lesson in Roman History?","review":"Although Mrs. Rice's return to the vampire series is refreshing, after her last few attempts to keep a reader excited about her \\"latest book\\" (Violin depressed me and I left it unfinished as with Menmoch the Devil), I will be hard-pressed to buy any new releases. Pandora felt like a roman history lesson - boring (I skipped over pages), and I felt she should have focused more on Pandora's life as a vampire and her feelings for Marius. I detect somewhat an \\"I am woman hear me roar\\" type of personality in Pandora. Give me more LeStat and his army or even better - Ramses! Maybe Anne needs a \\"sabbatical\\" to freshen up her tales from the darkside."},{"rating":"1","title":"sketchy and dull","review":"Anne Rice's latest effort is a shadow of her previous vampire volumes. Not much story, dull lectures on minutiae, laughable dialogue. I miss the richly textured histories that her books used to be. Now it seems like she's just cranking them out under a deadline. I miss the old Anne Rice."},{"rating":"1","title":"barely kept my interest","review":"as a lover of lestat and the lurid tales of ALL vampyres, I was sourly disapointed. this book that some call fabulous has next to nothing of the lore and passion that the others had. it barely kept my interest and i wasn't sad when i was finished. maybe rice should give it a rest, her audiance is slippng."},{"rating":"2","title":"excellent ...","review":"the story of the Vampire keeps taking on new dimensions as Rice expands the circle and lets us know those we met through the earlier chronicles..

I just couldn't put her down."},{"rating":"2","title":"I really enjoyed Pandora.","review":"Pandora was a fine entry into the Vampire Cronicles (although it is called \\"New Tales of the Vampires\\"). I am a little behind and so I haven't yet read Armand, but I am already excited for next spring and the release of Rice's next book, \\"Vitorrio the Vampire.\\" Pandora was a Roman history, a love story, and a horror stroy all wrapped into one. Rice has a sensual style and I adore her vampire work, but I only wish she would have not had so much religion involved. That is what kept this from being one of her best books. It is still a quick read and worth the time and effort."},{"rating":"2","title":"An excellent book!","review":"This was the first Rice book that I read and I loved it. I could barely put it down. Some parts were a little confusing, but in general the book is well written and full of great details! I now plan to read her other books!"},{"rating":"2","title":"WONDERFUL ! ! ! I LOVED IT ! ! !","review":"It had been awhile since I had read Memnoch and I became totally immersed in the characters in Pandora. It was like visiting old friends. The historical aspect was amazing. This was classic Anne Rice. Can't wait for the next one. Flavius perhaps?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Please stop me before I read another book by Ann Rice!","review":"I keep buying and reading Ann Rice's latest efforts hoping they will be as good as her earlier works, but to no avail. Wading through this murky mess has, hopefully, cured me from wishing to read anything else written by her again. This book was so boring that it was difficult to keep focused from one page to the next. Pandora should have had a stake driven through her heart before the third chapter. Having read almost all of Ms. Rice's earlier works, which I thoroughly enjoyed, I desperately wanted to take pleasure in reading this book. Unfortunately, this was not the case. The idea of the main character surviving from anicent Rome to modern times is such a fascinating concept that should have held the reader's interest from the beginning to the end of the book. However, much more was promised than was delivered."},{"rating":"2","title":"Anne, U outdid Urself!","review":"I love this book. Anne Rice introduces us 2 a world of splendor and magic in Pandora.PandoraI believe readers will fall in love with the characters and this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful book","review":"I have to say that out of all the vampires, Pandora is one of my favorites. It is a refreshing book as it is written from a female's POV, rather than the usual male narrative. While essentially having nothing to do with the grand scheme of the Vampire Chronicles (like how 'the Vampire Armand' explained events that happened in 'Interview with the Vampire' and 'The Vampire Lestat'), since Pandora's story is so contained and separate from the others even though she is Marius' love, it is still a great read. I honestly enjoyed this book, and it's definitely a worthy addition to the Vampire Chronicles. 4.5/5 stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"A thrilling read","review":"Anne Rice is at her best writing about her beloved vampires again. After a disappointing few excursions into the world of ghosts and whatnot, she has returned to what she knows best-vampires. This story chronicles the life of one of the oldest living vampires, Pandora who is the sometime paramour of Marius. Once Pandora begins to weave her tale, the reader is hooked, and putting this book down would be a sin."},{"rating":"1","title":"oh, no, not again","review":"lots of talking, not much action, not much added to the body of vampiric lore. moderately slim book in an even more slimming format, makes you think she is either running out of materiel (a bit late for that realization) or that forthcoming is a bunch of similarly sized books designed to lovingly suck money out of your credit card. slowly. agonizingly. but you'll love it. and come back for more. but you yourself will not turn into a writer with similar abilities to separate people like yourselves from their money."},{"rating":"2","title":"WONDERFUL","review":"One of her best yet. Pandora is an incredible character. Anne Rice fans must read this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Anne Rice can write so much better than this","review":"I found some pleasure reading this book only because I am such a fan of her vampire (and witches) series and it provided a little more background on one of the major characters of the books, Marius. For someone unfamiliar with the series it would be boring and confusing. It seems to have been written in haste without the characteristic sensuality, magic and depth to which I have become accustomed in her books. I continue to be a great fan of her work, but I found Pandora to be less than satifying."},{"rating":"1","title":"Anne Rice's going down the hill...","review":"After writing THE WITCHING HOUR, Anne Rice lost track of her own writing. It would be better if she were aware of what she's doing: going down the precipice. PANDORA is the best example of that. Boring, boring, boring. Anne Rice didn't need to do such an horrible thing. Terrible book. Terrible.

It was just boring."},{"rating":"1","title":"As bad as it gets.","review":"Oh Dear, Oh Dear, what has happened to Anne Rice.

Please come back Anne."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I expected","review":"After reading all the hype about Anne Rice returning to the style of writing seen in The Vampire L'Estat novels, I must admit I was expecting more than what I got from this novel. Parts of Pandora's history (from childhood to adult) were interesting but after awhile I was ready to move on--unfortunately, Ms. Rice was not. Around the time Pandora was made into a Vampire, the story picked up a little but not much. The characters didn't have the depth I expected, nor was the story as compelling as I would have liked. The story did have its good points, but I must admit, I finished it only because I was listening to it on audiotape (unabridged version) and at times, even that was a struggle."},{"rating":"1","title":"Demoted to paper back","review":"I was an avid reader of Anne Rice and have most of her books in Hardback. For me all her books were page turners I couldn't put them down. Like Servant of the Bones, which I never finished I'm having trouble just trying to finish the next chapter of Pandora. It doesn't seem to grab me and hold me like her other vampire series. I'm not sure what it is, but there's no excitement in reading Pandora. I'm going to try and finish it. But Anne Rice has been regulated to paperback for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"not so good as the Vampire Chronicles","review":"Pandora is much better reading then Violin or Memnoch but still not so exciting as Lestat or the Queen of the damned...

The story of a strong-willed woman in Ancient Rome is as intriquing as anything Anne has ever written, and she has finally returned more to the style of her older works. The book would have been better if Anne had touched a little on what Pandora had been doing in the last fifteen or so hundred years, but at least the part she gave us is definitely worth reading. This book has restored my faith in Anne's ability. Pandora is an excellent character -- the kind of woman that any one of us knows today, creating a great parallel from the ancient Roman civilation and our own. The introduction of Flavius was wonderful, especially now that we can look forward to someday hearing his \\"vampire tales.\\" Only Anne Rice can write like this. Thank goodness she is doing it again!"},{"rating":"2","title":"She's back at top form again.","review":"Anne Rice's last few books are positively monstrous in their incoherence and long-windedness.

The way she ended this tale could definitely lead into another one centralized on Marius, David and as she calls him the \\"Brat prince Lestat\\".

She has become the Danielle Steel of the Goth set. Sadly this took away a few hours of my life and this book came on Audio tape so I can't recycle it. A shame."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pandora","review":"I would probably be a bit more forgiving if anyone besides Anne Rice had written this book. As it is, I feel that Anne could have done better. Hasn't she proved to us before what a wonderful writer she is with such books as The Vampire Lestat, Interview With the Vampire, Cry to Heaven, and Feast of all Saints? The writing style of Pandora was simple to the point of being childesh. The plot itself was dull, as were also the characters. Compared with the fiasco that is The Vampire Armand it is relatively harmless. At least she didn't ruin any of her characters in this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"PANDORA!","review":"I couldn't put it down! As with all Anne Rice novels, she evokes the imagination as well as the senses (making you a little bit wary of what's hiding in the dark!). A perfect inclusion to the chronicles -romance, history and horror. You'll be \`thirsty' for more."},{"rating":"1","title":"Indulgent","review":"I was disappointed by this one- it's pure self indulgence for the author and lacks the interest of the Lestat books- a comment I see echoed by some other reviewers. It jumps great tracts of history that would have made great backdrops to the story. On the positive side it has more pace than Memnoch."},{"rating":"1","title":"Extremely disappointing","review":"I have really enjoyed other books by this author. However, Pandora seemed to be one of her worst researched, full of 'filler' and missing the attention to detail seen so often evident in books such as 'Cry to Heaven' and other period pieces. This books seems rushed to market."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent","review":"I loved it and couldn't put it down. It was good to get back to the vampire chronicles again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Rices best work","review":"Anne RIces original vampire chronicles far surpass this book. If you have read the original vampire chronicles don't spoil the beauty and reality of the myth that Anne Rice weaves in the first three books by reading this book. Also steer clear of Memnoch the devil. If you are new to Anne Rice do yourself a favour and read Interview with the Vampire instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'm disappointed.","review":"Pandora is extremely introspective past the point of interest. I used to love the plots and action scenes in all of her other novels except Violin but in Pandora all the action is mental and tends to get boring. The dream sequences repeat over and over and seem like fill. The effect is like reading tapes of visits to a shrink. I guess that I think the plot is rated much lower than introspection. I did not enjoy this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Whatever happened?","review":"Anne Rice swept me away with her first two novels in the Vampire Chronicle series, but with the introduction of Queen of the Damned and Tale of the Body Theif, I knew something was beginning to slip. Memnoch the Devil was a complete falling away from what the Chronicles once was, but I had hope with the release of Pandora. Disappointingly, this book's primary focus was Pandora's mortal life and not her trials as a vampire. Although the history of her life as well as the greco-roman imagery and history is stunning and fascinating, this is not a vampiric book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Guilty Pleasure","review":"Call it a guilty pleasure--but I loved this book. Okay, to be fair, I loved the audiobook. It's read by a woman whose British accent, although perhaps incongruous with the action, made the book a pleasure to listen to! And the story was wonderfully meaty and riveting. Although written in Ricean prose (overwrought and flowery) Read's British narration as Pandora helped balance this out, and make it an incredibly fun listen."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Vampire Chronicles takes a detour...","review":"Mistakingly, I read The Vampire Armand before this title. However, I found it somewhat shocking and graphic, but you must expect that it comes with the genre. This was a fine example of fiction, and deserves its place next to the rest of Chronicles. I recommend this to Rice fans,"},{"rating":"2","title":"What a great book, what else is there to say?","review":"I havent read all of \\"Pandora\\" yet, but so far, im amazed! This book has got to be, so far, one of Rice's best! I loved it! Im speechless!"},{"rating":"1","title":"BIG disappointment","review":"I had a really hard time reading this book. It was dull and lifeless, not at all the Anne Rice of the past Vampire Chronicles. She spent the first couple chapters telling David a bunch of information he already knows!! I found that a trite way to relay information. This was definitely, in my opinion, a throw-it-against-the-wall book. Apparently, Anne is only writing these vampire books because her \\"public\\" wants it. Her heart is not in it."},{"rating":"1","title":"really really boring!!!!!!!","review":"now, i don't want to say this novel is bad but...well...i can't think of a word to finish that sentence! Ms. rice is obviously pumping a dry well, and if she doesn't get out of new orleans soon to try to go into the world and get some real inspiration for writing, then she might as well close up shop."},{"rating":"1","title":"I couldn't get past the first chapter.","review":"Sorry Ms. Rice, but i couldn't. It seemed too paranoid. I also had the same problem with Violin. It's like you lost it for the first chapter and therefore, i lost interest."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unbelievably boring ... don't waste your time","review":"Ms. Rice creates such a beautiful story of Marius in \\"Lestat, the Vampire\\".To pair him with the one dimensional character of Pandora is a insult.This book starts out well and then dumps into the stupid."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bring your No-Doz","review":"In all fairness, I didn't finish this book. I got about halfway through it. But I just couldn't take it anymore! I loved Anne's Vampire Chronicles and Sleeping Beauty trilogy, but this new series needs a lot of work. She has always been very wordy but here her words are pointless and, well, sleep-inducing.zzzzzz. Please save your time and stick to the Vampire Chronicles-- you'll thank me later."},{"rating":"1","title":"very slow compared to her other Vampire Sagas","review":"I was really disapointed! Too much about Roman History and not enough about the charachters. I didn't buy this book to get a history lesson."},{"rating":"1","title":"boring","review":"I used up about two months to finish this book. The longest period ever. The story mainly concentrate on the two characters Pandora and Marius, focus on their argument, their disagreement, this is boring, I fell asleep many times and have no incentives to catch up the story. The gory scene is not enough, it seems like a love story more than a vampire story. One thing that I appreciate most is the discription of the art of Rome."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Read for a First Timer!","review":"This is the first Ann Rice book I have read and I was captivated. Pandora just sucked me in and I could not put it down. I found it to be a fast read. I can not wait to read another one of her books..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Life is too short to spend precious time reading this book.","review":"Let me start with a positive: Interview with the Vampire is one of my favorite books. I am a librarian, and read LOTS of books -- so this is a serious compliment coming from me! Having \\"said\\" that: Pandora struck me as just so silly and well, dopey that I couldn't justify taking time to finish the book. I actually found myself cringing when I read it. For starters, I don't understand the point of giving the character, David the very long winded blow-by-blow of a conversation in which he took part. Yes, it was a literary device, but didn't \\"ring true\\" and seemed just plain bizarre. Kinda disappointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"This was an outline? Wasn't it?","review":"Anne Rice needs to take some time off. Pandora reads like an outline for a book. And I suppose if it were fleshed out some, it would be a fine book. But I felt cheated. Also, Anne needs to start giving her characters more dimension and originality. It's starting be that you can predict what the book is going to be about and how the characters act. And that's too bad. Why a book about Pandora? It might as well been another Lestat story. I wish I could say I'm looking forward to \\"The Vampire Armand\\", but I'm afraid that it's going to be more of the same. Pandora was Lestat in female form. Nothing more. Give me Louis again. At least his angst about his lost mortality sets him apart from the other vampires. What happened to you Anne? Why the outline? And how could the publisher let this out? Hmmm..... could be the MONEY?"},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointing","review":"I used to be a fan of Rice (Anne, that is), but no longer. After the famous Trilogy of vampires (the third of which was the weakest), we have been snared by lesser and lesser efforts. I won't attempt another. This one was pretty on the outside and filled with air."},{"rating":"1","title":"It wasn't one of her best efforts.","review":"I am a huge Anne Rice fan. I found her last few books weren't that great, I am so disappointed. I love Anne Rice really! Her earlier works left you dying for more. The 1st three books in The Vampire Chronicles were excellent. They were filled with lively loveable characters. Characters that seemed so lifelike, you could believe that they could exist. I miss the old characters. Wake up Lestat! We miss you!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Just enough to make me truly miss a beloved mentor!","review":"Anne's last four novels have made me feel as if she has forsaken her fans for the almighty dollar. Pandora, one of the characters that has long intriqued me, has left me $20.00 short. I have been in love with Louis, Lestat, David, Rowan, Mona, Lasher, and Rameses. I miss the luster and the passion that Anne wrote. I miss the way she would weave a story around me, and the frenzy I would reach at the mention of her name. Now I long for my money back, and when my family, never understanding the passion I had for her literature, now asks me about her latest. I cringe. I am embaressed. Anne, where did you go? Will you come back?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Too much rambling, again. Very slow paced.","review":"This book is mostly about ancient Rome. This book can be summarized in a couple of sentences, the rest is Rome, philoshophy, adjectives, blah, blah, blah. Very, VERY slow paced."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thank you Anne!","review":"Thank you Anne for all your hard work and research. As an avid Rice fan, I have enjoyed ALL of the hard work put into each of her novels. This is no exception. Her research is evident and the story shows her growth as a writer. I can't wait until the next book."},{"rating":"1","title":"boring","review":"I used up about two months to finish this book. The longest period ever. The story mainly concentrate on the two characters Pandora and Marius, focus on their argument, their disagreement, this is boring, I fell asleep many times and have no incentives to catch up the story. The gory scene is not enough, it seems like a love story more than a vampire story. One thing I appreciate most is only the discription of the art of Rome."},{"rating":"1","title":"total disappointment","review":"Pandora lacks the zeal which is usually found in the other Vampire Chronical novels. The excitement level in this book is extremely low and the plot goes absolutely nowhere. All I got from this book was a damned history lesson. What would have improved the book would be to include her relationship to the vampires Azim and Santigo. The was an extreamly dissapointing novel when it had so much potential. All we read about is Marius,Marius, Marius! So what. Bring back Lestat...please!"},{"rating":"1","title":"only for her","review":"Because I believe Anne Rice is a great writer, I am giving this book 2 stars. Otherwise, I wouldn't give it one. It was boring, boring, boring, and I was disappointed, disappointed, disappointed to the point where I have not read any of her works since."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overwritten, overwrought","review":"Obviously Anne Rice's publishers would publish her weekly grocery lists if she submitted them in book form. Her early vampire and Mayfair novels were SO good - I can't imagine this drivel comes from the same author."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good yarn, but where's the meat?","review":"I will continue to buy every book that this (too?) prolific writer produces. Why? Because you never know when you're going to get a true gem. I was looking forward to a meaty tale about a female vampire in Pandora, but what I found was a rather tame love story. True, Pandora is a strong, willful female and an interesting character in her own right. That and the close-up look at the young Marius was worth the read. But surely Anne had something more in mind when she named this female vampire Pandora. I'm confident that I am not alone in thinking we would get the \\"inside story\\" on the legend of Pandora's box. What happened to that tale? I'm now happily deep in The Vampire Armand and look forward to many more of Anne's books. Hopefully, they will be more substantial than Pandora."},{"rating":"1","title":"weak and watered down","review":"I love Ms. Rice's work, but Pandora, what happened Ms.Rice, had to make a deadline....way too much \\"filler\\". Book should have been titled Roman history. Ms.Rice could have done so much more with this book. Skipped around and over alot of the heart of the story. I hope this is not what the future hold for you and the next of your novels."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why is this woman still writing?","review":"Another clumsy attempt at a novel by a gifted but immensely lazy writer. Of course there are beautifully worded passages, and wonderful details about ancient Rome - but a story - what story? There is nothing new here. We have read this story, much better told in her earlier works. Everything is off, the pacing, what she details and what she skips, all carelessly thrown on the page. There is nothing more she has to say about her vampires and she should just have done with it already."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good historical value","review":"This is a valuable history of how we treated WWII prisoners in our country. It revealed in detail how we were able to use the manpower so badly needed. The need to execute a plan that was satisfactory to all was carried out so well. With seemingly few incidents, the huge operation helped our economy and gave the prisoners a way of seeing how humane treatment exposes the horrific aspect of Nazism.My only complaint is the title of this book as not all WWII prisoners were Nazis. In fact, they were mostly kept separate from the regular German army prisoners. There were many German prisoners used in the Midwest where, because of the great number of German emigrant farmers, language barriers were minimal. Also some farmers had relatives in the German army."},{"rating":"2","title":"NAZI POW's in the U.S.","review":"An interesting book on a neglected subject in American history. I recommend this book for any student of History."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not complete, but very informative","review":"The first thing my husband did when he got this book was to check on the WWII German POW camps in our native New York. He was disappointed that there was no mention of Pine Camp or Camp Drum or the Montazuma Swamp camp. I'd like to see a book that mentions all the US POW camps. Maybe the New York ones just weren't big enough.

This book provides a practical interface to the original; a blank-paged \\"tick-off\\" format with which we can chart our Dante-esque journey. This \\"travellers' book of the dead\\" is increasingly to be seen all around the world, clutched by grim processions of the travelling undead, who trudge miserably from place to place like legions of the damned, anxious to tick the next location off the list. Upon completion, this journal is presented as evidence to an impatient grim reaper, who then mercifully dispatches the traveller to their ultimate reward. The fact that this book helps with some \\"nuts-and-bolts\\" travel practicalities is all very well, but this does little to alleviate the grim finality of its ultimate destination."},{"rating":"1","title":"expensive journal","review":"A lot of money for a blank book in which to write.

It holds nicely, combs out well, and hair feels clean until the next usual shampoo. I used to buy this product locally, but now it's almost impossible to find. Amazon sellers are generally more reasonable than area stores were, even including shipping. Most important for me, it is perhaps the only hairspray in decades to which I have no allergy. If you are looking to turn baby-fine hair into total thickness, this is not going to do it. But it is a great product.

Lots of trivia, some more interesting that others but all worthwhile.Disk 2, the science of Mars stuff (\\"100 Years of Exploration\\"), was really good.

This book has too many religious undertonesof \\"repent or face the consequences\\" to be of any interestto the serious investigator of ancient history or those interested in the suppressed origins of civilization. The titlepromises to challenge the origins of ancient history and provide a controversial investigation in to the creation story, but does not deliver. I found it to be the same oldstory,in which an individuals's religious views are presented as serious interpretations of ancient text in an effort to suppress discoveries or alternative theories that challenge Christian beliefs and/or boundaries. I highly suggest to the serious investigator of the orgins of civilization and/or ancient history not to bother with this book, there are more serious books on the subject available."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not well documented","review":"The author can write and the book is certainly readable; however, it is filled with many opinions that are not supportable.

Ranging in intensity from Joni Mitchell-like fragility to Sheryl Crow-ish self-celebration, Giges's songs depict wistful memories (\\"Funny Face\\"), rueful defiance in the face of loss (\\"Something to Say,\\" \\"Untouchable One\\"), and a proud acceptance of whatever lies ahead (\\"I don't know what I'm doing ... but it sounds good to me,\\" she sings on \\"Sounds Good\\"). Narrating this chin-up worldview is Giges's solid voice, which alternates between throaty and harsh on some of the more sinister-sounding numbers (the vivid \\"Simple Act of Kindness\\") and nimble and gentle on the ballads, adding up to one of the more promising first albums of the last few years. Hopefully a sophmore effort isn't too far off ..."},{"rating":"2","title":"A budding star","review":"Despite some production issues, it is apparent that Naomi is a talented and inventive musician with a wealth of promise and talent.

The shows' rigid repetition actually adds to the fun, as each week is a variation on a theme. It's also pretty amazing how much they packed into a 30-minute show.Variety series dominated 1970s television, and \\"The Hudson Brothers Razzle Dazzle Show\\" is not such a sensational example of the genre...it's flat-out sensational!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A long-lost treasure","review":"Great stuff!

Most of the attempts (that I have come in contact with) have been too esoteric or vague to be of much practical value.

Although it lacks some more schemes concerning general pathologic pattern changes in the lymph nodes, the perfect photograph images with the short text explanations are very helpful guidelining to an exact pattern recognition and diagnosis.

The book is very easy to read and does not keep repeating itself. Basically TPM is a(n) (big) extension on Keizen Teian and it might be useful to read a book on that subject as well, but is not necessary to understand the book. The book reviews all the steps how to come to a TPM system, especially the part on the preconditions is interesting, because based on my own experience this help your organization already a lot. The appendix contains a master plan for implementing TPM. In my opinion it is a good start but a more detailed checklist would have been better, but you can't have it all."},{"rating":"2","title":"Harmonie Poster Review","review":"This poster is a good expression of harmony with its monochromatic color scheme and simplicity.

Great sound, poor volume.","review":"Using it on my Takamine f349, with Elixir Phosphor Bronze extra lights. This pickup amplifies the tone beautifully! Very flat response, no need to worry about mid or treble boosts. There is no equalization.The drawback is that it doesn't get very loud. Plugged into a P/A system, my buddy's undersaddle pickup drowns my sound out, the sound man has to crank the gain very high to get mine to a matching level, which isn't good. His Gain is at 10 oclock, Volume about 2/3, my Gain is at about 3 oclock, Volume maxxed. I don't want to keep causing a strain on the system.This is a great sounding pickup, it is just too quiet! An active soundhole pickup is the way to go. Someone told me the difference between my buddy's and my pickups is obvious. My guitar sounds good, straight acoustic with no power.

I was disappointed that the book doesn't provide interesting answers to the central question of the future of the movement. Are the problems attracting new members and retaining children due to historic cycles or to a fundamental flaw in the utopian vision?All in all, I'd recommend the book to those who already know a little about the movement and what to gain a deeper insight into the history and pitfalls of the Kibbutz.."},{"rating":"1","title":"took forever","review":"this item was the last to be received of 7 other books I'd ordered the same day.

This is just a very very poor copy of John's Wild Life concert. Which of course I already have. I feel very strongly that I (and I'm sure many others) have been ripped off. My only comment is \\"How was this allowed to take place\\" and \\"who, if anyone, can be held liable\\" If this isn't fraud, I'm not sure what you would call it.

Comparing it with the political hatred and vitriol present today gave me chills and made me want to warn Mr. Obama to be careful. I am assured the Secret Service is much more competent today. How I hope so!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good book and very emotional","review":"This book had you feeling every emotion while reading it. I rarely cry while reading books but this book had me in tears through the entire book, I was also cheering because of certain action done by members of the services, the kennedy team and of the family itself. I was very skeptical about reading this book sense it got alot of heat before being published but I think the end result was done very well. I would recommend this book to any one who is/was a fan of JFK, the Kennedy's in a whole or just anyone who wasn't born yet(like me) who might want to get a real glimpse of what are parents and the rest of the world went through at that time. Definitely adding this to my collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"Still the definitive work on the Kennedy assassination and it's aftermath...","review":"However, given the large number of positive reviews here, most of which I agree with, it's worth noting that this book was published around the time there was considerable dissatisfaction and questions being raised about the findings of the Warren Commission and that Manchester I feel, truly gives short shrift to Lyndon Johnson and the transition that took place. To suggest that this was an easy time for Johnson or that there was some desire on the part of the Vice-President to usurp power without regard to the feelings of the Kennedy family or Bobby Kennedy in particular is utter nonsense. Upon reading this material I suggest people also give Max Holland's 'The Kennedy Assassination Tapes' a read as well. Holland's compilation of the taped discussions between Johnson and others in the days and years after Nov. 22 tell a very different story than what Manchester would have us believe."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book","review":"We have really been fascinated by this history and this book certainly was interesting.

By the time anything interesting does happen - in about the last 100 pages - it is certainly not worth the wait. Even more frustrating is her habit of alluding to things the characters know well, but never explains to the reader. I lost count of the number of passages that left me wondering what had just happened after I'd read them, and felt like I was reading a later volume rather than the first of a new trilogy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Read the first two books....","review":"I don't know why I even read book two and started three. The \\"romance\\" I know was finally going to happen (I think) in book three but by then I did not care - I was bored. These books went a bit overboard on the child rape subplots --- I could bear it in book one but then it came back in book two and so on. Also all the side characters were just wretched people. And book two was just boring compared to book one and book one just left you hanging. Spend your $ elsewhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Graphic By Far","review":"I bought this book thinking was would be a nice feminist slanted high fantasy novel, but it's depiction of the graphic rape, murder and mutiliation of children went just way too far.NOT RECOMMENDED."},{"rating":"1","title":"Loan it from the library instead!","review":"I bought it as a blind buy seeing that it had a good reviewer rating here and I was highly disappointed.

Then when you are finished you are really angry that you didn't get the other two books to the story, so that you can finish the story. Well this is what I found.I had to run straight to get them, and I haven't beeen disappointed. I will not go into the story as it is very involved and heaps of other people will tell you the story.. But take my advise and get these books"},{"rating":"2","title":"My favorite book series!","review":"\\"Daughter of the Blood\\" shows a corrupt society, which has twisted the notion that women rule and men serve. Rather than service being a soft leash, it is pain, torture and humiliation. Dorothea, the High Priestess, has conducted a campaign to brutalize female children before they can come into their power and destroy and maim strong men. Foreseen by a black widow is a Queen who will rule the Blood and reverse the damage that has been done. Jaenelle is born to a powerful family, but one who believes she is crazed and tainted.I have to admit right away that this is my favorite book series and Anne Bishop is my favorite author. This is probably the dozenth time I've read this book, and it was just as good as the first. The characters and their interaction are fascinating and the magic system is interesting. I loved the interaction between the three realms and as always, look forward to (re)reading the next book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Strange","review":"This book came surprisingly recomended by a friend. I couldn't get into stopped 60 pages in it was too strange."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely captivating","review":"Though it has become cliche, it is the absolute truth-once I picked it up, I couldn't put it down. I actually threw a fit when it was over! I have been attempting to calmly await the sequel, but it's perfectly torturous! This is the most unbelievably enchanting book i have ever read. It instantly became my favorite!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Forced darkness obscures innovation","review":"I found the sadism forced and excessive. I got the impression the author had disgusting things happen to characters just to push the envelope of what's acceptable in fantasy. At one point I actually found myself laughing out loud because some horrible secret ended up being so unbelievably stupid. Naming the good guys Saetan and Daemon seemed an immature attempt to explore how we define good & evil. That said... there IS something compelling about the characters, and the magical framework is really innovative and interesting. I would have enjoyed this book much more if torture occurred to advance plot and not for its own sake. I will be skipping the sequels."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely magnificent...","review":"Daughter of the Blood captured my heart from its opening pages, and has not loosed its grip since. A gorgeous tapestry of darkness, power, love and hate, its sheer presence is overwhelming. Rather like an enormous, grandiose mental feast, Bishop takes the reader's senses to a heightened level of experience, opening one's eyes to the greater themes of courage and loyalty that lay behind the surface occurrences. The characters in the story are incredible, not only for their strength of will and determination, but also because of their undiminished capacity for the glory of love in a world that has forgotten its legacy. Although each individual speaks to one's soul in a different way, the love the reader develops for them all in the end is tantamount to claiming these characters as members of one's own family. \\"And the Blood shall sing to the Blood.\\" Listen when the Darkness sings to you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fantasy Soap Opera","review":"Most of the books I buy based on other readers recommendations usually turn out to be ok but every now & then I kick myself for wasting my money. This book is one of those few.I could not finish this book. Half way through, it just got too boring and was going nowhere very slowly. The plot definitely had potential (dark and sombre) but it just wasn't interesting enough to keep me reading. The characters did a lot of chin wagging & chit-chatting and very little else. But, based on the large number of glowing reviews for this book, I am obviously one of a small minority who did not like this book so if the storyline tickles your fancy, odds are you will enjoy reading this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dark Dreams","review":"I read fantasy to escape the harsh realities of our world, but Anne Bishop has created a fantasy that dwells in the most nightmarish of harsh realities. Central to the story are the repeated themes of the abuse, molestation, incest and torture of children. There was no escaping these vignettes, as they are central to the story and the characters. I would have given the book one star, but the story is compelling, amazingly. But the compelling story was not worth the dark dreams that still haunt me after reading it. I don't watch the evening news because I can't stand to hear about children being mistreated. Why in the world would I want to read a whole series of books that dwells in that dark and despicable place? Anne Bishop, I may give another of your series a try, but the Black Jewels series is not one I wish to experience again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not nearly as good as I'd hoped.","review":"I found \\"Daughter of the Blood\\" to be disapointing. The writing itself wasn't bad, but just about everything else was. The characters, despite being in a completely different world, borrow very heavily from the Mythologies of this world. Many of the characters seemed basic and contrived. The society of \\"The blood\\" is hedonistic to the point of revolting.It takes a lot more than having a people worship \\"darkness\\" to make a dark fantasy. And it takes a lot more than people having sex (often sadistic, incestuous, demented. I can't think of a single character that had an honest to goodness HEALTHY relationship in the entire book) to make a book erotic.I couldn't feel good about this book. Reading it became a chore and the ending left me disapointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hard to get at first, then harder to let go!","review":"When I first started reading this book I didn't understand what was going on. I read the first four or five chapters and then I put the book away; I didn't want to read anymore because I was totally lost... Then I was lucky enough to run out of reading material and forced myself to try and read the book again. Once I understood the basic story I couldn't let go of it.I read a lot of books, but I like to try reading different things, and this book was like nothing I had read before. I absolutely recommend this book!!!! For anyone who would like to try it here is a piece of advice: the first chapters are hard to follow, the plot will be VERY hard to understand until after you have gone through several chapters, but don't give up on it, in the end you will enjoy it and will probably run to a bookstore to get the second and third books, just like I did!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Festering pile of dung","review":"This isn't so much a novel as a vehicle for the author's prepubescent sex fantasies. Which would be fine, if it were well-written or engaging. Go buy something by Robin Hobb, Guy Kay, or even Terry Brooks. Christ, even Robert Jordan is more readable than this tripe. It takes a lot for me to toss a book into the trash, but I had no trouble flinging this one into the bin before I was halfway through."},{"rating":"1","title":"A terrible book","review":"This book reads like thinly disguised child pornography.

I tossed it after reading half way through it."},{"rating":"1","title":"First time for everything","review":"This is the first time in a long time that I couldn't finish a book.

Everyone has to read this"},{"rating":"2","title":"Anyone who loves fantasy has to read this book!","review":"I got this book when a friend of mind was reading it. She had lent it to her other friend and the second friend was begging for the second book. I read this book and the sequel without skipping a beat. Now most of my friends and i have formed a sort of cult as we wait for the third book to come out.Anne Bishop is and excellent writer and she has created a whole world completely backward from ours where the darkness is worshipped and Saetan is good. Her characters are not perfect, yet I never once questioned their intentions. Their reactions are believable and they are constantly surprising the reader. The book is filled with things that make you stop and think, but it is still enjoyable to read. Some of the ideas are contaversial, but if you can get past that you will enjoy this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"good","review":"This is a good book the only problem its a slightly perverted.

I couldn't wait to finish them, but didn't want the story to end. These books have just about ruined me for reading anything else. Nothing compares. I have never be swept away to another time or place before. The detail of this story we entrance you. Do yourself a big, big favor...buy all three at the same time or you will not forgive yourself. These book are enticing and addictive. You will not regret purchasing these books, nor will you want to let them go!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"An amazing read","review":"A little girl born to be the embodiment of a whole world's dreams. A kingdom, dark, twisted and as wicked as they come. And out of this a delicate character like Jaenelle is created. This novel is riveting, the characters decidedly wicked and yet surprising human, with a wicked sense of dark humour that had me laughing out loud at times. This book, as well as the following sequels are a must read for all who enjoy fantasy. I don't often reread books but with this one I did, often into the wee hours of the dawn, each time a new sequel was released."},{"rating":"2","title":"Magical","review":"If you can get through the first 50 pages -- you'll fall in love with this book. I know *I* did!I am not one who usually reads Fantasy novels -- I basically picked this book up because I judged the book by the cover. I'm SO glad that I did!The characters have strenghs and faults... but you can understand who they are. Saetan seems more like a grandfatherly type than the High Lord of Hell. Daemon Sadi (the Sadist) was a true heartbreaker. Jaenelle was a sweet girl who brought love into the hearts of those who long forgot what love was.I loved this book so much. I can not express the words to praise this book enough!I could NOT put the book down once I started! I have reread the book 7 times already. I cry each time I read it!I can not WAIT until the second book in this series, Heir to the Shadows comes out!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Complete lack of substance","review":"I can't see where all the high reviews are coming from. This book completely fails to find its voice or its audience. The dark potential of the plot ends up being merely a shadow on a simplistic pre-teen read, with just enough vulgarity thrown in to make it a very disturbing blend. While some characters are interesting and enjoyable, by and large they lack dimension and motivation. The social and power structures are not well explained in the text (although come to find out through reading other reviews that the kindle version must lack some essential charts that at least provide a framework), nor is the connection of the realms really defined. All of this together made the book frustrating because it could have been so much more..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic!","review":"This is the beginning of one those trilogies. You know - one of thoooose. You won't be able to set it down, because you're already so wrapped up in Bishop's tangled web. Masterful world building and a host of interesting characters makes this one of my favorites of the genre."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow!","review":"My title says it all. Its been awhile since I've read these books, but I remember when I read this one in particular, I was hooked from the first page and couldn't stop reading until it was done. When it was done, I was so disappointed, I immediately bought the entire series and then some. It prompted me to look online for Jaenelle and Daemon Sadi and was happy to see fan pages. I remember reading the series over and over again until I got tired of it. But now that I'm writing this review I'm thinking of picking up the series again. I even bought other books from Anne Bishop. This writer is a talented and amazing story teller."},{"rating":"2","title":"New Anne Bishop fan!","review":"Anne Bishop had a way with spinning this story that had my attention from beginning to end. At first, it was hard to follow and understand, but once you catch on to the world Bishop has built and know the importance of each character then it's a smooth sailing.I'm not usually a fan of the Fantasy Genre, but after reading Daughter of the Blood I might start looking in that realm. What initially got me to read this book was after reading Sunny's Children of the Moon series. I liked it, but there were some bad reviews stating how Sunny got her ideas from The Black Jewel Trilogy and LKH's Anita Blake series. Since I've already read Anita Blake I figure I'd read this first book and see for myself what the big deal was. Conclusion, yes I see the similarities, but I say so what. If anything, thanks to Sunny, Anne Bishop has a new fan. ^_^"},{"rating":"2","title":"Solid Fantasy with an Adult Twist","review":"I really enjoyedDaughter of the Blood (Black Jewels, Book 1). Anne Bishop takes characters that fit classic archetypes and twists them just slightly to fit the world she's created. I found myself buying into the world Bishop created and getting absorbed in the trials of her characters.I also appreciated the adult themes in the book, how sex and the politics of sex play a key role without becoming vulgar or detracting from the story. The power exchange themes throughout the book are refreshing to see in such a \\"positive\\" way in mainstream publishing, with male characters (with exceptions) serving their female rulers.It has been a long time since I found myself so consumed by a fantasy world. I'd buy this book if you enjoy magical fantasy, power politics on an epic scale, and the idea that there's nothing wrong with making a slave out of a powerful man--or serving a powerful woman."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for me...","review":"A friend recommended this book to me since I enjoyed the Twilight series. It took me a while to get into it, about 100 pages or so,and for a while I enjoyed it. The names were sort of annoying and the world she created was irritating, the whole \\"ring of obedience\\" grossed me out, too. I still kept going with it, though, since my friend kept raving about it and asking me where I was in the book. Before I finished it, she gave me the next two so I go right into them. I'm not going to. The last 50 or so pages were soooooo distasteful and out of left field. I just found it totally disgusting. I agree with the other reviewers who found it repulsive and wonder what the author was THINKING. If you want to be grossed out and worry about children being ripped apart by perverted me, just open the paper. Why read a whole book that ends so appallingly? Gag."},{"rating":"2","title":"A wonderful start to a promising trilogy !","review":"Hmmm.....what to say about this wonderful book...

And so I trusted him. I can't believe that I did.Now let me begin by saying that I AM NOT a religious person, but this book's Satanic referrances frightened me. Every character has a referance to some demonic representation. Fantasy is supposed to be about magic and wonder and good vs. evil, not evil's corruption of the innocent and rise to power. This book has only sex, anger, distrust, violence and greed - nothing good, interesting or enlightening within. If you want good, richly written fantasy, I'd recommend Charles de Lint's early books, Lloyd Alexander, Margaret Weis and Ursula K Le Guin.This book disgusts me."},{"rating":"2","title":"*sweet*","review":"LOVED, LOVED , LOVED.... this book!!! damn i couldn't put it down.

When I did finish it, I started it over--immediately. I recommended it to my sister who did precisely the same thing. (Each of us reads hundreds of books a year--it is not a normal reaction nor is a genetic quirk!)I found the plot to be refreshingly original which is unfortunately becoming quite unusual in the fantasy genre. The book is the first of a trilogy, and while I can't wait for books two and three, book one had a complete story and a definite ending, which is another plus when so many series ramble from book to book.If you can't tell, I enjoyed this book immensely and I highly recommend it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Dont buy","review":"This album is really awfull and its not worth hearing so I wouldnt waste my money on it because there are no good songs on it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great idea, poorly executed","review":"The showerhead works, however the long arm creates a problem with the angle of the showerhead.

I could have gotten past the lack of talent of the actors if maybe at least there was a good plot but I can't even give them that much credit. I'm sorry I can't tell you how it ended but I got so fed up with the heavy breathing of the killer that I just had to stop the movie. After a few days I could still not convince myself that it would be worth my time so took it to a local book store and sold it for $1.00.

(And terribly tame by today's standards.)The story is silly. There are plot holes hig enough to drive a truck through. (With big blinking signs pointing to them in some places.) Teenagers die in silly ways for having unauthorized sex. The dysfunctional heroine tries to figure out who is doing it in order to clear her name. (It always seems like she is in the wrong place at the wrong time.) And wait until you see who gets crowned prom queen.Not a perfect film, but worth getting.

At least Kevin James has king of queens to go back to.

A beard and messed up hair doens't change the fact that we're watching two very well known TV characters.There is so much foul language in this film I was kind of shocked. I'm no prude but it seems it was all done to try and change the nice guy image of Ray and Kevin. That's the only explanation I can imagine for the profanity overload.

There are some definate parallels to 2001: A Space Odyssey, but Sawyer manages to keep the pace quick and the storyline gripping.

It shows a main hero, brilliantly played by Daniel Olbrychski, sacrificing his moral backbone on the way to a success at all cost. This movie is brutal and naturalistic. Has great energy and fast pace. Great acting and a beautiful soundtrack by Wojciech Kilar. It is one of the best movies by Andrzej Wajda. I wish I could have it on DVD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Forward thinking","review":"Yet another forward thinking recording by Wallace Roney. Dare I say visionary?

Alas, many might not be fully aware of the numerous tweaks you can perform. So this book tries to educate you. Naturally, a lot of the hacks relate to the desktop. The book allocates a chapter each to the KDE and Gnome desktops. It does not play favourites by suggesting one is better than the other. So the authors pragmatically support both.As a sign of the book's recent vintage, there is one hack involving Firefox. But given that this browser's rise has scarcely halted, if there is a future edition of this book, we can expect far more hacks on Firefox.Perhaps it is a good sign of linux's security that the only mention of viruses in the book is in the context of running Microsoft Windows emulators or in reading Microsoft Windows documents."},{"rating":"2","title":"Linux Desktop Hacks","review":"I read this book in about two days. The format is laid out in quick modular sections that cover just about everything from downloading and burning an iso all the way to recompiling your kernel. A day later I was genuinely pleased when I successfull did just that. The ability to bounce around the book for specific questions and answers is a ver positive feature. In some instances though the answers only apply if your running KDE or GNOME and equal covereage for both can be sporadic. The book is a handy guide to keep on a shelf for those problems that crop up at 2am that need immediate solutions. I feel this book is a worthwhile investment for a newbie to linux desktop environment."},{"rating":"1","title":"WAS GREAT, now OUT OF DATE","review":"This WAS a great book.

I would recommend it for those times when you are feeling down and you need encouragement. This was a good purchase."},{"rating":"1","title":"Gave up two Chapters in...","review":"The author's writing style is very hard to read. It is poetic and I can appreciate a turn of phrase here and there...but it is quite a slog. He just loads the text with so many little details; he goes on and on about how high the sand banks are and how low this Russian ship or that African ship are in the water...I just didn't care about these details at all...they added absolutely nothing to the narrative and frustrated me to no end. So I decided to abort this trip of the Yangzte...before it even really began. Life is too short than to waste it reading nautical miscellany."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Dip Into Chinese History","review":"The subtitle \\"A Journey up the Yangtze, and Back in Chinese Time\\" more or less explains this combination travelogue/history. Winchester's aim is to travel the length of the Yangtze heading upriver. In doing so, he does a superb job of explaining the importance of the Yangtze River in Chinese history by blending in all manner of history from Western gunboat diplomacy to Mao's Long March to the Rape of Nanjing to the current Three Gorges Dam project. In fact, the book isn't bad as a way to sort of dip into Chinese history for the uninitiated. The travelogue aspect is also well handled, as Winchester travels with a Chinese woman translator/problem-solver. Modern China doesn't come across very well in his description, as he encounters the usual corruption, but also amazing episodes of lethargy and apathy from the locals. At times, the technical hydrology/geology stuff gets tiresome, but overall, it's an excellent read--especially for prospective travelers to area."},{"rating":"1","title":"A well written but inaccurate trip up the Yangtze.","review":"Simon Winchester fascinates the reader with his storytelling ability. As he takes us along on his journey up the Yangtze, the reader feels compelled to read chapter after chapter in a shared journey to the source of the river. Unfortunately Mr. Winchester story is grim and unpleasant - from his hatred of the Shanghai Oriental Pearl TV tower and the Nanking occupation by the Japanese to his altitude sickness in Tibet. He also mentions on more than one occasion seeing corpses in the water. In September 1999 while traveling 1649 miles up the river I saw paper cups, plastic bottles, and other litter but no bodies of any kind - animal or human. Fortunately, I traveled the Yangtze before reading Mr. Winchester's book. I may not have gone if I'd read it first. If that happened, I'd have missed a wonderful adventure filled with beautiful scenes and friendly people."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good subject; terrible style","review":"I agree with Caroline Higgens. I have travelled in China and enjoyed Peter Hessler's \\"River Town: Two years on the Yangtze\\". I suspected there would be problems right from the beginning when I noticed that Mr. Winchester never expressed in a single sentence what couldn't be expanded into three paragraphs. I reached as far as page 28, where Mr. Winchester writes \\"...she could be the ideal companion: when matters became too trying she would brook no nonsense, give no quarter, take no prisoners\\".Three cliches in a row is about three more than I want to read."},{"rating":"2","title":"A search mainly for the river's past","review":"Winchester is almost thunderstruck by the river's majesty. He loves the wild grandeur of Tibet, and fully appreciates the Yangtze's importance in world history. It's just that he finds China's cities of the 1990s ugly, dull, and distasteful. Partly for diversion he's repeatedly drawn to every available relic of British colonial days, till his Chinese assistant Lilly cries \\"Oh God, your bloody British Empire again!\\"About half the book concerns tales of times past. It's half travel adventure, and half history. Clearly Winchester wrote this for a non-Chinese audience, highlighting what seemed relevant or appealing to foreigners, in the years just before the economic boom.--author of A Galaxy of Immortal Women: The Yin Side of Chinese Civilization"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent knowledge base, informative and captivating","review":"Simon Winchester displays a wealth of knowledge about the Yangtzee. He has clearly done his homework and clearly explains why the Yangtzee holds the importance that it does to the Chinese. His narrative covers all aspects of the region, the geological history, economic history and the crucial political aspects. He always puts the historical importance of these factors into the modern context and the net result is a truly interesting, yet richly informative read. It was difficult to put down. This is not a book for the lazy mind however as the imagery that the author conjures up is provocative and requires a good deal of interaction from the reader."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another point of view","review":"Almost every review I see here speaks of Winchester's eloquent storytelling ability, but I cannot agree. I found the subject/trip to be obscured by his rather repetitive and cliched use of descrption. Winchester attempts to enshroud his subject in heaps of magical and varied descriptive prose - but, being no Amis or Twain, he invariably misses the mark. As keen as I am on the subject, I couldn't finish this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cruising the Yangtze","review":"This is an excellent book for anyone planning a cruise on the Yangtze. It reads like a novel. I loved it because it describes the cities and the river, but also the history and the people. Winchester must be incredibly brave (or stupid) because he traveled the Yangtze from China into Tibet with one female guide. He also has a very good chapter on the Three Gorges Dam and why it should not be built. This book is a good read for anyone interested in history, travel, adventure or China."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yes, terribly disappointing!","review":"I agree totally with Yau in the previous review. Mr. Winchester is more interested in sharing the British (yawn) history of China, not giving us much else about the culture and beauty of the Yangtze and its people. I have been to China 2&1/2 wks and also taken a cruise (5 days) of the Yangtze and for him to make it all so boring is more than annoying, it is almost criminal. Perhaps his ego supersedes him. I would not buy this book, in fact I was uanble to even read more than a couple chapters, it was that boring and dry. The one by Mr. Hessler is an absolute winner. I read it once a year at least to refresh my amazing memories of China."},{"rating":"1","title":"Winchester falls short on this one","review":"As a great fan of travel writing and of Simon Winchester I've got to give a thumbs down for this book. Not very engaging writing. The concept is great - up a river, back in time, but Winchester doesn't really stick to this method - he does go up a river (although sometimes by boat, sometimes by car, sometimes by short flight), but he doesn't go back in time in a very methodical way. He's all over the place in time and brushes on huge events, like Mao coming to power, in the breadth of a single sentence. He doesn't dig deep into anything, he wains poetic then changes his tone to factually dry. Almost 200 pages into the book and I'm still not getting any sense of perspective, color, taste, smell - just a pot of rambling facts and mish-mash.Sorry Simon - not your best work."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is a great book!","review":"In this book, Clayton Moore tells all about his life: how he got to be the Lone Ranger, what it was like for him to be the Lone Ranger, and much more.

I am hoping that eventually I will understand the terminology and will get some use out of this book.I was looking for something more detailed with regard to the type of thread, the thread count of the fabric needed, how to secure stitches and what the work should look like from behind.

I wanted something other than the same set of publicity shots and badly spelled FanFic. I was excited by the concept of the Internet guide, but disappointed when I got the book. For the amount of money, I figured I would get a decent sized-book, and was dismayed to find it was only a pamphlet. I would say that at least 50% of the sites rated in the book no longer existed, or had moved, by the time I received it.

First, it's put together like 'books' I used to create in grade school - cardboard-like cover with copied pages on the inside.Second, there really aren't that many Web sites listed. Go to \\"Yahoo\\" or \\"Alta Vista\\" and you'll be able to find more, or to the links page on any halfway decent 'Buffy' site. The author has also ignored some of the more established Web sites, and has neglected to include some of the standout features of the sites that are mentioned.HOWEVER, if you're new to the Internet and looking for an easy way to find some 'Buffy'-related sites, this may be a good buy for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Search engine in a book","review":"It makes a great paperweight!

However, don't get me wrong, you can also throw these guys in your cd playing when you want to flip out or something too.If you like In Flames, Dark Tranquillity, with a touch of Lincoln Park, or just plain melodic or goth metal, then this is the cd for you.

I thought that she had some connection to pianist Marian Mcpartland but this album has about 20 seconds of piano.

The idea that Oliver Cromwell was Fairfax's second fiddle, sucking up to him in order to get close to his wife, is such utter drivel as to make this film unwatchable. The Royalists behind this film end up by saying that there were no republics until the death of Louis XVI in 1793. Err... the United States perhaps?

We fixed that by oiling the screw whose in-out motion controls the heat setting.The more serious problems emerged when the fuse blew. We looked inside and discovered overheated wires with partially-melted insulation. This condition could cause both an electrical shock to the user and an electrical fire that could burn down a house.Toastmaster makes another hot plate (model TTS1) which does have an Underwriters Lab endorsement.

It's the typical 'all text' book with some pages with pics that illustrate the full book. If I'm not wrong it doesn't have more than 10 of these pages with B&W; pictures.

The album doesn't rely on the guitar hero cliches and the wandering jams that litter so many new blues albums. This no-frills music is tight and intense, as are Healey's penetrating lyrics.

Unfortunately, the picture quality is terrible. Worst is the color balance: indoors, on Auto, everything is yellow. When I set it to tungsten (light bulb), everything is blue. The auto-focus seems to be off, too--pictures are all slightly blurred. Bluntly, the pictures are ugly. My old Olympus takes much better pictures, as does my wife's newer (and cheaper) HP315.From all the good reviews that I've seen for this camera, I suspect that I just got a faulty one, but it's not worth my time to try another of the same model.

French fries come out crispy and hot dogs taste like they're right off the BBQ. My only grudge is the clean up. The slide out tray is not so bad to clean (and it's dishwasher safe), but the inside is a chore! You have to clean it when it's still a little warm so the stuff comes off, but you have to scrub near the heating elements so it's very hard! But overall, I would recommend it.

Her graphics background clearly comes into play with this book and enhances the readability for those designers out there.Her style is easy-going and easy-flowing and her humor is injected in just the right places and right ways to make this heavy subject simple to digest and use. Thank you, Bonnie, for the gem that stands out as one-of-a-kind in the haystack of too many mediocre books written on Flash!"},{"rating":"1","title":"How to do EVERYTHING ?

Open up any chapter and you'll find paragraph after paragraph of theories behind Flash and animation concepts. But if you want a step-by-step guide to learning flash, this book has none. It does not guide you through projects or even offer instruction on how to create simple sites. To find what you are looking for you need to read through endless garbage and explanations of general design concepts. And even then, you are not likely to read about the steps of creating a button. Aside from this, the website where the publisher promises \\"Free images Online\\" does not currently exist."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Outstanding Book !!","review":"I bought this book just a 2 months ago, and now I'm developing professional flash aplications. This book does cover EVERYTHING there is to know about flash, in a method that even people with little or no background in flash can read and understand.

I would highly recomend this book to anyone seeking to learn Flash 5, the easy way!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best bright CFL desk lamp at this price point","review":"It is no fashion statement but it certainly works well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Emotional insight","review":"The first part of this book is very interesting and well-written however the second part with all the postures was disappointing.

I have tried chair after chair and still had back pain until I found this chair. I can sit at this chair for hours at a time and feel great. The chair has plenty of adjustments to set it just how you like it. You can have it as firm or as loose as you would like. There are settings for when you lean forward. You can adjust the height of the arm rests, which are leather and very nice by the way. You can also move the arm rests in and out. Obviously, you have the ability to adjust the height of the chair and you can make the lumbar support as tight as you would like as well. All around a great chair. Comes with a 12 year warranty! In conclusion, I am not a 1%'er in America, but the reason I paid the price I did for this chair was the fact that most people spend hours a day in their office chair just as you spend hours a day sleeping. You won't regret buying this Aeron chair."},{"rating":"2","title":"well worth the money","review":"Ok so it's not cheap, but then it's your back and health.Just like a good bed mattress, a good work home office chair makes sense given the amount of hours spent sitting down etc.I got this one back in June 08 (chrome base/leather arms blue/black tuxedo) as it looks a lot nicer and has much better arms and lumber support than the std run-o-mill aeron in black as you see in corporate offices, House MD Tv shows etc etc.Lets face it this chair is a design classic and is described by the media as the the world's best & most comfortable office chair."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing book","review":"I wasn't able to read more than ninety pages of this book. Usually I devour Kate Wilhem's Barbara Gordon mysteries in a day or two and can't leave my seat until I'm finished. This time I got bored, the story didn't interest me, it dragged on, wasn't tightly written, didn't get to the heart of the issues.

Yet, carrying keys on an open key ring will put holes in your pockets in no time. This is a good choice. The leather is smooth and soft; feels great in your hand. I think it will wear well. The hardware has a matte finish which looks a lot nicer than shiny.The best thing is that the keys stay secure in their holders. This replaced a Fossil key case of almost identical design that was unusable since somehow the keys worked their way out of their holders even though then seemed secure. After a week these keys are staying put.One con: the snap-on valet key ring is defective. It is simply impossible to open to add a key.

Now holders of the longest streak of futility regarding winning the World Series, they remain one of the most popular teams in America. Many reasons have been put forward for this, everything from poor management to a curse involving a goat have been cited.This book is one for every Cub fan as it contains a combination of history, lore and information regarding some of the greatest players ever to wear the uniform. I enjoyed reading it and will put it on my shelf and revisit it at the start of the season next year.

The least they could have done was to perform the music live, like it's supposed to be. I hate lip-synching when I see it on tv, and hate it even more when I had to pay in order to see crap like that. Don't waste your money like I did.

Where's the romance in that?This thing read like a really BAD Harlequin romance with WAY too much repetition.

The author's idiosyncracies guide his characterization of Nixon, e.g., Wills doesn't seem too sympathetic to quaker faith, and he insists on Nixon's minimal importance in the Eisenhower days. Knowledge of the political landscape of the time period (40's-70's) is assumed. Much of the book works to characterize the spirits of the decades (40's-70's) rather than Nixon.

However, it came unwound after 3 or 4 months. The C string was the worst. It was literally unplayable so I sent it back. The company replaced it even though that was against their policy.

The next day notice my garden is flooded. I take a look at the hose and it ruptured in the middle! Popped like a balloon from the water pressure I guess. The water pressure was not much at all as even a quarter turn of my spout would be too much for my little garden. I knew this thing was cheap and wouldn't hold up for any kind of job that put moderate stress on it, but this was the lightest of light duty jobs!Based on other reviews it sounds like the black hose has a better history of holding up but I had the green one and it was a bad buy.

As things get supernatural, she accepts help from a mysterious student who she develops a rare connection with.

Moreover the airlines really do need some help from someone like Mintzberg.But because he's not a comedian, it's not a terribly funny book either (he tries hard, too hard), so it's not interesting on that score either.Any editor with sense would have told Mintzberg not to waste his time.

This $...diminutive edition is title driven but once you open the book, the drive is dead. It would easy to say academics are self-indulgent and humorless but this book builds the stereotype. The first clue is the use of his mother with one of those cute quotes \\"Well, let them laugh, Henry. You can always try again.\\" on the back cover. You can point to any page to find similar ... humor - \\"The food is taking so long it as though they are out catching the fish -\\" Page 69.

Just read Mintzberg's WHY I HATE FLYING. The fact is, this book leads one to conclude that Mintzberg is the type who is ready to hate just about anything without taking the trouble to find out the first thing about it. This so-called authority on \\"management\\" has obviously never interviewed a pilot, gate agent, ticket agent, or flight attendant. These are the folks who have to put up with people like Mintzberg who think that profit-seeking (like every other industry)commercial airlines should be moving companies, hotels, and 5-star restaurants all rolled into one.

Hence the atmosphere was right somehow). Mr. Mintzberg is one of these \\"Professor of Economics Guru\\" who's frequently travelling and knows all about the world - except the real one. The \\"real one\\" in today's economics is surviving, especially for the airline industry. Airlines do have to fill their planes and make more revenues than they do have cost - as simple as that! Obviously Mr. Mintzberg has a hard time to get used to the fact that airlines can't give away anything for free. He's one of these guys spending 150 bucks for going overseas and expecting - of course - an upgrade for free including all the good stuff served in Business and First Class. Since that does not happen all the time he's blowing out all of his frustrations in this book.

I opened the packaging, and will not return it to Amazon because I fear a re-stocking charge. I will probably 're-gift' this case to someone who has an earlier P model, and look for a generic case that is closer to the size of the camera than this leftover case.

Honestly though, I would reccomend a group of singers that a MAN or GIRL should really listen to. As for guys listening to this CD, they must be (oops). Sorry... this CD is just for joking around with. I managed to get this CD at school in the Gym laying around. I brought it home and listened to this joker.

I was upset at the way he sings, not his voice, but the way he uses it. He said his album would be more grown up and he was going to rap, well, thats really not rap, not at all, not even close, he sounds young on this record, and like he didnt put much effort into the music, because of it, it might hurt him in the long run, but I hope that it does not. I did enjoy the songs \\"Im all about you\\", \\"Hey You\\" and \\"Baby Its You\\" they just caught my attention real well, but I could not get into any of the rest.

I take that back, the songs are stupid. Ok, he can't sing. You call that rapping? Well...maybe it is, but it needs some work. Jeez, give me a record deal, and I'll blow him out of the music scene...FOR GOOD! Aaron, I'm 15, and take my advice. Switch over to pop music. Don't rap, although your voice is ok!!!! sing something better, you may not have the best voice, but hey, I bet if you tried to sing something more like....Britney Spears type music, you would be a big hit. Why don't you try it. Just make some pop music with an edge and you got it. Hell, I'll write it for ya. Well that's all. This album could use some work on it.

Her father solves the problem - first having her wear a spare outfit of his, then reminding her mother of her own misery in her own clothes at that age. And there's a happy ending - her mother concedes the point and has a few outfits made for her daughter that are more practical.This is a lengthy book, with complicated words; and the cause of Phoebe's distress is likely to go right over the heads of the younger children. As well, the black-and-white drawings may not hold their attention. Phoebe is eight, and this book is definitely better suited for the older end of the 5-8 group."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't bother with this one!","review":"Unless you're already a fan of ASKA don't waste your time on this.

I have to admit I am using it in a very small apartment above the front door, but if that front door was kicked in or someone broke windows and entered that way it would definately go off. It is very loud and has a strobe light that would be intimidating for a burgular. At the very least it would wake me up in the middle of the night. The key chain commands are simple to understand and the lights are easy to see. There is no confusion about if you armed it or disarmed it. Also, it is wireless so it can be installed anywhere, does not give off warnings, has reasonable timing for alarms and exits, and would be difficult for a criminal to disarm (remove batteries or destroy?)

Upon closer inspection, I found that there was supposed to be a nut inside the hole, which was nowhere to be found. Thinking I might be able to work around that problem later, I decided to test the alarm, but the only thing it would do when tripped was flash the strobe light. It made no sound whatsoever.

None-the-less, for its small size it puts out enough heat to warm you if you are sitting right in front of it. It however does not do much for warming an entire room.

I didn't know it was a miniature size of a dish heater. It is small. Measure 9 inches to see how small the dish is.Considering the size, it packs a punch but still it's nowhere near adequate to heat a room. The best usage is perhaps put it under a desk to warm your feet and lower body.If you are considering a dish heater, buy a regular size one. By the way... Dish heaters are not for night-time heating purpose. I think they too bright to left them on when you go to sleep. For that, get an oil heater.

That's it. Nothing else.That said, the security feature which turns to element off with every suspicious move is very good point for the security conscious.

It works well in a smaller room but only keeps you warm if you are with a few feet from the front side of the dish. The warmth is nice in a smaller room and maintains a good temp.

I tipped it over an it shut off immediately."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth it.","review":"This Optimus radiant heat dish (9 inch diameter)was easy to start.. However the heat output- radiant- is very minimal.

If the \\"beam of heat\\" is aimed at your waist,your waist will get warm. Rest of your body stays cold. It's a funny feeling. UPS just came by to ship the item back to Amazon.The good thing about this heater is that it's rated 300 Watt.

The album begins with the rocker \\"You See Red\\", \\"Baby The Angels Are Here\\". \\"Ships In The Sky\\", the WA progressive sound of \\"Stand And Deliver\\" and \\"The Way Of The World Parts 1 and 2\\".

'Way of the World' scorched everytime I heard it live, but on No Smoke Without Fire, well it was a smouldering flicker. This was one of their biggest letdowns with Laurie Wisefield on second guitar.

Would I buy it again? The short answer is yes, but there are a few minor irritations I would point out. First, the clasp on the factor metal band is too difficult to open and close for daily use. I fixed mine easily but it is still not ideal. A better clasp mechanism would be nice. Second, you turn the crown to change modes, settings, etc. A slow turn for minor changes and a fast turn for major changes. I find that just wearing the watch causes the crown to turn enough to change display modes which is aggravating if you want to leave it on a particular mode. This crown adjustment has also become more sensitive with time making it cumbersome to use sometimes. Lastly, I miss the second hand and the glow-in-the-dark hands do not shine very bright (TAG take a lesson from Luminox) but this watch was more than $1000 cheaper than the Kirium so still a good deal."},{"rating":"2","title":"Stylish sports watch","review":"I was originally focused on another Tag model and saw this watch in a store.

I was very impressed with the watch. I knew I wanted a Tag and once I saw this one I had to have it. Although I did pay a little bit more for it than a typical F1, it was well worth the money. I am a scuba diver and it makes for an excellent dive watch. It did great at the depths at which I dove at (50-70 ft.) and has provided me with a durable, reliable piece of art for everyday use. The Tag Heuer Chromotimer watch is a great investment and I would truly recommend this watch. If I had to give any issues, they would simply be that the crown at times will turn by simple motion of the hand and change the LCD display feature, but not a big deal at all. All in all--great watch that keeps excellent time and the typical quality you expect from a high-end brand as Tag Heuer..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Almost perfect","review":"The only issue that I've had with this watch is that the face seems to scratch fairly easy.

Mr. Girard takes the reader back to a more simpler way of life and after reading it, I felt like it was there!Everyone feels a need for \\"home\\", \\"family\\" and \\"love\\" especially during these turbulent times. This book builds on that - in every chapter you see these themes as you get to know each member of the Ahearn family, from the patriarchial \\"Mom\\" and \\"Pop\\" Ahearn to the new generation that would lead us into World War II and ultimately the \\"baby boomer\\" area.If you want to get to know what hopes, dreams, struggles and joys an immigrant family experienced, then get this book!

Our college son now has it, and still uses it, so we're stuck with the burnt rice."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of money!","review":"This cooker was disappointing from the day we bought it - the lid didn't sit well so it emitted steam all over the kitchen counter. The rice always burnt and stuck to the bottom (which never happened with our Black and Decker one) and it stopped working just over a month after we bought it!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Looking for another cooker","review":"I have this cooker and am looking for another one. It burns the rice on the bottom every time, no matter what I do. Also, I agree with the person who was disappointed that there was no 2 cup mark--I don't need to make 4 cups every time."},{"rating":"1","title":"BURNS RICE EVERY TIME","review":"TOTAL piece of useless junk! Looks nice and build well, BUT the bottom line, as another reviewer already pointed out, it burns the rice every time no matter what kind of rice you use or what method you use to cook it. I assume anyone buying a rice cooker is looking to cook rice, not BURN it. So if you are planning on using this for cooking rice, DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME & MONEY WITH THIS ONE!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Used it 2 times and it died","review":"Unit just died yesterday, smelled something burning and it wasn't the rice.

Plus for the price, you'd think it could at least cook a decent pot of rice. Guess again. Despite how careful you are, the rice is either soggy or burnt! Plus the manufacture has calibrated their cooker to use their \\"Cup\\" of measurement which has no bearing to real world measurements (Closer to 3/4 cup) Not the end of the world, but frustrating to use with our recipes. Overall a real disappointment. Stay away - stay far far away!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Durable","review":"This product is the 2nd one that we had in the past year.

I bought this rice cooker because of its large capacity, non-stick pot and steamer rack. But now I have two at home and none of them work anymore.

The nonstick basket is nice and easy to clean, but the consequent brittle rice around the border makes the cooker unsuitable for making only a small amount of rice."},{"rating":"1","title":"It Died After 1 Year","review":"Well quite disapointed with this rice cooker> To begin with, the button that pushes down to go from warm to cook after a while stopped staying down and had to be forced to stay down with scotch tape and in turn the rice cooker had to be baby sat as not to over cook the rice. Since. Had no choice. And now as of two days ago and a year of use, It will not even turn on. No power at all. The power cord is fine, even ran around the house to make sure it was not the electrical outlets. It was not. It just died. Is it worth fixing or is it just the natural life span of a ... rice cooker? Time to move up in the world to one that does not use a common push down button destined to wear itself out, reason for the tape. But no power?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Steamed Rice Cooker by Farberware","review":"I think this is a great rice cooker. It's made by Farberware and they are known to high-quality products. This particular rice cooker can steam up to 20 cups of rice and keep it warm. It can be used for other foods too. Throw in your vegetables such as carrots, green beans, or broccoli. No more mushy broccoli after it's done boiling. The cooker is made with non-stick material so you aren't scraping all night to get the food off. I am impressed with this product."},{"rating":"2","title":"It matches with any kitchen.........","review":"I was looking for a nice-looking rice cooker, preferably stainless steel.

RodaAs you can see, only some of the tracks are one that Brasil '66 did. (This is somewhat analogous to the way Tijuana Brass cover groups like the Mexicali Brass did their albums.)But in my opinion, since the group has lackluster arrangements and performances compared to Brasil '66, it's not even worth a high import price to hear these other tracks \\"as they might have sounded\\" had Brasil '66 done them.

However, I find this to be a rather nice album. Nehemiah plays a style of melodic metal, but the style that is more in the vein of Dead To Fall and Light This City. What makes this stand out is how the band can manage to throw in technical riffs in their style of music. And yes, you have the occassional breakdown, but I'm not against that at all.

The author fails to deliver on his promise as laid out in the title of the book. Fortunately one comes to this realization that the author does not appreciate the meaning conveyed in the title early in the first chapter. His long winded entry to the question provides the reader with definitive proof that nothing outlined in the title of the book is going to happen. From a conceptual perspective his criteria further substantiate that the author is abusing the word used in the title. Multiple, contingent criteria are by definition not singular. The author has been a consultant at Gallup too long to appreciate that his set-up violates the premise of the book's title."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's not ONE thing...it's many","review":"The title is misleading...it's not one thing, it's many...and the many things the author cites are rehashed wisdom and experience, though he does present them in a succinct way.

It came with very few directions which I had to look for on the side panels. There are no directions on the battery placement, so I guessed, and was correct. Up to this point I figured, okay, the reviews were right, cheap but it works. The lights tested fine. About 20 minutes into my ride the front light stopped working. When I got home I pulled the battery and replaced it with a new American made $4.50 battery and it works again. Now I will have to wait and see how long the back light works on the \\"Made in China\\" battery."},{"rating":"2","title":"to blink or not to blink","review":"these little blinkies were easy to install and work great. Very bright and wide viewing angle so cars on the side can see you blinking. Choose between flashing, solid on, or off with a small button. Others have complained the button was too small, but I had no problems. Installation was easy, and its feels very sturdy once installed. to change battery, you need to just stick a coin into the side of the plastic covering for the light and it pops off easily. This concerns me on longtime durability, but the price is worth the chance. If you need these lights as headlights to see where you're going, they can suffice somewhat, but a bigger front light may be desired.

I travel along two lane roads that have lots of shadows due to trees. My concern has been that with the right angle of sunlight, a driver will over look me.For my purpose, these LEDs are just not bright enough nor do they have enough spread for day time riding. Even riding at dusk or on cloudy days through shadows, the LEDS just dont put out enough light where I felt as though drivers could see me. I returned these and purchased the more expensive three LED Planet Bike for the rear, and the Blackburn Quadrant for the front. Its 4x the price, but probably whats needed."},{"rating":"1","title":"White light, Red light, no light","review":"I agree with other reviews that the white light is really not a headlight by any means.I attached the red light in the back so others can see me.

Today it would turn on as long as I pressed the button . However , I can't ride the bike whit my right hand behind my back pressing the button. I put a new battery and it would not work. In a moment of inspiration I shook it and the light turned on. So, I though I was safe and sound driving to work.

The headlight bulb fit perfect on the bike and has 3 modes. Push the button once and it flashes (fast like a strobe light), push the button again and the light stays on, push again and turns off. The head light can also be adjusted up or down. Very easy to install and use. The red light does the same except does not adjust once on the bike.

They are not so bright that they blind an oncoming car (no point in pissing off or blinding someone behind the wheel with laser powered spotlights :-)) BUT they are bright enough to be seen blocks away.

However, the same thing happened to the second lamp . . . and then the third. I have had three new lamps in the last year. I just received the fourth today from GE. It seems like there's some kind of design/engineering problem with the lamp. It's not that the bulbs are burning out, it seems to have more to do with the floruescent balast, but I'm no engineer, so I don't really know.What I can say is that the lamp is bright, the color of the light is very white (not yellow like some flourescent bulbs) and it's very energy efficient (55w for 300w of light).I can only hope that this one does last a little longer than the first three I've had!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The majority I bought work poorly","review":"I bought seven of these lamps 2 to 3 years ago at Home Depot.

Leap of Faith is a great song while 20 Margaritas is weird (but good). I could go on and on trying to describe each song but I think the style of Big & Rich is such that for me to describe each one wouldn't do them justice.

Every song on \\"Horse...\\" was mind blowingly fantastic (to my pleasant surprise as I only bought their first album for their hit \\"Save a Horse...\\").

Having done that, the tool does not work very good. The alligator clip is weak and of poor quality. the test light is partially obscured by the spring contact for the - (negative) contact of the battery.

It cracked and broke partway right where the wood shaft enters the metal cone. Rather than wait weeks for a fix, I trimmed and shaved the shaft to reinstall it, and it again worked great until it cracked again just a day later.I realize my area has hard-packed clay soil, and that's why I'm not giving it a poor rating (it really is a good design). I solved the problem by adapting an aluminum pole for the original wood handle, and haven't had any problems since.

In an attempt to cover a wide scope of countries and issues and histories, Roger Owen, a well-respected authority in the subject matter, churns out a shallow text that does not even start getting to the issues at hand. It is a dull read that follows a standard template for what a professor believes should be fed to undergraduate students.Professor Owen dwells in 280 pages on state building and political parties and movements, but lacks insight into events at the beginning of the 20th century that contradict his conclusions. I would not recommend this book for serious readers of Middle East issues or history, but it is useful for those under duress to produce a term paper at college."},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic Rudner","review":"This is a great DVD that really showcases Rita Rudner's comedy style.

The story is unique and fascinating, the portrayal of the town is detailed and intriguing, there is a broad cast of characters each bringing something different. But it just...goes...on...and...on....ad...nauseam. Not nearly enough happens to warrant the book extending to the length of 700 pages. And I'm no stranger to long books, I love digging in. But by the mid four hundreds of Curfew my brain was turning to mush. The scenes start to reek of repetition, the same characters doing essentially the same things for hundreds of pages on end. I'd love to read an abridged version of this, and I hate abridges versions. This is NOT a page turner, but a long hard slog.

Rickman bases his novels on England's pagan spiritual past rising up against the remnants of the Christian conquest and the reality of its materialistic present. Outsiders who try to change local customs are thus always up to no good.I began reading this on a rainy Friday and finished it on a sunny Sunday. I felt the weather fit the book. Rickman got off to a good start, especially in the concept and the terrific sense of place. In the end he disappointed just a little by having his smart and powerful villains too easily defeated. He lost me when he has a middle-aged woman kill a big strong groundskeeper with an exhaust pipe.A great read on the whole. This wasn't my last Rickman."},{"rating":"2","title":"OVERALL NOT BAD","review":"Here in the UK CURFEW was released titled CRYBBE. Not the most inspiring title for a horror novel but I bought it nevertheless. The premise of a ghost-riddled town on the Welsh borders is interesting and generates a quintessentually English ghost novel that is thick with shadowy lanes, dark timberframed cottages and rural folklore. If you like slow-build-up horror which favours atmosphere to all-out carnage then CURFEW is your novel. The only trouble with this novel is the occasional eruptions of political correctness and an unpleasant heroine. A part from that it is an excellant read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Slow start, but picks up speed","review":"It starts slow, but the horrors of the town slowly build and grow on you.

Then a beautiful, older, realistic young woman named Carla boards in his house and the young infatuated Louden finds himself having deeper thoughts and aspirations -- like being a gynecologist in outer space!

Luckily, both stars would go on to do better things."},{"rating":"1","title":"Vision Quest","review":"I PURCHASED THIS MOVIE BECAUSE I HAVE BEEN LOOKING FOR IT FOR A VERY LONG TIME.

TO SUM IT UP I'M NOT REAL HAPPY WITH THIS PURCHASE."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wrestling movie that pleases","review":"\\"Vision Quest\\", from 1985, is a wrestling movie that grabs your attention and holds it. The film is well-cast and is headed up by a likeable young Matthew Modine. More than a little innocent, Modine's character, Louden Swain, is a terrific set-up to take on a favored champion opponent. Reminiscent of Robby Benson's \\"One on One\\" from a few years prior, \\"Vision Quest\\" moves ahead nicely toward a charged last few minutes....the best minutes of the film. The side romance is a bit of a distraction but it is fun to see a young Madonna perform \\"Crazy For You\\". This is an appealing film and highly recommendable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Possibly Modine's Best Performance","review":"I wouldn't describe myself as the type that is maniacal about a certain actor, but I think that Matt Modine is as good as they come. This all comes despite the fact that he plays a variation of the same character in almost all of his films (i.e. a smart-aleck who has a sensitive side). Vision Quest offers the trials and tribulations of a love-sick teen wanting to be a hero. Sure, the boy-meets-girl, boy-loses-girl story has been used before, but what makes this film underrated is that the viewer can totally believe Modine is an introspective virgin yearning for his dreams to be realized. Great '80s soundtrack featuring a fledgling Madonna singing \\"Gambler\\" and \\"Crazy for You.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic, a must-have!","review":"This movie is a classic, one that must be viewed at least yearly come state tournament time.

From Matthew Modine's training montages to the soundtrack, everything pumps you up in this movie. I don't like even like wrestling but Matthew Modine makes you wanna try out for a team! Matthew Modine is just a typical 18 year old high school student, young, ambitious, and confused. When he drops to a lower weight class level to beat \\"shoot\\" his team disowns him. That doesn't stop him though, he is sexually teased by Linda Fiorentino, disowned by his team and coach, and even challenged by his own health.

If you want to revisit what being young and wanting something really bad and feeling like everything is really really important again, see \\"Vision Quest\\". It's poignant and inspirational as well as very well directed and edited without beating the viewer over the head with whatever \\"message\\" it is that they want you to take away from it. This movie will make you laugh and groan - and probably inspre you to get in shape!

The same way that hockey players gravitate towards Slapshot and Youngblood and have made those movies well-known \\"guy flicks\\" despite having no affect on the box office when they were originally released, this movie about a High School wrestlers quest to do something great in life is also a worthy title in any guys movie collection. The wrestling scenes are all very believable, and the sub-plots are all very believable in the setting of a high school athlete's life. Great guy movie that should be watched and bought despite the fact you have likely never heard of it before. If you're a guy who loves sports movies - you need this flick. Also has some great lines in it that will be appreciated by any red-blooded male."},{"rating":"2","title":"a winner","review":"A well-made but typical 80's \\"you're the greatest\\"-type movie (as the soundtrack makes intrusively clear), about a high school wrestler who is driven to take on a legendary champ.There's something that's always bothered me about this movie: the lead actor, Matthew Modine, while charming, was totally miscast!He doesn't look anything remotely like a wrestler, much less the size and caliber that would be required to best the hulking \\"Shoot\\" (himself superbly cast).Not that Modine is a bad actor by any means, having delivered totally convincing (and even stunning) performances in \\"Birdie,\\" \\"Full Metal Jacket,\\" and a load of other movies.But he is congentially spindly and undeveloped, it must be admitted. The visual \\"cognitive disconnect\\" of this movie proved, for me, a constant distraction.The movie is also notable for featuring an extended cameo by Madonna, just on the cusp of super-stardom.This DVD's got jack squat for extras, by the way."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why fullscreen?","review":"I have been waiting for this one for a while now but I wonder why it was released in fullscreen only.

I wonder if these companies really want to make money or are simply going through the motions."},{"rating":"2","title":"something for us...","review":"I confess; I am a wrestler and that probably biases me slightly. No matter, I love this movie. My wrestling coach showed our team this movie my sophomore year in high school, and I have loved it ever since. Truly, before I seen this movie I thought no one understood how we felt--the feeling of sacrificing so much and receiving so little in return. The blood, sweat, and tears (literally) that came along with such a demanding sport, along with the joy, comradery and lasting friendships developed through sweat all come together in this movie. There are dozens of football, basketball, and baseball movies, but now we have something to call our own. Something we can watch that reminds us of how we used to be. If you have ever worked hard or sacrificed for anything in your life, you should not only understand this movie, but should love it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A truly excellent film","review":"On the surface, this is the story of a high school wrestler. But the story goes so much deeper. While I, like many others, were drawn to this movie because of the wrestling theme, I found it to be an amazing story about growing up, and about life as a teenager in America.

They're deep, which is fine, but the slot bottom is a wavy piece of wire that has big gaps. Pop Tarts (for which there is a special setting) lean way over to the side and get trapped when the pop-up mechanism activates. (Bread does this sometimes too if the pieces aren't very large.) Items don't pop up as far as the outside of the box tells you it does. Still have to stick fingers or tongs in to get items. Also, the darkest setting for making toast is not actually all that dark. Toast comes out unevenly browned. The levers to push the bread down don't always catch the first time, so you have to make sure the bread actually stays down.

They know their stuff. There's a map showing what color you should paint your bat house, based on where you live in the USA (sorry, no international maps, but you can use the temperature guides to figure out what color if you don't live in the USA).This book is large format, and very concise (35 pages, none wasted).

The curler box is not as big and bulky as lots of sets I have owned, thus you have more counter space. I like the fact you plug/unplug them to turn them on and off. This means to me there is no switch to short out. The clips are just the right sizes and hold the curlers in place well. The longer you keep them in your hair the tighter and bouncier the curl. They do not pull your hair out when you take them out. They release easily.

The Remington H-1080N rollers were slow to heat, the roller clamps were difficult to place in the proper position, and it was difficult to put the rollers back in their proper slots when finished.

The hinged lid isn't removable so it crowds the vanity. And the lid doesn't snap closed, therefore if you close the lid, slightly bump the set, all of the rollers spill out. The rollers have melted at the edges,leaving grey plastic on the heaters (I've been lucky about my hair and have stopped using them). The oval case makes it impossible to wrap the cord for storage. The clamps don't work on even slightly long or thick hair.

Next time I will spend more more for a better product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save Your Money","review":"Knowing what I know now after having purchased these hot rollers, I would not buy them again if they went on sale for a dime. My chief complaint is that the clips are horribly designed and allow the rollers to fall out of my hair almost as fast as I can put them in. The rollers that did manage to stay in place (very, very few of what I put in) produced curl which was way too soft to last for more than a very short time. About the only positive thing I can say about this set of curlers is that the ends stay much cooler than those in my old set (which were so hot to handle that I threw them away after a very short use. The old set is about to get company...)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not buy this!!","review":"I got this curler set, and I completely regret it! I used it once, and I wont touch it again! It left my hair frizzy, and there was a bump from where the clamps were. It took me 3x as long to get fix my hair as it did to put it in the curlers and wait for it to cool down. I wouldn't even give it one star...take my advice- DO NOT buy this!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"This product has been a disappointment. It takes up too much room when open. It needs a retractible cover (like my old Clairol set). It is not good for travel, because the rollers do not stay put. If you accidentally bump it, the rollers will disengage and the plastic will melt. Most of my rollers have melt spots after just a few weeks of use. You must do a lot of guess work to get the rollers back in the right spot. And, if you don't, guess what--more melting. It does not have a handle for carrying, and you have to find your own storage for the roller clamps. Very klutzy design.

It will also help in Esperanto comprehension if you are learning it which is a bonus."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good script, good acting, good directing equals good film","review":"Incubbus is a classic story about the conflict of good vs. evil. William Shatner plays the good protagonist that is confronted by a woman demon that entices weaker men into the sea as an offering to the dark lord. I think fans of the Twighlight Zone and fans of early Polanski films will really enjoy this low budget thriller. This was also one of the scariest films I've seen. The film is shot in Ingar Bergman style black and white, and the soundtrack accompanying the films is really a nice touch. The use of Esparanto gives the film even a more chilling effect. Also, if you read about the curse of the film that affected the actors and the crew after this film wrapped it really leaves you feeling a little bit unsettled. I strongly recommend this film."},{"rating":"1","title":"What on earth?","review":"From all the hype I would have thought this movie the equal of Night of the Living Dead in terms of cinematography and dramatic tension, with the added attraction of the movie being in Esperanto, which I speak, read and write.

It seemed as if the writer was trying too hard to make this story funny. It's also very pointless and stupid and the ending is completely unexpected.

Save your money and get it from a library. Why the warning? Summers gets far too carried away with his own research, and goes off on seemingly endless digressions that have only tangential reference to the main topic. In his discussion of vampire literature, do we really need to know the original casts of vampire plays performed in New York or London? And do we need page after page after page on excommunication? I found myself deeply annoyed as vampires faded from sight time and again and Summers expanded with scholarly garrulity on whatever bee was currently in his bonnet as he wrote.

The siren is very loud, and it should only be used in extreme emergencies.Be warned that when cranking, don't overdo it. My mistake was cranking the device so fast that eventually the gears wore out and broke.

They were a huge disappointment for me, mainly because of the clips! It is true that the rollers are heavy. My hair is very thick, but even with minimal hair around the curler, the clips kept popping off. Once I got the clips to stay and left them on to set, I had clip marks left in my hair! The only way I could use them was to use the metal pins from my old set. Also, these plastic clips are not travel friendly. They take up almost as much space as the rollers. And my set did not heat up in 90 seconds at home or abroad. Sorry, but dont get these if you have thick hair or don't have a backup set of clips!"},{"rating":"1","title":"No.","review":"I've used hot rollers for everyday styling years ago, but after going to a very short 'do, I eventually got rid of them. Lately 've been letting my hair grow out and decided to go back to trusty old hot rollers. Not much has changed, but I wanted to try a newer type of roller, one that dispensed with metal clips and I thought the grippy coating on these would be nice.I've thrown them out, having found them useless. First off - I don't think they get hot enough. Second off, the plastic clips they come with don't hold hair tightly - even if I managed to get them on tight, they quickly loosened and the rollers are then flopping around, unrolling. Even the best result I got was just nothing, nothing but a very slight volume, nothing that couldn't be accomplished with a little hair gel and a blow dryer.\\\\Very disappointing.

I purchased these curlers for travel, and their practically useless. First, the curlers are too heavy and do not stay in your hair. Second, the clips do not hold the heavy curler. Very disappointing :{. The good news, is that I have finally found a travel set which meets the needs of shoulder lenght hair or shoulder.The product I would purchase instead is the Conair Instant Heat Compact Styling Setter, Model HS 28.

These Conair are the next best thing to the Clairol curlers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Compact, But the Rollers Fall Easily","review":"I bought this set directly from the manufacturer. I have the previous old set that I've gone back to using because the rollers are far easier to put in place and they stay in place. I do sometimes get the crimped look on top with the old set, but I go to war with the new set. I have been using this new set for two months and used it on a month's vacation. I had high hopes it would work well because I loved my old set and it is compact. It was a battle to keep the rollers in place. They are too heavy, the pins don't stay in place easily. If you have short or thin hair, they want to fall out."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Hair Rollers Ever!","review":"I had bought these hair rollers a few years back at a local Kmart and LOVED THEM. I only bought one set which contains 10 rollers. With only 10 rollers it takes a while to roll a full head of thick long hair so I knew I needed more. Well turns out Kmart, Walmart, CVS, Walgreens doesnt sell these rollers anymore which led me to look online. They are worth the process of ordering and waiting. They dont rip your hair or get tangled. They are pink and turn white when they are hot and ready. Very helpful, takes about 1 minute to heat up and they curl BEAUTIFULLY. Not like the other rollers that have the prongs around them and pull hair while taking them out. I would recommened all girls that need good rollers to get these. I now have 3 sets and it seems like a good number for a whole head of hair!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Customer Service","review":"The seller of this product was Excellent...

They are so good, I stopped using the \\"big, home set\\" and use these type daily. Heat up fast, great lasting curl (particularly for hard to curl fine hair), and don't even need to leave them in that long.Would have given them a 5 - but this set has the awful plastic clips that can leave a kink in the curl. Recommend getting or using a set of the old-fashioned wire clips that come with most non-travel sets if you want a smoother curl."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty Good curls for fine hair","review":"I have very fine lair and a lot of it. My hair is a little below my shoulder and these curlers really do the trick. I only have to leave them in for about a minute or two for some nice waves. The set is small and it comes with 2 sets of clips - one for the big rollers and one for the small. Great size for travel, can squeeze into a suitcase and seem like it's not there.The only issue is sometimes the clips leave a dent in your hair, so make sure you have a second after you take them out to adjust or undo the dent (looks like a tiny crimp horizontally).

Topics range from Menscius to Han Feizi to the Great Learning. No previous knowledge of Mandarin or contemporary Chinese is assumed (although it is helpful). Text is supplemented with useful footnotes, and appendices contain grammatical reviews.My only complaint would be the following: upon introduction of a word, all possible definitions are given, with the most pertinent definition as applies to the given text astrisked by the author. However, as further uses of the word appear in later texts, they are no longer on the vocab list of \\"new words\\", and their meaning must be inferred from the list of definitions given in a previous chapter. A positive side to this is, of course, forcing a student to do his own research."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome!!","review":"This entire series is just awesome!

If you haven't read any of the others this is not the one you should start with. The character and spiritual growth of the characters builds with each novel so it's best to start at the beginning!

There are lots of characters but they all work well within the book and the romance is sensitively handled.As someone who has recently left christianity, the emphasis on it can be a little jarring but Henderson's portrayal of a loving and protective god still connects - the concept is not original to christinity! I can't wait for Stephen's story!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Dee Henderson's Best","review":"I am a fan of Dee Henderson and have read every book she's written. However, I can't recommend this one. Even though I am familiar with the O'Malley brothers and sisters, I was confused by the numerous characters and the frequent switch in point of view. I like Henderson's characters, but think she would do much better if she stuck to a few and let the reader get to know them better. I also agree with another reviewer: don't read this book if you're upset or depressed. It will not cheer you up. Read some of Henderson's earlier work instead. Yes, bad things happen, but an entire book filled with them makes the \\"escape\\" aspect of reading this book almost nonexistent."},{"rating":"2","title":"My Favorite So Far","review":"I own all of the O'Malley series and I have to say that 'The Healer' is my favorite. I absolutely love the O'Malley family. You really need to read all the books in order so you can learn the history of this family and watch as each character evolves. I started with 'The Negotiator' and immediately knew that I had found an author that could keep me enthralled in the plot and also share my faith.'The Protector' let me down a little. I just couldn't mesh with the characters like I did with the other books. But Ms. Henderson totally made up for it with 'The Healer'. This book had all of my emotions in an uproar. You really feel for Rachel because she has to deal with so much in this book. But sometimes we have to go through the difficult times to grow closer to God.I would definately recommend this book to any lover of Christian fiction or even any type of fiction. Dee Henderson is an author who knows how to captivate her audience and keep them there."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Healer","review":"In a time when it is so hard to find quality, clean fiction, this book shines like a beacon for a good read. The fifth in the series (there is a prequel, but not counted) the previous books do lead to this novel. The story is heartbreaking and I found myself needing to keep tissues handy while reading this book. I found myself ranging in emotions from laughter, tears, anger, and comfort. This book had it all. It is a little darker than Ms. Henderson's previous titles, but well worth the melancholy. It packs a spiritual punch that left me reflecting on my own faith. The book is entirely clean - meaning no language, no sexual situations, no filth. I am a romance reader and this was a refreshing and welcome addition to my library. It's a keeper (maybe I'll pass it on, after reading it three or four more times - but then again . . .) Highly recommended!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book!!","review":"This book is probably one of or my favorite out of the O'Malley series so far!

Overall, I'd say if the dogs ran off with it and buried it in the backyard, I'd probably replace it with the same thing so I'm happy enough.

My professor was Raymond Petrillo, the translator of this book and a close friend of the author. When I saw this book on the required reading for the class, I thought Petrillo was just trying to pad his pocket, but I didn't have any problem humoring him. Some of the pieces in this book are a little goofy and I wouldn't have put them on paper myself, but others were 'incredibile'. The author poured a lot of his soul into this book (and so did the translator).We memorized several sections out of the book which helped my vocabulary and grammar tremendously, but I learned more about being Italian than I did speaking Italian from this book. I'm glad my prof had us read Contrappunti, and I understand now that it wasn't just so he could earn a few more royalties. You should buy it and help pad my professor's pocket - you'll be glad you did.Grazie, Professore.

I adore a good glass of lemonade and this has got to be in the top 3! You do have to test the sugar and lemon amounts to your taste and 2 1/2 quarts isn't really much, but it is more than well worth it!!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Works Great!","review":"The other reviewers are right about the pitcher being poorly designed (drips/leaks when pouring) and the instructional booklet is weak at best. And yes, if you are not careful you can get burned by the steam escaping from the rear vent. The warning near the vent area is not large enough, it is much too easy to miss. Once you are familiar with your machine however, the steam vent is not a problem.The first time I used it - I didn't connect the male & female water/steam tube correctly. There was hot water popping out and the sugar did not dissolve. The second time I took a hard look at the machine itself, used the instructional booklet as a rough guide and voila, all connections were correctly made and it worked great! Now, I can have fresh cold homemade lemonade in about 10 minutes, with vey little mess and an easy clean up! You can't beat that, I love this machine!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"poor design, waste of money","review":"This is a poorly designed lemonade maker. The plastic construction is flimsy.When you apply pressure to juice the lemon, you feel like the plastic is going to crack.Making lemonade should be an easy, enjoyable process. But this machine makes it a lot more trouble than it has to be. You have to put sugar in a separate reserve, add water into another reserve, and the steam comes out of the top, so it can get kind of hot. Because the water is heated to melt the sugar, you'll have to use ALOT of ice to cool it down in order to drink. Then you have to disassemble the top to wash out the sugar, pulp & seeds.I cannot believe Salton released this product to be sold. It is a completely unnecessary contraption. I would recommend buying a simple, smaller juice extractor for squeezing the lemons instead. You can melt sugar with hot water in a separate cup and just add cold water. Trust me, it'll save u money, time and counter space!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Big disappointment","review":"We were so looking forward to fresh lemondade. The moment the Salton arrived we opened the box, pulled out the lemons we had bought in anticipation and began juicing.

Strong Motor.Cons -Extractor tray is too shallow and fills up with pulp quite fast.following instructions to use number of lemons the sugar required is far greater than it can use/handle.Not all sugar is used and some is left in bottom of container after water has gone thru.The hot water passing thru tray to sugar to make the simple syrup is totally unnecessary.The number of lemons siggested makes the lemonade far too strong especially with the amount of sugar required.The pouring spout on the pitcher puts more on the outside of the glass than inside.It is far more complicated than it needs to be."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buy a juicer and make a quart of simple syrup","review":"Geez, what a waste of counter space. Someone thought they were doing me a favor giving me this machine. It's a pain to use. Much easier to just use my electric citrus juicer and pour in my own simple syrup. Here a quart of it costs about 75 cents. Tastes just the same and is ready in 5 minutes. This went to Goodwill after the first use."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great!","review":"I've read some of the reviews and wonder if these people got the same Lemonader I got.

The place Vietnam. I was born sometime after the Vietnam conflict, but I have always been a huge Get Fuzzy fan. Watching Bucky going through boot camp was way too funny. THe part were he tells his drill sergeant that he has tuna breath left me rolling on the floor. It was great to see Bucky with a huge afro back in '68 before he got drafted. \\"Hey Buck\\", cries one of the other recruites, as he is tossing him a live grenade, \\"Catch this!\\". THis was really funny because it reminded me of an old Bugs Bunny cartoon. When we find Bucky in a POW camp he uses his biting sarcasm to fool his guards and even gets them to laugh. Get Fuzzy is so funny I wish Darby would make more strips that involve the past."},{"rating":"1","title":"Quality Testing sadly lacking.","review":"The only reason I'm even giving this book 2 stars is because the content is fine.

Get Fuzzy has yet to progress to the point of being funny or acute or original. Maybe some strips did take awhile to find themselves, but after four years Bloom County, Calvin and Hobbes and Peanuts found their groove and were funny/original. A fine artist Conley may be, but he needs help in writing jokes and wry humor."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dog + Cat = Overused Comic Theme!","review":"Does anyone ever look at other strips and see that this strip is no more funny than they are? Get Fuzzy really is not that great. To say that this is original is like saying Coke tastes nothing like Pepsi or Dr. Pepper tastes nothing like Mr. Pibb. The strip tries too hard to be and does not make the cut. It is too much a generic comic. It's trying to be like the auto industry and trying to create a new SUV when all SUV's are pretty much the same thing. That is what Get Fuzzy is pretty much the same thing. I am still waiting for the next comic that for sure is better than all the rest."},{"rating":"1","title":"What is this?","review":"All \\"Get Fuzzy\\" proves is that there is a dumbing of America. How can people begin to say that this predictable strip is original and thought provoking. I think that people are in a haze when they say that it is in no way like \\"Garfield\\"! Give me a break! \\"Get Fuzzy\\" would never have been created if it were not for \\"Garfield\\". Also, if the creator of \\"Get Fuzzy\\" would come up with some new ideas he might get his creation to grow. Lately all it has done is stayed within the apartment. Where's the growth of the characters? I am still confused over the lost fang episodes, did Bucky lose the fang or not? One day he still has the fang, the next day he does not. One day he has the fang, the next day the ferret has it. What gives? This is a bad strip!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Ignore what you've heard, this book is great!!","review":"Yes it may contain a few strips you have already seen but most of it is new. If you love Get Fuzzy you'll love this just the same. If you are collecting the books as I am then you definitely have to have it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Stay fuzzy!","review":"\\"Get Fuzzy\\" is brilliantly drawn, with sophisticated humor and more than a touch of \\"Dilbert.\\" Bucky the boorish cat is very much like Dogbert--megalomaniacal and cynical, and too adorable not to love. Satchel, the angelic dog, spends much time in the sidelines, observing things quietly and with an expression of great concern. But his asides often provide the strips' punchlines, and he is just as lovable as his feline foil. \\"Groovitude\\" is a great name for this collection, as the cartoon has a sort of groove that one must enter before the humor and humanity start to shine through. Fellow cat-lovers note: Even by the standards of anthropomorphic animates, Bucky is a bit too unrealistic, having been fitted with a number of un-catlike qualities. But he's a great character, anyway. It's only a cartoon, after all--albeit a great one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Be aware, this book has virtually no new content","review":"Groovitude *combines* the first two Get Fuzzy books, and adds some sunday color. If you already own the previous books, you will be unhappy. Seeing as I got all three at the same time, I was disapointed. Get it as a gift for someone who doesn't already own the others."},{"rating":"2","title":"Viva Le Katt!","review":"Darby Conley has created three lovable characters with diverse, yet unique characteristics: Stachel the pooch with his naive innocence; Bucky Katt with his brilliantly evil little schemes; and Rob Wilco, their long suffering owner, the stabilizing force in the household. Conley gives each a personality, as well as a few of his side characters (Joe, Rob's Dad, and the neighborhood pets).This is the book that shows you how it all began. The first few pages show you Conley's rough character drafts (the creation of Bucky and Satchel), along with a little background on how the strip originated. You'll then get into the first few years of the strip. I loved every page!This is one of the funniest strips to come along in a long time. Since we no longer have Calvin & Hobbs or The Far Side, where is one to go for witty, intelligent humor in the daily paper? \\"Get Fuzzy\\" is the answer. I hope Rob, Satchel, and Bucky are here to stay with us for a long, long time."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the Best","review":"\\"Must... fear... change!\\" Scream the masses who compare Garfield to Get Fuzzy, and derive that Get Fuzzy is just a horrible imposter. This book proves that while yes, it is possible for an artist to pay homage to other artists, at the same time a unique product can be derived. Conley's pen draws more than just witty banter between pets and their master, he also draws a rather modern illustration of the typical bachelor male. I imagine those most opposed to the cartoon are those which realize the only difference between their lives and this great comic, is that their pets can't talk. Jealousy is unbecoming! Instead, purchase this book, and realize that it is funny enough to stand on its own."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not order this on Kindle","review":"It is impossible to read or clearly see the the book.

It is one of the dullest strips around. What is great is that now Bloom County is out on Sundays, so poeple can see a truly funny and original strip.I noticed that Darb' just mentioned the war in Iraq in his recent strip. Darby, you are not clever enough to get political. In fact you have to first master being funny and original, which you haven't."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"Must,Fear ,Change\\"?","review":"Sure, some people might fear change, but \\"Get Fuzzy\\" does not offer any changes from \\"Garfield\\". So what would there be to fear? There are no changes from \\"Garfield\\" other than that it is drawn better. If people would really look at the strip they would see a rather mundane cartoon. Because this cartoon is so boring it must mean that any bad review would come from \\"jealous\\" people? That would mean that Darby Conley must have been green with jealousy that Jim Davis (the creator of Garfield) had a talking cat and a batchelor owner cartoon that he decided to create a knock-off, thus \\"Get Fuzzy\\" was born. I feel sorry for today's youth in that they were not around for great and original cartoons like \\"The Far Side\\" or \\"Calvin and Hobbes\\". I will still wait for the next great cartoon to come along, for from what I can see \\"Get Fuzzy\\" does not foot the bill. I would suggest buying something else from Amazon.com."},{"rating":"1","title":"Isn't This Just Garfield With Fancy Drawings?","review":"\\"It is far superior to 'Garfield'\\", \\"I'ts not really Garfield\\" etc. etc. What do you people mean that it is not Garfield. If it is not Garfield why does everyone have to mention Garfield in their reviews? Do you want to know why? Because all it is is Garfield in fancy packaging!! All it has are four main characters that say essentially the same thing every day. Where are the differences from day to day? This is an average strip at best. So the cat does things like your cat? Big Hairy Deal!! Or should I say \\"Big Hairy Catball Deal\\"? Look I made a reference to cats, now my reveiw has to be considered funny right? Or the dog Satchel is so sweet. Sweet is funny???

I paid for a DVD, what I got was a movie without any extras on a DVD-r that I could have recorded myself from any movie source. I collect films and as such was expecting a stamped DVD for my collection. DVD-r is a cheap way of getting top dollar from buyers with very little cost to the company, they don't last and are very easy to damage, in short, a rip-off the collector. Next time I will buy from a pirate, at least you know what you are getting and are not paying $20.00 plus dollars for a movie that a couple of years ago would have been released for around $10.00 on a long lasting stamped DVD. What a bunch of crooks. They whine everytime to the courts if student rips them off, but they figure it's fair game to rip-off consumers everyday. The movie companies are the biggest crooks in the American market."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great if you love this type of movie. I do!","review":"This is for the Blu-ray edition. Anyone who knows the movie doesn't have to be sold on this. If you have never seen it, read some of the other reviews. I do not know the quality of the DVD, but I can say the Blu-ray is great. Widescreen and nice Technicolor. I only had it on an old copy I recorded off of TV when it was shown on TCM.Eureka! has done a nice job on the transfer. I cannot say if it is better than a DVD copy, but as the cost is almost the same for both I decided to go with the Blu-ray.

I wanted the Foreman product [] because it advertised that is would hold a bigger bird - and I had trouble getting an 8 pound bird in my vertical rotisserie. After two separate attempts at roasting a 7-8 pound bird, I have decided this rotisserie is not worth using. The biggest problem was that you MUST tie up your bird so that the wings and legs don't flop over and start a fire on the heating elements. You must be very, very good at tying birds to keep the parts from working loose when the bird rotates. Gravity definitely works against you here. I decided to use the rotisserie simply for shish kabobs and cooking foods in the baskets; however, the kabob setup is very cumbersome and not worth the effort. I plan to purchase another vertical rotisserie. Better to buy compact birds than to learn how to rope tie a bird!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Rotisserie","review":"We did not like this at all, it seemed like it took for ever to cook a chicken.

I immediately looked at the areas that were problems on the competitor's machine and I can tell you the George Foreman machine is made to last. It is a much better built machine. I have cooked friers, tried air roasting vegetables in the large basket and my latest was to season a prime rib and rotisserie it. It was better than any prime rib I have had in any restaurant. The instructions were 18 minutes per pound and I was sceptical that it would be done but that is how long I cooked it and when I cut into it - it was PERFECT!!!

Does a good job with chicken too, but so does my oven and my oven doesn't put out nearly the heat that this GR82B puts out.Like most kitchen appliances, what you save in convienence, you lose in cleaning. It is easy to clean, but it does require a little extra time and effort to do a proper/sanitary cleanup.On the PLUS side, this GR82B seems to have better constructed parts than most of the other George Foreman appliances. In summary, the GR82B cooks great, cleanup is so so.... and the appliance should only be used during the winter (cold) months.UPDATE - Against my advice, spousal unit purchased one as gift for her niece (July 1st 2005).

The product is well designed - compact, easy to use and all parts fit together well. The food cooked in this rotisserie tastes better than the same food cooked in the traditional oven - it cooks more evenly and all of the fat is collected in the bottom tray. Actual cooking times are shorter than the times listed in the cookbook - a 3 1/2 lb leg of lamb took only about 2 hours. The rotisserie is easy to clean - almost all of the parts are removable and can be washed in a diswasher. I've given this product 4 stars because the skewers are not very easy to use and also some rust developed on the removable parts after washing. Also, it would be nice to have a lock for the front cover to ensure that the rotisserie is securely locked during operation."},{"rating":"1","title":"Small Birds Only","review":"This rotisserie will not actually do an average thirteen pound bird. In fact, it can not accomodate the average ten and a half pound bird, which is the first size I tried and ended up having to revert to my oven.

Within 3 months it builds up to the point that it prevents the locking tab from engaging, meaning you'll have the trimmer in the way 100% of the time - and all the washing/shaking in the world won't dislodge it; its disassembly time. 6 small screws and a couple of pieces that are pretty nasty to hold in place while reassembling."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great shave, wish it wasn't junk","review":"Here's how much I liked the shave from this shaver... I've returned two of them for exchange, and just gave up on my third one. The problem with each one has been the stoooooooopid pop-up trimmer, which must have a 1/2 cent piece of plastic to hold it down, because sure enough it doesn't. After a short time (weeks in one case, months in another, just outside of warranty in this one), the pop-up trimmer hold-down fails so the trimmer stays in the popped-up position. Either shave with it like that, or hold it down with your thumb, there's your choices. Or return it for repair, which is more of a hassle than it's worth.I originally bought Remington shavers because they were made in USA and I figured at least I was supporting American jobs, but since most or all of them are now made in China, there's no more impetus for me to do so. I'm now a Wahl customer (mostly still made in Sterling, IL!)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor quality","review":"Remington is no longer made in the USA and it shows. The 1st time I used it the screen ripped and it cut a gash in my face. Luckily I had an extra screen - and peroxide. I wrote to Remington who never replied. I've since used it over 1 year and found the screens weaken quickly. Also shortly after purchase the trimmer wouldn't retract. On the good side there is the shave itself which is close and comfortable and the charging is quick. However since the screen tore again (I saw it this time before shaving) I've decided to go for the Braun equivalent."},{"rating":"1","title":"MS3-1000 has same trimmer problem","review":"I have an MS3-1000.

Either way, for the money, it should be a good value. This shaver has the same 3 TCT \\"technology\\" and ALL THE SAME FEATURES but for less money. I have been using another Remington model for the past 5 years or so and it has performed very well for me. I lost my cord and decided I needed a new shaver, since stores and internet that I have seen, don't seem to sell the recharger cord only. My only complaint is that the microscreens tear if knocked around (by a small child or what ever). They will tear up your face if not replaced quickly. They are quite expensive to replace (Around $... if I recall @ Walgreens, but that also includes new, sharp replacement blades for the shaver. Who knows? Maybe they can be found for less on the web."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good shave but trimmer does not lock down","review":"I've used my MS3-2000 for almost 2 years now. The shave I received from it has always been quite good.The problem with the trimmer not locking down started happening to it within 3 months of use. I called customer service and they said to make sure you clean it well. This really means to use the brush and get in there to clean it.This resolved the trimmer not locking until about 3 months ago. Then it took brute force to make it lock down.Now it does not lock down whatsoever. I just bought a Norelco."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mediocre at best.","review":"Maybe a 2.5 but just barely. I needed a new electric for everyday quick morning shaves since I tend to have a five o clock shadow at 2pm. As others have said, I might as well just use a regular razor as it would be quicker and probably with less razor burn. Just to get the hair down reasonably low it takes forever. I don't expect an ultra close shave with electric but geez. On top of that, the cutters tend to let hair fly everywhere. Its back to Norelco for me as it least I don't have to clean the thing every bloody day.

There are fudumantal concepts left out like mains power, crossover setup, load in/load out/ recording, ect...

The problem was, once I used it, it cut less than half the hair, even after going over the same area of skin repeatedly. Experimenting with the 'hair length' settings made no difference.

However, I had no problem getting a good, smooth shave the first time, without any irritation whatsoever. My biggest disappointment was how long it took to get a smooth shave. You have to shave alot slower with the electric than with blades. I shave my legs every day, and with a blade I can finish in 5 minutes. The electric razor took 20 minutes! Unacceptable!!!

I read the directions carefully before using this product, and found that using it with warm water and shaving gel was optimal. I have had no problems with the charge running out and I find the unit easy to disassemble and to clean. There are three levels for shaving, depending on the length of hair- which is a very accommodating feature to have.

They are good on protecting powered devices and appliances. The negatives on them for me are the extra wire clutters and the continuous low power consumed (few watts).So when I have couple of situations that 1) do not really need surge protection, and 2) location not good to \\"dangle\\" a power strip, I bought couple of these as alternatives. They are really convenient to use, but outlets are tight where plugging in an AC (wall) adapter on the bottom will lose 1 other outlet, connecting to the top row and will lose two other outlets (one adjacent, and one below.All in all, it's best used in certain situations and definitely worth the little price!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Never has issues.","review":"Works well but the distance between the adjacent slots is too small to connect slightly larger plugs (like two lappy chargers) side by side"},{"rating":"2","title":"loved it","review":"I loved it.

Great!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Inexpensive, lacks surge protection but it has some uses","review":"We actually have a use for this as a temporary outlet multiplier, in the back of the house. Our 2-outlet plate is not sufficient whenever we organize a night pool party. We need the ability to plug in one or two coffee makers, a cheap boom box, a powered cooler. Under such circumstances we found this wall adapter as an acceptable solution. In the winter, it helps reduce some cable clutter in the front of the house for several strings of Christmas lights.It will fully cover a 2-outlet face, meaning that you gain 4 outlets.The major problem with this device is its lack of surge protection. It should be okay with appliances that are either resilient enough to be fully protected by the house's own circuit breakers, cheap enough not to be a major worry or don't include expensive electronics. Besides the uses that I mentioned I am thinking small kitchens, maybe basements.For anything else, I would invest a few extra dollars on a safer alternative."},{"rating":"2","title":"Almost perfect","review":"Pretty easy to install, and fits very tight so its not moving around like my usual wall outlets.

Unlike mockumentaries where the characters are larger than life, and situations are unrealistic, Kenny is quite the opposite. He is just an ordinary bloke, doing his job, and putting up with being the butt-end of people's ridicule. He never criticizes those who dish out abuse to him - where he could so easily. He is all parts real, and quite ordinary. His life, is real and ordinary. And yet, he is more than his job, and more than what people might think. The comedy is often subtle, with brilliant one-liners and a sure and steady wit. Viewers from overseas maybe hard-pressed to get many of the jokes on the first watch. Indeed, I was amused to hear his turn of phrase - so parochially Aussie - and I am Australian!

It's okay for most double griddle situations (it's really not a grill at all) such as ham steaks, flat fish and chops. It is faily easy to clean, and the savvy chef can use the drippings to use as a glaze or gravy. It is VERY FAST. I cooked a frozen sea bass filet (0.5 inch thick)in under six minutes. Most meat, fish and poultry have retained their moisture content. It is excellent for frozen hamburger patties.On the downside the heat and timer units are fairly clunky and the indicator labels wear off easily. It does not grill in the sense of the word, and therefore does not recreate the taste of a true barbecue. Think of it as a griddle, equal heat top and bottom, like a waffle iron."},{"rating":"2","title":"George Foreman Plus-Sized Grill","review":"Very convenient for cooking bacon (crispy with NO splatters). Burgers & steaks are tasty, although a different, not \\"outdoor grill\\", taste. Nice sized cooking area allows about 7 bacon strips, 2 medium sized steaks, 4 to 6 burgers. Dislikes: VERY loose lid (wobbles), no timer so difficult to tell when burgers are done. Rather messy clean-up (best done while grill is still warm). I wash with sponge & dishwashing liquid, and use LOTS of paper towels to wipe grill area, using drip trays to catch \\"run-off\\".. Also,the drip trays are not very heat tolerant, and peeled with first use (I would recommend hand washing, rather than using dishwasher, because of this). I still would recommend the grill for it's convenience of grilling indoors with less mess than conventional oven or frying pan (I'm purchasing another one for my parents)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wire Burn Out / Fire Hazard","review":"This item was purchased just 6 months ago.

The only thing that I didn't like about the functionality was the lack of heat control; the one-temperature fits all setting doesn't fit every kind of food. Thick foods were often charred on the outside and barely cooked on the inside. Fat/grease/juices would often follow the curve of the design rather than drip into the drip pan leaving the unit and counter rather nasty.

The only thing I have to say about the cleaning , is with that type of marinade it did burn and stick on the grill. I used a warm soapy dish cloth and it did come off pretty well.

I may have to let it grow out longer for it to work properly but I can't do that. It also doesn't get the short hairs at all.

My hair is soft and fine, so maybe that's why it does not work for me. When I use this product, I can see my hair breaks in the middle and does not get uprooted completely.

Unitill it touched my skin. The pain isn't to bad since your leg will go numb after a few minutes. But the BAD part is ...when you look at your legs it only cut not even 1/2 of your hairs!!!!!!!!!! So you endure PAIN and your legs aren't even smooth. AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH !! Don't WASTE YOUR MONEY. I'm sending mine back !!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Remington EP1000 Women's Smooth & Silky Hair Removal System","review":"I've always hated plucking because its so painful and you can only do one at a time. W/ this thingy, it was more pain, but more gain. I liked it and I would recommend it, but its def. not painless."},{"rating":"1","title":"All that glitters is not Gold!","review":"This product is better than other products of the same line. And the 24 carat gold feature is good and makes it more durable, but I think razor and wax are the painless option and come cheap. It pulls the hair out which makes the whole process painful especially imagine at the places like bikini lines etc. But since the gold is the metal that gives that antibiotic feature with it I think its a good. And if you are brave enough than I think pricing is very good at amazon.com. It does give you a good smooth legs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ouch.","review":"As one who could definitely use to shave every day, but naturally wishes for an easier solution, I was excited finally to purchase an epilator. When it arrived, I immediately plugged it in and went away at my lower calves. The excitement died down quickly as the pain of needles digging through my flesh overcame me. I managed a tiny area on my calf, a bit on my knee, and a spot on my bikini line. Interestingly enough, the bikini line hurt the least. Anyway, my trusty razor was back out the next morning, and this little gizmo is back in the box. I didn't think I had a low tolerance for pain, but perhaps you will have better luck with it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Good product","review":"This is my first Epilator. I like it and its very easy to learn how to use it with a little bit of practice. Sometimes if you are not careful enough to stretch your skin a little while using it in areas where your skin might fold a little eg knee joint , under arms etc., you might end up getting your skin caught in its gold plated discs. But if used carefully , its an excellent product which removes very small hair also. I am very satisfied with my overall experience with this Remington product."},{"rating":"2","title":"easy to use","review":"This product is extremely efficient and easy to use. It gets more hair than waxing, even baby fine ones. I was surprised at how little it hurt when I first started using it, but there are certain areas that hurt more than others. I had no problem with the bikini line, but around the bone in the front of my leg stung a little, and my knees were a little hard to navigate. In flabby thigh areas I recommend pulling the skin kind of taut because I experienced a \\"fat pinch\\" lol. I especially like it for the back of my thighs because the hair grows in so many different directions that shaving and waxing have been time consuming and not as effective. This product is great and leaves legs silky without a mess, and the stinging lessens as you get used to it. If your pain threshold is high or especially if you are already used to waxing, go ahead and try this and you can use it while you watch tv or something."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as great as I hoped it would be...","review":"After reading all the wonderful comments about the Remington EP1000, I thought I'd give it a try. I followed the advice from past users and found that it did take most of my hair out! I loved that part of it. However, after a few days, when my hair started to grow back, I found a lot of ingrown hairs on my legs. I tried using it again, but found more ingrown hairs than before. Now, the Remington EP1000 is sitting in my closet and I have gone back to shaving..."},{"rating":"1","title":"worked great for a few months","review":"I had bought this Item and was verry happy at first. Yes there was some pain but to be expected.. Come on it pulls the hairs out by the root. How ever the thing that maid me upset is it lasted about 6 months total and the gears went out in it. I sent it back and they sent me a new one I only had to pay the shipping but the next one lasted about the same lenght of time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Forget razors forever","review":"I have never had such a great time doing my legs.Ok I know how odd it sounds,but I think of the many cuts from shaving andred blotches from waxing I acquired over many years.I still have those lovely white areas to prove it.:( I recommend thisproduct highly.Please try,it's worth every penny.:)Remmingtonalways comes out with the very best products!:)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Would definitely reccomend","review":"This product is definitely worth the money. It provides a great alternative to shaving, using creams or waxing. I spent some time on Amazon looking for it before I bought it, and I am glad I did. Some cousins and aunts have turned to it because they saw me using it at recent family gathering. It has been working pretty smoothly, and it doesnt seem to be cheaply made. A warning though, do not use it for your face! Especially if you have done your legs on it a few times. You know what I mean!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best shaver I've ever tried","review":"I really like this shaver. I haved tried many, many different kinds and I think I have finally found the one that works for me. I have used cream hair removers, but they never seem to work how they advertise. After using this shaver my legs are smooth and it last a long time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not happy","review":"I am very familiar and have used hair removal systems for many years. I was not happy with this system. It was by far the worst unit I have ever used. It grabed and pinched my skin leaving large welts. It happened when I least expected it. It would go along smooth and then grab and pinch without warning. I would never buy again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Impressive for the price","review":"I was expecting the epliator to be really painful when I first got it. But I was pleasantly suprised to find out that it wasn't too bad. It hurt more on my legs but the hair is also finer since I don't need to shave my legs. I used for my underarms and it worked pretty well once I got the angles right. The only thing about it is that it broke off some of the finer hairs. And it makes a fairly loud and slightly scary noise. I think it's best for coarse hairs."},{"rating":"1","title":"item returned","review":"I was really excited when I purchased this item, as it is so difficult to find this kind of hair remover in stores (anyone knows a place where to find it except online?). But the first use is going to be the only one and the last one, as I was very disappointed by the performances of this system. It had difficulties to grab hair, even long hair, and I had to go over the same area several times (not just a couple of times), which is not good for skin irritation! And now that the hair is growing back, I'm even more disappointed, as many grow back under the skin or even form an irritation/spot.I have used many electrical hair removers and this is the first one to give such disappointing results! Sorry, but I'm sending it back."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ouch","review":"This is not the best but it does take some hair off, however i couldn't get over the pain long enough to actually find use out of it. I have mildly sensitive skin and it left little red blotches and bubbles on my skin. Don't buy if your skin is the least bit sensitive or if you have a low tolerance for pain."},{"rating":"1","title":"if you like pain, you'll love this product!","review":"wow, the first and only time i used this on my legs, i was surprised by how much it hurt! i would rather have a brazilian wax job!! i attempted the under arm and i must emphasize ATTEMPTED!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad Epilator","review":"Please dont go for this...it hurts like HELL...and my skin was burning/itching for a long time where it plucked my hair...Epilators are supposed to be smooth...feel waxing is much better as it removes all the hair at once atleast...!!

If you are a hard core Shumanski fan, you might watch it twice."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good Nudity, But Little Else Worth Mentioning","review":"Blackmail Boys is a gay-themed drama in which we get to see every inch of the three main actors, including erections. But, unfortunately, that is the only thing that could possibly make this movie of any interest. The script, acting, and direction are pretty dull. The pace is very slow, yet the film is only 67 minutes. That is not good. I'd say that this is worth seeing only for those that want to see some male nudity from \\"average\\" guys."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointment","review":"I had been forewarned, but I had to see it for myself. There was an interesting plot here, but the movie has a \\"homemade\\" video feel to it that is part of the plot. There should have been consequences here, but the makers of the movie went for a happily ever after style. The plot wasn't logical. The characters aren't likeable, just plain. For a movie that showed us about doing wrong, it chose to tell us what they did right at the end. I was so disappointed with the movie that had I been a producer of this movie, I would have worked in an ending that included everyone dying. That is how bad this movie is, just plain awful."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible.","review":"The plot sounded interesting... The movie itself is just terrible. Lowest video quality, the story has entirely too many holes in it, doesn't make sense half the time. Takes more than half of the movie to actually get to the point...

I give Saosin credit for so quickly compiling this disk right after Cove joined up. This is easilly enough material to hold us over until the full length comes out. Come on people! It's an EP! It's not supposed to be awesome anyway.Saosin has already established two new songs with Cove that are featured on this disk. (although the new track Uphill Battle is not)If you don't like bury your head then that's just sad. It may not have that perfect old saosin sound you all like but it comes pretty frickin close plus it's better than some of the old stuff IMO. The acoustic VER. is also pretty cool and a nice bonus. The revamped version of No Angel is also on here and it rocks pretty sick. It's a lot different then the old one. If for no other reason buy it for the live track. Any fan of Anythony green Saosin will want to have Lost Symphonies just because it's one of their best songs.So seriously, go buy this on ebay or something... now"},{"rating":"2","title":"Oh so good","review":"Whichever clowns are saying that Saosin are not talented are wrong. Saosin is full of great melodies, vocals, amazing guitar riffs, and offbeat drum parts that make songs better than you could imagine. Those that say that drums are not to the beat need to realize that they do that purposely to make their music more intricate. Definitely a band worth listening to. Listen to Circa Survive too."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth buying","review":"i won't lie, i never listen to this cd. if you're a sao fan you've heard all these songs before. the only reason i bought it was to have the better version of 'bury your head' i don't like illegal downloading. i'm also a collector so i had to have it.::sigh:: saosin used to be so good...but hey this was my first purchase with Amazon and i loved it! i will totally buy from Amazon again! came fast and in this neat lil package!so sao's dark ep not worth buyingbut buying from Amazon is!"},{"rating":"1","title":"This EP = Horrible","review":"Do not under any circumstances by this EP.

What a shame."},{"rating":"1","title":"Saosin was a good band..","review":"Saosin was a great band until Anthony left, Cove joined and signed to Capitol. This EP lacks the energy the first EP had. The songs sound generic and aren't worth a second listen. GG Saosin for signing with a major label and turning into a steaming pile of feces. This EP doesn't even deserve one star. Don't waste your money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Execellent Resource","review":"This is an excellent resource that will help you understand and review several concepts in the PMBOK Guide. The only problem is that the answers provide quotes from the PMBOK Guide and no explanations.

It is the one book that I come back to, year after year, when I have some free time at the beach or while on vacation. Ms. Vale-Allen's attention to detail in describing the world of Beatrice Crane is outstanding. Even though I've read this book countless times, I still take pleasure in re-visiting the characters and their relationships. It's a great work of fiction with life lessons embedded throughout the story. If you want to escape into a world of spotlights and glamor, and learn something on the way, please pick up this book. You will not regret it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice looking case to match the P200","review":"The case itself is well made. It has enough padding without making the case look bulky. My P200 fits perfect. The external mesh pocket fits a spare battery and a memory stick. The case comes with a long strap that is meant to be attached directly to the camera. I already have the shorter strap that came with the camera attached to it. I thought this longer strap could be attached to the hook so I can wear the camera case on my neck or shoulder. The hook is meant to be attached only to a rucksack or bag, not the long strap. The velcro is secure enough to keep the camera inside if you wanted to hold the camera by the strap. Overall, I would recommend this case. I gave it only 4 stars because I had no use for the long strap."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great case for P200","review":"Bought this case so we could carry the P200 without having to worry about scratches, etc. P200 fits perfectly and the pocket in front holds the extra battery like a charm!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Purchase","review":"I love listening to the songs on this CD.

Please leave the acting to someone else."},{"rating":"2","title":"Characters caught in a noir world","review":"The short story is a great form for Woolrich -- he deftly illustrates the trajectory of characters caught in a noir world in streamlined, hard-boiled prose. There are no Raymond Chandler-esque prose stylings here: Woolrich's style is closer to Dashiell Hammett's lean style. The title story, originally published as written by William Irish (a frequent Woolrich pseudonym), has grown famous thanks to the Hitchcock film starring Jimmy Stewart. Well-written, it varies only slightly from the film, and Woolrich's clean style lets the reader easily see how Hollywood was attracted to Woolrich's stories as launch pads for movies. But \\"Rear Window,\\" while good, isn't really the best tale in this collection. The others better typify Woolrich's work -- inexplicable events made believable and inevitable in a noirish, claustrophobic world. This collection is a good introduction to any reader new to Woolrich."},{"rating":"1","title":"An awful mess 60s Pop with 50's do wop beat","review":"What a great collections of songs, the originals with a pulsating hip 60's beat. But these interpretations are as bad as can be, the arranger mixed genres with no sense of camp or ear and presented them to a 50's do wop beat that sucks the life out of these other wise fun songs. It's a real miss. Yes, there are a few comic gems like the James Bond Theme, but just download that and skip this disc. The original songs are much better and these girls don't add to them, they just wreck them. Too bad, it seemed like a great concept. Just the wrong wrong wrong people incharge of putting the music together."},{"rating":"1","title":"60's collection, not a musical","review":"I understand that the most recent thing is to take groups of one band or artist's songs and make a musical (Movin' Out; Taboo; Mamma Mia) but this takes a small group of songs from the 60's and makes a musical. Maybe if you saw the show it would make more sense, but the CD gives nothing as to the plot, or characters. This is not a Broadway CD, it's a 60's Ballad CD. Don't get me wrong, the voices and music are great, but to be advertised as anything resembling a musical is just plain wrong. Musical Theater collectors can pass on this one (that is the first time I've ever said that) it shouldn't be part of a musical collection. But if you like the golden oldies by all means get this one. I didn't give this CD two stars because it's bad, it is just advertised wrong and shouldn't be here.

I was planning on using this in my elementary art room, but those details are going to ruin the fun, knowing they will be pointed out immediately. I am not returning the book because of the great story and the other fun illustrations, I am just going to have to get creative on covering up Klimt's models with attaching paper clothes.

Further, so much of this story is unbelievable, no real connections are made between Isobel and certain characters, and the end is thus a totally ridiculous surprise. I was very disappointed by this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"As bland as Zelda's novels","review":"There isn't much to this novel. I found myself skipping pages just so the story would advance.

I've searched the web and stores and can't find anyone who sells just accessories for this groomer.Even after e-mailing Remington to ask where I can get replacements, they never responded.

HOWEVER, if all you put is 6 ice cubes, the ice-crushing is unsuccessful. In 5 seconds, the ice freezes suspended above the blender blades. Liquid will be needed, which is in fact what a smoothie asks for (1/2 cup to 1-1/2 cup milk). The milk with the ice cubes will allow this blender's stainless steel blades and the waveaction to get the job done. The rest of the yogurt-ingredients(e.g. 1-1/2-cup frozen blueberries, yogurt, protein mix, banana) gets processed without difficulty as a smooth smoothie gets prepared.[NOTE: I'm curious what the 700-watt waveaction blender does --- but they have plastic containers while this one has the all-glass container which I prefer.]"},{"rating":"2","title":"WOW!!!","review":"The reason I purchased this blender was because I wanted to match it with the red stand-up mixer I have.

So when I found this on Amazon I was so glad that the price was right for this red blender. Once I received it I then put it on my kitchen counter and all I can say is \\"Wow, what an impressive looking blender!\\"For all my positives about this blender my only negative is that it doesn't blend ice very well. When I made a smoothie which requires for the ice to be blended I noticed that there was still some small ice chips. Other than this the rest of the ingredients of my smoothie were blended well.

Very portable and quick to set up and take down. Great for cooking smaller items--mushrooms, chopped veggies on the right side griddle.Minuses: after two summers, the surfaces are losing the teflon coating especially in the center \\"high usage\\" area. Hard to keep level so grease drains properly--the little levelers don't stay put very well on hard surfaces, sliding out. The heating gauge is useless--mine never gets more than a bit beyond \\"warm.\\"I sometimes miss the smoky flavor of charcoal--though not as much as you would think--well cooked meat has great flavor!All in all, the plusses far outweigh the minuses.

Bottom line, My Grill to go is now useless because I can't replace the TEFLON grill surfaces that are damaged.

The meat items all cooked in a reasonable amount of time, I didn't have to be concerned about flare-ups, and the taste was wonderful. Also, the meat was juicy. The clean-up was even nicer. After cooking, I removed the grids and sprayed them off with the hose, wiped all other surfaces clean, and then folded for storage. I would definitely would give this grill a thumbs up!

This summer, the same thing is happening, only now they're telling me (at CharBroil.com's customer service line) that they won't replace the grate because the grill is out of warranty. Never mind that the grate is only a year old, they were surly, rude, and generally abusive both times I called. They should be ashamed to be producing and selling such a cheap and horrible product.

Turned out to be a very pleasant surprise. Only 291 pages, the plot develops quickly and the action is brisk. Fairly straight-forward plot without extraneous characters or confusing tangents. Enjoyable enough to finish in a sitting or two.Turn back the calendar to 1963 where retired CIA agent Jack Teller is asked to come out of retirement to make contact with an East Germany agent. Curiously, the East German agent will only give his information to Jack Teller. The \\"why\\" is a mystery at first. But the information passed pertains to a vague plot to assassinate President Kennedy while on his scheduled trip to West Berlin. Is this plot real? Who is behind it? How will it work? And why was Jack Teller the sole conduit for this information? All of this is unveiled in this well-crafted and crisp espionage thriller.

The book is only a 150 pages on a large font, you'll read it in a day.The book makes also oversimplification of the phenomena involved. Eg it describes the sail with the grade school anecdote 'air travels a longer distance leeward to the sail, thus creating lower pressure'. While that might explain part of the physics involved, my sailmaker seems to have way better models...If just want a quick read on physics involved, this is your book.

This is just silly, and the idea that these men couldn't tell they were with soldiers from the other side?

With what little they had...they done an AWESOME job with the most accurate battle scenes and uniforms that have came outta the Civil War era of films. EVER!!

It died after a month. I returned it thinking, \\"It couldn't happen twice.\\" Then the second one died. Both deaths occurred during cooking after about 10 uses.I called the customer service people at Salton, and they said it was probably a bad batch. They sent me a new one by mail. That one died after about a month.I called the customer service people again today, and they are sending me a different model.The older version of this model worked for me for 8 years.

He held us in good stead over the years, only stuck when I added sweet stuff like Mirin to the mix and a nice soaking always fixed that problem.

If it hadn't quit working for no reason, I'd be quite pleased with it.However, as it stands, I wouldn't recommend this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful product even when functioning","review":"My cooker has never had any electrical problems, but it may as well since I'll never use it again. The directions were inaccurate, it spewed liquid rice out the top in every direction, and it badly burned the rice anywhere it touched the bottom or sides of the pot. Worse, the pot became badly scratched after I repeatedly had to chisel burnt rice-crust off of it, and after awhile the rice began to have a metallic aftertaste. I would not buy this product again at any price."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheap and messy","review":"I owned this rice cooker for less than a year before it stopped working. Even when it was in working order, the rice stuck to the bottom & burned, and fluid overflowed through the top causing quite a mess each time. Definitely not worth the price even though its one of the cheaper models available."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't bother","review":"Because of the high heating element tempature the water bubbles up at a terrible rate and pushes water bubbles through the small steam hole in lid. This means the rice cooker and anything near by get a starch coating which means clean up is a real pain. It always over cooks the rice at the bottom and it all sticks. Have to soak the pot to get it clean. Now shopping for a much better machine for this one left a bad taste in our mouth regards using a rice cooker."},{"rating":"1","title":"Defective.

Its in perfect shape...can't even tell its used cuz it barely was before it broke. It's lucky that the minimum is 1 star. Then again that's just my personal experience, I'm sure other people's will work longer. As far as the cooking goes, cooks really unevenly and sticks to the bottom like glue. Defintely go with one of the newer non-stick coated designs if you want to be able to wash it without soaking in water for half a day."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not even worth 10$","review":"The rice cooker boiled over, cooked unevenly and burnt in spots.

It makes wonderful rice and has worked well for us over the last 4 weeks. The only problem I have with the cooker is the handle is a plastic knobby with a bolt through a hole in the glass... the plastic knob is becoming stripped and now comes loose during cleaning. The handle has to be readjusted (after collecting all the parts from the bottom of the washer) everytime we make our rice... and we have used it almost daily since christmas.Other than the bad design of the lid though, I like this cooker. It makes perfect rice and the pot cleans up with very little effort.I will need to get a new cooker soon, and it won't be a Salton unless the lid design changes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic","review":"I purchased this rice cooker in 1996 and use it at least twice a month. I've cooked all types of rice in it and it always comes out perfect (just a little more water for brown rice). It doesn't have a non-stick finish but if you leave the top on for five minutes after it turns off, the rice at the bottom softens, and when you are finished, soaking the dried rice for 30 minutes will let you clean it just fine. I also put the rice pan in the dishwasher. I will never spend more money on a rice cooker."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ready Rice! NOT!!!","review":"UPDATE: Take back anything good I said about this item. It shorted out (almost had a wire fire) in under a year - I should've returned it but just tossed it instead. DON'T BUY IT!!!I bought the Salton 3-cup rice cooker over the negative reviews of several people. However, with a little tweaking, it does what I want it to do perfectly! The criticism that rice sticks to the bottom happened only one time. After that,I started to add a bit (a TBS or 2) more water than the book recommends, and sometimes I put a tiny drop of oil on the bottom & spread it around w. paper towel or fingertip. No more sticking! The criticism that it boils over? ONCE that happened to me, & that was when I tried to cook Trader Joe's Harvest Blend multi-grains & pasta in it. This cooker does brown rice and quinoa for me with no problems. We're just 2 people & the bigger, fancier ones were not for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor design.

Mine lasted a long time, but you can't make over 2 cups of rice. If you go for the full pot, it will bubble over and you'll be cleaning your kitchen again. Another thing is, it slightly browns on the bottom with one cup. 2 or more cups, and it practically burns on the bottom.

I replaced the rice cooker with another one, which behaved the same way. So now I'm cooking rice on the stovetop, because it's less messy and requires less cleaning. I'm looking for a better quality rice cooker that will steam vegetables while cooking the rice, thereby saving electricity (and pollution)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unreliable -- it broke after I used it 5 or 6 times","review":"The machine cooked rice just fine at first, but then it broke after I'd only used it five or six times.

It won't stay on \\"cook,\\" keeps switching to the \\"warm\\" function, and now, when the unit is on, it makes a horrible smell, almost like burnt plastic. We babied this machine by only hand washing it, and always storing it properly but it still gave out. The rice it put out was decent. Never burned. Hard to make the Persian Tadik (spelling?) with the aluminum body, my next one will be non-stick.

The color is a little different (our rice cooker is all white), but Salton makes a really good product. We've made jasmine or brown rice at least once a week for the past 8 years and it's still going strong. Simply toss in the rice and the water and press down the button. When the button pops the rice is done. It's that easy. We lost the scoop and measuring cup a long time ago, but I can guarantee when this Salton stops working we're going to replace it with another one. We looked at fancier models and decided the bells and whistles are for people who don't actually know how to cook vegetables.

In exchange for poorly steamed rice, I found my counter, everything on it, and the floor in front of it splattered with starchy rice water (which is nearly impossible to clean when dried). Instead of returning the cooker, I (stupidly) got another one with the notion that I just got a bad unit -- surely they all couldn't be designed this poorly. They are. The second cooker sprays starchy rice water everywhere too. Now I am steaming rice with this thing spraying rice water in the sink until the replacement arrives -- and you can be assured my next cooker won't be a Salton.

Then, I took it out to use it and it just never turned on. I see now that other reviews mention this problem as well. It has a 1 year warentee, but I would have to ship it back to get it fixex/replaced, and that cost would be more than what I paid for it, so I just never did.

Or learn to cook rice the old fashioned way, which is what I'm doing right now because the piece of junk just broke down on me.Update: These rice cookers are repairable. I still highly recommend that you don't buy one, but if you're stuck with one and getting a replacement or a refund is too much hassle, getting it repaired might make sense.

I know nothing about the Digimon universe or any of the characters, but it was a very fun and simple. The controls were easy to master as well as the special moves all the little Digimon characters can do.If your kid likes playing video games and you want to play them with him this is a great game to pickup. The only bad part was for, at 31 years old, getting 'sea sickness' after playing for more than a hour.The only downside was no cooperative play and it was...well, like the name says a big rumble arena. No fault of the game design that's just my personal preference when playing with my son.Bottomline, if you are looking for a game to play with your kid then might want to check this out. I'd also recommend the Lego Star Wars (which has cooperative) for some more father/son entertainment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Could be better","review":"I bought this book for a class I was taking. It's not a bad book however, if you have any experience with IPA or other phonics ... it's confusing. The reviews at the end of the chapter are tedious & repeat as you get further along.

The only flaw of this watch is that the zaphire cristal has not have antireflex treatment, so when you face the watch directly to an artificial source of light, it is reflected in the cristal, bothering you.

The watch was delivered to me in perfect manufacture condition and packaging. It is grey market since I didn't purchase it from an authorized dealer but it is the same high quality at a fraction of the cost. There are two things I will comment on, 1) the face is not as light blue looking as the picture, it is much more of a darker blue (which is a good thing), 2) Sizing the bracelet is not easy for a common jeweler. The pins are very tight (which is a good sign of precision). I would recommend taking it to an authorized dealer to size even though they may scoff at you for buying a grey market watch (that's their problem). If you want a TAG and want to pay less I recommend this item."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just one 'cute' song ; disappointing","review":"Whereas the book is absolutely amazing, the CD is not. (The book is on par with Mountains Beyond Mountains -- also must-read -- by Tracy Kidder, about Dr Paul Farmer.) This CD, however, was disappointingly short. There's just one song on it. I was hoping for a bit of music from the region featured in the book, but what you get is one song of kids music. Great for kids, but the price tag is disproportionate to the content.

I suppose its because he does most of his thinking with that part of his male anatomy that has neither a brain nor sensibility.I hope that in the five years since the book was written he has grown up, made some decisions about the direction he wants to go, and commitments to stand by his beliefs. If not, I'm sorry for the women, black and white, that come into his life.

A perfect example of this is when Manne completes the drum roll on his solo, Rollins duplicates this on his sax--pure alchemy!!

Chapters correspond to different subjects, such as military (administration, recruitment, army size...), church (church-state relations, the deep integration between the 2 spheres), economy, and so on. The first few chapters function as a brief narrative history, although within the thematic arrangement, the author skips about considerably. Each topic is intended to buttress Barbero's convincing argument that Charlemagne's rule was fundamental to all of European history that followed. Unlike Ozymandias disappearing into the depths of history, Charlemagne's works endure to this day.The book is well-written and well-researched. Within the second or third chapters, either the translation or the original wording was awkward, but it did not affect the overall conveyance of the subject matter."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not What I Was Expecting","review":"There was a Twilight Zone episode called How to Serve Man.

O'Malley--whose absurdly Irished-up name is intended to wrap the green vowels 'round his obvious loathing for all things Irish--is only a servile, native auxiliary.Irish Uncle Toms have never been difficult to find, and for obvious reasons they have no difficulty finding publishers. But even in their grimy company, this would-be author (who's never produced another book, having expended all his venom on this one) stands out as a perfect metonymy for the cruelty, self-serving, and above all the sheer stupidity of the rightwing pseuds of the Reagan/Thatcher era."},{"rating":"1","title":"What is this bulb???","review":"How is anyone supposed to know what this item is?

The first thing I noticed is that the face is not really white - as the picture indicates. It's more silver, which I think looks a bit nicer. Given that the watch's movement is quartz, I was less worried about its functions and timekeeping ability. That said, I have checked it against the atomic clock and in one week, it's one second fast. So, it should pick up one minute a year...which is effectively perfect. The documentation indicates the battery will need to be replaced every 18 months, which I'll use as an opportunity to have my jeweler give it a once over. i wear this watch every day and am not gentle with it - already in a week, it's hit several doorways and corners.

What he did not explain is that the word Barbarian meant in Latin, at that time, was foreigner. The meaning we now give to this word is modern.2.

Too often we concede the field without a fight when accused of perpetuating an ignorant Dark Age that held sway until the \\"enlightenment\\" of the secular \\"Age of Reason.\\" This book presents an easy to read overview of how the Church preserved knowledge following the destruction of the Empire at the hands of the Barbarians, and then proceeded to build upon that knowledge through the High Middle Ages, ultimately setting the stage for the birth of the Scientific Method. The text contains numerous citations for the inquiring mind that wants more detail about any particular passage.

Now I am just thrilled so many reviewers find this book worthy of 4 or 5 stars but for us it is laughable! Written by a lady long dead (probably from her diet) it seems to invoke some bizarre cult-like, pseudo-science nonsense God. It is just the pits! For the steep price you get a thin book with LARGE printing. Very few pages are devoted to talking about the diseases she claims to be able to help. Most of the book is a recipe-a-page of some of the most revolting tripe ever thought up. This woman is more \\"Vicious\\" than any disease she claims to address. A complete waste of money and paper. The only reason it may help others is because of the placebo effect or buyer's remorse: buyer's just want these \\"recipes\\" to work. Horrible and amateurish junk.

The book is clearly written, easy to understand and easy to reference. The diet itself is a miracle. I started the SCD in July 2005 and currently have no symptoms of Crohn's Disease. I feel great. It is a bit hard to comply with the diet which, among other things, eliminates wheat, starch, most dairy products, complex carbohydrates. But complying with the diet is a wonderful trade off for eliminating the symptoms of Crohn's. I recommend the book and highly recommend the diet.

I have spent so many hours in so many books over the last two years I feel like I have been to UC college. It never seases to amaze me how corrupted our food supply is with sugar and additives (both of which set my son off). Just try and buy food without them. Even the salt we used had sugar.

About one half of what the diet demands is OK the rest is NOT. The idea that ANY spice is OK, totally dumb. I avoid spicy stuff, if I don't I pay the price. Also I avoid all salads with raw leafy vegetables or raw carrots and cabbage, the book says those are OK, not for me! With total discipline on diet but without eliminating sugars or carbs I do well without meds.In short the book goes overboard on things that make no sense to me.

My wrist has never never gotten tired during one of my trimming marathons. I would prefer it was available in designer colors, but don't let that stop you from buying it. Happy trimming!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fairly effective","review":"I purchased my trimmer several months ago. I wasn't happy with it at 1st but I gave it some time. I didn't think that it was cutting anything the 1st time I used it but by the 2nd or 3rd use, I changed my opinion.This thing actually does a pretty good job of trimming nose/ear hair and it's so-so on the private hairs. I still use my electric razor to finish off the nose hairs that this unit can't cut - it's usually the tiny, coarse hairs that's close to the skin.Some people didn't like their trimmer and I can understand why. It's not something that you want to drop. I clean it under water all the time and it has never malfunctioned like another user stated. The cut hairs remain in the nostril so you can see that it does it's job fairly well when you use a tissue."},{"rating":"1","title":"Does not work with water!","review":"Although it says its a wet/dry device, it is NOT!

However, as a device the NE-3 is not particularly sturdy: after a year's use, and maybe most the life of the battery, the on-off switch ceased to function. For a while I could get it to run by pressing the on/off switch into the trimmer case, but now even that's stopped working.If you're willing to pay $8 for a razor that will likely break after a year's use then this is an outstanding razor to get; if you want one that will last you, then--like me--begin to look elsewhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"Please don't buy this!","review":"I bought this trimmer two years ago. It's not that it doesn't work but it's just a pain in the neck. The on/off switch keeps falling off. Sometimes it just makes too much noise but hardly trims, and it consumes batteries too fast.

The seating depends on some 4 mm tabs to hold the rotor assembly in place over the rest of the unit (which houses the motor). These tabs have a tendency to snap off, which means that you have to either 1) hold the assembly in place with a spare finger or your other hand, which severely limits mobility 2) try to rig something to hold it in place, or 3) replace the unit.Either way, the inconvenience and annoyance is completely avoidable if you steer clear of this poorly designed product and purchase something with better design and construction, even if slightly more expensive: this product is a perfect example of the \\"penny-wise, Pound-foolish\\" aphorism."},{"rating":"1","title":"Like the Epi-Lady for the Nose, Don't Waste Your Money","review":"I've had other nose trimmers, all of them have sucked for one reason or another, mostly their blades would fall out of some other mechanical function would fail, but I've never had one that was as unpleasant to use as this one.

The book is broken into sections and outlines where to begin and end each day. A short amount of reading is required, just a few pages each day. The object is that you can complete the bible in the prescribed time and understand what you have read. If you skip a day or a few days, no problem, just pick right up where you left off. The benefits of reading the Bible are overwhelming and before you know, you're finished."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must have for all those desiring to get closer to God.","review":"Listen, there is nothing better in the world than knowing God. Further, there is no better book than the Bible. It certainly may seem challenging to read the entire Bible in 90 days, but the truth is, you get so much more out of it when you know the whole story as if reading a book. If you take too long to read the Bible, you will forget most of it by the time you draw near the end of Revelation. Another HUGE bonus is that the print in this text is awesome. It is large print, which makes it easy to sit and read for long periods of time. Honestly, though, it usually only takes about 45-60 minutes to read each scheduled reading.

You can choose which books of the Bible to read or include the entire Bible. You also choose which days of the week that you will read. And, you then choose a start and stop date. From this information, a personal reading plan is generated. It is very flexible, and I have used this, in the past, to create a 90 day read through the Bible plan. With this program, you choose how long you will take to read through the Bible. And the output has a very good verse balance! In other words, it will not cut you off mid verse, and you will be reading roughly the same amount of text each day. The plan can also be printed out.

It's a standard NIV Bible with nothing special about it, other than it containing a reading plan. The idea is to read through the Bible in 90 days, and I assumed that something about the Bible was special to help facilitate that goal. I was wrong. The only thing that made this Bible different than any of the other NIV copies on my shelf, was that the beginning and end of each day's reading was marked at the top of the page.Do yourself a favor and save the $13.

Amazon's way of fixing it is to send a hole new pump set out and remove everything that I got installed and replace with new pump. Package all the old/bad items up and return. It sounds simple but with all the rain we have been getting around here it is very hard to remove and install a new pump when the water is filling up faster then you can do all of the work. The control box can be simply changed out without removing everything.

What I once regarded as soulful singing has now degenerated into a whining mess of a voice. What happened to the Crystal I once knew and loved?

Only the section on \\"Music\\" was weak, lacking the rigor found elsewhere in this terrific volume."},{"rating":"1","title":"Scruton the Apologist","review":"Roger Scruton is a polemical kind of philosopher, in many ways similar in style to John Searle. When Scruton does philosophy, it's a joy to read.But as others have complained, the philosophy in this book is a frame for Scruton to do Christian apologetics. If that's what one wants, it's not a bad book. Personally, Scruton's Christianity doesn't have much appeal for me. And the philosophical issues can get sidelined.If you're really interested in philosophy, Scruton's \\"Modern Philosophy\\" is a better place to look. No Christian apologetics, just philosophy. It's both an introduction and survey with Scruton's usual acerbic comments. Personally, the work is directed more toward intermediate philosophy readers than naive ones. But as a general introduction and survey, Scruton does himself very well.For a basic and broader introduction to philosophy, Robert Solomon's \\"Introducing Philosophy\\" with original texts and commentary is certainly to be preferred, but the price is outrageous."},{"rating":"1","title":"angelo alright","review":"I read this book for the first time when I had been studying philosphy for about six months. at the time I liked it, with my limited knowledge of the subject. rereading it now Im not so sure. Ok, Scruton writes good, and has a lot of points to make, and I agree on many of them. What annoys me greatly, and not just about Scruton, but also with very many of the anglo-american philosophers are their understanding of so-called continental philosophy. His short account of Foucault in this book shows almost no understanding at all of Foucaults ideas. Its plain dumb, like many other \\"anglo-american\\" readings of \\"continental\\" philosophy. spare me the self-referentially inconsistent arguments...sorry the outburst but its way off the point that Foucault, Derrida and others are trying to make.To get back to the book, I still think its ok in many ways, but it needs to be read along with another book as counterpoint."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good enough for some.","review":"Other reviewers have done admirable jobs of reviewing this book. I offer only a few random quotes from it. (1) \\"I refer here and there to the great philosophers, and in particular to Kant and Wittgenstein, who have been the most important influences on my thinking.\\" (2) \\"The judgement is not fair: none of Nietzsche's are.\\" (3) \\"All discourse and dialogue depend upon the concept of truth.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Utterly forgettable","review":"Rather than try and be objective and original, Mr Scruton delivers a tired and re-hashed right wing view of this schoolboy attempt to give an intelligent [sic] guide to his rantings.

I like a little excitement when cooking, but this was a bit much."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great concept, terrible recipies","review":"If you like everything you eat to be drowned in lemon juice and lemon zest, and you consider a potato something rare and precious that you only eat 2 or 3 times a year, you will like these recipies. Better not have any picky eaters at your table.As another reviewer pointed out, the weeknight recipies are not assemble and heat, but quite a bit of cooking using a very small amount of leftover food from the Sunday dinner.In short, don't waste your money on this book. I wish I'd thought to come here and read reviews before buying this book on impulse."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful Book","review":"After long reflection, I am convinced that this book is the most finely crafted piece of teaching I have ever encountered. If you have hard interest in relativity, spacetime, cosmology, but lack facility with mathematics more advanced than calculus and linear algebra, Callahan will lead you into a deeper understanding of the mathematics than you would have believed possible."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for learning how to actually use the math behind GR","review":"This book is great for teaching the math behind GR using excellent examples from Math and Physics problems (for another great problem solver see also Schaum's Outline of Tensor Calculus, but this has less Physics). It is a bit long winded, spending alot of time on SR and in some place just over the top (for Physicists!), but once through it there should be no problem going to the more advanced texts which deal with more of the uses of GR. At the same level I would also recommend Schutz's First Course in GR, however, Callahan's book goes through and explains the use of the math better, whereas Schutz's is better for uses in GR, surprisingly this is the strength of Callahan's book: you can't really do the Physics properly unless you can do the math! After this it's on to more Physics orientated books like Carroll's excellent Introduction to GR, as a stepping stone to MTW's Gravitation and Wald's GR."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good introduction","review":"I have not had a chance to work through the whole book yet, but I think the previous reviewer is correct - it is an excellent book. I particularly like the approach in the early chapters where special relativity is treated with the basic linear algebra of linear transformations. This gives several interesting applications that students often don't see early in their mathematical career.The later chapters cover the geometry of surfaces and general relativity. I would like to learn GR in a \\"coordinate-free\\" fashion, but Callahan does not take that approach (and gives his reasons clearly in the introduction). In scanning over the later chapters it looks like the coordinate approach is balanced with lots of physical and geometric explanation."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can't shut our Door while using this!","review":"This is a great concept however I can't shut the door it is hanging on because the depth of the metal bracket is too deep for our doors.

My oldest two, ages 2 and 4, have an extensive hot wheels collection. I bought this item to provide them with an attractive, easily accessible storage option for their hot wheels. However, I was very disappointed with the durability and functionality of this product. It will only hold hot wheels cars. It does not hold trucks, vans or any of the more creative hot wheels designs. Most importantly the cloth straps which support it are stitched into the plastic seams on the face of the storage unit. This allows the front to tear easily away from the straps. The item only lasted a month in my home before the stitching was torn from the plastic seams, rendering it useless. It is disappointing that the name of such a durable toy was placed on such a flimsy storage solution. I would only recommend this product for use with much older children."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice & Tidy","review":"I read the reviews from other buyers before I ordered, so I was a little skeptical, but I really thought this would be a great way formy grandson to take care of his cars.

It's great to see Mick Taylor, he's still awesome. Clapton like always is excellent also. Buddy Wittington blew me away he's fantastic.

So much time is spent in setting up the relationship of its three protagonists that little suspense is generated and the script hops back and forth in time without any obvious breaks so its hard to keep up with just when this stuff is going on. Suffice to say, the story follows a young artist and her ex-husband and current boyfriend, who were all the best of friends when youths. Since the divorce, however, hubby Martin has become desperately possessive and even psychotic. The script tries to pull some twists, but they're so contrived and implausible that the final effect isn't a desired one I'm sure. The acting is mediocre except for a nice turn from Margaret Tyzack as the girl's nosy neighbor and confidante. Not spooky at all, folks!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Great concept, voices and story not strong enough to support","review":"The thought of the progeny of a philandering man and his paramours reaching out to one another is an interesting concept but TOTALLY unbelievable.

Found out I was not alone that it was \\"disagreeing\\" with me. It does say on the package that it \\"may have a slight laxative effect\\" but that wasn't the entire problem. It contains the sugar sub. Maltitol.Side effects are major bloating,gas,more gas,bad gas,gurrgling & strange colored movements-if you get my drift.This may not be the norm-but I have consumed a lot of sugar free products and have never had the consequences that resulted after eating this product. Anybody want my remaining 10 bags??

A predecessor to this game and I can't beleive they are in anyway related. This game is pure arcade. It has all of the realism of the old 1942 game for Nintendo. In fact it plays much like After Burner for Sega. This is definately a game that has been rushed out for the holiday season to trick people into thinking it is a true WW2 flight simulator which couldnt be farther from the truth.I was truly excited when I first read about this game coming out and agin unfortunately I have been let down."},{"rating":"1","title":"WEAK!","review":"I own many WWII flight sims.

This games does not pretend to be a simulator, it's an arcade action game based on WWII. I've had hours of fun with this game, sure some of the missions are hard but it's still great fun.

I'm sending it to my Brother's kids in the morning, maybe it will be able to entertain a seven and a nine year old, but I doubt it. What a shame, I was at least expecting an updated SWOTL!The flight dynamics are missing a few things, like gravity. I've played games like the Falcon series and IL-2 but I also love games like Crimson Skies so I'm not a realism fanatic.All I got was some dated eye candy.

I find that these knives are very light which is a little awkward for my preference, but I'm not a professional chef. I also found it scary to use, because they are extremely sharp. I was a little disappointed to find that there was an extra slot which made the set appear incomplete. I purchased an extra utility knife to fix that- but that was added cost that I didn't expect after paying for the set. My guest have all commented how SHARP these knives are when they use them. All in all, these knives do the job for me and I've had them for about a year and haven't had any problems. I would recommend to purchase these if you are looking for a very sharp set."},{"rating":"1","title":"proceed with caution","review":"Like the first reviewer, a knife broke in half the other day. I've had mine nearly four years and they have performed well otherwise. The set is attractive, but seems to be poor quality.

They look cool, can be worn with just about anything, and are very popular. They are also rather comfortable, once you get used to standing on hundreds of little bumps. However, I hardly ever wear them, because I have a very hard time keeping them from sliding sideways under my feet. I've tried tighteing them, loosening them, and altering the angle at which I velcro them, but nothing seems to help keep them from becoming crooked after just a few steps, especially if I'm walking at a brisk pace. I don't know how people wear these things around without having a problem with them sliding sideways. I would not recommend them, unless you can somehow keep them straight on your feet. If you can, they are great."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what it used to be....","review":"Don't buy these sandals...I purchased a pair of these five years ago and they were great.

They are almost unusuable at this point.I wrote to the Adidas to let them know that the quality had gone downhill and got a 'corp-speak' response but no answer or even willingness to admit they have a bad shoe now. See update below:Recently, a friend of mine bought the Adidas Men's Calissage, with the clear nubs, and they have not lost any nubs in over three months. They seem to be about the same as this version, just better made nubs. I would recommend going with the Calissage...if you can find it in your size.

I got these a couple of months back. The nobs started shedding immediately and now has several patches at all the places that matter. I have used this type of sandals previously and they lasted me several years. These sandals don't have the same quality. Most certainly not worth the price."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great while they last - which isn't long","review":"As another reviewer reported, I had an older pair of these sandals that worked well for years, until the strap broke off. On the newer version, the nubs started breaking off immediately, quickly leading to large nubless patches under the forefoot and toes. They do provide great relief of muscle stress and soreness while they last. At first, the nubs become painful after about 20 minutes of wear - but they become more comfortable as the foot gets used to them."},{"rating":"1","title":"I need to file a police report...","review":"Because I have been robbed and assaulted.First off, the quality is terrible. Like others, the nubs started popping off nearly from day one. I own a lot of adidas products and this is by far the worst I've ever purchased. Thanks for stealing my money.Second, my feet have never felt worse. The soles of my feet feel like they've been stabbed to death to the point that I had to ice my feet to feel better. I bought these in hopes of \\"massaging\\" my feet after running, as I was led to believe by the product name. Instead... OUCH.I'd like to note that I am an average size guy. No one (well, in America at least) would refer to me as fat or obese. My doctor whines at me to drop some weight, but I'm not heavy enough for these sandals to be falling apart and causing severe pain.

A college introductory course introduces options in skills available for human communication. This text provides students exercises that help identify their current communication style, the answers to the questions then invite discovery and awareness.

Unorganized, with no development to the ideas, no introduction, no summary, inadequate and incomplete glossary. It is absolutely horrifying to think that the author was a former *communications* professor. It is seems to have been written with no editorial oversight whatsoever, of any shape or form. The author cannot help that he cannot write clearly, but the publisher is supposed to do some quality control one would think.Clearly written by someone both obsessed with 'race' and gender issues, and at the same time, desperate to not be 'racist' or sexist. Particularly amusing were the categorization of entire cultures as masculine or feminine. One of the great things about old racists is they go away eventually.
