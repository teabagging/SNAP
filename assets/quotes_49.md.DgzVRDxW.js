Everyone who finds Open Water scary in any way.. must be special, veery special.. Because the only quality Open Water has, is that it makes you laugh more and more as you realize that it is the worst piece of s*** that you have ever wasted your time watching!There is not ONE element in Open Water that in any way can be described as good, or anything close to that! But still, i recommend EVERYONE to get a hold of Open Water and watch the whole movie! (Even though it is very tempting to stop it after the first 15mins..And remember, the best part is the end!! I have never laughed as much as I did when i saw the end of Open Water, it was even worse than the rest of it!This is a movie i will remember for a loong loong time!! Hilarious!"},{"rating":"1","title":"It really sucked!","review":"This movie was so boring that I can't believe I wasted my money on this movie. I recommend to anyone who is thinking about getting this movie that you shouldn't buy this. Rent it first then you'll know why you shouldn't buy it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just awful","review":"A waste of my time and money. It's only an hour and 15 minutes long. I did not see the similarity to Blair Witch as some have suggested. It was not scary, it was boring and even the cinematography wasn't very good (it may have been better in the theatre, but I rented the DVD and that is what I'm reviewing). There are major questions unanswered (I don't want to give them away for those of you who will actually suffer through it) and given how short the movie is, there really is no reason other than poor filmmaking for leaving them out. The party scene looked like an editing room mistake (i.e., why include that scene, which had nothing to do with the movie, and not include the boat's trip back to the dock after they left the people in the ocean?!). According to my son, \\"watching this movie was like losing a couple of hours of my life,\\" and that just about sums it up."},{"rating":"1","title":"THIS WAS THE WORST MOVIE I HAVE EVER SEEN!","review":"THE MOVIE WAS SO BAD, THAT I CAN'T WAIT TO SEE IF I CAN EXCHANGEIT.

Saddly, this movie is nothing more than a waste of an hour and a half of your life that you will never get back.The previews and trailers for this movie are more scary than the actual movie. Half way through the movie you are begging god to let it end. When you an hour or more into the movie you are telling god you will give him your first born if he but makes the movie stop!The acting is amatuerish, the directing is terrible some of the camera angles leave you scratching your head wondering why they did that. The attempt at suspense is laughable at best... as I said earlier the best parts of this movie can be seen in the 30 second trailer... don't waste your time you're not missing much."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hooked","review":"Low budget does not equal little thrills.

This is movie is the worst movie of the year, if not of all time. I haven't been tricked into watching a movie this bad since I was convinced that Blair Witch was going to be a good movie.

Don't bother with this movie!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I Really Think Not","review":"Well...if I went to the movie theatres to see this movie, it would have been cheaper. Luckily I only dished out 8 dollars or so for this movie and for me, it is one of those movies you can really only watch once. No serious spoilers here. A married couple goes scuba diving with a group and they are left behind and straded in the water. They end up having some bickers between them. Really, after listening to the wife constantly moan and whine, I was rooting for her to be ended. Others may find some annoyance in the dialogue throughout this movie. The acting was done much better by the husband than the wife. The picture wasn't all that great, but this was a small budget film. The concept may be comparable (and there are many comparisons)to the Blair Witch Project, but the Blair Witch project wins by a long shot."},{"rating":"1","title":"be afraid...very afraid","review":"of anyone who actually recommends this piece of drivel .Do not on any account arange to spend a nice evng at home with this DVD unless you have backup..like another DVD - almost any other movie would do .Let me make it even clearer - if you are the type of person who likes looking at webcams of an empty ocean for 2 hrs then go ahead & buy 6 copies - you'll love it .Otherwise suck on a lemon - you'll enjoy it more."},{"rating":"1","title":"I wouldn't watch it again if someone paid me!","review":"I have watched some really stupid movies but this one takes the cake. I was so excited when I saw the preview for this movie. I couldn't wait to see it. There really isn't much dialogue between the two characters until they're forgotten in the ocean. Other than a couple of brief shark scenes there wasn't any suspense. An hour into the movie my husband said \\"Can you believe there is still a half an hour left.\\" I just kept saying \\"It has to get better.\\" It didn't. The ending was a big disappointment. We returned the movie to the store the day after watching it for a better movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cut to the chase!","review":"A young couple go to Bahamas on vacation and go with a boat on a diving expedition. Unfortuantely, the expedition leaves without the couple, and they are left alone in the open sea.Boats pass, far far away. The couple drift with the current. Different fish appear. Sharks even. Will they be found? Before they get too cold, or thirst to death, or get eaten by sharks, or...?Lots of dialogue. Not much action. Beautiful sea pictures, both over and under water. Some of this is of course good, but there is not enough here for an entire movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Go Watch Paint Dry","review":"This movie was the worst movie I have ever seen. The whole movie was just fighting about one thing or another. I love movies with a lot of plot and drama. This movie had neither. My dad is a fan of horror movies and he even gave this movie a bad ratting. The main charters start the movie off with a fight and never stop fighting the whole movie. They fight about where to go for vacation, what too do once on vacation, about having sex or not having sex, about whose fault is they end up in the water and finial about what to do once left behind by about the boat. If you really want to see this movie rent it or borrow it from a friend who wishes they had not bought it.

Sorry if you think otherwise, and I know some of you do. It's not packed with special effects, or gore. It is an interesting story that focuses on a couple left behind after a 35 minute diving session in the ocean. When the couple comes to the surface the boat has left. They were a few minutes late and due to a miscount by one of the crew members they were thought to have everyone at departure time. Of course they did not. From this point on they deal with what you might expect drifting in open water. They encounter motion sickness that includes drifting in vomit, foating in each others urine (which wasn't to bad considering how cold they became after a while), jellyfish, other aggressive fish, and yes, ..sharks!! The best way to enjoy this movie is to put yourself in their place, and in the end be glad that you are on your couch watching t.v.."},{"rating":"2","title":"it's not about sharks...","review":"This movie is not about sharks, it's about the loss of a loved one. The ending scene is very touching, but you have to pay very close attention to see what actually happens. I missed it the first time and my girlfriend re-winded it and showed me. It really is touching. This is a movie meant for someone who knows about love, not for someone looking for shark action. My only complaint is the false footage during the closing credits. It drives home a point that doesn't need to be made. Stop the movie before the credits start rolling at the end, and it's a good love story."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a waste of time","review":"I've just wasted 2 precious hours of life watching what was probably the worst movie ever made.

I had not read previous reviews or even heard from friends what it was like. I had not idea. This movie was, without a doubt, one of the dumbest shark movies I have ever seen. You spend a good hour floating in the water with two lost scuba divers left by their scuba explorer club. From minor jellyfish stings, to nips of wandering tiny sharks, the movie lets down in more ways than one. Not to mention that the movie seemed to be directed by a guy with a hand-held camera. The directing was bad, the producing was bad, the storyline was all together bad. Rent Jaws again. You'll enjoy yourself more. If you are expecting a freaky shark attack that might very well keep you from wandering in the deep blue, this isn't the movie for you..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible Movie","review":"This hardly even deserves one star. This movie is full of bad acting, bad directing, bad sound quality...it was just terrible. It was boring and poorly done, just 80 minutes of nothing leading up to an ending that evokes the worst feeling in the pit of your stomach. While I feel for the couple that had to endure such a horrific experience, this movie was not worth seeing. It was just an exploitation of a sad, sad event that should have been left alone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ugh.","review":"This movie is just bad.

I cant beleive they came out with this as a horor movie and it was more like Cast Away and it was based on a real life event but they have no proof that it came down like that. I would save your money and see a real show somewhere else. I cant beleive that this made it the movies. What a let down and what a JOKE!! I am totally truthful that this is one of the slowest and dryest movies ever and the end will kick you in the butt and leave you so mad that you want to kick the TV. Please dont waist your money and your time on this film."},{"rating":"1","title":"slow","review":"Another indy film that got lots of attention, Open Water features the tale of 2 young divers who get left behind while on a diving excursion. Not much else to it; they bob in the water, argue, make-up, curse their bad luck etc etc. Sharks linger in the area but never really take center stage until the end. I admire the stripped-down style of film-making but this project is just too long without much happening. Worth watching but not nearly as good as media made out."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't watch it","review":"I gave it 1 star b/c I had to in order to write something about it. If there was a negative star...it would be negative or at least 0. The title describes it all. It's all about open water. It's just about 2 people in water. That's it! Boring! The worst movie ever! I can't believe I watched this! Waste of my time and money. I should've listened and I didn't. DO NOT WATCH this movie! Just don't. It's NOT interesting, not fun, not scary, not anything! Don't even be curious to watch even if you have the free time or money. The whole entire movie is about people in water. Let me say that again...about 2 people in water."},{"rating":"1","title":"This movie sucks","review":"Bad movie, bad acting, bad screenplay, no suspens, no thriller, nothing, boring movie from begining to end, just to follow a sleep zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz.1 star just for the title.Do not waste your money :("},{"rating":"1","title":"aburrida","review":"Aunque la premisa de encontrarse varado en el mar frente al peligro inminente de tiburones sea prometedora, lo cierto es que la pelicula decepciona a tal punto que luego de los primeros 15 minutos que uno trata de no aburrirse te das cuenta que hay mas aburrimiento por venir. Se dice que es una pelicula de terror, al nuevo estilo psicologico de peliculas como El Aro o Aguas Oscuras; sin embargo, el realizador no logra introducirnos ni contagiarnos del terror que sufren los personajes. Estamos viendo a una pareja en medio del oceano como si vieramos a una pareja perdida en la calle, discutiendo si llegaron a tiempo para tomar el último autobus. Francamente más terror psicologico he sentido al ver documentales médicos sobre cancer; y por favor dejen de compararla con Tiburon porque no hay ni una pizca para ello."},{"rating":"1","title":"What i have to give this trash one start to rate it,./sigh.","review":"I though the movies was awfull and i wouldn't recomend it to a single friend to waste there time watching this i would say, here story goes two people got stranded in the ocean, don't go deep see diveing.

I fell asleep during the movie it was like watching Jaws and when they were screaming I felt like I was watching another Blair Witch movie. Don't listen to the other reviewers on amazon. This movie is really awful. I can't believe I spent good money on a stupid film. It didn't even seem like a true story most of the movie was like watching a remake of Jaws or whatever. I just didn't like it much but if I were you do not see it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of time and money!","review":"I thought this movie was supposed to be scary? I listened to the reviews and saw the commercials, and then I sat there waiting to jump out of my seat. Well, I guess I did want to jump out of my seat... and go see another movie! It starts off slow and unfortunately that is the way it ends. It is filmed like a documentary, but I have seen scarier things watching the Discovery Channel. And compared to Jaws...pulleeezz, this movie does not compare. The only thing that was really scary was the acting. The reviewers who gave this movie high ratings may have been distracted by the full frontal nudity in the first 10 minutes, and like the woman in this film I also wished for death by the end."},{"rating":"1","title":"borrow it from a friend","review":"I must say, they did a better job than I could have done, but for the money, I would try to borrow it from someone who has a copy, than buy it. the begining is anything but lame, trying to spruce it up with a nude scene doesnt help. there is anticipation involved in the time after being \\"left behind\\" but the ending leaves you with a \\"that's it?\\" feeling. The Shark footage is cool, but watching shark week was much more interesting. I knew it was bad when I thought I would share it with my son and daughter and there friends and all they did was mock the whole thing, and were gone after 40 minutes of the film."},{"rating":"1","title":"Character development?

Unfortunately, it is buried in a 79 minute boring piece of cheaply produced cinema. The actors are bad, the direction is far from subtle and we're forced to sit through a lot of absolutely irrelevant and useless exposition for a couple of short thrilling moments. Really over-hyped and not even worth a rental. Save your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Scary situation, but no suspense or entertainment value!!","review":"Okay, a good idea, lets take a horrifying news story and put it in production for a film. The movie is not horrible, its just dreadful to watch. I can see where the director was going with a realistic point of view, but it just was not well put together and I was looking at my watch wondering how much longer is this thing going to go on. How would you feel if you were in this situation being stuck in the ocean with no one around, jellyfish stinging you, sharks circling you, no food, cramps from staying a float, and over 12 hours of torment? Not good and not fun to watch either. Jaws is a much more entertaining movie, and has all the elements that will scare you while swimming in a pool. This movie lacks the thrills, is boring and is like watching a reflection of a bad vacation become worse!!! Don't waste your money!"},{"rating":"2","title":"You could make your own but why?","review":"Its cheap enough and its better. It has has a mesh filter thing on it too.

How can you go wrong? I don't know, but the author did. Reading this book was so difficult that I couldn't finish it. It is the first book that I've not finished in 10 years. The author jumps around from anecdote to anecdote with no rhyme or reason and no connection of one story to another. You can keep track of them, not because they are part of a connected story, but because the stories are, themselves, pretty simple to follow. It was the constant jumping around that I couldn't handle. I don't know if it was bad writing or bad editing, but something was bad. After I had decided to return the book to the library, I had second thoughts and I tried somethings I'd never done before. I tried putting the book down. It didn't work. I tried skipping chapters. It didn't work. The author and the book lost me. Great story to be told much better than it was."},{"rating":"2","title":"Charlie Huston rocks!!!","review":"Six bad things is one of my favorite books.

I read the whole thing in one day!Coming back to the US I had to get the first book in the trilogy, \\"Caught stealing\\", as I was dying to know the story from the beginning! Then I read \\"Six bad things\\" again, this time in english!It keeps you on the edge of your seat the whole time you're reading, you suffer and cringe with Hank as he gets pummeled and stumbles from one bad situation into another! Bud, the cat, is my second-favorite character... he's just too cool! Of course I had to get \\"A dangerous man\\", too, to know how it continues...

The story never leaves you bored, disinterested, or hurrying up to finish. I savored the book, beginning to end. The only reason I didn't give it five stars is because of the way it ends.

Of course I enjoyed it. But in this- I started to get: who is this guy? (As opposed to \\"Who are those guys? - Butch Cassidy & The Sundance Kid). The point is he knows what he is writing about. My favorite scenes are those that explode out of calm/nowhere. Looking for action? The hook is in for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wohoooo What A Ride~","review":"Caught Stealing is a must to read before this one as you has to understand how this laid back guy became the man he is in the 2nd of the trilogy books on Hank. I am W/F, 60 and love this series. They are gritty as has been described, but with such wit thrown around it softens the blow. The characters are all so well brought out I can see them as clearly as watching a movie. Mr. Houston's writing style is so, so, so, catchy to the mind. I am so delighted to have found Mr. Houston's works and plan on reading them all one after another. Smart writing and stories with more twists and back to back oh dang it situations. Very little down time for Hank or the reader."},{"rating":"1","title":"Itchy and Scratchy Violence","review":"The second half of the book is a neverending parade of cartoon violence. The cast begins to blur and fade together as our hero suffers one beating/shooting/injury after another but keeps on going with the help of an occasional percocet instead of three weeks in the hospital. By the end I had lost track of who was doing what to whom and for what reason. Improbable coincidences pile up and let the hero's pursuers track him down against all odds. I think I read and enjoyed the author's first book but this one was like finishing a dull assignment. It was a chore to read at the end."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cascade Plastic Booster","review":"I purchased the Cascade Plastic Booster, Plastic Cleaning Additive for use in the dishwasher (6.8 oz) This is a great product.

It is a little pricey but well worth it. I purchased 2 of them."},{"rating":"2","title":"An entirely new spin and look to the godfather","review":"This is a wonderfully done re-edit of the first two movies of the Godfather, with extra footage added in. The story is told in entirely chronalogical order except for one flashback at the very end, scenes are added and the story takes on a much more historical/familial feel to it, particulary at the end of the second movie with Michael all alone.Not a movie for anyone who hasn't seen the Godfather trilogy in it's orginal format. really wish this movie would be re-released by the studio on DVD.In terms of editing quality and addition of subtle depth to the story lines the most recent example of a well done re-edit on the lines of this movie was the masterful job on the extended versions of Lord of the Rings trilogies. Everyone who loves the Godfather trilogy as much as I do should see this movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"RELEASE ON DVD ALREADY!!!","review":"Who do we petition to get this released on dvd?!? This is the only reason we must still keep a VCR in the house! And this is the only way to watch the trilogy. Of course I enjoy watching 1 and 2 in their separate forms, but I don't ever put in #3. In the chronological version, it all just flows and is the best single film of all time. I mean really, what is the hold up or hesitation of getting these out on dvd?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Another look at a stunning cinematic achievement","review":"Francis Ford Coppola put the footage from the first two Godfather films in chronological order in the late 1970s or early '80s for a TV showing, and sadly it's never been released on DVD. Nevertheless, the end result is stunning, and, for this viewer at least, is an even more powerful viewing experience than the two original films themselves. A number of additional scenes are included, none essential but well worth having, and they do wrap up some loose ends.

But I was disappointed. The book starts with a once-over-lightly discussion of how to take good snapshots of friends and family members. It starts with the basics--types of cameras, film, lighting, and how to take a photo. All standard stuff that can be found in any introductory book. It then gives you lots of ideas for where and when you can take photos (At parties! weddings! when people are having fun!). Again, pretty standard stuff, and directed towards folks who only take pix of the relatives sitting on a couch. But the advice on taking a good phot was incomplete. How do you get a good shot of a person? Take the photo at the right moment. But there was no suggestion on how you do that.Here's a suggestion: People and Portrait Photograhy, Sean Hargrave, Amphoto. ... Color photos. Beautiful layout. Good sidebars. Lots of ideas."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Basic Portuguese Vocabulary","review":"A friend recommended these CDs since her class was using them. Alone, I felt that they were disappointing.

They weren't helpful."},{"rating":"2","title":"Should Have Been In Oprah's Collection","review":"It's been along time waiting for a good Romance/Thriller to come along. Even though I am NOT an advid reader........I just could not put this book down. I have read at least 6 of Oprah's bookclub books and only one compared to this novel. Yes, it was a predictable Love Story but the ending was very different from most. Valerie and Wynn moved quicky in their romance but writing a book that moves from one thing to the next is what keeps me motivated to read more. I just LOVE this Author and can't wait to read more of her novels. Love a great Love story......predictable or not!"},{"rating":"1","title":"too much raunchy sex, not enough of anything else","review":"This was my first Judith Gould book, and I won't try her again if this is her style.The problem: The book did not deal NEAR enough with the main characters, Val and Wyn - and had way too much dirty, drug-induced sub-plot sex going on between all the other characters. Who cares?!! I do not want to read the detailed sex lives of all the villians in the book! I want to hear about the main characters. I was half-way through the book before the 'hero' and 'heroine' even kissed! But I had read at least 4 sex scenes by then. I felt like I was reading porn at some points.What I read of Val and Wyn - I liked - but there needed to be way more about them, way more love, more plot, etc. Just cut the first 150 or so pages and start where Val and Wyn first meet - then add 200 pages or so in the middle developing their characters and their love story. Then you'd have a good book.I wish I would have checked it out at the library instead of buying it . . ."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lost this book, found it recently, wish it had stayed lost","review":"I picked this book up a while back, but lost it in a pile of boxes when I moved last year. I found it recently while I was taking a sick day from work; I wish it had stayed lost.I know that these romance thrillers tend to have rather unrealistic plots, but this novel has a plot that defies even the most flexible of minds. There is no thrill in this thriller - I just plodded through the book, hoping that something would rescue it from mediocrity, but no such luck.I was also hoping that I would care about what would happen to the characters in the story. The characters , however, have no depth whatsoever, so I did not want to cheer on any of them. A bad plot can sometimes be rescued by characters that the reader feels some connection with; in this case, bad plot and bad characters make the reading tedious.This book is better used as a doorstop."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I was very disappointed in Judith Gould's latest book. In a nutshell vet engaged to marry cocaine sniffing embezzler who is better suited for her domineering mother. Vet meets owner of large estate who had been horribly disfigured in a polo accident and has mutiple emotional problems but alas after being with the vet twice he overcomes all of his problems! There are a few other characters not worth mentioning. I found the characters quite shallow, consequently the book lacked depth. It certainly is not up to Ms. Gould's usual high standards.

Instead I ended up with an endless number of idiotic plot twists, a rejected fiancee with mental issues who poisons animals for fun, random people having tons of boring sex all over the place, and maybe 40 pages of actual interactions between the hero and heroine. The secondary characters were caricatures from a bad soap opera, the dialogue was reminiscent of the cheesy Harlequin novels from the sixties, the romance between the heroine and hero would register as tepid, and I quit reading it about forty pages before it ended because it was so predictable and stupid. This was a rotten book and I question how it ever got published."},{"rating":"2","title":"What a Find!","review":"I first heard this poem on the Smother Brothers Show many years ago. Then found a framed print of it in a thrift store. Now I knew who wrote it. This poem has never left my mind so when I saw this book I had to have it.

His family's trip from Vienna during the start of the Holocaust to their arrival in America. When Otto looks out the window he sees how everyone else around him live with loving parents. He finds no love in his own family except for Otto's brother Heinz Robert. Otto's success is due to hard work and long hours. This has taken him away from his own family. Eventually, the long hours at work pay off with success and family love and appreciation. A joy to read and to think about your own family's hardships and success.

Then making a successful life for himself in which his accomplishments are many and are definately something to be very proud of.His life is evidence of that which hurts us only makes us stronger.

The shock came, when I played it: instead of the full Stereo- Sound I heard a meagre Mono- CD. My English Regal LP or the American abriged reissue on a bad Vinyl pressing sounded much better. Didn't they know, that they have a Stereo Master, or were they unable to find it. The CD is now out of print and I hope, in the meantime they had enough time to find the Stereo Master for the next reissue, and I hope, it will be soon, or Mr.Ray Purslow from the Recordcenter in Birmingham UK should do it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Delivers with the Punch of a Machine Gun!","review":"The definitive biography of \\"Scarface Al\\" Capone, who ruled the Chicago underworld with an iron fist during Prohibition. John Kobler is a fine writer whose flair with words will keep his readers glued to the pages, regardless of the subject matter. In \\"Capone,\\" he masterfully recounts the rise and fall of the Windy City's overlord of vice and crime as only he can, presented in an honest, objective, and straightforward (but never dull) manner. This is a highly entertaining effort which any crime historian is sure to enjoy. My only regret is that Mr. Kobler didn't tackle the biographies of other gangland luminaries as well (although he did an excellent job narrating the history of Prohibition in \\"Ardent Spirits\\"). If you must read just one book about Big Al, then this is the one. As far as I'm concerned, you can skip all the others."},{"rating":"2","title":"The book is very interesting and has a lot of details.","review":"I personally feel that this book does a very good job of explaining the details of Al Capones life and the time era in which he lived.

However there are some omissions and errors which make the reading somewhat disappointing. One example is omitting the relevant technical date about the 1936 Cord 810 featuring front wheel drive. The technical data on the 1960 Cadillac convertible erroneously described the Hydramatic automatic transmission as a 3 speed! The Cadillac Hydramatic was a true, fully automatic 4 speed transmission, first developed by Cadillac in 1940. Why is this important? Because this transmission is the world's first successful fully automatic tranny ever produced. Despite minor problems such as these, the product looks great on any coffee table."},{"rating":"1","title":"kind of flimsy","review":"I bought this for a gift for my dad who is in the process of building a train lay out.

There can't be too many homes in this country without a copy. The story is quite simple. Passing through the woods, a child loses a favorite toy, a monkey. It finds its way to a family of mice living inside a tree, then to a family of hedgehogs, before briefly being in the care of a magpie. Monkey then falls into a stream where (months later) he is fished out by an old man -- a toy doctor, it so happens. He brings Monkey back to his toy hospital in the nearby village, carefully repairs him, and at last puts Monkey (looking like new) in the window, where his owner happens to see him. There is a joyful reunion. The Dutch edition (Monkie)is without text, which I prefer. The US edition has opted to include short and simple sentences. The illustrations are endlessly fascinating."},{"rating":"1","title":"Easy read, but some stuff outdated","review":"I am a natural health devotee and though I agree with a good part of the material the author discusses, I found a few items that are outdated and irrelevant.

The temple was in fact totally destroyed in 70 AD about forty years after the death of Christ.

Sumerians existed thousands of years prior to the House of Judah and Israel. Abraham left Ur due to God telling him to get moving (due to the coming collapse of the ancient Sumerian/Akkadian civilization), etc. It mentions the book of Daniel but fails to point out even one alleged future prophecy and so on.

While some parts of this film are historically correct in regards to Israel, there are huge assumptions made about the evils of international peace and interfaith tolerance.

It would make a great present of a Lord of the Rings fan. Along with the pictures, the book has back ground information on Middle Earth and the characters involved in this epic drama. I found the short summaries of the characters and places to be quite interesting. Having a set a pictures from the movie adds a new dimension to the book.Of course, a coffee table book with pictures is not a substitute for the real thing...it is a pleasant diversion with interesting pictures of hobbits, wizards and Middle Earth scenery (now that we know Middle Earth is located in New Zealand <g>)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Movie Encyclopedia!!!","review":"Being a major fan of the books by J.R.R. Tolkien and loving the first movie of his trilogy, I bought many books that contained information on the movie. Jude Fisher's guide was one of them. This book is only on \\"The Fellowship of the Ring\\" movie. This guide contains information on Middle Earth's places and people in an encyclopedia format. If you have read \\"The Lord of the Rings\\" trilogy already, most of the information in this book will be known to you. This is still fun to read, nonetheless. The photographs in this book are beautiful and that is just one reason why you would want to buy this. I recommend this encyclopedia to a fan of \\"The Lord of the Rings\\" book or the first movie. I enjoyed this guide and I am looking forward towards Ms. Fisher's guides for \\"The Two Towers\\" and \\"The Return of the King\\" films. I recommend this very highly.Happy Reading!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Missing Pages!","review":"I agree with all the reviewers who praise this excellent and exhaustive Italian grammar.

Otherwise, I would have enthusiastically given this book the five stars it deserves."},{"rating":"1","title":"don't buy it!","review":"Based on the rave reviews I purchased this book. I am minoring in Italian and wanted a grammar that went into more detail than the very good, but basic one I own (Essential Italian Grammar Olga Ragusa). I have to agree with the other reviewer here who stated that this is not an easily accessible book. Like the other reviewer I too am near fluent in two other languages and already have a background in Italian. The book is not well organized, and though loaded with examples, few were of the kind that proved helpful in shedding light on the language in a way that improved my understanding of the nuances of usage.

Therefore I think it will appeal to anyone looking for historical fiction. The song of the German Queen is fantastic.

After nine or so months with this book I can say that any people new to Calculus need to avoid this text at all costs. The layout and definitions for this book are decent, albeit a little harsh in that they are often strictly mathematical, but can still be understood. Having said that, there are virtually no applicable examples in this book. Almost all examples in this text are done for the most basic forms of problems and do not adequately prepare you for more difficult, complex problems used in problem sets. To make it worse, this book does not make any effort to lead you through even the few examples that it does present. As others have stated, this book may serve as a good read if you were to already know Calculus, but to attempt to learn from this book? No. Save yourself the heartache and avoid professors teaching with this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Calculus book","review":"Like all other reviews , I also consider that this book is the worst calculus book , I also like math but I didnt find any explanation to the problems in this book.THIS CALCULUS BOOK IS REALLY BAD."},{"rating":"2","title":"great book","review":"this book's in good condition, the same as its description when i first purchased it. it arrived on time, which was the most important thing that i needed when i bought it on amazon."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst calculus book I've ever encountered","review":"This book is terrible. The lessons do not adequately cover the topics, and many times the problem sets include problems that are not explained anywhere else in the book.

However, it lacks reference materials (for example, there are no derivative or integral charts easily accessible in the front or back covers, but are hidden within the pages).Do not use this book if you want a thorough source for calculus."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great","review":"I used this book for my single-variable integral calculus course and I must say it did an excellent job of teaching what the instructor couldn't.

I thought it was a complete waste of time.I didn't care for the hero, Falcon, at all. In fact, at times, he acted like kind of jerk. All he cared about was money and land. He was willing to throw Mariah away and marry a woman he didn't like just for money. Not the kind of hero I'd want.The plot got better toward the end, and just when I thought this book may redeem itself, Ms. Mason just left the most important issue unresolved! Can Falcon NEVER claim his son as his own? It just seems like she got tired of writing and just decided to wrap it up early. Everything is a mess, then within a few pages - presto, a quick solution to end the book.Maybe it's just me - I'm a Karen Marie Moning fan and her heroes are larger than life and devoted to the heroines.

The hero and heroine didn't know each other very well, and didn't seem to even like each other very much when they were not in bed. Even then the love scenes were all the same, and not that interesting (the same words seemed to be used for each one). Many times in the book I wondered why the hero was even IN the book. The heroine saved herself more than once, and the people of her village and castle were more help than the hero - he was sort of useless, a bit dense, and not even very nice. Overall, this was not a bad book, but it was very far from good. I'm soooo glad I got it while it was free.

With the higher end XS900 I assumed it would be fine with the replacements, but the charging circuit is not working. Batteries have been test and they are fine so I'm assuming APC designs products that won't survive the death of the first set of batteries. So these two new batteries go in the pile of perfectly functional batteries that have nothing to go in.I've learned my lesson and will try another brand of UPS. This product (the battery) works fine for me, but I'm scoring low to warn folks to think twice about flushing money down the toilet if they aren't sure that the unit will work with new batteries.

Before telling us who the author was, we had to read the first two chapters. It was more than easy to tell that it was a woman. After all, she spends more time male bashing than discussing the issues critical to the text. Her development on HOW manhood is a social creation could use some help. How she develops it as it changes though time is interesting, but to bland. Some of her argument is based on stereotypes instead of facts. She may be a proffesor, but not everything she says is truth. Nevertheless, she does an exellent job adding storylines into her text to keep it interesting.

I was also very pleased that I had received it earlier than the estimated date. Unfortunately, the next night I took it off before going to bed and my thumb was green. I am very disappointed because it was such a nice ring and I was looking forward to wearing it all the time. I have bought several rings from this particular seller in the past, (7 all together to be exact), and wear almost all of them everyday. This was the only one that has ever turned my finger green.

The product is really cheap and barely works with some effort. They used it for a little while, but quit using it because it was so \\"finicky\\" to use. You absolutely could not use this in a real situation. I would not recommend this product.

I needed to get a circular polarizing filter to fit my lenses that use 49mm filters. But I already had a 77mm and 58mm circular polarizing filters. They're quite expensive and I wanted to save a few dollars.So I purchased this 49mm to 58mm stepping ring. The 49mm end threads into my lenses that use 49mm filters. Then I just thread my 58mm circular polarizing filter onto the ring and I am ready to go!If I want to use my lens hoods (usually) I can thread the 58mm to 49mm stepping ring I purchased. It threads onto the 58mm filter, and provides a 49mm thread for my lens hoods!This is a light-weight item (they all are) so it needs to be handled carefully to avoid bending it. Handling it the way you'd handle an expensive filter is about all that needs to be done."},{"rating":"2","title":"Legend of the Red Wolf","review":"Legend of the Red Wolf successfully combines elements of nature and Native American wisdom in a realistic story of conflict resolution. The author's teaching experience is evident in this story about family situations, art, animals and the environment, bullies, and problem solving. Tony, the main character, is a real kid with real problems who considers various ways of handling those problems and creates a workable solution. A fine addition to the growing field of Latino-authored books for children and young adults."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Legend of the Red Wolf","review":"I read this book to my second graders at the beginning of the year and it fit perfectly with our conflict resolution unit. It deals with peer pressure, and how a young boy avoids violence and turns the situation into something positive. The use of art as a way to channel childrens' energy is a great lesson for us all."},{"rating":"2","title":"great book","review":"This is a great book for upper elementary and jr. high kids.

I rearranged my kitchen to avoid interference from other appliances and have attempted changing the channnel on the phone several times--no improvements."},{"rating":"1","title":"It Sucks!!!","review":"This phone is nothing like I thought it was going to be. First of all, it is so light, it feels like a toy. When I drop it, the whole thing comes apart. I tend to drop things a lot, so that's not good for me at all. It doesn't even have a speaker button on the base like I thought it did. It does have one on the handset, but that doesn't help a whole lot. When I click over to answer a second call, more than half the time, I can't get back to my first call. I have to hang up and call them back. I should have given this phone a \\"1 star\\" rating, but I gave it a 2, because I am able to talk on it. That's about the only thing good about it. I would have been better off going to the drug store and buying a phone for $10. This phone costs me about $40, and it was not worth it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"The phone was very annoying. Everytime I tried to call on the phone, it would not connect. I would have to either change the channel or just not call. I was only able to connect to the number I was calling once in the 30+ times I attempted to call.

According to the sparse instructions, after the popping stops you are to turn the unit over pouring the popped kernels into the bowl which doubles as the lid. Well not only did kernels empty into the bowl, but hot oil as well. Since the seal between the top and bottom was kind of a lose fit, hot oil also poured out onto my counter and hands as I turned the unit over to empty the kernels. Also, the red rubber measuring cup, which doubles as the bowls snap-on bottom, did not fit. It is suppose to snap onto the bottom of the bowl making a seal but was way too big. All in all this popper is a poor design and can be dangerous to use."},{"rating":"1","title":"This thing stinks!!!!","review":"As with the previous review, I have to first of all say that I, too, find the unit a danger to use. When I attempted my first batch, I found that the butter melted down way before the oil got hot enough to start popping the corn. Not a pleasant aroma, butter and oil \\"burning\\" together. Oh yeh, and the corn never did pop. Figure that! Instructions were measly. I am so disappointed that a unit of this cost could be so completely ineffective. Slap the disney on it to make a few extra bucks and then you find out it's a piece of garbage.I first saw this product demonstrated on the QVC shopping network, and that urged me to find it at a local store. Thankfully I did as it made the return ever so much easier.Pass on this one, folks. It stinks!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't Work. Not Worth the Money","review":"I bought one of these because the design was similar to the Stir Crazy popper I had in college, and because of a good sale price. I wish I had left this piece of junk on the shelf.I followed the directions and measured the oil and popcorn into the popper, plugged it in and turned it on...or tried to. I pushed in the button and nothing happened. The stirrer rods didn't turn and the unit didn't heat up. All I had was a oily mess and wasted popcorn. I packed it back up and returned it to the store.If you are looking for a GOOD popcorn popper, don't bother with this product. Instead, buy a West Bend Stir Crazy, a quality product that doesn't count on the \\"Disney\\" name to sell."},{"rating":"1","title":"Trust the reviews... I wish I had read them first","review":"I bought this at a local retailer and my review is simple: The product failed to operate right out of the box. Our experience duplicates that of a previous reviewer. We filled it with oil and popcorn and plugged it in. We let our son press the button and turn the unit on since he was excited about it. Nothing happened. I checked a few things but nothing seemed to make a difference. Just a cold plate full of oil and unpopped popcorn.There are a couple of other things to note about this product. The various parts did not fit together in apparent ways. I would have used instructions to figure out how they fit together but there really aren't any instructions. I think the leaking that people discuss is down to the parts which are just so poorly designed that they do not fit together with an easy motion."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disney Popcorn Popper","review":"I bought this popcorn popper for my nephew. He really wanted it and couldn't wait to get it. What a disappointment! This takes a very long time to warm up and then when it does warm up it doesn't work so well.

I would suggest that you don't waste your money on this!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Cute but doesn't last long","review":"I bought this 1 1/2 to 2 years ago as an impulse purchase. It is just too cute. A few months later it quit popping every kernel and now it only popped 20 kernels out of 1/3 cup. So I just went out and bought the Presto Microwave Popper which popped every kernel and fast.Something I didn't like from the start is that you have to tip it over but there are openings in the lid, so hot steam/water and oil drip out. So you can't really use the lid as a bowl for that reason.I am surprised the popper quit working this soon."},{"rating":"1","title":"cow lawn sprinkler","review":"The product was a gift and it does not work correctly.I have yet to get a refund or a replacement.

It was immediately reported and Amazon.com promptly responded with a return shipping label so I could send it back, but they couldn't replace the mat for the one I ordered because it was through another store. I could, however, re-order it and they would arrange for free one-day shipping, which I appreciate, but when I order a mat that is even tagged the \\"Go Away\\" mat on the product itself, on the invoice, and on the online product description, and yet it arrives as a plain doormat with nothing on it does not assure me in any way that re-ordering would guarantee that I will get the product I am paying for.

This commentary also uses one of my favorite Bible versions so I am now free to use another translation while reading Proverbial Wisdome.

After the first install there was a burr in the deadbolt that prevented the bolt from coming out. I filed that down, and installed it a second time. Next, I went to program it, and the only place the programming codes existed were on THE BACK of the keypad, so I had to uninstall it all over again. Nowhere in the instructions does it mention to write down the codes first-- there was supposed to be a \\"programming guide\\", but that was not in the box anywhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"broke after 18 months","review":"Had one of these installed by a professional locksmith on front door of office.

I'll never be locked out again or worry about keys left outside.

Installation was a breeze and took about 30 minutes, taking my time and reading all the directions. If I had to do it again, I could install it in 5 minutes. So far the lock works flawlessly. I used one of the keys just to try it out, but since the bolt is manually operated, I expect the batteries to last a long time and doubt that I will ever need a key. I will buy another one soon for my garage door just because this one is so nice."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great lock. Moved and just have to have another.","review":"This lock worked flawlessly the 2 years I had it at previous residence. I sorely miss it and will be soon installing one at new home.Love that you can temporarily put in a different code for pet sitter or anyone else you need to let in and don't feel like you have keys or potential copies of your keys floating around.For instructions to enter and delete new code etc. there is nice YouTube video also.Convenience can't be beat and in the dark it lights upon touching button."},{"rating":"2","title":"Superb customer service from Schlage","review":"I have two of these guys, completely happy with them,,until one stopped working, swapped batteries, check connections, to no avail. Called up Schlage but they determined it could not be fixed...so they shipped me another one (I bought these at least 6 mos ago)...at not cost to me. I had the replacement sitting in my hallway awaiting install, when one day I heard my kid opening the door with the key-pad. Sure enough, the old lock starting working again. Now, I don't know if I should ship the replacement back or wait for it to go on the fritz again. But, needless to say, Schlage has made me a customer for life."},{"rating":"2","title":"Functional and looks good","review":"This is a great buy - There was one on a vacation house we had rented so we decided to purchase one and install it on a new house we are moving into. It was easy to install and looks great. Love the functionality of it and option to not have keys with you. Price on Amazon was much better than the exact same product at a major home improvement store."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very difficult to install.","review":"If the holes drilled out for the deadbolt on your door are not perfectly level then you will not be able to install these and will acquire a great deal of frustration. The tolerances in how the screw lines up are maybe 1 mm. The return process wasn't the most stress free either. I have installed a lot of locks while re-keying foreclosure properties so I have an above average experience level with locks and the company treated me like I was a piss idiot. I only got one of two installed and when I did use it the lock was very sporadic in its operation and actually locked me out of house once."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Pleased","review":"I'm very pleased with this lock. It's really useful for families with kids, because you don't have to worry about them losing their key. It also has some intelligent features ... when you press the top button (above the keypad), the keypad lights up ... if it's unlocked, pressing that same button above the keypad allows you to lock the door, without entering the code. I put it on my garage door, and I'm considering getting one for my front door, too."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terra Hoat","review":"I was so disappointed. I had to return the keypad. The home we purchased is all about 'natural light' therefore; all the doors have glass - to have this lock would NOT make me feel safe. I have looked for and asked for a double cylinder keypad system and I'm told it's considered a hazard. You want to know what I consider a hazard? A single cylinder deadbolt! All anyone has to do it pop the glass pane, stick their hand in and flip the lock! That's just too dangerous for me. I've had double cylinders for years and I'm responsible enough to have a key near by that never moves - ever."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love these things","review":"I use these on my farm where the folks I work with need to get in and out of doors.

It was easy to install, straightforward to program. Comes with pre-programmed user codes which can all be changed (great for letting in cleaning people, for example). Biggest pluses of the design:- Easy to use.- Looks nice.- Key override.- !! Doesn't waste battery power trying to throw the deadbolt !! While some might prefer a product to actually lock and unlock the deadbolt, this action takes a lot of energy and would kill the batteries quickly. I bought this one because the code enables/disables the deadbolt in the spindle; YOU still have to turn the deadbolt to lock and unlock. This is a much more effective/efficient design for a small, battery operated system. As I said, I installed it about 2 years ago, I almost never use the key and I have not yet had to change the 9V battery!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Shorted out","review":"We purchased one of these locks for our back door and an apartment that that we own. We did like the convenience, at least until it did not work. We have just gone through about five days of heavy rain which seemed to short out some of the buttons. Currently, none of the buttons are working which has left my wife stranded with our two kids. locked out of the house. As I am writing this review, I am on hold waiting to speak with Schlage customer service.....(8 minutes later). They have said that they would replace the lock, but it would take about 20 days to send us a new one........This may be the exception to a relatively good product but I'd rather not wait nearly a month to use our main entry."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it","review":"I should have bought this a long time ago.

As a plus, if you own a vehicle with a key less entry/ignition system you never need to fumble with keys from the time you leave your home till you get back."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it!","review":"This lock is wonderful. It holds multiple combinations, is easy to install, and easy to use. I love being able to go for a jog, walk the dog to the park, run to the gas station, etc and not have to bring my keys! Guys might not care that much, but ladies often have extremely small or nonexistent pockets, making bulky, noisy key rings an annoying requirement on these quick outings.My husband also went on a long spiel about how nice this lock is compared to other keyless deadbolts because of the way the locking mechanism works. It saves lots of battery power and doesn't have a small motor in it. Which means not only does the battery last longer, but there aren't any motors to degenerate over time. I won't say anything more to try to mitigate the risk of talking from the top of Mount Stupid.Bottom line: I really REALLY like this lock. I felt it was well worth the money."},{"rating":"1","title":"do not buy","review":"I could not program one of the locks I bought.

I then bought this one and has lasted many years I love it. I just put in another one on back door.

The code can be changed anytime you want and you dont have to go get new keys made."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just purchased.....but works great with quick installation","review":"Bought this product because I don't need any keys to get into my home. I'm a person who will rent out a room in my home and nobody needs keys to get in as long as they have their special code.

Today I decided to use it for the first time, to heat up a frozen pizza. Per the instructions, I put the frozen pizza on the room temperature stone before putting in the oven. The instructions had no specific information about how long to to let them sit so I waited about 2 minutes before putting into a preheated 425 degreee F oven. The stone cracked about 3-4 minutes after putting in oven.I guess if I had to do it again I'd let the pizza sit for 10 - 15 minutes before putting in the oven (even though the pizza instructions tell you not to thaw first), and I might also forego the preheating.

This book is not that. It reminds me much more of anti-feminist texts written by women on 'evil in fairy tales' and such that I read in the early 70s. The essays are poorly conceived. If you think this might be like a text by James Hillman, forget it, or a text by Jack Zipes, forget it. We still need a book with this title, but with a much improved text.

I knew that this was going to be a great album, and guess what, it is. So in that respect it met my expectations. I love how instrumentals just take a hold of you and don't let go, in a world spoiled with pop this stuff is so refreshing.That being said, I do not think that if you are a fan of Isis that you are definatley going to like this album. In my opinion this is closer to Mogwai than it is to Isis. Now, I am a fan of both, so it works for me, but people who like Isis and think that Mogwai is too \\"soft\\", may have an issue. This does not even come close to the level of power and aggression that Isis puts out. Oh and no, this is not better than Panopticon, sorry.Fans of Mogwai, check it out; fans of Isis, proceed with caution; fans of both, you'll love it.

Formed from members of both Isis and Neurosis, Red Sparrowes is an ambient-instrumental metal super group of sorts. Starting with beautifully intense buildups into full-on doom metal fury, At the Soundless Dawn is a lush, orchestrative affair as each member contributes wonderful sounds from their instrument, achieving what some could call a masterpiece of an album. Greg Burns of Halifax Pier manages to both relax and captivate the listener with the strangely satisfying addition of the pedal steel, which helps At the Soundless Dawn reach its full glory. It feels almost sacrilegious to try to describe what Red Sparrowes have achieved. Like the album, it has left me speechless.- Nick WalkerSynthesis.net"},{"rating":"2","title":"Highly recommended","review":"Funny that an album with members of Isis and Neurosis can put out an album that is better than both Isis and Neurosis' last albums.

I'm not pushing hard but it just seems to suck up skin under my chin or along the bottom of my neck. I get a horrible rash as well as cuts.

This is the best by far to date. Cuts close and free of tugging. I usually shave every day, but skipping a couple of days will kill the shaver's performance. Like all screen based electric shavers it is not great at picking up and cutting long whiskers. I run it on a couple of Sanyo Enerloop rechargable batteries. Cutters run a lot faster than my last two Panasonics and that helps to minimize any tugging and helps with a clean shave. Only concern is that the snap on plastic blade cover may not stay in place in my shaving kit when I travel, leaving the delicate foil screen unprotected. I may throw a rubber band around the cover for insurance.

I recomend it as a REALLY good Christian youth book, with meeaningful lessons that we can learn from without going through it ourselves if we choose to learn from it. There are the mentions of drugs and such, so I wont say its the cleanest book ever but this is a real problem in the world that we cant hide from forever."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love this book!","review":"I have 2 daughters, 9 and 12, and we still read before bed on most nights. This book is the first to really grab both of their attention and mine as well. It is a bit more suited to tween/teenage girls, but my almost 10 yr old loves it too. The stories bring on deep discussions about things that are otherwise hard to bring up or talk about. Love this book..will order the rest of the series and would reccomend to anyone with tween/teenage girls."},{"rating":"2","title":"A special place in my heart","review":"This series of books has a special place in my heart and played a role in my greater understanding of God as a pre-teen and middle-school student. I am buying them now for my niece who is in 6th grade in hopes that she too will one day have a special place in her heart for Christie and her revelations."},{"rating":"1","title":"Confusing, with a dubious moral, but entertaining","review":"The most startling thing about this book is Christy's wild mood swings. I got exhausted just reading about how she went from angry to hopeful to sad to despondent to cheerful to excited to happy to angry every few minutes. Of course, she IS a teenager, so this is largely excusable. I liked how the author didn't shy away from sex and drugs in the story, and she kept the story moving at a good pace. However, I found the moral rather dubious: Wear a lot of makeup and stylish clothing and become a Christian and other kids will accept you. At least that's what I made out the moral to be, since the kids were mean to Christy before she started dressing in style, and ambivalent towards her before she became a Christian. I was also very confused by Todd and Tracy's behavior, although it got a little less confusing at the end of the book. I may or may not read the rest of the series to find out what happens next."},{"rating":"1","title":"summer promise","review":"Christy Miller is a regular fourteen your old girl, and during the summer decides to stay with her Aunt Marti, and Uncle Bob. in Escondido, California.While she\`s there, she finds fitting in is soemthing that is very important to her.

I have a small library in my room, this series belonged to one of my older siblings.

The first book really got me hooked, then the next three still kept me reading. I really liked Christy because she was kind of insecure and shy, but she blossoms throughout the books. Todd was such a sweet guy, but sometimes he was a little slow when it came to Christy. I really got involved with the characters, and I felt Robin Jones Gunn did an amazing job of making the characters. They were 3 dimensional and so realistic. I recommend this series!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Christy and Todd are so sweet!","review":"This one was AMAZING. Now I want to go to Disneyland to do all the things Christy did and re-live that experience. You're really rooting for her to get together with Todd.

These are my favorite series ever, and I doubt that will change soon.-pokes post below this one- Read the college years :P You'll find that her romance with Todd is more consistent, and it might change your view on romance novels."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mini travel shaver","review":"Arrived on time and stopped working after three instances.

A splendid book, can't be missed.","review":"I would highly recommend this book to anyone who wishes to read about Hitler's life. I would suggest, though, that this book is read after having read the first part by the same author (1889-1936 Hubris). I had not read any books on Hitler before, and I am extremely glad that I have chosen this one, as I can't imagine others to be better. The only thing which could be improved is the description of WWII which is sometimes lacking details, but after all this is Hitler's biography, not a WWII history book. The two books are a splendid account of the dictator's life, which should not be missed by anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing new","review":"I read this book hoping for some greater enlightenment about Adolf Hitler, his life, and times. There is nothing new in this book that has not been covered in about a hundred others biographies. I will not go so far as to say this is a \\"bad\\" book. That it is certainly not. However, if you are already well read regarding Adolf Hilter you will find nothing new in these pages."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Problem of Perspective","review":"Kershaw's second volume of his biography of Hitler is disappointing for two reasons. First, it is hardly a biography. Rather, it is a superficial history of the Second World War in Europe, starring Hitler. Little insight into the motives, character, actions and impact of the subject is given. Second, Kershaw has relied very heavily upon a historical point of view represented by Momsen and Irving - that the Holocaust was not intential, but derived from the unexpected contingencies of the war and the way it was conducted. One must observe with regret that not only does Kershaw adopt this view point, but he does not acknowledge the historical debate about this issue or that he has chosen an impugned point of view. This is a book that should be read with great caution by anyone without extensive background on Hitler, the War, and the Holocaust."},{"rating":"1","title":"Drier than a Martini - Whats the Hype?","review":"I expected much more. Dry and tedious, Mr. Kershaw pacts each page with wave after wave of flat, colorless data.

Indeed, the only good parts seem lifted directly from the brilliant David Irving's pathbreaking, revisionist \\"Hitler's War.\\" The rest is just plain uneventful. For example, there still is NO repeat NO evidence of a written order concerning the necessary internment camps, a fact that must horrify the hysterical Ms. Lipstadt no end.

When we got to Madagascar, we realized that everyone else had bought the Bradt guide, which is far superior to this book. We ended up using an old copy of the Bradt guide whenever we were travelling around the country, because this Lonely Planet didn't get us very far.

I was searching for songs in the KEY OF C and when I found this was for \\"C\\" instruments I thought it was like for a harmonica that is tuned in C.

Damned expensive and for me, and very disappointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Warning: Editions out of whack","review":"This fakebook is published in C, Bb, and Eb versions. The C version is now on the 3rd edition. But the publisher has not yet sold out of the 2nd editions for the Eb and Bb books, and so have not gotten around to releasing 3rd editions for the other keys. The editions are badly out of sync, in terms of the songs they contain, and sometimes even the key of the song. You can't use these split editions in an ensemble setting, so if you're getting this to play with friends who already have the older edition, avoid this one like the plague.The low star rating, however, is for the song selection and generally hard-to-read (chords are too small, poor use of whitespace, and songs broken awkwardly across pages) typesetting that you find in most Hal Leonard fake books."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not for youngsters","review":"I just want to disagree with those reviewers who say that if you are over 40 this book is not for you.

Also for guitar players the difficulty I would place at intermediate to advanced due to the keys and (perhaps needless)chord complexities (no mini-charts with the chords which would have helped with all of the obscure ones). I have two other fake books from Hal Leaonard ( Christmas guitar and Folksongs )and I can't imagine that this group was gathered by the same team since I really like the other titles.

That is exactly how it came out of the camera, except for the border.overall the camera has great easy to get to features on making a photo. The screen is very bright outdoors and easily readable. I suggest using the the strap that came with it since it can slip out of your hands. Video quality is very good after upgrading to firmware version 1.1b.

I didn't know if they would be able to put out a release that even came close to AOJB, being that following up a brilliant album is very difficult. However, they pull it off, and they pull it off well. Addition of Howard Jones (who I've seen live 4 times, soon to be 5, and is one hell of a show) is a terrific addition to the band. Every last song on this album really does rock. I went to the store right after school today and picked the album up and was listening to it all day.

I enjoyed their last album, but this new one is a joke. Maybe because I am not 15 years old, and I don't appreciate metal and emo placed together. With this, Killswitch maybe the next TRL band. Korn was good once too...just once. Perhaps KSE will be the Korn of Metalcore (Sellouts). I give it one star because I actually bought the CD."},{"rating":"1","title":"KSE used to be good now they suck","review":"this album \\"the end of heartache\\" blows, the new singer blows, i strongly discouage you from buying this.

That's all that really needs to be said."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wow, this sucks.","review":"For all of you people saying \\"THIS IS THE MOST BRUTAL METAL ALBUM I HAVE EVER HEARD!\\" YOU ARE RETARDED! This album is nothing more than emo glazed over with some heavy guitar. And I read one review that called Shadows Fall and NIN poser bands...wow, not even gonna get into that.

The new album though kicks ass too. The production is great as expected but the vocalist has much better screaming abililties than the last vocalist. The only weakness compared to the last cd is that the clean vocals were better on the last cd. If I could have my cake and eat it too I would have both guys in the band, Howard Jones to scream and Jessie leach to sing clean. As it is we have Jones and he is definately a good fit with the band and their music style. Great riffing, but the next cd will be an improvement if they could incorporate more solos, ala Shadow Fall, Unearth and God Forbid. Still, this band is a joy to listen to. Get this CD if you haven't already. Support american metal."},{"rating":"2","title":"solid","review":"I can't keep track of all the subgenres of metal...I tend to just separate them by singing style...you got your singers, grumblers, screamers, screachers and growlers. KE falls into my screamer catagory and the new guy is one of the best screamers I have personally heard. Added to his superb vocals is the decent songwriting. I don't really like bands like Hatebreed because the music sucks...just bang out the same chords over and over on your guitar and add some screaming..no good melodies to be found, but KE has managed to add some actual solid melody to go with the nice, angry screaming and mix in some solid singing occasionally to create a very enjoyable CD. I must also add that \\"inhale\\" is one of the coolest acustic melodies I have ever heard. They should leave the confines of their normal appraoch and make a full song out of it. Their fans would call it \\"selling out\\" i'm sure, but it could be one of the greatest songs ever. Oh well...I'll take what I can get."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good, though a bit overated","review":"While nothing is that bad about this album, it isn't as good as Alive or Just Breathing. Much of the blame for this lies on their new frontman Howard Jones. He can get the job done on the hardcore vocals but, more often than not, sucks on the clean ones. The fact that Howard isn't as good as Jesse Leach becomes very obvious on the best song on the album, Take This Oath, in which Jesse is the guest vocalist. The music, while heavier than AOJB, is much more simplistic. There is rarely a moment when it deviates from the regular KSE formula and does something truly unpredictable. Overall, this a good effort considering what they had to work with, though they'll probably never surpass AOJB unless they somehow reunite with Jesse."},{"rating":"2","title":"KILLSWITCH ENGAGE DOES IT AGAIN!!!!","review":"Anyone who thinks METAL is dead hasn't heard KILLSWITCH ENGAGE.If you are a true fan of REAL music buy this.It is everything a metal fan wants.Great clean vocals mixed with some of the best growls on the planet.HEAVY HEAVY guitars with lots of tempo changes.

Such an intense album from a band that has really come into their own. All of their albums are fantastic from their self-titled to the current As Daylight Dies, but, this one in my opinion takes the cake. Every track is excellent. \\"The End of Heartache\\" is my favorite track but other tracks including \\"World Ablaze\\", and ending with \\"Hope Is..\\" finish the album out masterfully. The band has matured into one of the best metal bands out today. They are great performers and IF YOU HAVE NEVER SEEN THEM LIVE PLEASE DO SO!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Crap","review":"Wow. Ok all you metalhead nazis out there, I am somebody who listens to what most would consider nu metal like Nothingface, Project 86, Blindside, etc. My friends have been trashing my tastes and telling me for years to check out bands like Killswitch Engage.I did, and you know what? This sounds like frickin' hair metal! Some of the song parts are heavy and carry a good groove but apparently its cool to be into that cheesy 80's guitar playing now and so most of the time the music sounds ridiculous.Sorry metal elitists, I am not impressed"},{"rating":"1","title":"Sounds every other nu-metal band...","review":"Nu-metal and metalcore are the worse genres in music...That i've ever heard.What's so difirent about the two?Nothing at all.

Might i add, how mediocre the music here, realy is?Its horrible,un-original,repetetive, emo like lirycs, and, weak production as well. I quess its trendy to sound like every one else.

Nu-metal , emo, metalcore, rap, pop, it's all the same bullsh*t. If you want good music do not buy killswitch engage's \\" end of heartache\\" because its poison to music. By the way , why emo & metalcore kids all have gay hair styles ? and wear pants that gets stuck insade their a*hole ? Go to hell all of you whiny fa*gots.

I was excited because there were live tracks, and they're Roadrunner live tracks so we know they're good quality. That's the only bonus to the album. The two 'unreleased' tracks, Irreversal and My Life For Yours, have been on the internet since the original was released. If you don't own the original already, get this one definately. However, if you already own the original, there is no reason to buy this one unless you're like me and have to have it all..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent music","review":"I like to search for albums and look at the reviews that I totally disagree with. For Killswitch, I checked all the negative reviews, and for the first time in a long time, I just couldn't figure out why these guys didn't like this band. 'Its not original or creative'? What does that even mean? These guys are just using glib phrases to describe the fact that they want music that sounds more like some other band they like.I have to admit, at first I was a bit turned off by Howard Jones' vocals. I thought they were too dramatic, or operatic. Then at some point (probably when my friend and I spent an entire weekend doing our best Howard impressions) I just started to like the songs. Now, I honestly cannot figure out what I didn't like at first.This album is really good! Bid Farewell, End of Heartache are standout tracks, but its the first album in a long time that I've liked in its entirety."},{"rating":"2","title":"Almost a five....","review":"Killswitch Engage is a band you want to love, but they make it so hard. If it was not for all the emo crap this album would get a 5... the guitars, and drumming are fantastic but the melodies lose me. It sounds forced, as if the record company had something to do with it. I still listen occasionally but Lamb of God, BLS, Mastadon, and Shadows Fall are far better choices. Metal rules!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good to have this CD despite vocal shift","review":"Good CD to have but it ain't great like the first one did. Best track that I love is Take This Oath. Big difference is there is two instrumentals instead of one this time around. Wait for Hope is... to sound like a cross Metallica and old school hardcore punk (Just listen to the chants! Ha ha.)

Howard stick to Blood Has Been Shed. The radio version of The End of Heartache just builds on my disappointment of this album.

Unfortunately Jesse had to leave the band and in stepped Howard. The end of KsE as I knew it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A little repetative","review":"The follow up to Alive or just Breathing and with a new vocalist. I guess he does an OK job filling in for jesse, but i think jesse is still better. Howards screams are better but jesse's singing is better. On this album, the vocals get a little repetative, especially on the last few tracks. They arent bad and this is still an awsome album, but ever since the went on tour with the Used, ive been a little iffy about them. Great Metalcore nonetheless and heavier than a rock!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Buy it, love it and headbang like a madman","review":"Rose Of Sharyn is my favorite Killswitch Song. I loved Alive or Just Breathing and Element Of One is a close second. Darkness Falls has some awesome blast beats in the beggining and remains a killer track throughout. End Of heartache is an Awesome ehhh ballad is the closest thing to call it. All the osngs have their moments and even the band said they wrote most of this while on the road and sometime may feel a little rushed. But its not disappointing at all. Its a solid metal album.Theres alot to be happy about on this record. The inside cover mad for a cool tattoo across my back and when I saw them live got me a chance to hang with the band and get there set list and stuff.

Howard Jones destroys any sort of doubt you might have conjured up over the last year or so with his ever so powerful, melodic voice! This is pure evolution following the metallic masterpiece \\"Alive Or Just Breathing\\". \\"The End Of Heartache\\" is amazing in every aspect of instrumental bliss!

The only difference is they actually have decent lyrics and good transitions from alternative to pure hardcore thrashing metal in each song. I especially like \\"End of heartache\\". You hardly hear metal bands talking about being in love and having their heart broken. They did and made it sound cool in a metal kind of way. (In other words they expressed their pain and heartache from this girl without sounding like p*ssies.) Great band. Good metal. Definitely different.

He drops a lot of names but the story never goes anywhere. It sounds like he dictated this into a tape recorder and had someone transcribe his musings. And I'm not convinced he didn't make a few things up along the way.

One problem, do not bother trying to weight those small packages, it is not a scale to use to weight your packages for shipping, at least not the small ones, does work great for weighting your suitcase to make sure that it under the airline weight regulations."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it. .Accurate, attractive, good price.","review":"I read the reviews after I purchased the Salter scale. I was afraid I had made a mistake, but after five minutes of use I highly recommend it. My sister came home from the doctor's office weigh-in and the numbers were the same. It is attractive and unique in appearance. It operates on carpet or hard surface. The price is right. Yes, it is hard to wake up but lifting the upper edge an inch off the floor and releasing it activates it everytime. Go for it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice scale","review":"This replaced a large-mechanical-dial scale of ours. Looks very nice in the bathroom. Seems quite accurate [perhaps depressingly so].

I used it twice daily, once when I wake up and once before I go to bed. The numbers are large and easy to read on the the scale. Additionally, since there are two pieces of glass, this scale works on CARPET. My bedroom has carpet and I use this scale in my bedroom. To use the scale, you simply tap the scale and wait for the scale to calibrate. Once the scale calibrates you step on it and wa-lah, your weight is displayed. The scale shows your weight to the nearest 0.1.I recommend this product to everyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"nostalgie","review":"the CD Design and the songs are the same that the LP Original.

Ian and Sally are a young married couple who dreamed of leaving civilization and living in a cabin in the wilderness. It took them a year to gather the money and supplies needed, but eventually they made it to a lake in Northern British Columbia, Canada.The book is written from the journals they kept during their 14 month adventure. I was totally drawn into their lives as they described building a cabin and a food cache, the wildlife they lived among, the changing of the seasons, canoeing on the lake, the sounds and smells of the wilderness, and the aurora borealis at night.I just purchased their other two books (Arctic Adventures, and Wilderness Journey: Reliving the Adventures of Canada's Voyageurs) because I want to travel and explore with them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Be warned","review":"The star rating is for the discs, not the music.This looks like a good value for money package - the 1968 \\"Converge/Song Of The Wind\\" session, plus the well-known Chick 'n Lionel MIDEM session (and a couple of surplus tracks that feature only the Hampton band).The trouble is - it may have been afflicted with a disc fault.

The people who he likes get a free ride while those he disdains, for unclear reasons, can do no right. This was the first Feinstein book I have read and will probably be the last. I was unimpressed by his style and prose even though I have heard so often how great of writer he is. After reading the book, I looked through these reviews and realized that I had heard he was a great writer from Feinstein himself, but rarely if ever from an unbiased source who didnt happen to have him as a guest on their show at the time. There are many great books on college hoop, this isnt one of them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Feinstein is a good witer but is lazy and extremely biased.","review":"As a college basketball fan I enjoyed some of the stories this book provided about the Patriot League but have serious issues with Feinsteins credibility. I will never read another one of his books. His bias angainst Georgetown University and anyone else who doesn't cater to his every whim makes me sick. The unprofessional way he handles himself on TV and Radio appearances is quite disturbing. I for one am sick of his biased garbage and extreme arrogance. He acts like everyone owes him something for being John Feinstein."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's a mess!","review":"I stopped reading by page 70, with a headache. He introduces too many players, coaches, administrators, teams, all from present and past, and it's very difficult to remember who is who in all of it. It's like listening to someone who is talking at 75 MPH and didn't bother to plan his speech. I agree with some of the other reviewers who say he should have focused on just one team. Otherwise, he should have written this more carefully, more skillfully. The book reads like it was written in a hurry and given little editing. He jumps from one place to another, and from one person to another often from sentence to sentence. Very confusing. I read his book on Bobby Knight and the Hoosiers' championship season in 87/88, and I really liked it, so this book was a big disappointment."},{"rating":"2","title":"Incredible","review":"I loved this book. The book is intended for the true Basketball aficianado, not a passing fan. You get a great peek at what life is like for some true Student-Athletes, and great insight into life on the road in the Patriot League. I did not attend one of these schools and was still riveted to the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hoops Heaven","review":"John Feinstein is an american treasure. He is the sort of writer that you could sit down with at the bar and talk sports and life. Once again he manages to take the reader inside the world of the athlete in a way no one else can. Once you read this book you will care about the Patriot League and find yourself following their ups and downs next season. If you're tired of overpriced ,coddled, spoiled athletes READ THIS BOOK!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Lehigh Alum","review":"I bought this book since I went to Lehigh and thought it would be extra interesting because of my background and because I played soccer and ice hockey at college. What a let-down!I found the game by game annayasis drawn out and boring. About the only thing I can recommend to you from the book is the \\"amaterism\\" ( if there is such a word) of college sports at Lehigh and the great majority of other colleges in the US that we do not read or hear about on a daily basis.I see you can purchase a used copy on Amazon for $0.99 - so what the hell - for a buck it's worth it I guess."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Last Amateurs: Playing for Glory and Honor in Division I","review":"John Feinstein's book is interesting, but I cannot help but see while reading his work that he falls again into the trap of bringing his own personal bias and agenda into his writings, ultimately providing a disservice to the reading public."},{"rating":"1","title":"A quack on the brink","review":"Those who are regular readers of Feinstein's Washington Post column will recognize the blatent and quite repetitive biases that plague the corpus of his work. I had difficulty wading through Feinstein's opinions to get to what should be the focus of the work, the student athletes. This book is not about the patriot league; it is about John Feinstein. If you have to read a book by him, read \\"Season on the Brink,\\" at least that was entertaining."},{"rating":"1","title":"Okay, but way too long","review":"I agree with other reviewers who said that Feinstein would've been better off following one team instead of all of them. This could also chop the length down to a more reasonable amount. There's just too much going on to remember everything. I didn't even finish the book because it just took too long to get to the end and it didn't seem like the end would ever come. Feinstein could've told this story in about 250 pages instead of almost twice that. Not terrible, but I wouldn't go out of my way to get it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why do people find Feinstein tiresome? Maybe the bias","review":"A couple of recent reviewers have protested that the book is OK and that anti-Feinstein reviewers were being malicious. On the contrary, while Mr. Feinstein may be a decent sportswriter, his views on college basketball are so biased that it is difficult to seperate the book and the bias. So, one can only conclude that anything he writes on college basketball is fiction, at best."},{"rating":"1","title":"feinstein, he of personal agendas has struck again","review":"This guy is really appalling. He is a transparent control freak, who promotes anybody who supports him positively, and trashes those who don't (especially G'town). It really is a shame that such a small man has such a large platform. Save your money and buy something worth more than fish wrap."},{"rating":"1","title":"Read another book if you have the chance","review":"Here's the deal....the author of this book has some very strong biased feelings about college basketball. I feel that knowing this about the author takes away from some of the stories presented. If you want to read this book, please take it as purely fiction because you have no idea if what he wrote really happened like he says. Johnny Feinstein has very slanted views which is unfortunate for loyal college basketball fans such as myself. The book is ok, but you can find better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Feinstein fan, but this one misses the mark","review":"After having read most of John Feinstein's books, this one misses the mark. In fact it would have made a fine article, rather than a book. The continual movement from team to team, that is so effective in his other books doesn't work due to our unfamiliarity with the teams and players. Note that many of the positive reviewers were students or fans of the Patriot league."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Never Give Up League","review":"I've had season bball tickets as long as Alumni Hall at Canoe U has been selling them and rarely miss a home game. This is a great book about a Don't Say Die league. Not only does John Feinstein, who also does color for Navy football games have a keen insight into life at The Yard, he really lets one know and appreciate the fine student athletes at the other Patriot League schools. This is more than a book about round ball, its an solid introduction to a very solid group of schools. If you enjoy colleges for more than training future pros, you have to read The Last Amateurs."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Way College Hoops Ought To Be","review":"This book was a bit of a change of pace for me; I don't read too many sports books anymore. However, I was a fan of Feinstein's previous college hoops books -- \\"A March to Madness\\" and \\"A Season on the Brink\\" -- and this struck me as an uncanny subject. Although the book ostensibly chronicles the 1999-2000 season, Feinstein actually transports us back in time. The Patriot League is college basketball the way it used (and ought) to be -- before TV and avarice transformed the sport into a proving ground for the NBA and a cash-cow for the universities. The kids in the Patriot League play not to audition for the pros, but for the love of the game and the challenge of the competition. Feinstein brings to life the excitement that small-time college basketball can generate -- every bit as electric as the ACC and Big Ten."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great Read","review":"I just finished this book about two days ago. It's refreshing to read about college athletics given the current atmosphere of laughable \\"student athletes\\" and early departures to the NBA by 19 year olds.I was particularly glad given the 2002 NCAA Tourney and Holy Cross' great game against Kansas in the first round. That scenario is nearly identical to the beginning chapter of the book when Feinstein makes his decision to write on the Patriot League after watching a first round game between Kansas and Colgate.I will be sure to watch the league championship game on ESPN this year!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Big time sports","review":"Great look at basketball played by real student athletes, who go to school to graduate and play ball. Great human interest mixed with games played with heart and emotion. Fans will be greatly pleased with this work."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overhyped and Sappy","review":"Feinstein once again thinks the measure of good writing can be calculated by how much sap and melodrama he incorporates into an otherwise mundane story. About the only thing that shines through in the book is Whinestein's personal biases and alarmingly partial commentary. Is he a journalist or a propogandist?"},{"rating":"1","title":"More Feinstein Bias","review":"While the book's topic is a meritorious one, I always have a hard time getting by the author's bias. I have read several of his books and regularly see him in the Washington Post and hear him on the radio. He has a few hot buttons that he can't leave alone and where his one-sided views (good or bad) show no balance or understanding of the whole picture. Few things in this world are wholly good or bad -- Feinstein has yet to figure that out. The ACC is all good, Georgetown or John Thonpson all bad."},{"rating":"1","title":"Amateur Journalism","review":"After years of trying to bash the big boys, Feinstein has finally moved down to the little leagues in a feebly transparent attempt to justify his previous efforts by cuddling up to the cozy, innocent world of amateur basketball. This book just does not make the cut, much like the players and teams featured therein do not make the cut in major callege basketball. During Feinstein's so-called career as a sports commentator, both in print and on the airwaves, he has developed a unique style that is a particularly obnoxious blend of Harvey Fierstein and Jerry Springer. His personal biases are so painfully transparent that mentioning Feinstein and journalistic integrity in the same breath is an open invitation to an oxymoron. The only positive comment that can be made about this book is that amateur journalism and amateur basketball have finally met. Amateur basketball scrapes out the win in double overtime."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lost in another era","review":"Feinstein just doesn't get it and seems to always ask \\"wonder why? and make out big time basketball as some villan, but he makes all his money out of this.....I just read an article in the Post and he brings up the same junk he did 20 years ago......Send this guy packing.... don't buy his book as his pompous arguements have never stood up...."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Lamorna Wink","review":"This is one of the weaker Grimes novels. The emphasis on Melrose Plant was exelllent as was the fleshing out of most of the major characters but the plot was badly resolved and detailed. The usual Aunt Agatha and Long Pid characters were comic if getting a bit tiresome, but the tone was completely at odds with the main plot. Snuff movies, Count Drac and IRA snippets make for an unconvincing mix. She really shouldn't take such serious topics as pedophila and AIDS and bracket them will almost slapstick humor."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another Great Mystery By Ms. Grimes","review":"I thought that this was a very well written book.

She gives no motive for the first murder(s) except one which was discovered well after the fact(s) of such.And would someone please kill Aunt Agatha. She's consumed more fairy cakes than I can count and I don't even know what they are. And it is so Boring's to read about it over and over and over again.Grimes has created a wonderful character in Melrose Plant and she should \\"run with\\" him. Jury is so sunk in a mire (or fen). Even Wiggins is more interesting than Jury and I want to smack Wiggins a lot of the time. I can also do without CarolAnne, Mrs. Wasserman, and Stan Keeler(& his dog).This \\"series\\" has run its course unless it takes a big turn."},{"rating":"2","title":"Disturbingly good....","review":"The subtitle of \\"The Lamorna Wink\\" says it's a 'Richard Jury Novel.' It isn't: Melrose Plant is the central character throughout most of the book. As usual, Melrose is likeable and charming, with friends who are delightful characters, absurd representations of 'high society'.In contrast to the froth is the underlying evil and perversion which is the impetus for the crimes and murders which take place. No, it's not pleasant subject material, but it is all too real--not even the gentle last scene can take away the bitter taste in our mouths.But this is a good book: well-written and moving, with a plot line that is suspenseful and finely drawn. And it makes its point: no matter how much money and glamour one has, or how desperately one would like to escape the ugly side of human behavior, evil is a reality for us all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Has Ms. Grimes ever actually been to England?","review":"I ask because no-one in England misspells \\"Provo\\", \\"Weetabix\\", or says \\"nine-fifty\\" when they mean ten-to-ten; there were lots more Americanisms, but those were the worst.Those nitpicks aside, this is by far the worst book I have read this year, despite it coming fairly highly recommended. Utterly, utterly dire characterisation. These characters are so wooden they'd give Pinnochio a run for his money. And the \\"plot\\" is just laughable, despite Ms. Grimes dismal attempt to spice things up with a little snuff.Want a good \\"cozy\\" detective story?

I really enjoyed this book in particular since I had see the \\"Uninvited\\" movie referred to in the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Melrose stars at last!","review":"It was nice to see Melrose Plant take the lead. So far, \\"Stargazey\\" is my favorite Jury novel, but I found this intriguing because we learned so much more about Melrose and Maccalvie. One thing which really surprised me, and I wonder what others thought, was the brief scene between Melrose and Bea. I don't recall ever seeing such a scene in a Jury book before. Does anyone else? It just seemed so out of character for Grimes to write, as did the children's deaths which were very sad and macabre. But the scene between Bea and Melrose really stopped me cold, especially since it didn't fit anywhere into the rest of the book, as far as I could tell anyway. Anyone else have any thoughts?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Shocking","review":"I was a great fan of Martha Grimes until this book. The use of the children not only had no point in the story but was upsetting, disturbing and not necessary. In fact I put the book aside after Macalvie viewed the video. I don't know how an author who showed such empathy in her other novels would write one with such a tasteless overtone as in this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Grim Grimes","review":"I received \\"The Case Has Altered\\" for Christmas and enjoyed it immensely, so I immediately went out and purchased \\"The Lamorna Wink.\\" Big mistake. Obviously this is usually an enjoyable and entertaining series. But not this time. The focus on child snuff films constitutes an ugly error in judgement. What did Grimes think she was doing? She provides her readers with not one, not two, but three graphic descriptions of young children being tortured and murdered. We get the usual whimsical Plant/Jury shenanigans, but mated to material that is distressing in the extreme. Where is the fun in that? If a writer has to stoop this low for a plot, or is unable to judge just how inappropriate the plot is in relation to her own characters, perhaps it is time for her to move on to another line of work."},{"rating":"1","title":"It&#65533;s a mistake","review":"How could the writer make such a mistake as to misattribute the classic Dover beach by Matthew Arnold to another poet. What happened to the editor? The strange handling of the death of children was offensive. The ingénue character has somehow remained a very young woman despite the passing years and incongruously has forgotten about record players, which she used in earlier books - duh! The mystery of this book is why it was published?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disappointed","review":"I was most disappointed in Lamorna Wink. After reading every one of her books written before 1995, I found this one to be decidedly unpleasant. The sleazy story line about killing innocent children for the thrill of a snuff movie was unnecessary. Also woven into this story was an equally sickening plot line about another child who was murdered for revenge. Come on, Martha Grimes, get out of the gutter! There are some sensationalistic topics that are just too unutterably disgusting for any but the most perverted and you have managed to touch on them all here! Bring back the characters we love and leave the seedy storylines OUT."},{"rating":"2","title":"An excellent read","review":"An excellent book...I couldn't put it down once I picked it up. When will her next book be out?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Never Again","review":"I had read several of the Richard Jury books and enjoyed them very much. This one, however, is my last. There were a couple of jarring elements, perhaps because I haven't read the books in order. For example, Melrose Plant's love interlude seemed totally out of character. What makes this the last one I read is the treatment of the two children's deaths. The author should have put a warning on the front cover."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst \\"English\\" mystery I've ever read","review":"I am confounded by 2 things - how this book was ever published, and why I read it to the end! Most contrived, convoluted, drivel I've ever read. I enjoy mysteries and I guess I kept thinking this would come together, but it never, ever happened. Although I may have read one other Martha Grimes, this one put the nail in the coffin. I truly cannot imagine a more poorly conceived book, at least as far as innocuous books - designed for entertainment - go. Combining the murder of 2 small children and 3 adults, with the banal \\"comedy\\" of aristocrats conspiring to prevent a potentially bad marriage for a member of their inner circle --- what was Martha Grimes thinking? What were the publishers and editors thinking? I am so embarrassed that I finished it. I'll take that secret to my grave!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Good story comes to bad end","review":"I wonder what Grimes was thinking as she finished this novel. She takes a delightful amateur detective story and spoils it with a graphic account of a sadistic child murder. In the final chapters, she mixes scenes of unbearable cruelty with local pub amusements that are not funny in the context of the tragedy we are reading about, and add nothing to the story. Richard Jury shows up only long enough to lose interest in all the plots and subplots. And after being actively involved in the entire mystery, Melrose departs the scene before it is unconvincingly resolved with one of the perpetrators in the sadistic murders going unpursued."},{"rating":"2","title":"A strong Jury novel, albeit with \\"little\\" Jury","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed the latest of the Martha Grimes \\"Richard Jury\\" series, in spite of Jury's near absence in the book. Melrose plant figures strongly and there is just the right mix of the usual Long Pidd characters. Strange (nearly gratuitous) plot twist at the end in the continuing saga of VivViv and the Count.... I suppose it's the \\"cliff hanger\\" type of thing that makes you wonder what is coming in the next book. Anyway, enjoyable reading in spite of the rather \\"dark\\" solution to the disappearance of the two children. Overall, it's one of the better of this series."},{"rating":"2","title":"Darker than her previous mysteries, but still a good read.","review":"And even though Richard Jury played a much smaller part than usual, I enjoyed seeing Melrose Plant take centerstage. I like both of these characters very much. The other continuing characters appeared just long enough to be entertaining without being over-powering. The deaths of the two children seemed so incredibly sad to me. Especially when we find out how they really were killed. Tragic, and a showing of the depths to which some people can sink."},{"rating":"1","title":"A weak plot","review":"This is my second Richard Jury book and I find it disappointing. Off to an interesting and richly characterized start the grand \\"mystery\\" depends on an utterly absurd (not to mention distasteful) event awkwardly inserted into the plot almost as an afterthought. I don't recommend this book even for Jury fans - Jury himself doesn't enter the fray until almost the bitter end."},{"rating":"1","title":"Who really wrote this book?","review":"What a disappointment! If you compare the writing style of this book and Stargazey to the older Martha Grimes, you begin to question which is the work of the author. The tight, witty dialogue is gone, and there is just the bare bones left of any kind of real relationship between Jury and Plant. The plot itself, which centers around child snuff films, is enough of a reason to skip reading it. If you must have this book to round out your collection, wait for the paperpack version. I wish I had."},{"rating":"1","title":"Betraying the Trust of the Reader","review":"Every mystery writer has an unspoken obligation to his or her readers: to entertain, or even frighten, but in a way that is ultimately enjoyable, like a really good roller coaster. Even if the ending is sad--as some of Grimes' have been, over the years--the ending should be fair to the audience. A good three hanky ending is acceptable; a slap in the face, like the one this novel provides, is not. Grimes jollies the reader along with the usual cute antics of her investigators and their companions, only to hit us with a punch line that is far from funny and far from fair. Those kiddies whose demise we've been investigating? They were the product of snuff films. They were filmed as they slowly drowned, sobbing for a place in a boat left deliberately out of reach; the films would be sold for the sexual gratification of others.I have been reading Grimes' work since her career began. This book ended my readership. Never again."},{"rating":"1","title":"awful","review":"Really awful ! I do resent the late introduction of the snuff film plot.

It's in the trash."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shockingly Bad","review":"I am at a loss to understand how anyone could enjoy this novel. She relies on an utterly disgusting \\"snuff\\" murder of two children for the plot. Who thinks of such things? Maybe mystery writing gets to you after a while....I am hot and cold on Martha Grimes--she is a bit like the nursery rhyme, \\"when she is good, she is very, very good; and when she is bad she is horrid.\\" Skip this one and try one of her other books. Unless, of course, reading about murdered children is your idea of a fun-filled afternoon."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pass This One","review":"I'm sorry that I bought this book.

It cracked easily during normal use due to thermal shock. The cheese and sauce burned on and is difficult to remove. I have a normal size oven and this is a bit too small in width. The pizza cutter is also junky. It would be better to buy a better one separately.I replaced this stone with a set of unfinished clay tiles from the hardware store (one whole one and one cracked in half that do a much better job of crisping the pizza because they hold more heat and yet they haven't cracked under heavier usage."},{"rating":"2","title":"baking stone","review":"I own two round pizza stones which are used more for baking cookies than pizzas and this rectangular stone works great because we can fit a dozen ccokies on it that always turn out perfect."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cracked after 2nd use","review":"I bought this to use with the Artisan Bread in 5 Minutes book.The first time we make one loaf of bread and some bagels.

I must be doing something wrong, although I follow the instructions. I preheat the stone before I put the pizza or bread on as instructed. I don't wash it much so it will keep its oil as instructed. I definitely don't use soap. Everytime I used the stone, I end up getting soft crust! I have to then move the super hot, heavy stone out of the way so I can rebake the pizza/bread on a naked oven rack to crisp it up.

The timer works as advertised but the audible alarm is not very robust, you cannot hear it from another room. Control of all of the various functions is somewhat confusing, certainly non-intuitive.Worse, the magnetic strip on the back of the timer is affixed to the plastic body with double-sided tape that will fail in very short order, allowing the magnet to separate from the body. My first timer fell off the front of my fridge onto a hard tile floor, shattering the case and destroying the timer. Amazon replaced that at no charge. A second timer did exactly the same thing after about a week's use, although this time I expected it and it only fell to the countertop.Instead of the dual timer, I do recommend the Polder 898 Clock, Timer and Stopwatch, available in Black or White, $15.00. It is very loud, comes with a laynard so you can hang it around your neck, and is simple to use."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointing!!","review":"I read in Cook's Illustrated magazine that this timer was *the* timer to buy, but I am very disappointed in the product. I gave it two stars instead of one because the dual-timer function is great...but other than that, I don't have anything else positive to say about it.The biggest detractor is that the alarm is VERY quiet...so if you're more than a few feet away from it, you'll likely not hear it go off. You can wear it on your waistband, but who wants to do that?I'm likely to throw it out and replace it with something else. Don't buy this product!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice, but has problems","review":"I love that you can set this timer for two separate things at once and I also really like that you can see both times at once. Switching between times on other timers can be difficult with messy hands. But the display is nice and big and easily readable.I wish it had one or two more times you could set simultaneously. But the biggest problem I have with this timer is that if I leave the room, I can't hear it, even if the exhaust fan is off, so I have to take the timer with me when I leave the room and sometimes I forget to bring it back in with me and I lose it.Otherwise, it's a fine, user-friendly timer."},{"rating":"1","title":"OK Product","review":"Good performance as a timer.Easy to read and use.Do NOT put this on your fridge .. it WILL fall off and break.Use it as a desk timer or use the small loop to hang it.DO NOT TRUST the magnets to hold it to your fridge."},{"rating":"1","title":"can't hear it","review":"The alarm is so quiet you have to have it next to you in a quiet room to hear it beep.

It has a plastic scratch cover over the front when it arrives (like most new things do). When I removed it, it came off fine, but after a few days, the face of the timer was etched everywhere the scratch prevention cover had been touching it. I can even see the small bubbles where it didn't seal all the way. The entire clear face now looks like etched glass.

The men are impotent and women can read minds. He is selected to mate with a healthy woman, who happens to be mute, to continue the human race.There are a bunch of crazy mutants held prisoner, who escape and the pilot has to try to get back to his jet before others destroy it and escape back to the past.Cool futuristic sets and and bizarre ambience.While cheap, it's not bad the way \\"Plan 9\\" is.

Ulmer's \\"Beyond the Time Barrier\\" is still one of the best little science fiction films ever made and is as relevent today as it was when it first came out. Filmed in black and white, the film makes creative use of simple geometric shapes to depict a not-too-distant apocalyptic future. Our test pilot hero Robert Clarke leaves his base one morning and an hour later returns to the same base, except he finds himself in the future. He falls in love with pretty Darlene Tompkins, is menaced by sly villainess Aranne Arden (Ulmer's real life daughter) and is tutored by wise Vladimir Solokoff who, as a veteran actor, adds cred to proceedings. \\"Beyond the Time Barrier\\" questions the rate of human progress and how we use technology. One day it would be great to see all Ulmer's films released on DVD with commentaries and interviews. \\"Beyond the Time Barrier\\" in particular deserves this treatment."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Time Barrier","review":"The Time Barrier is a very good film. I always enjoyed watching Robert Clarke in various films and on television. I understand that he was very prominent in the science fiction genre. I believe that this movie is very well made and does comment on the greed that some people have after making discoveries that could potentially benefit others. The character of the deaf-mute empath is very interesting in this movie. Without speaking a word, the actress creates a very interesting and memorable character. I would recommend this film to others."},{"rating":"1","title":"owners experience","review":"Book was in great condition..but unfortunately it did not come with the accompanying cd !

It especially touched on the topic of linked lists very well, explaining the concept in the most simplest way possible.

Either cover the subject or not; but don't do a [poor] job. This book, although good, does that \\"exercise\\" thing. It devotes a whole chapter to describing Red-Black Trees, and then doesn't even provide an algorithm, but leaves it up to the reader to look in the references for a book that covers the algorithm or code. It does the same for B-Trees.As I said, the book is good, but that \\"exercise\\" thing is a big hot button for me. I would rather have the author just say that there are other data structures called such-and-such that may be better for certain use but they're outside the scope of the book.If you're an absolute beginner (as I am), and don't mind a $50 book teasing you and then telling you to buy another $50 for the complete answer, go ahead and buy this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"I'm very satisfied","review":"great product. i have no complaints. the book was in good condition as promised and i received it on time. thanks again."},{"rating":"2","title":"EEEExcellent Data Structure Book for Starter in Java and C","review":"For various data structures and algorithms covered in this book can be ported to ANSI C quite successfully.

His description of Machs or Machiavellis who seek power only for its own sake to advance themselves, is extremely realistic, convincing and a challenge to principle people to take back organization politics from the pecking order obsessives and make organizations own awowed purpose a central guiding light.

Despite its title it includes the Saskatchewan proper between the Forks and Lake Winnipeg. That said, the basic idea is good. Regional studies that mix geography and history with some literature and tourism are always valuable.

I had previously bought different worm lights available out on the market, but only one works as nice as this one. However I do have a complaint about it however, it uses (2x) AAA batteries and the GBA uses AA. I found that I did not like having to have both types on hand, also AAA seem to drain faster. Also if you are not a fan of the magnifier an adult can easily remove this, but I found that it causes strange shadows; also probably voids any warranty the company may give. There is a newer light out that resembles this light, but it does cost more. I have that light as well and love it, but it is more and not a lot better; so if you need to save a few bucks this one works great!"},{"rating":"1","title":"What a JOKE!","review":"This movie is HORRIBLE.

The young director takes a personal interest in Meagan who can't resist him.Meagan spirals downward as her career goes upward. She has dreams were she talks to her dead sister who tries to get her on the right path. The film was packed with cliches, stereotypes, and mediocre acting. To assist Meagan in her downward/upward spiral, other video girls influence her.Meagan is excellent as a video girl, but the rest of the film lacks credibility and is clearly a \\"come to Jesus\\" film.

Rape attack."},{"rating":"1","title":"Replacement for toilet paper?","review":"I watched this movie thinking it might be a Honey knockoff and probably not that great but I like movie that show decent dancers.

The part where they shoot a music video in front of a green screen made me want to throw my remote at the tv. It was so poorly lit that you could see artifacting on Meagan Good.

I confess I could only read about 60 pages of this book. What's the point? The author starts off by using such obscure words one needs a dictionary to follow the text. As if that wasn't enough, he starts inventing words to encapsulate the \\"cutting edge\\" concepts he's propounding. Can't say I agreed with much of the first sixty pages; I threw it down in disgust.

It is a grand opus from a time when academics were still willing to pursue grand themes. It has been 30 years since OC was written and scientific advances have added a level of confirmation to many of Jaynes's theories and predictions. I imagine his predictions will continue to find confirmation as we probe deeper. Whether you agree or disagree with Jaynes's theories, you owe it to your mind to read this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"so you want to think about your brain","review":"This is a book for people who want to struggle with an understanding of what actually goes on inside their mind. It is not really a book for the lighthearted, nor is it full of real upbeat entertainment.

I found it somewhat heavy going but worth the effort."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fascinating","review":"This remains a fascinating and seminal exercise in scholarship and original thought. Ranging from archaeology to religion to psychology to cerebral physiology with the ease only an extraordinarily fine and well filled mind could accomplish.The Origin of Consciousness should be on every thinker's must-read list, early in life.David Lloyd Sutton"},{"rating":"2","title":"Easy, riveting, and necessary reading.","review":"If you ever wondered about the nature of mind and consciousness,this is a delightful way to begin your quest for knowledge inthat arena. This book provides a solid introduction to thestudy and problems of conciousness, and goes on to proposea framework for clarifying some of these problems. Jaynesuses the current knowledge in neurology and psychiatry todefine the various aspects of what we now call consciousness,and then traces vestiges of these aspects in human history,litrature and archeology to arrive at a fairly plausiblehypothesis on when and how consciouseness may have evolvedin the human mind. Even if you find Mr. Jaynes' argumentsnot convincing, you will certainly find his erudition and scholarshipeducational and entertaining."},{"rating":"2","title":"A revelation!","review":"This book will blow your mind! I believe it to be the most important book written in the last century. It challenges all current thinking about how man developed the ability to become consciously aware of both himself and his surroundings.Never before has the origin of religion been so eloquently explained in a single work. As more and more research takes place over the years I am convinced that Jaynes' theories will be proved to be true beyond any reasonable doubt. The idea that man invented his own consciousness only about 3,000 years ago seems incredible at first, but Jaynes' arguments are compelling and his evidence so strong as to be most convincing.He proves to me beyond any shadow of a doubt that Mysticism is a default mind state that precedes consciousness itself, it is merely the search for authority outside of the individual himself. We humans have much to learn from reading this Magnum Opus."},{"rating":"2","title":"An essential read","review":"Jaynes' book was a revelation to me when I first read it, and five years later on a reread it remains one of the most interesting books I have ever read. The Oxford professor's central idea is that the the consciousness of early man may have been much more alien to us than we dare admit, that 'the Gods' once 'spoke' to man, and that their leaving was caused by the relatively development of the corpus callosum, which allowed the two hemispheres of the brain to communcate and drove the collective schizophrenia out of human society. With impeccable credentials and a good knowledge of early history, Jaynes's hypothesis is readable and plausable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic Book!","review":"Bravo! And another 5 stars! I, too, read this book years ago and read it again recently. An anthropologist by training, a voyeur of human behavior by inclination, and an atheist by good fortune, I find Jayne's ideas compelling and original. His theories command attention, they are so bold. Only by abandoning superstitions of imaginary creator deities can we begin to guess what \\"really\\" happened back then, how reflective consciousness evolved. Can you imagine the long expanses of quiet - no TV, no radio, no telephone, no electric lights, no sirens, bells, horns or whistles - and hour after hour of thought and contemplation? I, too, would like to read more of Julian Jaynes."},{"rating":"2","title":"There is nothing like this....","review":"In this book, Jaynes hypothesizes that five thousand years agi, people obeyed the voices of 'gods' without conscience. They lacked the ability to think. As intellectal as this sounds, this book weaves together a very cohesive argument based on literary and architectural records....Why would one read a book on an obscure topic by an author who published nothing else? Simply, one must because it is that smart. It becomes a must read. It will blow your mind."},{"rating":"2","title":"Persuasive, careful argument for recent emergence of consciousness","review":"The Origin of Consciousness in the Breakdown of the Bicameral Mind,Professor Jaynes argues that language preceded the emergence of consciousness in humans, and uses sources from archaeology and literature (i.e. the Iliad) to demonstrate that evidence of a mind conscious of itself does not begin to appear until around 1000 B.C. The argument is presented along with possible objections where they can be made in a fashion more rigorous than many in the field of psychology. He even traces his own arrival at the premise through stages reflecting many of the previous theories on the subject. This book requires careful reading and rewards the reader who takes the trouble with a clarity on the subject unusual in this field of study."},{"rating":"2","title":"be challenged","review":"if you have read or glanced over the other rev iews for this book you will see it is deeply provocotive. Because of the length of other reviews I will keep mine short:This is a serious book. I read this book with the intention of not really believing any of it and at the start of every chapter when Jaynes introduces a new example for his thesis I simply laughed and said no way! - but by the end of the chapter I had come around to his ideas being reasonable.Each chapter will challenge you in this way and then go about offering the \\"proof\\" for his arguement.It is highly recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pedagogically Unsound!","review":"Up until now I had been very impressed with the Starting Out Series by Everyman Chess. The first two books I studied were great (they were Starting Out: The King's Indian and Starting Out: The Colle).Starting Out: The Ruy Lopez did not measure up to either of those books in my opinion. The format is basically the same but the author just did not explain things well. His annotations were dry at best and completely uninformative at worst! There was also no real room for further study or analysis.I recommend the other two Starting Out books mentioned above but cannot in good conscious recommend Starting Out: The Ruy Lopez. These books are meant to be heavy on explanation for newer and improving chess players. The annotations contained in this book functioned more as bland comments with no instructional content."},{"rating":"2","title":"powerful story and characters","review":"This is the work that forever tied me into the world of anime.

The adapter side that went into the Playstation itself was loose, but never seemed to act up.This lasted me a couple of weeks before it finally died, and when I went to unplug the controller from the extension in an attempt to make it work again, I discovered that the plastic itself had bent and broken at some point.This isn't worth the 8 dollars it cost me after shipping."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is good","review":"Got this just as I needed it.

In any real movie, the editor/director would have re-shot the scene.When the dead hitchhiker is getting raped on the couch, you can see the camerman's shadow.Henry's scar on his eye keeps changing between scenes.When the doctor is preparing to give Henry shock treatment, he has the nurse take out Henry's glass eye. While he's shocking Henry and questioning him afterward, it is obvious that the eye is still in place, the actor is just looking upward to make it more ominous.The actors' \\"accents\\" were too funny.

You can purchase this system with all necessary items and still buy ten or twenty games for the cost of a new console and two or three games, not to mention you have the ability to play this thing virtually anywhere, especially on road trips. The only downside to the screen is you might have issues with reading text displayed on it, and the use of a gun is purposeless, becuase the sreen is small and shooting at it would just be plain pointless.

The hip-hop is truly amazing in this cd too, but is definitely more mellow than the mainstream rap you hear nowadays. For anyone who likes jazz and hip-hop and can do without explicit lyrics (which you will find on the 3rd volume), this is absolutely a must."},{"rating":"1","title":"good idea, boring rapper","review":"In principle guru's experimentation on jazzmatazz is a good thing. The variety of guest artists adds diversity and originality to each track, and gives the cd a distinct jazz flavor. However, there is one problem with the album: guru really isn't a very good lyricist. His rhymes are boring, simple, and formulaic. An example from \\"take a look at yourself\\": \\"In there gettin funky with the track/I used to drive a cadillac/it got me there and back.\\" As you can see, the lack of diversity in guru's delivery makes for a fairly bland album, despite its experimental nature and promising direction."},{"rating":"1","title":"Does not shine as bright as Gang Starr (sorry for the pun)...","review":"I got this CD used based on some of the reviews on here. Don't trust them (except me, of course).I really like Gang Starr. Guru is in Gang Starr. Guru makes a Jazzmatazz record. The next logical step would be for me to like this record, right? Wrong.One of the problems I found with this album is the music. I don't see how this is a Jazz & Hip-Hop fusion. It sounds like a bad Hip-Hop record with samples of bad Jazz melodies - not new recordings with musicians. The Jazz portion doesn't feel like genuine Jazz. Furthermore, there are too many choruses and hooks. I felt like I was hearing too much of the same thing. Longer verses, musical breaks, anything else would have been better.My advice: sample it before you purchase it. This is NOT a no-brainer pickup like the review score and the name on the album cover may lead you to believe."},{"rating":"2","title":"May Guru live on in us all","review":"There is not too much to say about this album, it's simply uplifting spiritual ecstasy.

Being myself a specialist in another field this is downright inspiring and encouraging.

When you get to your destination or vacation and it rains or you are stuck somewhere, pull out the regular adapter and play continues with no need to pull apart anyone's TV setup.Of the screens I looked at out there, this is the best. First, it is a sony product so the warranty stays intact and the fit is the best out there. The visual quality is great and the speakers work suprisingly well. I have had it for over 6 months and criss-crossed the US and Europe with no problems. I would recommend this to anyone who enjoys their PS."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Product","review":"I recently got this LCD screen, and I couldn't be happier. It makes out of town trips more enjoyable, and the quality is superb. DO NOT get other brands, but get only the genuine Sony screen.

Also, be sure to keep the image on the screen moving, or it will freeze."},{"rating":"2","title":"Buyer dissapointed","review":"My son was very excited about this lcd screen, therefore we thought he could take it in the car, because that was the purpose of buy it.

She never really got the hang of it and it never really seemed to work well. It was one of those soft rubbery gummy style ones that you can not take apart.After some searching and reading reviews we settled on this one. Within the day of delivery she was actually able to use it very well. It comes with an extra string and it clearly comes apart for maintenance so for the money it is a good deal.I have been using a yo-yo for a long time myself and at one point in the past used to be able to do some tricks. I was able to pick this thing up and was able to get the hang of it on the first try and knock out some of the old tricks.So for the money it is highly recommended for beginners and beyond."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Yo-Yo!","review":"I love Duncan yoyos! They're durable. This one is great for tricks. It makes a great gift too."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Yoyo","review":"The Bumble Bee is regarded as one of the best yoyos you can buy. Like all yoyos it takes a little getting used to - it's one of the lightest yoyos available - maybe THE lightest, so if you're used to heavier yoyos it will take a little getting used to. Also, because of the unique friction pads inside, it takes a little breaking in. But for the beginner it's very good - the lightness makes it less painful when it returns quickly to your hand. You can throw this thing all day without getting bruised - you can't say that with many other yoyos.This is a 'modified' shape yoyo, with rounded inner and outer edges and flat sides. It's good for loops and average for string tricks (better than a 'classic', but not as good as a 'butterfly'). Once it's broken in, it will sleep for a reasonably long time, but (in my experience) not as long as a heavier yoyo, such as the Team Losi 'Da Bomb'."},{"rating":"2","title":"bumble bee yo-yo","review":"This is a good yo yo , Because a kid needs some skills, because it might be a little difficult to retrieve once it goes down.

He especially loved the part where the little dinosaur eggs would hatch and there would be little baby dino's. I recommend to anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good but...","review":"Only one thing didn't make sense. Why put a young Anakin in the final scene when Ben, Anakin and Yoda are observing the celebration of the defeat of the Empire? (Return of the Jedi) George Lucas should have left Anakin as he was in the original - OLD. No way Anakin could enter the Force at the same age as his son Luke. That was really dumb."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the Films I grew up with","review":"While I must concede that I have been anticipating the release of Star Wars on DVD since the format became mainstream - I am severely disappointed in the treatment presented here.These films are not the original Star Wars films from '77-83, these are not even the versions released in '97 as definitive. What we are given here is what Lucas would like us to believe is his \\"true vision.\\" Be that as it may, the movies pale in comparison with his \\"half-finished\\" works from 25 years ago.With that in mind, these are great DVDs. The picture is good throughout (aside from a few skips). However, an important note is that the Audio is horrible through most of the trilogy. Not only are there major adjustments to the volume of the score in comparison with effects, but the channels are botched in 5.1, and there are also sequences of drowned out dialogue."},{"rating":"1","title":"Excited and Bummed in Seconds","review":"I had been waiting anxiously for the Star Wars blu-ray release. I own the original theatre release of IV, V and VI. I also purchased the so-called \\"enhanced versions\\". I was prepared to buy the six film blu-ray set, only to find it won't include the original theatre versions. I simply don't understand the logic. I understand wanting to have continuity with the later films but, don't alienate :) the old school fans. I hope George is reading these reviews. There is a large portion of his audience that feels this way. I will wait until I hold the box in my hands to confirm there are no original versions. If there aren't, I for one will not be making the purchase."},{"rating":"1","title":"Message in a bottle : listen","review":"It sure is a shame that a legacy which has been built on such an ardent fan base would have to be tarnished by the unwillingness to listen..

But these new changes really take the cake; over-dubbing Jeremy Bulloch's dialogue as Boba Fett with a very flat sounding Temuera Morrison ruined ESB for me, and RotJ just isn't the same for me anymore without the Ewok song at the end.

It was a cleaner, more polished version of his original smash hit. It was still a good song, but something was missing. It just didn't have the 'Feel' of the original. Less sorrow, less ferocity. Del Shannon felt his original 1961 version was too gritty, and he could catch a bigger audience if he just cleaned it up. He was wrong. By re-recording it, he had changed the song. Purists, and fans of the golden era of Rock n Roll wouldn't go near the re-recorded version of 'Runaway'.This is how I feel about The Star Wars original trilogy.

Because those are the ones that gave you your fortune, that we fell in love with growing up. The ones we paid for in 1977, 1980, and 1983. So yes, George, you imbecile, you owe us THOSE versions.

The man has no respect for his original work, and disowned it like a father would his son. What kind of respect should we have for the poor delusional soul who can't make up his mind on how he wants his movies edited.

I hated the special/enhanced/modified/desecrated editions when they came out on VHS and DVD many moons ago and there's no need to see that fecal matter in 1080p on a 136\\" screen.

Those movies were so exciting and fresh... it's a shame that Lucas won't leave these gems alone, or at least give us viewers a choice.But really, it's not THAT big of a shame.

He completely destroyed everything about these movies that were so great. Those out-dated effects still work today and the puppets look better than CGI effects made these movies spectacular! The fact that George wont release the original, and TRUE versions of the movies proves that he isn't an artist to respect, but more of a business man, with no respect for any of his fans or anybody that helped him put those original masterpieces together.

What was wrong about Han frying Greedo?? The alien was giving two choices to Han: to turn him to Jabba to collect the reward or give him money to forget he saw him. (...)It's annoying that George doesn't want to please his fans with the one thing we've been asking for YEARS... having BOTH versions in the DVD.

I think it to be a grievous mistake to take movies from our past and change them to such a degree as Mr. Lucas has here.

I'm happy that it came on DVD and when I have money I'm going to get it and it will be sort of great to see the new scenes but he needs to retire from Star Wars and make no more of it.

I don't want to make a big deal, but I mean come on! What's next? Maybe 10 years from now Lucas is going to make changes again to Episode IV? What could possible he do to make it wrong?

The original uncut version was one of my favorite parts and now they totally ruined it. There is now a big computer generated plant mouth(that looks like the plant from Little Shop of Horrors)coming out of it. This made me soooooo mad I had to fast forward it! Why in the heck would someone want to add that in? I could go on and on about the stupid new scenes but that would take for ever.

Any and almost ALL dvd/star wars fans would have wanted to see the ORIGINAL THEATRICAL releases of these films perhaps cleaned up but not redone to the nightmare they are now. If you couldnt even be decent enough to your fan base to NOT wreck these films then I think you should have LEAST given them the option to purchases the UN-CGI releases of this particular trilogy. The reason these theatrical cuts will NEVER see the light of day is because lucas has cut,spliced,editied,them to death. He has gone too far to go back.

I'm shocked that people are buying this set, and thinking it's a good deal, just to get 3 of the butchered versions that will just end up in the trash. Really? $110 for the 3 movies that you really want? I just don't get it people. Stop playing his game.

If you already own the trilogy, there really is no reason to buy it again. Why not release these movies on DVD? The official position from Lucasfilm is that George doesn't have the time to do the movies on DVD. Does he print them himself in his garage. This is just another example of Lucas milking it.

I could go on but I'll just skip to the last one. They changed Anakin's force ghost!! People say it doesn't change the story, of course it does. The movies is called RETURN of the jedi, the older force ghost represents the return of Anakin, changing it to a younger Anakin is changing the whole story of that movie. The effects are ruining the story, like the prequels. People say that kids like the new generation which is based on only effect, effects are nothing compared to a good story and good characters.

Hopefully, they same will happen here. I can't think of anything better than to see this tripe collect dust on the shelves of stores all over the world.

At least with the Thx 1138 release though their offering both versions in a boxed set, like spieberg did with e.t. Thank god for spielberg, if it was'nt for him god knows what lucas would have done with the indiana jones trilogy with cgi.

The prequels so far have been superb, and I believe Episode III will be the best Star Wars film of all.

I like some of the digital touch-ups. But every single bit of dialog he added since 1997 should be trashed.And one more thing. Why is he continually changing the original trilogy to match the crud he delivered in the prequels. That's just plain dumb.

Well most of us at least.These are not the original movies, they are tidied up versions with 'extra' scenes.

We get a daft sequence of Han-Solo talking to a CGI Jabba which looks like a college graphics project. Worst of all is the new song and dance routine in Return of the Jedi which makes Fraggle Rock look like West Side Story.A digitally remastered version of the original movies would be unmissable, these tacky cash-ins should be left in the bargain bin along with the colorised versions of Black & White classics."},{"rating":"1","title":"Way to butcher your films, George","review":"After looking forward to the release of these films for the past year, I am left seriously disappointed. George Lucas seems to believe that poorly done CGI makes for compelling viewing. I had read that there were only a few \\"minor\\" changes in this DVD set, a claim that is completely false. Entire scenes with dancing CGI characters have been added (like the end of \\"Jedi\\"), and the background music in many of the scenes has been changed. Particularly offensive is a scene in \\"Jedi\\" where the seedy lounge singer in Jabba the Hutt's place has been replaced by a \\"wacky\\" animated version straight out of Disney. Puh-lease.

I'd rather watch Antonioni's trilogy of solitude, Bergman's religious trilogy, or listen to Emerson, Lake, and Palmer's Trilogy. The best film Lucas made was the original THX 1138. When I saw the first film, the film broke a few times, which was more entertaining than anything on screen. Luckily, Lucas has decided to end the series, which all of us can be grateful for. These films are, however, superior to the prequels, which shows how bad the prequels are..."},{"rating":"1","title":"This isn't Star Wars","review":"Does George Lucas have the right to add silly, out of place, crude-looking special effects to these movies decades after their initial release? I guess he does, because here they are.If da Vinci had gone back to the Mona Lisa years later and painted a mustache on her, would it still be a work of art? I guess it would, but it would not be the Mona Lisa anymore. So these DVDs may be works of art and may still be worth watching, but to label them \\"Star Wars\\" is nothing short of a lie.You could buy these DVDs today, or you could wait (maybe forever) for ol' Georgie to release the original versions of the movies on DVD. Personally, I'd rather watch a faded, grainy VHS copy of the real movies for now. Eventually the real versions of these movies will be released on DVD; if there's money to be made in doing it (and there is) it will be done.Stay away for now."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not buy this DVD set!!!

Hayden Christensen appears instead of the actor used in the 80's, also Naboo appears in the celebration. THAT'S ALL.If you own the software of Star Wars , \\"Behind the Magic\\", you'll find images that George Lucas, made of Planet Tatooine and he never incluided. Except in this software.In DVD 4 it's just the story of mister Lucas and his problems, to take Star Wars to the cinemas, a story we all know.

Initially I was prepared to overlook the changes for the sake of something very special now enhanced in 1080p glory. However having seen these changes and how pathetic they are this is not something anyone should put up with. I've waited this long for star wars in blu ray, I'm happy to wait longer for either the originals in blu ray or 3d blu ray.I must admit I thought everyone was just nitpicking and being overly harsh with the changes, but see them for yourself (or better yet YouTube it and save yourself the money) and disappointment is a given. I wouldn't even classify myself as a fanboy either so god only knows what all you real die-hard fans feel about it all! Shame on George Lucas."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just say NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!","review":"Of all the changes George Lucas has made to Star Wars over the last two decades, putting the stink of the prequels in Return of the Jedi's pivotal scene is the last straw.

I have mixed views towards the Special Editions. I like some stuff, like the pan galactic celebration in Jedi, and getting to see more of cloud city in Empire. But I thought Jabba looked too CGI, and Greedo does NOT fire first, period. The films were just fine. Did we really need this? Anyway, I wish they'd put out the Originals, I've heard that Mr. Lucas is destroying all the original prints of the trilogy so that the only version left is the Special Edition.

In my opinion the best movies of all time, it has everything you want in a good movie:Action, romance, excitement, danger and adventure. These elements are rarely found all together in a single film franchise and if they are it is usually put together very badly. For adults this takes them back to their childhood years, pretending to play games like cowboys and indians, I mean tell me someone who has watched star wars and not pretended to have lightsabre fights with their little brother, and for the kids these movies give them a sense of adventure inside. These three movies are the best of all time.

VHS is good enough, isn't it?? We can be PATIENT and wait for the DVDs, yes?? Besides, DVD is just another format that has tended to spoil a lot of us into thinking that VHS should be gotten rid of completely. That's bogus! Lucas doesn't have the time right now to even THINK about the DVDs. He wants thought put into them so he can put lotsa' great extras into them. He doesn't want to rush them. I applaud George Lucas to take the time to make every one of his products special and precisely thought out. He's busy enough with making Episodes II and III as it is!

George Lucas is suppose to ADAPT the prequels to the original trilogy, NOT the other way around. Hayden Christiansen SHOULD NOT APPEAR as Anakin Skywalker in Jedi.

These movies look brand new -- there's a digital perfection to every image. The downside is... there's very little emotion and nothing to engage you. While the effects are startling, the digitized colors feel both rich and fake at the same time. They don't \\"feel\\" like the movies I've grown to love.The new scenes -- Lucas has destroyed the finale of jedi with new bad special edition music and having Luke looking on a ghost father younger than himself (Hayden Christensin), which makes very little sense. The new fast cutting of the final ewok village detracts from the reunion of friends who have made it through thick and thin.To his credit he fixed the bad jabba in star wars and got rid of the dumb scream in empire when luke tumbles down the vortex at Bespin.But these movies have lost the fundamental emotion Lucas created.

The only film I have seen since then that the audience clapped for was Titanic and the clapping at the showing I attended was not nearly as loud or as long as for Star Wars. This tells you a lot about this film. People seeing this film for the first time now do not get this same feeling because they have been subjected to so much high tech that it appears to be below the standards. But those that saw it when it first came out realize that it broke new ground and the special effects were wonderful and ground breaking at that time.

I hate the fact that the only way for me to see the original versions of these three SciFi landmarks is to see an old, damaged, crappy VHS at a rental store that some Psycho(like George Lucas) tore apart. The only thing that I have left to say is at least Gene Roddenberry left Star Trek alone and didn't screw it up like George Lucas did.

Empire Strikes Back and Return of the Jedi lack the initial punch, but taken as a whole it is an immensely rewarding set. The prequels are more spectacular in terms of scope but nothing compares to the impact these movies had on the general public when they came out in the late 70's and early 80's. 2001: A Space Odyssey lavishly portrayed space but took a decidely existential approach to the subject, whereas Star Wars treated space as a wild frontier.

Well, for some crazy reason George went PC and RECUT the scene so Greedo (in a really weird re-jiggered shot) shoots at Han first! What!? We knew Greedo was gonna kill Han, and when Han beat him to the draw, that was cool! This scene got a cheer back in the day. Now it's just confusing. And don't even get me started on that dumb Jabba scene or the \\"musical number\\" in Jedi. This is like New Coke. A total disaster.

I was expecting some super-science fiction extravaganza with the best special effects you've ever seen. I was sorely disappointed. The special effects are good, for the 70's. Today, they are hopelessly outdated and even distracting. I can see why somebody could become fanatical about this film, there are billions of characters to ponder over and there are little \\"hidden things\\" in the film to look for, but I have no desire or interest in ever seeing Star Wars again.

If Mr. Lucus waits any longer, he may wait past the point to where we just won't give a crap anymore. If maximum sales profit is all Mr. Lucus is concerned about and the fans be damned, then I suggest Star Wars sales would have already reached their peak at this time, and it's all downhill from here.

But the fact remains that Lucas is squeezing the life from the trilogy by reselling and reselling the old material in new packaging. When will he stop? Maybe start giving us newer editions of Indiana Jones instead.Buy this edition if you haven't already been scammed into buying his last year edition.

The original, unaltered trilogy but with remastered picture and sound, and special features galore, including deleted scenes. Sure, Lucasfilm could easily do this, creating a true \\"ultimate edition\\" - but, these flimsy re-releases still sell, so if they release the ultimate edition, especially on Blu-ray, these fans will have all they want. Lucasfilm will sell these well, but it doesn't bode well for the future. That's why they continue to sell these on DVD only, and in about five years (as another on Amazon has commented on) they will finally come to Blu-ray, but - I guarantee it - they will only be the special edition versions that the fans do not want.

The original trilogy is now full of edited scenes, CGI bits that look awful, and changes that make no sense. George Lucas should know that while people love Star Wars, they love the original Star Wars. There's a reason that he made the prequels, because the originals (which you can only buy on DVD in one release (2008) which is twice the price of the whole 6 Blu-Ray movies) were awesome.Just like Darth Vader now says \\"NOOOO\\" to the Emperor, everyone needs to say no to George Lucas and not buy this \\"Star Wars\\" release."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wait for the Real Original Movies","review":"Do not by this set.

Not going to touch this with a thousand foot lightsaber. To give the fans the respect they deserve for making this franchise as big as it is, and to do right by all the people that worked hard made these films great against all odds, Lucas should do the right thing and sell (for massive profit!) a proper bluray transfer of the REAL films, and I don't mean as a half-assed special feature on the 2nd disk either."},{"rating":"1","title":"Original Theatrical Release Please","review":"I won't be purchasing this product because it lacks the original theatrical release.

Making changes (adding or cutting) is akin to blasphemy as far as I'm concerned. Furthermore, being of an age that allowed me to see 'Star Wars', 'The Empire Strikes Back' and 'Return of the Jedi' during their original theatrical release ('77-'83). I cringe at the thought of watching what Lucas has done.However with that said I have to admit the 'Star Wars' trilogy as it is still demands enough loyality and interest to persuade many to acccept them as offered.

I was very excited for the special editions when they were released in the 90s, but let us face it, George Lucas has lost his touch. He relies to heavily on ILM, which has very low grade technology, especially when compared to Weta Digital (the special effects creators for Lord of the Rings). Lucasfilm has tanked just like Disney.

It's bad enough that the blacks are crushed, the lightsabers haven't been fixed (save for maybe 2 shots), audio errors from the 2004 set remain, there are weird color casts, etc, but adding insult to injury by adding the NNOOOOOOOOO!!!, obi's howl, and adding all of the other pointless revisions shows a stunning level of mistreatment for some of the most important films in cinema history.

One day (even if it is after Lucas is dead) the REAL triliogy will be released and these will be forgotten like the colorized Three Stooges Georgie himself hated so much.

The release of his \\"reworked\\" special edition ignores what the fans really want, and that's for Greedo to not shoot first, for the most part. I'll buy it, of course, but seeing that so many of the special features on the fourth disc are just previews and demos of other products you can buy to fill George Lucas' pockets sickens me."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'm not buying this.","review":"As a Star Wars fan, this dvd set makes me sad. Most people here are complaining about the lack of non-special edition versions, and they have reason to complain. There's really no excuse for leaving them out when the Alien Quadrilogy had two versions of each movie AND commentary tracks. That aside, it's the special features disc that REALLY bothers me. Unless they announce more, there only seems to be a few featurettes, deleted scenes, trailers and a demo for a (...) Xbox game. What a waste of disc space that is. That measly collection of extra features could have been put together by a fan years ago. Lucas said he wanted to wait to make the OT dvd set special, well, this isn't it. I'm going to wait for the uber dvd set they'll make after the third prequel is completed.

I was happy to see Indiana Jones finally appear on DVD, unedited and fully intact. I was hoping to see a similar treatment for the DVD release of Star Wars. DVD offers the ability to provide the special editions and original theatrical releases together, but not for Lucas. He has decided the original versions are no longer relevant and only the (un)special editions represent his true vision. The added special effects were distracting and looked worse than some of the effects created in the original release.

But the marketing ploys that have come along with it have really killed the mood. It started with VHS, one movie per tape. Then came the fancy boxed set. Then shortly after came the theatrical CGI update. Then came the VHS CGI-update boxed set. Then came the various incarnations on DVD, sold separately as full screen or wide screen, then came the boxed set. Then came the prequels (ok... this part didn't market me to death). Now it's time to double dip with blu ray. First we have the boxed set... cool. Why was the original non-CGI release not included? One blu-ray disc can hold both versions. Look for it later on yet another incarnation of the franchise. I give the original trilogy 4 stars, and the prequels 2 stars.

The task of this release is the carrying of the Episode II-trailer. The films are really good, but we don't need another release. The remastering isn't done quite good, listen to the surroundsound of TESB, it is clear but not good encoded (my personal opinion).Lucasarts continues in their polticis of releasing products of minor quality (Episode 1 PC-Game, Many Stuff of the E-1 Merchandise). I think many fans will be able to pay higher prices for better quality.To come to an end, this trilogy is only for kids and people that entered the starwarsuniverse through Episode 1 for the first timeJovo (i'm not 12)"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Star Wars Trilogy remains unbeaten!","review":"I would like to say that surprisingly, each of the three films of the Star Wars Trilogy has been my favorite at one point, which is proof of their quality. For me, each Episode provides new elements to the story, and helps the plot to progress, ultimately leading to the great finale. To this day, no other sci-fi film or franchise has reached the level of these awesome movies; not even the new Star Wars films. This Trilogy remains the best entertainment you can get.I have only one question: when are they going to be released on DVD?!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Return of the Unaltered Trilogy","review":"I got this box set knowing that the dvd was non-anamorphic, But fortunately, If you're watching this on a computer or an HDMI TV, then you could zoom in to a better format (though the subtitles would be cut off). I also knew that it was a bonus feature. Other than those drawbacks/nitpicks, this is a satisfying box set. It DOES have the original versions of the trilogy despite it's controversial format. I DO agree that the original trilogy should be in an updated format, but if you can cope with or solve (via zooming aspect ratio) the format, you will be satisfied with this box set."},{"rating":"1","title":"Should of been a lot better for what I paid","review":"I don't know what they were thinking when putting this set together.

This edition is just a downright shame, and the quality is worse than the first Special Edition release. For one thing, George Lucas should be ashamed that this was allowed to be released again, and on VHS, no less. Whoopty-do, it has flashy packaging and a \\"featurette\\" that has NO interviews with the cast and dances around things about SW2 that we ALREADY KNOW. If you just happened to miss the SE the first time, go ahead and pick it up. Otherwise, just let it rot on the shelf. George, I certainly hope, for your sake, that when you FINALLY release the DVD's of this Trilogy, you include the ORIGINAL, GOOD versions of the films.

Taking the magic out of the Force by giving it a pseudo-scientific explanation. Stormtroopers explained by cloning a super-bounty hunter (except, apparently, his ability to hit what he aims at). George Lucas has revised his masterwork to the point of incoherence.

I just can't watch it. Something just doesn't sit well with all the extraneous additions. I don't mind a little cleaning up and tinkering. For example, I kind of like what they did with cloud city in Episode V. There were just way too many changes for my taste though.

We KNOW the originals were made in the 70s/80s, to put Hayden in ROTJ is pathetic! Because we know it's an add-on it takes so much from the realism of the film.The ewoks in the original were singing such a cute song! and the scene felt so intimate because we didn't see how the rest of the galaxy were celebrating- it was our heroes celebrating in a quiet, intimate place!Ugh I despise my new purchase! I can't believe I have to buy another bundle of DVDs when the originals come out."},{"rating":"1","title":"trying to hard to connect","review":"the sound, and visual quality are great and its nice to have them on dvd, but the films have been altered further to create more continuity, including voice dubbing over boba fett's original voice, altered dialgoue between the emperor and Darth Vader with a new holographic emperor in empire. and the last scene in return of the jedi the original actor who played the spirit of anakin skywalker has been replaced with hayden Christensen. All of these things really alter the films for me and make it a far different trilogy than the one I grew up with. So I will say I'm not fond of the changes and additions."},{"rating":"2","title":"Remember Laserdiscs","review":"These are three of the best movies ever produced, in their original form. The revamps to these movies wouldn't be a bad thing if they were integrated well. The primary disappointment with this box set is the absence of the original films. This means that my Laserdisc set is still the definitive star wars set. They could have easily transferred these over to DVD with minimal cost as they do include commentary. The only downside to the Laserdisc set is that it is 16 sides. Sigh..."},{"rating":"1","title":"DO NOT PURCHASE!!!","review":"To anyone who hasn't heard by now, George Lucas has really gone to town on destroying this DVD. He has super-imposed Hayden Christenson's body into ROTJ at the end, when Luke see's the three ghosts, he has gotten rid of Obi-wan's howl that scares away the sand people in ANH and replaced it with something that sounds like a car alarm, he has changed dialogue in ESB so it seems that Darth Vader didn't know he had a son, also in ESB he has taken out the creepy hologram image of the Emporer and replaced it with that of Ian McDeirmont, the actor who plays the emporer in episodes one and two. These are just some of the changes, not to mention dialogue that was changed and clipped. Show Lucas that WE WANT THE ORIGINALS!!!! DO NOT BUY!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Wow, is Star Wars gonna change every few years now?","review":"Well, lets just say that the changes might be for the better, but I think its more or less that Lucas has to fill the holes in the storyline that didnt work at all.

They are just presented and gussied up but there is absolutely no motivations or sense... the additions are ludicrous - especially these days after witnessing the Lord of the Rings achievements . The much praised music is warmed over Stravinsky, Wagner, Brahms, Puccini, etc.... one wonders if John Williams has any sense of shame...... The characters of Leia and Han are irritating and Mark Hamill is such a bad actor standing next to Alec Guinness - - one more thing - i don't recall that it was so difficult to understand many of the lines - this smudging of sound is a disgrace"},{"rating":"1","title":"The Other Reviewers are Right","review":"I love the Star Wars movies, and I have seen them more than a couple times, as I'm sure everyone else has. But this is outrageous. I see no need for ANOTHER repackaging and redistribution of the same Star Wars movies. I could see if it included Star Wars: Episode One, but it doesn't. It does have a featurette on the making of Episode II, but there is nothing else new here. So if you already own them, don't bother. If you do not already own these classic works of Science Fiction, and can't wait for them to come out on DVD, buy this set now, but only under those conditions."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not high quality!","review":"While the video is better, the color restoration is inconsistent (some things change color, even in the middle of a scene). Worse, the audio is really bad, especially in some of the dialog scenes in A New Hope. The noise it so bad in some, it sounds like someone off-camera is using a power saw.

I am interested in seeing an \\"updated\\" version that incorporates the prequels...but I still want the movies that I've enjoyed for years. I'm sorry Lucas didn't like the special effects back in 1977..clearly most of us didn't have a problem with it, judging how popular the films still are today.I've been looking forward to these DVDs for a long time, but now, less than 3 weeks before the release, I'm finding that I'm not that excited about it.

The Alien Quadrilogy has both versions for each of those films.I think a lot of people (literally thousands) will be downloading pirated versions of these films just so they can get the original version. That's a lot of lost DVD sales. The set could have had both, but inexplicably didn't.I feel sorta disappointed. After all, these were my favorite all-time movies."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Gonna Do It","review":"I see now that I have to hold on to my THX laserdisc original versions a whole lot longer.I will absolutely, unequivocably, NOT buy this. It really irks me that George Lucas shows such flagrant disrespect not only to fans of the films, but to the films themselves. In the interest of brevity, let me put it simply: RELEASE THE ORIGINAL VERSIONS! William Peter Blatty and William Friedkin did it right with The Exorcist Blu-Ray: they treated the original 1973 version and the 2000 expanded edition as seperate entities, and gave each a lavish and respectful co-release in one, awesome package. That way, Mr Lucas, you present your updated version, while still honoring and respecting the hallowed place the original films hold in the hearts and imagination of a generation.

A 2nd disc could have that version on it. A 3rd disc needs to have about 8 commentary tracks (at least). A 4th disc needs to have interviews with the entire cast. A 5th disc needs to cover Star Wars merchandise. A 6th disc needs to have the film with ALL the unused footage thrown back in, including the original opening sequence (according to the script) with Luke and his friends chatting on Tatooine, or at least ALL the deleted scenes.

I guess, for die hard Star Wars fans this new box-set must be great, but there are many star wars fans out there who eagerly awaits the DVD's.The reson I give this box-set 5 stars, is because the Star Wars movies are classics!

Some people hate the modified version of the Star Wars Trilogy, but the modifications make this film enjoyable to watch on a GOOD home theater set up.

People who welcome these changes are part of the generation of fans who prefer movies that use a \\"story\\" to show off special effects rather than use effects to help tell the story. Yes, I know the meat of the story in this trilogy is very much in one piece. However, who would want to see Gone With the Wind or The Wizard of Oz be \\"updated\\"?

George Lucas has joined the Dark Side...more machine now than man.By the way,...when the Death Star blows up at the end of episode IV, all I can think of is the Klingon moon, Praxis, blowing up at the opening of Star Trek VI.

If you want to polish the effects because you couldn't do so in 1983, fine. But changing the context of scenes ... it just hurts the legacy of these films. The Vader sequence at the end of Jedi that has been changed was one of the few perfect moments in that film.

What made Star Wars special to me was the humanity of it - it had an almost mythological significance to our culture - it wasn't something we went to see simply for the special effects - it was deeper than that.

I love it all, and the more Star Wars the better for me.This DVD collection is absolutley amazing. In comparing the original in-theatre teaser trailers (included on the special features disk and look awful - scratches, pops and all) to the beautiful images in the films, I can only imagine how painstaking it must have been to clean these classics up frame by frame.The results are breathtaking, and the sound is incredible. Not to mention that having them on DVD is just so convenient - no fast forward or rewind issues, etc.There are also several \\"easter eggs\\" or hidden features on the bonus disk - most notibly the hidden \\"gag reel\\" or outakes from the films.

Still haven't gotten any response. Customer service apparently does not exist here. I would not recommend them."},{"rating":"1","title":"There's a reason George's last name begins with an L.","review":"Not giving fans a choice to watch the original theatrical versions in HD on Blu-ray is an insult to anyone that remotely cares about the integrity of the movie industry. I think I'll just go read Mein Kampf instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't go with these versions","review":"So unlike many other Star Wars fans, I wasn't greatly bothered by the changes made in the 2004 DVD release. Disappointing as they were, they were too minor to ruin such otherwise great movies for me (although the CGI sarlacc was really dumb). However, this release is an entirely different matter. One of the best scenes in Film history where Darth Vader is finally redeemed is completely ruined by the insertion of Darth Vader yelling \\"NOOOO\\" several times. It messes up the entire suspense of the scene and turns it into nothing but a joke. I don't want the next generation to grow up watching this version which why I urge everyone to rate this set 1 star. Casual fans of the series or parents looking to buy this for their kids need to know that this is not the version to go with.On the other hand however, I look forward to watching the Blu-ray prequels. Apart from the replacement of the Yoda puppet, they have been left unaltered."},{"rating":"1","title":"George Lucas ruins the films (again)","review":"George Lucas can't leave well enough alone. Between Han shooting first, a new scream from Obi Wan Kenobi, a new \\"NO\\" from Darth Vader, etc., don't buy this if you are expecting to see the version of the films that we all know and love."},{"rating":"1","title":"Goodbye Forever!","review":"I was excited to see the original (and best) Star Wars films make it to Blu-Ray. I made a pre-order. I thought about how awesome \\"Empire\\" would look in 1080p.Then I saw the clip of Darth Vader saying, \\"Nooooooooo!\\" like a drama mama, new for this release of The Return of the Jedi. A great scene totally ruined because George Lucas can't leave even anything alone. You wouldn't catch Peter Jackson doing this.I've canceled my order. With apologies to Amazon, I can't buy movies that have been ruined by the filmmaker."},{"rating":"1","title":"Restore the Originals","review":"Your new versions are crap, sir. Please consider the majority of us who want the originals simply restored. No enhancements needed. We want the movies we loved and grew up with. I will not buy this and hope no one else does either. Thanks."},{"rating":"1","title":"Big Disappointment","review":"Not what I was wanting or expecting. Yes, you get the original, un re-mastered version on one side, and the newly re-mastered on the other side. Don't get me wrong, the re-mastered version looks amazing, EXCEPT it has the deleted/additional scenes in it that weren't in the original. I think the deleted addional scenes are stupid and ruin the films. George Lucas has become an expert at ruining his classic works of art with the new trilogy as well. So yeah, I may still have the original version on one side, but it's not remastered and it looks like I'm watching it from a VHS. Why they couldn't just take the re-mastered version and cut out the stupid scenes is beyond me. I was so excited for this to come out....what a bummer"},{"rating":"1","title":"Please let us see the original versions","review":"It would be no big deal to put the original versions in this set. I have no problem with them cleaning up the prints, fixing some bad mattes, or adding color. But don't mess with the edit! The pacing of the first movie was EPIC and speedy. The added scenes and special effects take AWAY from the movie. I will buy a blu-ray player when Mr. Lucas decides to give us the originals. In other words, I won't be buying these or a blu-ray player anytime soon."},{"rating":"1","title":"I must have a bad memory","review":"The cgi additions are just aweful. You go from cgi out the wazoo outside the cantina scene to the hokey costumes in the cantina - this really shows the 25+ years gap in technology and to add it just diminishes the validity of the movie's content. Just imagine if the matrix, lord of the rings, terminator (pick your favorite sci-fi movie) had their movies modified based on technology 25+ years from now. It may seem trivial to some but the reality is is that adding cgi to a film made in the 70's is just campy and degrades the visual experience.As most have already stressed, just give us the original and the modified versions. Is Lucas really this disgusted with the gaps between the 2 trilogies ? I do not think the changes made really impact the gap between the 2 series.Just beware - Lucas adds cgi whereever possible throughout these films."},{"rating":"1","title":"We are not whining!!!","review":"It annoys me that those of us who have decided not to buy this DVD set are being called whiners by some other reviewers. I believe it isn't right to ask people to shell out $41.99 or more for movies that are not the ones we grew up with. It might just be a few tweaks here and there, but to me that is not the same movie. I refused to buy the special editions on VHS and I refuse to buy this set now."},{"rating":"1","title":"Changes....WHY?","review":"While young viewers won't know the difference, George Lucas' changes to these films, especially Jedi are pathetic.He turned the musical sequence in Jaba's palace a modern-ish hip hopish music video and the worst of all is in the end, they show multiple celebrations on various planets. I don't need explain how bad this sucks.This is just the tip of the iceberg."},{"rating":"1","title":"not widescreen","review":"This product says \\"widescreen,\\" yet when you play it, it is NOT widescreen.

I have seen more realistic special effects on Saturday morning cartoons."},{"rating":"1","title":"Noooooooo, thanks.","review":"\\"Nooooooooo!\\" Wow. There was nothing wrong with the original ending. It was dramatic and well done. Sure, making Vadar scream \\"Noooooo\\" ties it into Ep 3. This change defiles a previously powerful scene. I won't even begin to try to guess why it was changed. Other reviews have already described the imperfections retained in this release. Noooooooo, thanks. I'll pass."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not even if it was free","review":"I saw the DVD special edition and it was terrible.

Why would you use a word you do not know ze meaning of?) of extra tidbits, including color commentary from Lucas and Carrie. BUT NO OPTION TO WATCH THE ORIGINAL. Lucas is such a control freak he won't give US the option of watching the original OR his bastardized updates? Isn't that the beauty of DVD formats? The room to let the viewer decide?

It took years for him to finally release a DVD Star Wars film, and when he finally did he at least gave us the original series and not the computer edited farce re-release (though later he did do exactly that). A Blu-Ray disc CAN hold both versions of the film, so why doesn't he just put both versions on the same disc?Please continue to give this one star and ask Lucas and Fox for what we all really want: The original trilogy as they were released. As the title suggests: Star Wars ORIGINAL trilogy.Thanks loyal fans!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The worst version of the greatest films","review":"Unreal. I finally get around to watching and it's NOT the original but instead I have paid nearly $100.00 for the awful, horrible, \\"weirdly inserted crappy updates\\" special effect version.

Thanks for the false advertising butt-wads."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great films, but different boxed set.","review":"The films in this Star Wars set were awesome, but not what I had in mind. I was expecting the set from 2008, but it was the one of 2005 to promote the release of Revenge of the Sith, the best of the prequels and the darkest in the series. The set of 2008 has the theatrical and 2004 enhanced versions, but this one just has the latter versions standalone. That would explain why it costed about $24.00. I am dead serious. It was neat, but when it comes to ordering used films online, please be careful.

Not unlike many other people I am sure. I am the Star Wars generation and damned proud of it.

(especially if you can manage to watch them back-to-back!!!)My only problem is with the new digital effects- I would have been happier if Lucas et al would have simply cleaned up the color and sound, as is done with most DVD transfers...The films just don't need any tinkering!!! I prefer the originals (even the funny smudges below Luke's landspeeder)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Star Wars saga is the greatest ever!!!","review":"The whole Star Wars saga in my opinion is the most extradorinary, compelling, and it has many story lines a person has to follow. When Episode 2 and Episode 3 comes out we will learn more about the story of Anakin Skywaller and how he becomes Darth Vader. Every movie has a purpose and every movie makes this wonderful saga to fit like a perfect puzzle. Yes Phantom Menace was a great movie, people are very short sighted not too see that. Phantom gave a lot of clues about what is going to happen in the future, all you have to do is follow it closely. To people who don't like Star Wars, GET LOST! No matter what anyone thinks Star Wars is the most popular and most talked about movies of our lifetime. 99.9% of people you ask have watched Star Wars. All we need is to wait til 2005 and I can pick up all 6 of these movies on DVD, now that will make everything complete!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Noooooo","review":"Cancelled my preorder, adding Vader saying Nooooo as he throws the emperor in to the reactor was too much for me.

In seen 27 of episode IV the video and audio is choppy in 3 areas."},{"rating":"2","title":"Special Edition, what did you expect?","review":"We all knew that when they released the THX Star Wars Trilogy back in 1995 that that was the last time we'd see the original versions. That release funded the restoration and changes made for the Special Edition. So if you want to be purist, watch it in its original crummy quality on VHS, or be total geek and get the LaserDiscs if you want better video quality. I for one am excited to see the special edition on DVD. The changes and improvement relieve some of the hoakiness and cheapness of the theatrical versions. DVD is a modern format for modern movies, why not put the most modern version of Star Wars on DVD."},{"rating":"1","title":"What the hell was HE thinking?","review":"First of all I'd like to say I am a big fan of the Star Wars Trilogy. I think it is great fun to watch these movies, but sadly, I dont want to anymore. When the \\"special editions\\" of these movies came out in the late 90's, I was very excited. After seeing \\"The Empire Strikes Back,\\" was very disapointed. The CGI looked terrible! It was so out of place from the 70's special effects. Keep in mind, I have grown up in this wasteland of tasteless movies featuring crappy CGI. Bottom line, if you like these special editions, be happy with a piece of trash. For those UNCOUNTABLE MASSES that aren't, Boycott it with me!"},{"rating":"1","title":"No Sale","review":"I'm not falling for this again. Lucasfilm got my money twice in 2004/2006 and we still don't have a decent transfer of the unaltered original trilogy.

He probably didn't even know what star wars was when return of the jedi came out. So, instead of this, please stick with the VHS verison which haven't been messed with.

In 1977, 1980, and 1983, three landmark action/adventure films were made. They were: Star Wars, Empire Strikes Back, and Return Of The Jedi. I will now rate each one.STAR WARS (9/10) For 20 years, this was the most successful motion picture ever. The story of a young farm kid who becomes a Jedi-in training with the help of the rogueish Han Solo (Harrison Ford).EMPIRE STRIKES BACK (10/10) While this was the least successful of the trilogy, I like it best. There is more action than the others, and it shows better character develpment.RETURN OF THE JEDI (8/10) Return Of The Jedi is the worst of the original trilogy, while still being a very good action movie, all the actors are too old, and it seems to lack the power of the two others."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lucas won't get my money","review":"Hayden Christiansen (however his name is spelled) as old Anakin????

For REAL fans, the best option is to transfer the VHS tapes to DVD/CDROM until Lucas does the right thing and relases the REAL trilogy on DVD, not his botched special edition attempt. As for the best trilogy on DVD? Lord of the Rings, by far. When the original Star Wars Trilogy goes on sale then it will be a close race, but not the crappy special edition.

Don't count on him including the 1978 TV Wookie Holiday Special though - but if you have seen it, you will see why.Mr. Lucas, we all love you and your films, but please don't make us wait until WE ORIGINAL FANS who grew up with the films are in our wheelchairs before giving us what we ALL want - A BLU-RAY EXTRAVAGANZA!"},{"rating":"2","title":"star wars trilogy","review":"I purchased this for my son and he loves Star Wars he sits and watches it over and over."},{"rating":"1","title":"Originals Vote","review":"Another vote for the Original release...

BUT THAT'S NOT ALL. They appear to have continued work on these films, creating even more footage to be wedged into the films, including adding a shot of the prequels' Anakin Skywalker, Hayden Christensen, into the end of Return of the Jedi. You can easily find this shot online if you look for it. It's upsetting. It's a bait and switch: this isn't the movie anyone grew up with. George Lucas doesn't seem to know when to leave well enough alone, and his films and his fans are suffering for it. Don't buy this now; wait until they release the original editions on DVD, which they most definitely will."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Pleased","review":"Lucus could just as easily release both versions on DVD to please everyone, but do you think he cares one bit about his fans other then their money? Of course not. I urge everyone to sign the petition for the original trilogy on DVD. There are about 60,000 signatures there right now. Maybe if the number grows to 500,000 signatures he might change his tune.. not wanting to miss out on the extra money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Might be worth a look","review":"While I agree that having this trilogy on DVD finally with all of the new features (not new effects) and extras is probably a good move for star wars fans, I can't say I am excited about the release the way I wanted to be. Episodes I and II were a huge disappointment and further brought to light how Lucas ruined the original 3 with the re-release. It is worth it for anyone to get a good laserdisk copy of the original movies and get someone that loves them to sample it down to DVD format. Laserdisk was great quality and with the affordable HD video editing software out there today, a good DVD of the orignal 3 can be made. There are probably even people selling the orignal releases somewhere out there.I am not a fanatic at all. Lucas really did ruin his creation and reputation. Not quite as bad as Michael Jackson, but close. I am a real-world casual movie lover and this is just bad."},{"rating":"1","title":"Older folks will be disappointed","review":"This is straight from the PR folks at Lucasfilm:The Blu-ray discs will feature the 1997, 2000, and 2003 versions of the film, with additional edits made by the filmmaker. There is now one definitive version of the films thanks to technological advances, which have made it possible to achieve the visual effects the filmmaker originally intended. This will be the version released on Blu-ray.So I hope this answers some questions."},{"rating":"1","title":"Originals please","review":"I agree with the sentiments here. George, the ORIGINALS WITH 5.1 surround sound mixes. STOP being such a cry baby about how much you hate the originals and realize your FANS are the ones who LOVE them so much.After all, without the FANS, you'd just have had another THX1138 on your hands as far as popularity goes...1 star only until you correct your error of a lifetime."},{"rating":"2","title":"CHOICE, GEORGE, PLEASE!","review":"Listen, I need the original trilogy.

And God forbid, hire a good screenwriter and Irvin Kershner for Episode III. I guess it's too late now. I'll never again see \\"Star Wars\\" \\"The Empire Strikes Back\\" or \\"Return of the Jedi\\" the way I did in the 70's and 80's. I better kiss it good-bye, thanks to you, Luc-*ss."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enjoyable, of course, but not great BluRay quality","review":"We enjoyed the videos but were a little disappointed in the picture quality.

Now, I don't think my friend got an unfair price, although I feel it's a bit on the high side to be paying for butchered classics.If I were to buy this trilogy, six dollars (two per movie) sounds more reasonable to me. Despite the fact that Lucas destroyed a legacy and toyed with the childhood dreams of many of us, if he decides to drop the price to six bucks for the whole thing I'll consider buying it.After all, DVD's can make attractive drink coasters."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Easy To Rate My Favorite Movie So Low","review":"I was watching the new DVDs and I've finally had enough of Lucas's tinkering. I enjoyed the special editions in the movie theater because I thought it was nice to see something different. Now I realize I will have to live with them forever as being the Star Wars. I will always be disctracted by the new scenes and the movies will never be the same. Tinkering with something that was great does not make it better. I'm sure you can find a list of differences if you want to look for what Lucas has changed. It just does not make the movie better."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'll stick with the orginal vhs versions.","review":"To be fair I must state I havent seen these yet as they havent come out yet. But I do know these are the horrid special editions. If you grew up watching star wars then steer clear of these but if you didnt maybe then seeing the changes and alterations wouldnt bother you.Personally I refuse to buy these. I hated the changes made and not one single alteration was for the better of the movies and just lowered my perception of lucas which hit rock bottom when his prequels were released.Go rent or buy the old vhs orginal versions which are easily found or buy the indiana jones set if your itching for dvd quality lucas."},{"rating":"1","title":"A new hope?","review":"I thought the title was Star Wars.

We finally get them and he tinkers yet again. Lucas clearly has obsessive compulsive disorder and these movies are proof. He can't leave well enough alone. Furthermore, he refuses to at least do the decent thing and release ONE version for those of us who'd like to see the originals."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the original","review":"These movies are definitley not the original movies that we all saw 25 years ago, but if you can live with all the new special effects they are fine. All kids love these movies because they are up to date but they do not even look as good as the original ones. The Jabba and Greedo scenes in A New Hope are pretty bad. I think they should re-release the original films and that would make people much happier. The best thing about this setI think is the bonus DVD."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boycott! No theatrical release!","review":"The money grubbing narcissitic greed wh*re George Lucas has once again ignored the multitude of Star Wars fans who have made him a billionaire and refused to include the far superior original theatrical releases on blu ray.

He hasn't created anything worth viewing in decades and he won't get my money again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Major disappointment","review":"This set was suppose to be good, it had potential. But a tweaked digital master from 2004 can't do any wonders.And that's not the worst. It's Lucas's tinkering with the movies with every release. This is the 3rd homevideo release since the Special Editions came out in -97, and the movies had been quite different every time.Enough is enough."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why has the rating gone up?","review":"A few days ago, the overall rating for this was 2 stars. There have been nothing but one star reviews since then. Now, all of a sudden, it's up to 3 and a half, even though 99% of the reviews are one star due to Lucas' stubbornness. Looks like Lucas' goons are at it again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another ex star wars fan","review":"Sad that George Lucas is not finished screwing up his brilliant (first three) movies.

VI. Believing that the use of the ORIGINAL artwork for the discs' box and no mention of the special editions on the box I bought a copy happy that I had in fact just missed this release due to my busy work schedule leading up to the holidays, but an hour later I was ready to call Lucasfilm and raise hell with their deceptive marketing practices.DO NOT BUY THIS SET.

Before you do something silly and buy this set, please check out Obi-Wan's new krayt dragon call and Vader's new line of \\"No... NOOOOOOOOOOO\\" at the climax of episode VI... Think long and hard about whether George Lucas deserves any of your money.I will be happy to buy the star wars films of the 1970's and 1980's if they are ever released, but I will not spend money on this garbage.I encourage all real star wars fans to avoid this product and give it a one star review."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh no, not again ...","review":"I have stopped counting the number of re-releases, re-re-releases and re-re-re-releases of the trilogy - and I can't help the feeling that this is all about ripping me (the customer) off ... or should George Lucas be in some kind of financial trouble, and that's why he keeps throwing slightly altered editions on the market? I am already looking forward to the June 2001 re-release with an exclusive 3-minute interview on the planned schedule for filming Episode III ...I have always considered myself a big Star Wars fan (excluding ridiculous Episode I), but somehow I am getting fed up with this ...

There is soooo much material published post return of the jedi in the \\"star Wars Universe\\" to make a hundred NEW movies. YOU DONT ADD NEW TECHNOLOGY AND RE-SHOOT SCENES TO 30 YEAR OLD FILMS! Remember colorizing! Old stories are \\"updated\\" (usually very unsuccessfully) by a new generation makeing thier movie i.e. Sabrina, Ocean's 11, Charlie & the Chocolate Factory, Planet of the Apes etc. etc. Show off cartoony CGI with new projects!!! like the awful new Star Wars movies!

That would be awesome!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Greedo didnt shoot first","review":"Well, I would welcome this set if it were the original theatrical releases, but every time George releases these films, he manages to change more of history in the process. For those of you too young to know the truth-these films are not the original theatrical releases, and farther from it than you might think. All I can say is that HAN SHOT FIRST, period. George Lucas gets rich, we get revisionist history. Would you want to watch Casablanca in color?Did you know that in this DVD version of Jedi, Lucas has superimposed the face of that Hayden actor onto the face of the original Anikin Skywalker at the end of the movie when Luke is the only one to see their Force lifes? Amazing that Lucas has done this, just amazing. Dont buy these films, find the orginal on Laserdisk or old-VHS, then burn them to DVD on your own.

Why? Because of this monstrosity. Even the extras are dissapointing (I rented them off of Netflix) since the bulk is a 150-minute MTV-style documentary, about 10 minutes of which is actually interesting. Really, I'm a die-hard \\"Star Wars\\" fan but this won't ever be on my shelf. Pick up Lucas' \\"THX 1138\\" for an example of how an update should be done. Then again, Lucas should learn to listen to his fans more or just stop watching his own films. At the very least he could have put the original versions on here IN ADDITION TO the newer versions."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why George Lucas, Why!!!??????","review":"What did we do to deserve this, George Lucas? The old version of these movies were fine! That is why you have millions of dollars. Are you so bored that you feel that you have to fix things that are'nt broke? All us fans really wanted was to have clean, brand new, dvd versions of the ORIGINAL THEATRICAL RELEASES, and you have to deny us that. Wasn't Attack Of the Clones, and Phantom Menace enough punishment? We don't need new scenes with all this computer graphic stuff in it. Save it for your new movies. I'm not even a huge fan of Star Wars, but This dvd set upsets me for all of your hardcore fans. I should go get my laserdisc player fixed because that's the only way I'll be able to see the original movies on a disc! Oh, by the way. I can't wait till Revenge of the Sith comes out!! yeah, right."},{"rating":"1","title":"I wonder what goes on in Lucas' mind.","review":"Im rating this DVD set a 1, not the Star Wars movies, which obviously, rate a 5. Lucas thought it'd be fun to go back and see how much more he could ruin in the movies that he didnt already mess up in the special edition. I bought these thinking I was going to get the original, or at the worst, the special edition. In fact, it got even WORSE than that. He edited MORE things, totally messing up the movie. The longer I watched, the more I wanted to take out the dvd and snap it in two.

I think most of them are right on the money.I think it's a sad situation when an artist who we've supported over the years gets to a point where they willing ignore the base that put them on top.If you ever read this Mr. Lucas, please remember that everything you have, the computer you're sitting at reading this, the cup in your hand, even your kids college education came out of our pockets.

Mr. Lucas has screwed up big time. The CGI looks very fake to me and I actually think the old special effects (miniature models and all that) looks much more realistic in most cases. Moreover, there are a lot of changes, and most of them are for the worse. It is interesting, though, to compare shot by shot of the improved versions on DVD vs. the originals on laser discs.

Lucas can do whatever he wants with the movies, as long as that doesn't mean pretending the original versions don't exist. That's what he is doing, however.These will be even further enhanced with additional changes made since the 1997 theatrical releases. George Lucas has ruined these movies, for both first-generation fans as well as future fans. Changing something permanently that so many people contributed to is unforgivable. The special effects were groundbreaking, but future viewers will not be able to see film history as it really was. Lucas has wiped it out in favor of computer generated effects and such.Some people feel this doesn't matter. If movies matter to you at all- if they hold any importance to you whatsoever- you will consider boycotting this release. Whether it's music, movies, books, paintings-- art, whether the fine arts or pop-art, needs to be preserved."},{"rating":"1","title":"Glad I still have the Laser Discs!","review":"I would much rather watch episodes IV-VI on Laser Disc as they are the ORIGINAL unaltered theatrical versions.

WHY IS THAT SO HARD?!?!?!?!?!?!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Everybody, RELAX!","review":"So, these aren't the original unaltered movies we loved. And Lucas says he won't be releasing those movies on Blu-Ray. But guess what? He said the same thing about the DVDs. And yet, there was a box set a few years after that with the new versions AND the originals.

Han Solo does that stupid CGI shifting when Greedo shoots at him, and I thought: Yeah, so what? Tons of other changes pepper the movie. But now, after owning the movies for awhile, I really DO care about the changes. They annoy me, they make my eyes roll, and now....well, now they even make me NOT want to watch the movies anymore.

Give us, the fans, a break. Release these on DVD and stop wasting our time.

George Lucas didn't have the money or technology for flashy special effects, so he relied on a solid story, and (for the most part) good acting. That is why his movies are as popular as they are. It is not because of special effects, and there is just no need to put in new scenes. Even if they weren't that good, it would be understandable if Lucas wanted to put in scenes he had to leave out in '77. But these are new and unneeded additions. My personal opinion is \\"if it ain't broke, don't fix it.\\"I wouldn't even care about this release either, if Lucas was offering the originals as well. But since he decided to pursue this holy quest for the \\"perfect\\" Star Wars, I have decided not to buy this dvd set, and to let my friends and family know not to buy it."},{"rating":"1","title":"My VHS tapes are showing age.","review":"Seriously George, buddy, you did something great and created a world that we all love and cherish.

I will not buy the relevant trilogy on blu-ray until the real originals are available. Lucas' remakes are an abomination. I also think Ep's 1-3 should be re-made by someone who knows something about story telling. I think the common denominator here is that Lucas didn't have full creative control in the making of the originals. The more control he's given, the more he destroys these once great movies. Until the originals are released in high def, I'll keep my Laser Disc editions. There was another person who, like Lucas, tried to change history.

In the 2004 release, lucas was able to finish the movies HE made to help bring the entire saga full circle. Now according to previous reviewers nothing beats those good old CBS/VHS tapes, but if you want to experiance the saga the way it was meant to be seen pick up this set.

The SE versions were still fun and I was glad they did them. Now I can enjoy both versions. Everything that is great about film making comes from these movies.

I love the Star Wars saga but for now I'll be content with my laserdiscs, which hold up very well to DVD. Why not offer both versions on the same disc? In my opinion Lucas has ruined the Star Wars world with his prequel movies; Jar Jar Binks? storyline? bad acting? digital worlds? ... and now with this DVD set.

In about two years from now he'll release the originals with improved sound and picture in its own boxed set. I love the original trilogy, but I will not be purchasing this at all along with the prequel collection, which is its own travesty.

I love these movies - and when I saw the DVD versions, it only added to the enjoyment I got from them. I love the modifications Lucas made to the films - though they are only minor changes of course. I don't see why everyone is making such as fuss over them, its not like they totally shifted the flow of the movie - who really cares about the voice dub overs, the added footage, and the appearence by Hayden? Its not like it ruined the movies - I feel that everyone is just blowing this way too far out of preportion - Modified or not, Star Wars is Star Wars - it kicks major ass!

While some changes to movies are arguably minor, what's to stop a director from making significant changes to a film that won an Academy Award for best picture? A version of the film that was not even evaluated now carries their seal of approval. I'm not saying that any changes should be forbidden but the original versions should always be available.

I want the original movies, not these hacks. Most of the new scenes are simply awful; much of the digital imagery doesn't fit the original feel and is poorly crafted - the new scenes look as if they were thrown together at the last minute without any faithfulness to the originals. The Jabba scene in ANH is probably among the most blatant hack jobs, and the jabba's palace scene in ROtJ is a close runner-up. There's also many instances of cut and/or changed dialogue.

I was immediately nervous that he would use the same 4-disc formula. Unfortunately, he has.How could they possibly not fill up at least two discs with bonus material? This is the Star Wars Trilogy, after all! Answer: money. That has been the sole thing guiding Lucas since he began releasing these prequels that don't even deserve the label of \\"Star Wars.\\" Undoubtedly, years from now Lucas will \\"re-release\\" the DVDs with extra bonus features or something along those lines.

Lucas, on the other hand, has decided to release this sub-par boxed set that only gives customers the special edition of each Star Wars film and not nearly as many extras.

It's not even about which versions are better: it's about being given the choice to see whichever version you prefer. If Ridley Scott can provide five versions of one film in a single box set (Blade Runner) and countless other films get two releases (theatrical and director's cut) in one box, then I'm quite sure LucasFilm could and should have provided both versions of the trilogy here.I'm not sure what good it'll do at this point, but there's still a petition over at originaltrilogy.com that might be worth signing if you care about this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Once more - No originals, no sale","review":"I'm not sure what's wrong with George Lucas' brain.

I for one have always preferred the original theatrical cuts of the three movies. The new effects fit very poorly with the original shots--a problem that is endemic throughout the 'new' trilogy--and essentially add nothing. However, some people like the new version, and I respect that. Therefore, Lucas should have cranked out *two* DVD sets. One with the original cut, one with the expanded cuts. Easy as pie--people do it with fullscreen/widescreen movies all the time. Might even have made *more* money. But, no. Now, if I want to see the originals, I have to fall back on my VHS tapes. Not a bad alternative, but lacking.

In some ways it's because of Star Wars that grew to be able to trust my instincts and feelings. Sadly, George Lucas has become such a manipulative control freak over the years and the worst part is that he seems to believe every thing he says with little or no accountability.

There are at least five or six addtions/changes made from the original versions that make this trilogy embarrissing to watch. The one change I really do not understand is the end of ROTJ. Why did Lucas remove the fun and triumphant Ewok victory song for the lame and cold feeling classical peice. To me the end of the series is ruined by that change. When I have children that are old enough to watch these movies I am going to have to dig out the old VHS versions for them to watch. This trilogy IS NOT the Star Wars movies you know and love.

My point is...don't give me this traditionalist perspective, it just doesn't hold water. My kids love these movies and so do I! It's going to be even more of a tradition in 20 years.

Where would these films be without the people who paid cash to go see them 20 times back in the 70's and 80's?Keep your S.E. version, George. I'm not buying.

As for the ending of Return of the Jedi changing Anakin Skywalker back to a young man in a way made sense. Everyone knows Anakin became Darth Vader was he was young and when he got older his body never really fully healed so appearing as an old ghost doesn't look right because his body was burnt up while he was a young man not when he was older. Anakin returning as a young man was more moving and dramatic and the chorus singing in the background sounded so angelic and powerful showing that good had conquered evil.

All I wanted was to see the original ending because it's virtually impossible to find these days. Though I will treasure my new dvds, they could have been so much more than they were.

The Star Wars Trilogy has been released in more different editions than any other movie series, and this release is being made only to capitalize on the excitement for Episode II (the 10 minutes of bonus material previously unreleased).

With all the DVD sets available it was confusing as to which was the actual theatrical release before Lucas began 'fixing' them with enhanced sound and all, so I went with this VHS set. Also MUCH cheaper than all the dvd sets since I only wanted these three. The set is of the final retail offering of the original theatrical version of the 'first' three Star Wars.

As with previous releases, little care or work at all has gone into the new BR releases.

No I don't. I read a review once that I'm starting to believe more and more these days. It said that Star Wars was great in spite of Lucas, not because of him. The reason the movies don't get better as your go IV, V, VI, I, II, III instead they get worse, is because after the initial sucess of the first movie or two, the studios have gave George so much 'artistic license' that he was free to make crappier and wierder movies every time. Hence the ewoks, probably least favorite thing out of the original three. Hence that blabber thing in Episode I. Anyway, not going to be buying this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"George Lucas is an ignorant man.","review":"The stupidest argument I hear from pro-special edition people is that George Lucas couldn't stand the originals and wanted to make them how he wanted them, that's just rediculous, many artists hate what is generally considered their best work, Anthony Burgess never understood why people liked 'A Clockwork Orange' so much, he made it just to pay the bills, Tchaikovsky despised 'The Nutcracker Suite', and John Lennon generally disliked everything the Beatles did. I originally didn't mind the special editions, I didn't like them, but I figured I didn't have to watch them, I still had the old ones, but now George Lucas is trying to rewrite history and make it seem like the originals never existed.

I have the VHS tapes that were released before the three newest films, and as much as I can't stand the poor quality, I will not give another dime to these movies. Just because the newest films have new actors, why do we have to ignore the work of the actors that gave us the originals?Don't buy these movies. It's simply a way to get your money.

The sneak peak at Episode II was cool as it gives a glimpse into the future of the prequel trilogy. However, what the heck is the big deal with not releasing the DVD of the original trilogy? Why just a vhs version? Really this is just a marketing ploy to get suckers like me to buy the trilogy who missed out the first time this was available. That's the only real reason why I don't give this 5 stars.

They flow better, the acting and the storytelling was excellent. Plus, my favorite music in the entire saga, except for perhaps Duel of the Fates, is the \\"yub yub\\" song thing at the end of ROTJ. Do yourself a favor and go on E-bay and get the origional version. The special features were not worth the money, considering that if I just want to watch the movie, I still prefer to see the origional versions and deal w/ the VHS.

If George Lucas wants to turn the original star wars trilogy into musicals for children I have no problem with that. He created the movies, he has every right to do so. But for him to say, I'm ruining the star wars movies, and I'm going to force everyone to watch these abominations, is outrageous. This basically means he made it so everyone who doesn't enjoy watching pure crap, won't every buy his movies again. It's sad but, whatever, I'm sure there will be plenty of science fiction movies out there that aren't directed towards 5 year olds.

I had originally started with two but after realizing how amazing convenient these would be near the pool, I purchased additional units. I have six exterior doors so the chances of exiting one door to enter elsewhere is good. The first three that I purchased were all keyed alike, I am not going to have the next two re-keyed as these are secondary doors that I most likely would never need to enter using a key. The first units have been on my doors for 9 months with absolutely no issues. Schlage also makes a auto locking keypad deadbolt that I plan on purchasing for my pool entry gate.The convenience of taking the dog for a walk, or going to the mailbox while not having to worry about carrying a key has been great. I find that I lock all my doors all the time since I never need to think ahead about locating keys.

After a couple of days, I received a response stating I would receive a full credit, minus shipping of course, upon return of the product. I immediately went down to UPS, packed it up, and shipped it off.

Maybe the nicest thing about the book is that, given a subject matter (young love on the rocks) that lends itself to sentimentality, and a location (small town New England) that lends itself to preciousness, Wickersham firmly rejects both tiresome flaws. I agree with the reviewer who said that the story upon which this book was based was strong enough on its own; but the birthing scene that ends the story has got to be the gutsiest, gnarliest, most unflinching portrayal of labor ever put down on paper. I hope we'll see more of Wickersham's work, if only so that this novel gets another chance to see the light of day."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Classic","review":"A good all around cream to use on especially dry spots.

I use it primarily for the hands and being that I live in midwest where winters are harsh, I am open to all products that can nourish the skin and keep them look young.Product is very rich and one only needs a small dab on both hands. Cream is very thick and it may feel sticky to some. For that reason, I prefer to use it in the evening and let it soak on my skin overnight. In the morning, skin is soft and smooth. Do not expect this product to have aromatherapy properties. It does smell like a petroleum which may not be appealing to some. But its healing properties and fair price are well worthed. Convenient packaging makes it easy to carry in a purse or pack for a trip.

I've been using Aquaphor for years, and it can be used for absolutely anything (dry/cracked skin, burns, dry lips, heal skin blemishes), it has no scent and is a fraction of the cost!

This book does not touch this issue at all. Another issue not touched is the structure of ATL and the OLE parts of MFC (which is hard to explain without explaining COM first).

Needless to say, it amply rewards that effort.Modulated with irony and unfailing humor, circumspect and whole in its vision. Like all works of its kind, it is more valuable for the questions raised than answers found. Like most works of this stature, it is exasperating in parts, perhaps because it goes to the limit.

Over all it could've been a manufacturer mess up.. but whether or not you want to take that chance is entirely on you. Frankly I think this prob wont be the last time.

They meet various races of friendly aliens, go fishing with them, drink beer and establish galactic federation. No, really. And Oltion is serious about this.

The silly character of Bouncing Boy is also deflated as a nice added touch. The stories still rely too heavily on the surprise gimmick which gives an interesting cover, such as the concept of the girl Legionnaires attempting the kill the boys, but result in a rather silly conclusion. Also, the writers still did very little characterization so there is little difference between the various members. That would come with later authors.

I paid about $65.00 for them. They were used on two pekingese/pomeranian mix dogs approx 4-5x/year. The clippers did a fair job up until the last year. I contribute their breakdown to my lack of maintenance (ran out of clipper oil) and I finally tried to take them apart to thoroughly clean them and couldn't get them back together again. The instructions were too vague on how to properly maintain the clippers. I am now going to bite the bullet and upgrade to a nicer set. You get what you pay for. If your dog only needs a couple trims per year or if you're a newbie that needs the blade guards I suppose $25.00 is not a bad deal."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty good for a beginner","review":"I bought these clippers a couple years ago because I hated shelling out $40+ to groom my wire hair terrier. They did a great job at grooming her until she knocked it off the counter. The blade has been a bit misaligned ever since. Because of the misalignment it only works really well with the attachment combs on, if I try to only use the blade it pulls hair out instead of cutting. Overall I love it, it has gotten a bit hot but I know that is because I do a full cut on my dog each time. Her thick double coat doesn't make it easy, but the clippers always make it through and do a great job. If you are cutting hair longer than an inch I recommend scissoring off any extra so the clippers have an easier time getting the correct length."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I bought these clippers to do a maintenance trim on my Lhasa Apso. He was groomed last about 1-1/2 months ago and his fur is about 1/2 inch long, clean hair, no tangles, and no mats. Sad to say these clippers became bogged down in his hair immediately and would not go through at all. They were absolutely useless. If I could give a lower rating, I would.

These movies were orginally presented in a \\"wider\\" aspect ratio (2.35:1) than HDTV (1.78:1) so black bars are still required! The only way to eliminate them would be to \\"pan and scan\\" the original film down to the 1.78:1 aspect ratio.Are you all surprised there is no commentary by Spielberg? Has he ever done one?

Therefore they will not be releasing any films made by them. Even though I am a HUGE fan of the DVD world, I must agree that they have a case.

What I wanted to add was that I was most disappointed with Lucasfilm not including:Great Movie Stunts and the Making of \\"Raiders of the Lost Ark\\"andGreat Adventurers and their Quests The Making of the Last Crusadedocumentaries. I have had these two on VHS forever which I quickly dubbed to DVD because they were not included in the original Trilogy release.

Extras when we go this level, need to exceptional, especially in a released trilogy, I have seen no such comments. I just see wind bags complaining about inferior films. Were the Sinbad films great in their time, most definitely. If you are going to review something, keep your mind in what genre you are viewing. Don't rate as a modern day viewer. Yes, I agree we should talk about extras, but don't complain about plots, or facts, heck, we were beyond our time, when did Science Fiction, Fantasy, Adventure become cream of the crop.

I started watching the movie on my 8' screen and couldn't stand it; my wife immediately noticed as well. We moved to our smaller TV but noticed the same. Poor contrast, blocky image, and a bad aspect ratio. I don't think this DVD is anamorphic, as we had to watch the picture in \\"zoom\\" mode just to get the aspect ratio correct.

The fourth disk is worthless. There is nothing covered by the documentaries that you haven't seen before on AMC and they could have easily placed each one on each disc, saving you space.

I'm hopeful that this Blu-ray set will come in the fall (November) when Indy IV is released. It just seems like they are \\"double dipping\\" to milk the franchise while the movie is out in theaters.

Harrison Ford (my favorite actor) plays Indiana to a T, creating a charector for both young and old and he embodies every boy's dream of the action adventure. These movies are great! Indiana Jones and the Raider's Of The Lost Arc is the first installment of the trilogy (possibly the first of four, there is talk about the three super powers, Steven Spielebrg, George Lucas and Harrison Ford working on a new Indiana Jones movie in the near future)The first one is probably the best, though No.3, Indiana Jones And The Last Crusade does challenge.

It has some of the best \\"Indy\\" scenes of the 3.... the Elephants, the Rope Bridge, the Card game with Short Round....Enjoy all of them as the Popcorn movies they were intended to be! Enjoy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Its not the years. Its the milage.","review":"Perhaps the greatest action adventure hero ever, Indiana Jones comes to DVD and all I have to say is its about time. The trilogy (hopefully soon to be 4) takes you on a ride through the late 1930's like none other. Indiana is a professor of Archeology in his spare time. What he is most of the time is a hard nosed, snake fearing, treasure hunter. In the movies he goes after the Ark of the Covenant, Sacrad Hindu Stones, and the Holy Grail. Raiders is the standard that all action movies have to try to achieve yet inevitably fall short. Temple is a good movie that has good parts and a funny kid but isn't quite the same. Last Crusade introduces Sean Connery as Indi's dad and they work great together making it the funniest of the 3 movies.Indiana Jones is finally on DVD. Thank you. Oh yeah and thank you for not adding any scenes and stuff like in ET and Star Wars."},{"rating":"2","title":"ADVENTURES OF INDIANA JONES-THE COMPLETE DVD MOVIE COLLECTION","review":"Enjoyed all 3 DVD's-Harrison Ford is one of my favorite actors.

When I bought I knew what I was getting for my money, all three episodes remastered with better picture and sound with a whole disk of bonus features and interviews and guess what? THATS WHAT I GOT!!!!! I thought the sound and picture was awsome and I even have the originals on video to compare them to. The bonus features are sweet and I love the interviews. Any REAL Indiana Jones fan should have this it is classic Indiana only BETTER. My favorite is The Last Crusade with the fight with the tank and Sean Connery as Indys father but the other two are awsome as well. The bottom line is, if your love Indiana Jones then buy this you won't be sorry."},{"rating":"2","title":"see it","review":"if ur a fan of the series than this is a no brainer. it has a lot of extra stuff in there for die hard fans. this is a strong series of movies that has stood the test of time. own this dvd"},{"rating":"2","title":"Finally.","review":"Raiders is one of my all time favorite films. The sequels, while very entertaining, never were able to measure up to original. From the very first frame, where the Paramount logo melts into the mountain in the jungle, to the end, where the camera pans out of the storeroom, it was the perfect ride. And gee, melted Nazis - works for me. Maybe I won't be in a nursing home when they release Star Wars on DVD afterall."},{"rating":"2","title":"Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom","review":"Too bad George Lucas doesn't think the DVD crowd deserve this great movie.

I read the bonus content for this collection and it sucked!! These movies were actualy already released in the U.K (i don't live there, I've just been there) and I watched this collection and the quality is cruddy! Never buy this in stead of the other set!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Indiana Jones is the real deal.","review":"First of all I read some of the reviews on Amazon about color, contrast, and sound for this box set and here are my comments:1. I found an issue with the sound on disc 2 and 3 and returned the set and got a second. Got the second and had the same problem. The third on was fine. I call the manufacturer and they said there was a limited run with ths problem and they have fixed it.2. The color on my dvd's were fine.Now lets talk Indiana:Harrison Ford is my hero. His acting and performance in Star Wars and Indiana Jones is what makes the movie. His charisma and extrodinary acting make these films inspirational, addictive, and classic; and that is why you will watch these adventurous movies time and time again.Great adventures, strong plots, and a fabulous cast.Its a must for your collection.Stephen John Becciaauthor of The Treelanders"},{"rating":"2","title":"First class, all the way.","review":"I recently picked up this boxed set, and couldn't be happier. I loved these movies as a kid, and still enjoy them immensely as an adult. The digital remastering is gorgeous -- the colors are vivid and the picture crisp. The 4th disc of bonus material is also well done. I won't even comment on the films themselves -- quality material that stands the test of time. Classic, action-packed Spielberg. They don't make 'em like this anymore."},{"rating":"2","title":"Raiders of the Lost Ark trilogy","review":"The movies are of course, wonderful---the 2nd movie was a bit dark for me, BUT--they included an excellent dvd on how the movies were made and came about in the first place. Now, when I watch that 2nd movie, those gruesome scenes, I can appreciate what is really going on, the genius involved in every scene. It is worth it, just to see how and where they made these, and the stories behind the stories.

It will be a must for anyone with an smart action movie mentality."},{"rating":"1","title":"No commentary on the best adventure movie of all time?!","review":"Of course the Indy movies are terrific, that's common knowledge. The thing is, issuance of the film on DVD requires higher standards in this day and age. All great movies on DVD today deserve at least four features: 1. anamorphic wide-screen (if applicable), 2. restored video and audio, 3. sub-titles, and 4. COMMENTARY. Paramount, you deserve the Bronx cheer for cheating the world of a commentary on one of the best movies of all time. Pthhhhhhhhhh!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good, yet shameless","review":"Like many others, I have waited for the release of Raiders of the Lost Ark on DVD. It's one of my favorite movies of all time. However, Universal, copying what they did with Back to the Future has made this available only if you buy ALL THREE MOVIES!!! I'm sorry, but this is wrong. I know several others who feel the same way. I never liked the two sequels to either movie, but in order to get them, I have to buy the whole set!! Why the hell can't they sell these individually? I already know the answer. Because the majority of people would buy the first movie only. I know there are a lot of people who disagree and will buy the trilogy, and I wish you a lot of enjoyment. But for those of us who only want one movie, we should have that option as well. I give the box set four stars, only because the first Raiders was so good. To hell with the sequels."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wait for the Blu-Ray version...","review":"I wouldn't bother with this set...

Really enjoyed seeing these movies again."},{"rating":"2","title":"loses 1 star for 'temple of doom'","review":"So finally we can look forward to Indiana Jones IV and they'll scrub complete from this version.It's all here, the first marvelous moments where everyone seems like a bad guy (pistols, whips, poison, etc.)The final ride into the sunset of friends.Spielberg's direction pushes this nostalgic cliffhanger formula into a higher plane of enjoyment.Ford plays a man of action who is really an easy-going scholar until you get him riled up. Then, BAM!The secondary characters are generally even more effective and charming than the leading man.Lucas and Spielberg tried to dodge the 'curse of the sequel' with the \\"Temple of Doom\\" and it almost works, except I don't feel engaged by the plot. The leading lady is a huge thorn in the side throughout, none of the characters quite develop as you want them to.The story misses much of the \\"gee whiz\\" factor.But 'Last Crusade' more than restores the zoom and boom of the genre.Nearly an instant classic, catch the widescreen version."},{"rating":"2","title":"If you don't already have it...buy it!!!","review":"Wow! It's about time this is finally on DVD! 'The Temple of Doom' still stands as my favorite Indiana Jones movie - but the other two are now getting equal play now that they are finally on DVD.

Plus, people need to remember what all the old serials were like, which is what the Jones series brings back to life.

George please re realease this box set onto dvd please."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best Action Trilogy Ever!!!","review":"The Indiana Jones films are the alpha-omega of action films. Steven Spielberg and George Lucas have certainly made a stunning milestone in film history. Harrison Ford is a brilliant and thrilling Indy, and the 3 heroines in the movies are beautifully acted also. Sean Connery is a funny and likeable father, and Julian Glover (Walter Donovan), and Paul Freeman (Belloq) are the best villians ever! The best film of the 3 is The Last Crusade, which is better plotted, then followed by Raiders, and then Temple of Doom, which is easily the darkest of the 3. If your ready for some thrilling action and high-flying stunts, sit back and enjoy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good product","review":"Used DVDs in excellent condition. The product arrived in time.

I Loved, Loved, LOVED the now-classic first film...only tolerated the second...and thoroughly enjoyed the third. However...the only one I MUST have on DVD is the first one.But...I cannot (at present) BUY What I Want, because in their arrogance, George Lucas and Paramount assume I Must Have ALL of their product in this case, leaving me No Choice Except to Buy Three or Buy NONE. Ridiculous -- and with luck, the market will convince them of this. If not (shrugs) I buy none and I guess I live without it and keep running my VHS tape until it breaks.I understand the Godfather Trilogy DVD Box set didn't do as well as was orignally hoped, forcing the studio to release the first film separately...I'm keeping my fingers crossed for another such event."},{"rating":"1","title":"Consumer Alert! Deleted Scenes!","review":"I loved this movie when it came out in theaters. I loved this movie when it was shown on television, both network and cable. However, some scenes were deleted from the DVD. For example, when Indy is in the well of souls, a bunch of rats flee an oncoming wave of gasoline/oil and the ensuing fire. That entire scene is missing from the DVD. As consumers, we should boycott such modifications of great works of art. Do not rent or buy the DVD! Stick to the video."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lucas has destroyed his legacy","review":"I grew up with Star Wars and Indy. Both beloved series held dear to my heart. I grew up and George Lucas became a very rich man because of kids like me who spent their allowance on star wars toys and at the movie theater to watch Indiana Jones. But as Lucas got more money Lucas became more greedy and the wonderful magic that he penned turned into garbage.Lets just call it for what it is folks. The Star Wars prequels and the add ons to the original series are garbage. Nothing more than a money grab just like this new box set that Lucas has churned out.I am no longer a fan of Lucas. I have no faith what so ever in anything with his name attached to it. All I can think about when I hear his name is money.Great legacy Lucas."},{"rating":"1","title":"Is Anyone Concerned About the Quality?","review":"Paramount is not exactly known for the quality of their DVDs. The best example is The Godfather triology. Paramout slapped this movie (series) on a disc and sold it. The quality is miserable.

Yes, it did have retrospectives and such, but they felt like they were forced, or that they had more to tell but ran out of time.

Definitely keep youngsters away from #2 Doom; older kids will be fine with the 1st and 3rd installments. Sadly the sharp-witted female figure of the \\"Lost Ark\\" was replaced by a simpering twit in \\"Doom\\".The pace and flash from the \\"Raiders\\" are regained in the not-so-final installment of the trilogy. In it, Sean Connery proved that his class and panache remained intact even though his \\"Bond\\" roles ended! He steals the spotlight from Indy in the \\"Last Crusade\\". Harrison Ford wisely permits the theft - and orchestrates a genuine cliff-hanger in the process. (Even my knowledge of Petra, site of the final scenes, did not spoil my thorough enjoyment of the movie.)

This one is about a man falsely accused of murder who hires a private eye to find the real killer. It takes place in England in the late 19th century. Tracy rarely embellishes- he doesn't bother describing the scenery or people's clothes or telling you unneccessary things about a character's past. Everything he writes pertains directly to the story. He writes in a very detailed manner, meaning that he puts in lots of seemingly insignificant things that may be of great importance later in the book. I like how he'll start a new chapter right in the middle of a conversation, which I'm sure he does to draw your attention to the imnportance of what the character just said."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor quality","review":"Very disappointed with the ring.

I have had equipment where the remote turned the volume knob with a motor. I like this type of analog volume control. I'm assuming the volume works with the car and home kits.I think the box sounds really good. The inclusion of the radio and CD player is a plus for those very rare occasions. CD plays MP3 too.

The speaker sound is below average, any 30 dollar boombox sounds better and can be turned up louder. I now have to buy aux speakers so that the music sounds half way decent.

It might be useful for some travelers, but with only 12,500 entries, it is too limited for any other purposes. It certainly wouldn't be satisfactory for students trying to read Swedish books, for example, because too many words just aren't there. Pronunciation guidance is provided in both languages. Special features included in the dictionary are food and drink lists in both Swedish and English, irregular verbs and abbreviations, numbers, and how to tell time, in both languages.

Other folks from bigger states are probably used to this, but it is a nice change for me.Jack Wallace, the hero, is a likable guy, most of the people he meets could be my neighbors, and the story unfolds at a nice contemplative pace. Anyone who has spent a little time here would find the idea of an ex-KGB boss located here a little bizarre, but it works out okay for the story.Like I said, I'm probably a little biased, and perhaps a more objective reviewer would only give the book three stars, but I wouldn't be troubled recommending it to a friend."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I expected at all...","review":"I got two copies of this CD, one for myself and another for a anime-loving friend.

However, in my initial excitement when seeing this on amazon.com, I must have overlooked the fact that these were remixes. Kikuko Inoue has a nice voice and all, but the remixes don't do justice to the songs as they were originally, generally speaking. I'm a huge fan of Neon Genesis Evangelion's \\"Thesis of a Cruel Angel,\\" and I couldn't even listen to the entire track on this CD. For those of you who like new twists to your favorite anime songs, by all means, don't let my opinion be the deciding factor as to whether or not you get this CD.

Mordden is a wonderfully talented writer whose prose takes a bit getting used to at the start, as if you're reading Austin, Forster or Dickens. He also creates fiercely intelligent, witty, and culturally educated characters, so every chapter seems to be spouting off either a literary or operatic reference, or a musical playing on Broadway at the time. All this lends itself to a perfect time piece about being gay, growing older, and living life. Or as one character defends his argument to write it all down: \\"If we write about what we did, and how we felt, who we were... we will leave something behind.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Further tales of Manhattan","review":"Mordden develops the characters of the \\"Buddies\\" series even further in this book, which is a more connected, novel-like volume than the previous volume. The familiar faces are joined by a new one, Cosgrove, and while sometimes the actions surrounding this somewhat unbelievable character seem unbelievable in themselves, they lend the entire story a sense of humor and depth that has its roots in the relationship webs of the first two books. A definite must-read of gay fiction fans; of course, anyone who read the first two volumes could not abstain from reading this one to continue the story of the characters the reader has come to know and feel close to in the course of the previous two books."},{"rating":"2","title":"My Horseman has a first name, J I L L.","review":"This piece is astounding in the way that it compells a reader to delve into race relations in Africa between the Ugun-gun and the British.

Especially between African people and europeans. I think the author's account of how the europeans tried to rob the Africans of what little pride, religion and culture they still had left spoke of the horrible genocide that existed then and continues now. It's also most disheartening to know that African people can't even have their freedom in death."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good intro to the work of this winner of Nobel Prize for Literature","review":"This is a definate must read. Written as a poetic play, Soyinka captures the Yoruba experience during the British occupation of Nigeria. It captures their perception of their colonizers, their religious ideologies in sharp contrast with that of the British, their political stance including about Yoruba persons who worked for the British at the time(hence, the mimic men/women) and their trauma and lamentations regarding the slave trade. The title refers to a specific issue that main protagonists will struggle with, leading to the Yoruba/British clash of religious and political ideologies. The result unveils the hypocracy of forced-conversion and explores issues of (in)humanity, suicide and freedom by examining each group's relationship with their leaders, their understanding of the divine God(s) and destiny.

But I think that in some areas that were to confusing, it seemed like the whole objective of Mr. Safire is to misdirect the reader and not sticking with the plot.

Safire starts with a wonderful concept -- finding a deeply burried spy (a compelling concept.) He did get my attention.Regretably after reading the first 150 pages, and even with a compelling concept, I was unable to complete the book. The main characters were predictable and lacking of any depth, and the dialogue cache if not contrived. Perhaps,if the predicatability of the dialogue and characters could have been overlooked, Safire may have told an wonderfully interesting story. Unfortunately, I wasnt able to come to this conclusion since I couldn't take it any more after the first 150 pages."},{"rating":"1","title":"No More","review":"The book should have been called sleep inducing.

The main charcters are Captain Lawson, his wife and journalist Edwin Morrison, and you'll learn to appreciate each one of them for their strong roles in the story. Much of the novel revolves around the fighting in various arenas and takes you inside the interaction of the black troops with each other and with their white officers. The Filipinos showed themselves to be worthy opponents. As always, the writing by Kluge is of the highest order. I suggest that you pick up his other novels, and also an account of America in Micronesia, for additional superb reading.

It does make SOMETHING.....a LITTLE like cotton candy, but only makes enough for a tiny taste. I used the fine household suger as it suggests and low and behold you could still crunch the sugar crystals.It is an awful product full of dissappointment for me and all the kids.

The biggest of many problems is the lid doesn't stay put which means the connections don't line up, which means, it keeps turning off. The second problem is most of the (minimal amount of) cotton candy comes out hard & stiff. Third, it started to smoke; fourth, it is almost impossible to clean!!

The packaging indicates you use 'ordinary' household sugar. The instructions INSIDE the packaging emphasize that you must use FINE sugar which is 4x (not powdered and table sugar). After searching for 2 weeks trying to find FINE sugar, I finally found some. Eager to try the unit out, I discovered that the electrical cord had pulled out of the plug that attaches to the base unit. We're lucky we didn't start a fire. I soldered the loose wire back onto the plug and made ready for another attempt. In great anticipation, the cotten candy maker did make cotten candy ... about 4-5 strands. What a disappointment. Fortunately, I decided to try this when my daughter was not present in order to avoid creating another 'Are you ready? Here goes! ... I'm sorry honey' scene. This toy is an absolute piece of junk."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointment","review":"I could not be more disappointed with this product.

Furthermore, the tribes were separated after Solomon\`s death and his son attempted to place pressure on the tribes. Three tribes went back to holy land, Jerusalem, and nine went with Ephriam and later they were sold into slavery.

Here's a sample from the first essay, on Augustine's first chapter, by Charles T. Mathewes:\\"Rather than seeking to comprehend our lives better, Augustine hopes his readers will more appropriately fail to comprehend them; and insofar as one fails to fail to comprehend in the right way, one is blocked from understanding the deep character of what the Confessions is all about. . . . What do I mean by this?\\"Beats the hell out of me.Leaving aside the trouble of the dangling participial clause the sentence opens with, I would find this writing laughable, were it not so needlessly dense and inexcusably condescending to the reader.

The chapters in these parts introduce the reader to such concepts as power politics, international law, trade, the environment, and the North-South Gap, to name a few.It is a difficult task to sum up the entire field of IR, and Goldstein does not do this.

The plot, such as it is, doesn't even get going till the last 80 pages. If this had been my first Tiller novel I wouldn't bother continuing with the series. Another problem is that Tiller isn't that likable in this novel. It's OK to have a rogue hero, but the rogue has to have some redeeming qualities or be likable in some way. In this episode Tiller is an unattractive jerk even though he does the \\"right thing\\" in the end. But by then who cares. I'll continue with the series but I hope they get better!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excelent source of inspiration for all seasons!","review":"Dr. Keiser once again shows us why she is known as one of the foremost organists and church musicians of our time. The fabulous organ and chourus from Fairmount Presbyterian are also very impressive, as are the Cleveland Lyric Brass. Two favorites on this album for me include the awesome \\"Baptism Dance\\" from Dan Locklair's Windows of Comfort, and Flor Peeters' awe inspiring Entrada Festiva. The sheer power of organ, brass and percussion sent chills up my spine. This album showcases well the talent and skill of Dr. Keiser, the well known professor of music at the exceptionally prestigious Indiana University School of Music.

Well you are looking at it. I bought this cookbook off of Amazon 3 year ago, and really thoght that I could use a new twist of cooking, and I did, and used my Retro Ranch cookbook. It got everything you need to know what kind of foods that the cowboys cooked when they used to camp out on the ranch. Like 2 kind of chili recipes and all kind of bake bean recipes. Here are three items that I cooked from this cookbook for a meal. I made Quick-Fix chicken which is very good, Scratch Biscuits and Amy Tanner's apple crunch. Yummy.

While the graphics are better than average, they could be better. The biggest setback this game has is its one player championship mode. This is not your typical lap-style racing game. This game actually has a mission to complete while you race. For the most part, the first time you reach a new mission, it is difficult to complete forcing you to use a continue (you're given 5), and this eventually leads to starting completey over at the first level. Besides that, this game is awesome!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I was disappointed with this game. All the reviews made it sound great, but its not.

The first season introduced us to the characters and their backgrounds as well as the reasons for contractors and why, the second season storyline while not as in depth was alright as well but don't be surprised if they come out with another season after this one as we again are left with a somewhat ambiguous conclusion for some characters. the animation and soundtrack are pretty much like the first and fit decently together and the voice cast did a very good job in their character roles both for the subbed and dubbed.

With \\"Bones\\" handling the animation work(Wolf\`s Rain, Soul Eater, Eureka Seven, Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood) you know the animation is going to be top notch.This season comes chronologically after the frist, but, there are events that took place during the two seasons that you aren't going to find out till you watch the 4 OVA's that come w/ this season(even then there are still lot's of answered questions, but at least you don't have to wait as long as those of us who followed the fan subs of the series.) A lot of people complain about this season not answering questions from the first, but it is a geat setup for the 3rd season.Lot's of character development, wonderfully animated fight scenes, and I would have to say that it is a very emotional season.

A slightly different tone than the first season but still good. Though I do have a few recommendations, first of all watch the OVA before watching the second season. It'll clear up a lot, also you'll need the internet for to understand the season finale. It was really confusing for me, but made sense once I looked it up online. It's a good series, and the second season doesn't disappoint. The OVA is really damn good as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good 2nd season for a great show!","review":"Darker than Black season 2 is the second season in the Darker than Black television series. Originally coming out on Japanese T.V., Funimation (English Dubbing Company) took this show and brought it to American shores. The Funimation dubbing of this show is awesome, however falls a little flat in the second season, the main character Suo doesn't nearly live up to the Japanese voice over.

I was dissapointed after the first time that I played through the game by myself. The questions repeated themselves after three games. Playing in the four player mode is more enjoyable but still leaves much to be desired. Just as a side note... If they can have a game as detailed as \\"The Legend of Zelda Ocerina of Time\\" could they have not added at least 50 more questions to this game? Final rating... Cute as related to South Park but Totally lame as a Video Game."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst game ever","review":"This game really was one of the worst games I ever played. It is slow, and not fun.

One of my friends had rented it and invited me over to play it, let me just say, it was sorry. The questions for one, were few and confusing. They never give you the right answear, and by the third time playing it, I was seeing questions repeated. The mini-games were wanna-be Mario Party games, and had absolutely no entertainment value. Out of all the games, I enjoyed one. The only reason this game deserves higher then one star is the characters themselves. Stan, Kyle, and the rest of the gang are still hilarious, which at least made the game somewhat funny. I might rent this game if I was having a party or something, but please, do not make the mistake of purchasing it without trying it first. I guarantee you will be dissapointed. Oh, and one more thing, that \\"Wheel or Fortuity\\" is annoying."},{"rating":"1","title":"Major flaws hamper an otherwise enjoyable game","review":"Like all \\"game show\\" games, this one suffers from the same flaws: (1) it's too easy to lock out your opponents by \\"buzzing in\\" early, and (2) not nearly enough questions.

The mini-games are OK, but if they wanted an excuse to use South Park mini-games, they should have come up with a Mario-Party style RPG/Board Game to work them in, not the game show format."},{"rating":"2","title":"really bedroom","review":"One of my favorite games of the past just can't seem to get enough of it these days also my boyfriend loves it two"},{"rating":"2","title":"Service is ok. but billing is not clear","review":"Got this connection a month back. and there is no problem. we get lots of free mts.

Esther Williams plays the beautiful rich playgirl who brings a massive lawsuit down on the head of newspaperman Keenan Wynn, who had printed an unflattering article about her lavish, irresponsible lifestyle. In order to win the case, Wynn hires suave Johnson (a former employee with the same newspaper) to win over Williams so she will drop the charges. Naturally, everything goes haywire... While this film can't hold a candle to original 1936 film LIBELED LADY, of which this is a re-make, it gave Lucille Ball one of her best comedy showcases in the movies in her role as Gladys Benton. The colour photography is quite good and the songs are amusing if a bit corny."},{"rating":"2","title":"really good!","review":"I recommend this film.

When I found out that she had written another one, I couldn't wait to buy it, even though the reveiws I read hadn't been the greatest. Unfortunately, this book is nothing like her Book of Shadows. The Love Spell is a (boring) diary memoir of Phyllis trying to find \\"true love.\\" Almost all of us have been though the up and downs of dating, etc. Reading about man problems, even with Wicca thoughout, it not any better. On top of that, every sentence that she writes, Phyllis has to make a comparison with her feelings, moods, etc. That makes for extremely tedious reading. I kept losing tract of where I was and where Phyllis thought she was. Was it real, or was it a daydream. Let go and let love."},{"rating":"2","title":"Warts and all!!!","review":"In telling her story of her search for love, Phyllis Courott doesn't just highlight her success, she illuminates her mistakes.

The humor is good, although there are a lot of subtle in-jokes that sci-fi fans won't pick up on. Still, it is very funny.The most interesting thing about this film is that the writers were able to actually craft an interesting adventure plot around the satirical humor.

THERMIAN!Stoopid."},{"rating":"1","title":"What Plot?","review":"This was probably the most boring movies I've ever seen. I could NOT believe all the positive reviews. The entire movie lacks a plot. I almost fell asleep halfway through. I recognized some of the actors from other films/shows (Tony Shalhoub from Monk, Alan Rickman from Harry Potter). Glad I saw this at a friend's house and didn't pay anything for it."},{"rating":"1","title":"BLAND AND UNINSPIRED!","review":"Don't believe the hype! This film would barely cut it as a made-for-tv movie. The story is obvious and boring. The characters are unimaginative and dull. Tim Allen is a little too self-satisfied with his phoned-in performance. Making fun of Trekies is like shooting fish in a barrel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Jettison This Movie","review":"Yuck! I can still taste this movie.Hollywood is still at it: putting all the budget into special effects, and nothing into a decent script. I could've written a better script while taking using the restroom.Now, why did I watch this thing? Well, Sigourney was looking pretttty cheeeeeky in those commercials. And the special effects looked impressive. As for Tim Allen, I never much cared for him; matter of fact, he's not even talented enough for public-access TV.So, looking at Sigourney and the special effects, I sat down eagerly for this movie. Then boredom went through me like a catheter. And later pity. First self-pity, then pity for the poor actor who played the villain in Die Hard; and here he is playing third string in this noxious bit of cow-fodder.The only other merit this movie has is as a cure for insomnia.Boredom, they name is Galaxy Quest."},{"rating":"1","title":"Putting Tim Allen In A Movie Is A Lot Like Multiplying Zeros","review":"A good plot, a plausible storyline, and a good solid cast of characters are just a few of the many things that make a good movie. This movie had none of those. There is only one thing I hate more than this movie--that guy who scoops ice cream at Thrifty who told me I had to wait my turn to be served. Tim Allen is about as entertaining as a bucket of chum, so unless you are a whale I would not watch this lame movie. I did not have toast this morning."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stink-o-rama!","review":"This movie stunk! I was soo hoping it would be good, but it wasn't. I'm sorry. I actually had to stop the madness and shut it off with about 30 minutes to go.The plot was decent, and I really thought with the good cast it would be hysterical, but it was not to be. I found I only mildly chuckled, and before I knew it, I was more than a hour into the movie.The guy from \\"Just Shoot Me\\" plays a really annoying alien that makes you grind your teeth.If you want laughs, I'd look elsewhere!"},{"rating":"2","title":"It's surprisingly funny!","review":"I'm not a great Star Trek fan. If, however, you've ever watched a Star Trek episodes or an Alien movie, Galaxie Quest will make you laugh. This movie takes a light-hearted approach to itself while maintaining the semblance of a plot. Watch this one with the family. It's good-hearted fun."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cult Classic","review":"Galaxy Quest is an instant cult classic. Every scene and line is memorable and can be used as personal jokes. The \\"thermians\\" approach Commander Taggart and declare \\"You are our last hope\\" or the Galaxy Quest motto \\"Never give in never surrender\\" are messages for us all. The casting is great, the pace quick, its good, clean fun. Its Star Trek the way we would remake it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Laughs","review":"I was expecting this movie to be rather bad. Just when I was beginning to think renting this film was a horrible mistake, Tim Allen's character encounters real aliens. The real fun and real hilarity begin here. The jokes had my boyfriend and I giggling for days. The special affects are good and there's plenty of action.The only down side to this film are the appearances of the pig monster and the alien enemy. The pig monster looks exactly like what it is--a man in costume. The enemy looked like a variant of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles. In contrast, the baby aliens (obviously computer generated) were fabulous. Both their look and their movements were superb. Fortunately, the appearance of the pig monster is brief and it doesn't take much from the overall feel of the film. I was able to thoroughly enjoy the movie and would love to see it again. If you like comedies and you like Star Trek, you're sure to like this film."},{"rating":"2","title":"By Grabthar's Hammer......","review":"I love this movie! As a trekker, I thought it was a halarious ode to Star Trek. I especially love the whole idea of the character of Guy Fleegman as the designated \\"Red Shirt\\", destined to die before the first commercial. This movie is so witty and entertaining, a true delight!"},{"rating":"2","title":"What a tripped up dork retard of a movie - but sure is good!","review":"I saw this just the other week at my college, in the video lounge. When it began to play, the woman in front of me said aloud \\"this is horrible\\" but followed with a laugh. I think I understood her. It's just a kinda stupid-like comedy that's actually a good movie. I think it's more to amuse than be a great storyline though. My favorite line, Guy - \\"Oooh, that's not right!\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Smart, affectionate parody of Star Trek","review":"I have always enjoyed Star Trek in all its incarnations, and that doesn't stop me from enjoying Galaxy Quests witty digs and inside jokes that parody both the show and the people who were in the show. This is a movie that you can watch several times and still catch action at the edge of the screen that's worth a second laugh or a third. Very much enjoy this movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Galaxy Quest","review":"Fun to watch. It has become a classic with our family. This is 3rd copy that we have purchased.

Craftily directed \\"show within a show.\\" Wonderful"},{"rating":"2","title":"Never stop watching, never stop laughing","review":"I just watched GALAXY QUEST for the first time, and must admit that I was pleasantly surprised. A very funny script, pretty good special effects, and perfect casting (led by the great Sigourney Weaver, who somehow manages to transform herself into a hilarously 'bad' actress) are highlighted here. Special mention goes out to Thermian leader Enrico Colantoni for his wonderful performance.This movie lampoons with the best of them - in fact, I found myself often laughing out loud, to a bemused reaction from my family. Good stuff..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Some humor","review":"This movie was a fair attempt to poke fun at Star Trek. It had some laughs, but mostly left me grasping for a reason to keep watching it. I realize this is a spoof but, there was an attempt at character development which left me almost wondering which character was which. I was just looking for humor and I guess I got a little."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good fun","review":"4 stars because its good fun the whole family can watch. Maybe a little silly at times but a pretty good effort overall. Nice work by Tim Allen and cast. Good rental movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great movie!","review":"Wow! A FUNNY comedy you can take your kids to! Tim Allen, Sigourney Weaver, and Alan Rickman star in this \\"Star Trek\\" spoof. The cast plays the cast of the now defunct, but cult-status TV series \\"Galaxy Quest\\" and every one but Allen is totally sick of the whole deal, the conventions the grand openings, the fans, the whole nine yards. But then real aliens, thinking the show shows actual history, gets the cast to help in a real deep space war. Allen is hilarious, Rickman does his usual excellent job, (he is perfect as the \\"I'm too good for this crap\\" Spock-like character)and Weaver goes against her usual type playing a sex-pot blonde, doing the exceptional acting job she always does while reminding us, (at least the male viewers :-) ) that Weaver is VERY defintly female. There is no smut, nothing a parent would find objectionable, (the movie is rated PG) and I would highly recommend this one to anyone....."},{"rating":"1","title":"Alot of running around that didn't make sense","review":"I was disappointed in this film because I have been a fan of Star Trek for many years. There were a few moments that were humorous, but I kept waiting for the film to go somewhere. Maybe my sense of humor is delegated to films such as \\"Hot Shots\\", \\"Naked Gun\\", \\"Airplane\\", etc. If it relied more on Star Trek where you could identify the characters or situations, it might have been funnier. It just seemed that there were alot of scenes where the actors were running around with nowhere to go."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why did I like this movie in the theater?","review":"I saw this movie in the theater and loved it, but when I rented the DVD to show my uninterested family I found it uninteresting myself. I wonder what happened. One time I see it, I love it, the second time I'm board and want to go play video games. Odd, must be a one timer."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good film","review":"I really enjoyed this film. Glad I bought the DVD. Good extras & was glad to get the film letterbox."},{"rating":"2","title":"Entertaining and funny, but little beneath the surface.","review":"With a movie like Galaxy Quest, you're probably expecting a light-hearted spoof of low budget TV science-fiction series, with maybe a few Hollywood quips thrown in, but probably not much else. Galaxy Quest delivers. The performances are all good, if mostly undistinguished, and the script is mostly funny, if never hilarious. The DVD has some nice extras, but they strike the same note as the rest of the movie: Good, but not great. If you're a fan of Star Trek, Battlestar: Galactica, or other series of that ilk, though, you definitely shouldn't miss Galaxy Quest."},{"rating":"2","title":"Much better than I expected","review":"I have to say, I originally watched this film to see Ms. Weaver play a regular, pretty girl...something she doesn't often do....she was very sexy, no offense, and has the brains to play a pretty blond VERY well. (Too often in today's society we forget that it takes a very talented actress to PLAY this type of blond. And she looks great in the longer wig...)I was very pleased to find that this was an all around pleasing film...watchable over and over again. I'm not a Tim Allen fan, but all the actors were good in their respective roles. I would recommend this flim to any one, any date, and any family...."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun!","review":"Galaxy Quest is an obvious parody of Star Trek although non-Star Trek fans will enjoy it too. I'm not a huge Tim Allen dan but he's great as the over-the-top actor turned starship captain who finds his one great success story is a little more real than he imagined. Inventive story line, solid acting, and lots of humor keep the movie fun and moving. Certainly not too deep, but just as certainly not a brain-dead comedy either."},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT!!","review":"More fun than a barrel of monkeys. I do not know how much fun that can be but this film is way to much fun!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Lots of fun","review":"I went into this movie unwillingly, determined not to enjoy it. Within the first twenty minutes I was laughing out loud. This movie doesn't take a low IQ to enjoy as was stated in the other reviews. (Besides the fact that anyone judging other peoples' IQs had better learn how to spell the word ridiculous correctly.) On the contrary, it takes a desire to have a good time and enjoy yourself. I found Galaxy Quest to be a highly entertaining movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hilarious!","review":"I love on-going slap-stick that goes on through this movie. Being a Trekkie, I think it was a funny portrayal of the Original Series, and Tim Allen captured his character greatly, who was extremely simialar to William Shatner/James T. Kirk (in my opinion, that was the best part in the whole movie). I also enjoyed the performances of Enrico Colantoni, Sigourney Weaver, Alan Rickman, and Tony Shalhoub."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loving send up of Trek","review":"This movie is hilarious.

This movie is an example of how a comedy can be really great. The cast is in top notch performance, the special effects are fantastic but not overwhelms the movie, God, everything is fantastic here.

Congratulations !!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A VERY FUNNY, CLEAN MOVIE","review":"This is one of the funniest movies I've seen in a long time and the best part is, it doesn't rely on sex jokes, the f-word, violence or crude language to be funny.

At first the adults, from grandfathter on down, could not keep their hands off of it. Then the kids started playing and just loved it.

First, there are 1189 chapters in the Bible, and each one has its own track. I really wasn't thinking about this when I transferred it to my mp3 player. This dwarfs the music I have on my device and visually takes up a lot of space when viewing my audio library in Windows Media Player. This combined with the fact that the books are listed alphabetically when copied to a device makes it almost unusable. So you see your books/chapters listed like this: Philemon 01, Philippians 01, Proverbs 01, Psalm 001, Revelation 01, Romans 01,... pretty much useless. There aren't even any instructions that talk about how to fix the book/chapter order once copied.

We have owned one for over nine months and rely on it for time and temperature every day. While the phase of the moon is not very important to us, the outdoor temperature, calendar, and atomic-accurate time is great. If you live in a cold weather climate, you will probably need to buy lithium AA batteries for the outside sensor. Our sensor kept failing initially, and like other reviews, we thought maybe we would have to replace the sensor. It was actually the batteries that were failing. Alkaline AA batteries could not handle the extreme Iowa cold. We installed two lithium AA batteries (about $3 each), and the clock (and sensor) have worked like a charm since."},{"rating":"1","title":"A piece of garbage!","review":"The outdoor sensor failed after 2 weeks.

They charged me $7.40 for shipping me the clock and I had to pay $8.20 for UPS Ground for sending the clock back. The total shipping was $15.60 which is 43% of the price of the clock ($36).

The first one I bought worked great for over a year until the transponder got lost in a storm. The second one never worked at all. I give LaCrosse credit -- they replaced it immediately. But that third didn't work either. Spent lots of time with Tech Support -- who were very helpful and responsible but couldn't get it to work. Then, I matched the transponder from the second with the third clock and it worked! For about 3 days. Then it wouldn't work either. No combination, no matter how many times I reset and no matter how close I put the clock and the transponder would work. Finally just gave up on it.

After reading some of the other reviews, I'm quite glad that the first time I heard EBTG was from this CD. I thought it was an awesome compilation of music with a flair I had never before heard, and immediately became addicted.

The fact is that their first few albums were their best work-1. Eden (1984) 2. Everything But The Girl (1984) 3. Love Not Money (1985). If you want to know WHAT they sounded like before they sold out, these 3 albums are a good place to start. If you want to hear HOW they sounded at their peak- get these 2 albums: 1. Idlewild (1988) 2. Acoustic (1992). I truly understand one must move with the times and not lag behind in the world of music, hence their recent other Best Of called Adapt or Die, but they abandoned a lot of fans when they sold out to the techno/electronica audience. I miss their early days and wish they would record just one more last album of the old stuff for their old fans- a sort of gift to those of us who were there in the beginning."},{"rating":"2","title":"The definition of \\"Old-Fashioned\\"...","review":"I have all of these adorable little 'Cook Books from Amish Kitchens', and have really enjoyed them.

In this story Carly sees a crime and knows too much. She is relocated with a new identity. When Ryan shows great interest in her, she is very wary. Though she is greatly attracted to him, she doesn't know whether or not to trust her heart.

She's trying to forget her fears, trying to build a new career and identity, and perhaps, trying to learn to trust and to love once more.

The \\"suspense\\" element is incredibly easy to guess (maybe Delinsky didn't want to make it a surprise?) and the hero and heroine behave in very unrealistic ways.

Easy to set up, and I love being able to see both the outdoor and indoor temps. Looks great too!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"This unit is impossible to read at an angle. The LCD screen is old-school; you have to look at it almost dead-on to read it. It also has a hard time tuning in the atomic clock to reset itself each night. I was unable to mount the unit on the wall where I wanted it because it can't find the atomic clock signal each night. I had to mount it on a wall 90 degrees to the left of the wall I wanted to mount it on. All in all a real disappointment."},{"rating":"2","title":"Graet Digital clock!!","review":"This digital clock it's so amazing work very good & you need just a 4 double AA batteries, 2 for the clock and 2 for the outside forecast sensor... make the set up and set the sensor outside the room in an open area... include the indoor forecast too...

Won't be buying any more la crosse products.1-27-13: Another minus for this product. Sending unit won't work when temps below 30 degrees unless it's within 6'-8' of receiver. Even with new batteries in both units the functional distance between units is very limited in moderately cold weather. As stated before....no more la crosse products for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Functional and looks good","review":"The clock is automatic and I had no trouble connecting to Colorado. The temperature sensor seems too be a couple of degrees high, but that may just be where I placed it.

Still, it does the job and looks good for a reasonable price."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Travel Clock for RV","review":"We bought this clock/weather station for use in our RV. It works great, keeps accurate time and the weather function is fun for our 10 year old to \\"predict\\" the weather with and is at leasts as accurate as looking out the window! A bit fussy to set up the first time and if you live out of rage of a tower, like we do, some of the automatic functions will not work untill you take a little trip to get in range of a tower, but after that it works just fine. Appears to be a quality built unit with good fit and finish, looks great with the rest of the wood trim in our RV."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worked well for ONE YEAR.","review":"This product was awesome but only worked for a year. After the warranty period passed, I might as well have started hitting it with a hammer. First, the LCD display gets foggy. Then the outdoor temperature monitor just dies--completely. I tried to take it apart and see what's up but no water damage, no extreme temps, nothing... Just died. Finally, the LCD freezes on the time 6:31pm (think Final Destination) and that's the end. Clock is done.A solid $35 for one year. Then you'll buy another one. I've read several similar stories. Maybe try another brand?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Works great, but weather is \\"fuzzy\\"","review":"The clock works great, the inside and outside temperatures have been great and (I assume) accurate. It did take 2-3 hours after installing batteries before it set itself to the right time.The weather display on the middle is very fuzzy at guess what the weather is. It does not communicate or receive the forecast from any external source, it simply decides whether the weather is \\"improving\\", \\"staying the same\\", or \\"getting worse\\", and displays the corresponding sunny, cloudy, raining icon. I'm in Arizona, and it's funny how often it has the clouds or even raining clouds when there is rarely a cloud in the sky. I supposed I should have researched or guessed that it probably isn't an accurate weather forecast pulled from some radio or online source."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money","review":"The La Crosse atomic clock looks great. Smaller than the one I had for years before but still could read the time from more than 10 ft away. The problem, like other reviewers complain, is the outside sensor. I stuck mine in my window frame behind the screen thinking that it would be fairly protected from the rain and snow. Nope. It stopped working after the first rainfall. Ok, so I had a nice wall clock. No again, the new Duracell batteries lasted only 4 months, and I am not going to waste any more."},{"rating":"2","title":"does the job","review":"Works fine, but the weather forcast is often off. It has said sunny when its snowing etc... the temp is sometimes off outside as well, but that could be because the sensor is against the building?

The remote outside unit could be a bit smaller and more waterproof, but I solved that problem by putting it inside a class mason jar."},{"rating":"2","title":"I'm always right","review":"I had one of these clocks that had lost its outside temperature sensor and missed knowing the outside temperature. The batteries went bad and leaked in the sensor. I bought this as a replacement and it works fine. It is good to know you can replace the outside sensor if it goes bad. Place it somewhere it will not get wet and you should not have any problems. The power goes off in Florida frequently during storms, and it is great to have a clock that keeps time by battery so I have a reference for setting the other clocks on everything that go to 12:00 when the power fails. I like the weather feature and it has proved quite accurate. This is a great conversation piece, and once you get one you will not want to be without one."},{"rating":"2","title":"petronut","review":"We are very pleased with this Clock the weather is accurate the thing is so easy to set up a 2 year old could do it.

In both instances, the outdoor sensor did not work properly. In addition, this sensor requires the sensor not be exposed to elements. What's up with that?

Unfortunately, it does not operate nicely! it's a little bit difficult to program which would have been fine if it had been reliable enough that i only had to do that once in a while. I had this clock what could be measured in weeks not months and i had to replace the batteries already once. Then it appeared the batteries were out again, only to find it actually stopped running altogether. Additionally, it took a few days for the atomic feature to kick in and update with the time change....the atomic feature was one of my primary reasons for getting this clock so that's a bit of bummer!

The clock is very attractive and works well. I have received compliments on how attractive it actually is. The only down side with it and other La Crosse Weather Forecasters I have, is that the outdoor temperature unit has a very short range. The literature says it can be placed up to 250 feet from the clock. Only going through one outside wall I find the effective range is no greater than about 15 feet from the clock. I tried to locate the remote unit about 20 feet away and it did not work. That being said, in all other respects the product is great. I have some smaller La Crosse units that are more than 5 years old and they still work fine."},{"rating":"1","title":"1010","review":"I have always wondered why reviews state the order came fast.

A week later still waiting after a week prior, after calling twice! I was advised they would mail me a label, that of course was after the email label could not be opened on my computer.

Success! It worked. However, 20 discs later, I have had about 7 that have turned out badly; basically static that makes the music unlistenable. I tried it on different players with the same result (and I'm burning @ 2x). I tried a different brand (smart and friendly) and had no problems. In regards to the customer service, I was just told (also) to try one from the middle of the spool and/or try different cd burner software.

One issue that I have found is the sanding disk likes to slide down sometimes onto the chrome part.

It took forever to do just 2 nails and I was afraid I was going to burn the motor out so I ended up having to have the vet clip his nails like always and then use the grinder to maintain them smooth and short.

As for the 4 interchangeable soft silicone tips, they are silicone, but are not soft. Also you really can't tell the difference between two of them.

It also claims to be waterproof, but I don't see how. I bought this to replace a cheap 7 incher that I just use for external stimulation after my old one had developed a loud and obnoxious sound. The nubs on the caps are hard and not comfortable, and it's not adjustable, but it shouldn't be stuck on super speed either. It vibrates faster than ANY of the adjustable ones. No instructions, and the metal contact is hard to disengage to get it apart to put a battery in. It appears, for all intents and purposes, to be as waterproof as a tube of lipstick, and the tips don't even snap on, they slide down the top, which leaves metal in the \\"bubble\\" and I'm not sure what would happen if the tips slipped off during bathtime play.All in all, unless you're a movie star who wants EVERYONE and their NEIGHBOR knowing what you're doing, I wouldn't recommend this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheaply made","review":"I didn't see anything special about it.

It is very powerful - I wasn't even excited and I had an orgasm within 60 seconds. Unfortunately it is very loud. It's not something that I can use when anyone else is here.

I ordered mine from amazon, and for one, it didn't come with the bag. That isn't really a big deal, but it was supposed to.Also, if you're an experienced vibrator user, this is definitely not the one to go for. If you're just starting out, its probably fine for a first user.It is small, and relatively quiet in comparison to others, however, the little tops it comes with are hard. More hard than usual, and aren't that pleasurable. It doesn't create much movement, and it has lower vibration speed than most. It also only has one speed. Its a better vibrator to use during intercourse, but not so great for solo play.Battery power is limited and runs out quickly. It is not nearly as waterproof as the packaging entails, and really doesn't work well for me in general. For a cheap vibrator though its alright, especially if you haven't used one before."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Product","review":"Great product its a lot more silent than my vibrator.

Over time I slowly lost the screws and became too lazy to replace them and sometimes even to put them back. The hinge kit is just what I've been waiting for. It converts the panel cover into a hinged door with a lock and saves me from ever having to play around with the screws. The biggest downside is that, since my panel cover was manufactured before the hinge kit became available, that there is no punch-out for the lock. It took me a good 20 min to drill a hole through the cover large enough for the lock. Another minor quibble is that the small plaster spacers that are supposed to go on the cabinet on the lock side don't really seem to work. In fact they push the lock far enough away that it won't lock anymore. The solution was simple - I just didn't use them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Recipe changed for the worse; not as advertised","review":"I used to love these crackers. They were a staple item.

My pleasure at finding them on Amazon (which I didn't even know sold groceries) and at a great price with auto-shipping lasted only as long as it took for the first shipment to arrive.

The attention to detail the architects employed in these buildings is amazing and the fact that so many are still extant is a tribute to the artistry and talent that went into designing and building them and obviously contempory wealthy apartment seekers appreciate these attributes or else we all know these buildings would have been pulled down long ago, just like so many of the Gilded Age mansions they replaced.

Yeah, it's great to have the movie in widescreen, but at the very least would it have hurt them to include the trailer?I also think, if the recorded material of Janet Waldo as Judy does indeed exist, an \\"alternate audio cut\\" should've been made available as a bonus feature.

I was hoping for something that actually went into my Super Nintendo's RF out port like it showed on the box on here but no I got a multi out port WHAT THE HELL I GOT THIS BECAUSE MY MULTI-OUT PORT IS SHOT"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not item in picture","review":"The item I received in the mail today was different from the item that I expected I would get from the description and from the picture.The description says that this cable is compatible with \\"Sega Genesis model 1 only serial # 1601, 1602 1603 or 1604\\" The cable in the picture of the item would have been compatible with my sega model 1601 however the cable I received had a flat plug on the console side, not the round plug in the picture. The flat plug I believe is the one compatible to the SNES and maybe later models of sega.I hope this was a mistake, or that they change the image and description for this product to reflect what item they are actually selling. I'm very disappointed. :("},{"rating":"1","title":"Crap","review":"I purchased this for an old sega genesis and it was broken on arrival.

The central relationship is set between the written and the spoken word, and poses hypothetical scenarios of the way in which writing has affected human language. While describing his views on why the Chinese pictogram, a seemingly 3000 year-old cumbersome system, is in fact very useful, the author also ranges over the Ancient Egyptian hieroglyphs, the Near Eastern cuniforms and Semitic, Classical and Indo-European writing systems. The book offers many black and white drawings and illustrations.This is a highly recommended book for all, but especially those with interest in linguistics and the history, evolution and importance of writing."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"Writing Systems of the World\\"","review":"\\"Writing Systems of the World\\" by FLORIAN COULMASThis book elaborates the Writing Systems of the world's languages, including the ancient script of Egypt, Cuneiform, Chinese, Semitic, and the writing of ancient India.It further examines the alphabets of the ancient languages, including the divine nature attributed to the written word and its power.
